As soon as that man [Donnarumma] became available, drive to Paris, go and get him, give him whatever he wants.\"\n\nHowever, Lammens has well and truly made Scholes eat his words. The Belgian custodian has emerged as one of the most impressive goalkeepers in the Premier League this season.\n\nLammens has let in just 26 goals across 21 top-flight fixtures in 2025/26 and delivered arguably his finest display yet during the 1-0 triumph at Everton on Monday. He pulled off four saves, four punches, two high claims and remained authoritative throughout as he earned the Premier League Player of the Match for his contribution.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Senne Lammens won the Player of the Match during Manchester United's win at Everton\n\nSpeaking after the Everton clash, Lammens drew comparisons to former United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, who was covering the match for Sky Sports. \"[I] just try to stay calm, play my own game,\" Lammens said.\n\n\"I know I have the qualities, I wouldn't be here otherwise. So, [I] just believe in myself, the players around me and my teammates support me really much.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Now I just keep on building, keep getting that confidence. Like today, getting those wins, feeling important, is really important. And yeah, like you said, if I'm in a comparison with Edwin van der Sar, it's always nice to hear.\"\n\nThroughout Lammens' 21 Premier League outings, United have suffered defeat on only two occasions. One came in the 1-0 reverse against Everton in November, whilst the other was a 2-1 setback at Aston Villa.\n\nAdditionally, Lammens' stops have prevented 5.5 more goals than the average goalkeeper based on the quality of accurate shots he has denied, according to OPTA's expected goals on target (xGOT) conceded model. No Premier League keeper can rival that record since the Belgian's United debut on October 4.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHis impact has been astronomical, with some claiming that Lammens is - and could be - United's best and most influential signing in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Lammens has made the No.1 spot his own and it's clear that he is far above Onana, who is on loan at Trabzonspor, and Bayindir in the pecking order.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Sterling, 31, looked rusty after coming on as a second-half substitute in Feyenoord's 2-1 win against Telstar last Sunday.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt was understandable given that the former Manchester City star's previous competitive appearance was in May 2025, his final game on loan at Arsenal. Sterling had been exiled at Chelsea, who finally agreed to terminate his contract after six months training away from the first-team squad.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHis performance was panned by Dutch media and Van Persie has described some criticism as 'inappropriate'. \"If you have a little sense of context, where he comes from, what he's achieved in the past, and that he hasn't had any team training for months,\" the Feyenoord manager began.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I understand that there are expectations of an absolute top player, but to criticise him like that after half an hour - his first half hour after over six months - then you really don't understand anything at all.\"\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

But to throw out such strong opinions based on his first half hour, I thought, was inappropriate.\"\n\nSterling's ex-England and City team-mate, Jack Grealish, also jumped to the winger's defence after criticism of his debut online.

But it would be a huge call to leave out one of Liverpool's greatest ever players for a youngster that's knocking on the door.\"\n\nNevertheless, Slot shows no indication of making such a decision, having supported Salah ahead of the West Ham fixture. He said: \"We are used to Mo scoring a lot of goals, and at this moment in time, that is maybe the biggest difference in his performance and game time.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n\"But we also know this has happened before.

He added: \"If it goes down to the last day of the season, I would be delighted.\n\n\"I know how hard it is to win the league, but the run in does favour Arsenal slightly.

Hincapie, 24, joined the Gunners on a season-long loan from German side Bayer Leverkusen in September.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nArsenal negotiated a £45million option to buy and after a slow start to life at the Emirates, Hincapie has become a staple of Arteta's defence. The Ecuador international has started all but one of Arsenal's last 16 Premier League games, displaying his versatility by playing at left-back.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHincapie is set to be named in their starting XI once again on Sunday, as the Gunners host Chelsea. Ahead of the clash, it was put to Arteta that his loanee had gone up a level.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I fully agree,\" the Arsenal manager replied. \"Again, having more time with the team.

You can see that, the way they interact and react with him. So I'm very pleased that he's showing that up.\"\n\nOn whether the Gunners will trigger their £45m clause, Arteta said: \"We will see. Let's go through the season. We have already discussed the possible outcomes that we have after that period. But so far, we are very, very happy with it.\"\n\nBACK THE MIRROR!

            "content": "Tim Henman feels Emma Raducanu is better off without a coach despite the British No 1 reuniting with Mark Petchey on an informal basis ahead of Indian Wells - live on Sky Sports Tennis.\n\nRaducanu parted company with Francisco Roig in the wake of her second-round defeat at the Australian Open.\n\nShe enjoyed a strong run of form while working with Andy Murray's former coach Petchey early in 2025 in a temporary arrangement, but hired Roig in August as she sought a new permanent fixture.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights of the Transylvania Open final as Raducanu struggled in defeat against Sorana Cirstea\n\nFollowing a six-month spell in which she has endured disappointing results, Roig, who formerly coached Rafael Nadal, became the ninth coach to depart since Raducanu's 2021 US Open win, with the pair gelling well on a personal level but not aligning on style of play.\n\nHer next tournament in Romania saw her reach her first final since her victory in New York in 2021, and since the split from Roig, Raducanu insisted she is happy working only with hitting partner Alexis Canter, a 27-year-old British former player who reached a career-high ranking of 779 last year.\n\nThe 23-year-old, coming off a first-round defeat to Antonia Ruzic at the Dubai Tennis Championships, is set to retain Canter as part of her setup as well as working with Petchey in the lead-up to Indian Wells next week.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Marion Bartoli believes Raducanu will learn more from playing the top players after she exited the US Open\n\nSky Sports analyst Henman thinks British No 1 Raducanu doesn't need a coach and should concentrate on working on her physicality to match the likes of fellow Grand Slam champions Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Elena Rybakina and Coco Gauff.\n\n\"I just wonder whether she's better off without a coach and that's nothing against Petch,\" said the four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist. \"He's someone I've known for a long time and he's a very, very good coach but we know it's not going to be a full-time appointment because Petch has his broadcast commitments.\n\n\"Emma has talked about her identity, her game style and she wants to own it. She's been around long enough on the tour so I wonder whether that might be a good option for her but it's her prerogative.\n\n\"I worked with three coaches in 15 years. I like the consistency and continuity and we know that coaches don't last long working with Emma.\n\n\"An aggressive game style is how you have to play. You have got to be aggressive because if you don't your opponent will be and for me. I want to see her build her physicality: to get stronger, more resilient, to hit the ball harder.\n\n\"And I think if she does that, that'll mean that she has less interruptions and less little setbacks physically. She'll be able to compete at a high level for longer periods, so if I could add one element it would be the physical side.\n\n\"Raducanu does work on her physical side. I think her tennis game is outstanding but when you think of the physicality of Sabalenka, Swiatek, Rybakina, Gauff, she's not in the same league.\n\n\"The physicality is the biggest challenge.\"\n\nPetchey helped inspire the most productive period of Raducanu's season as she reached the quarter-finals at Queen's before running Sabalenka close in the third round of Wimbledon.\n\nEmma Raducanu's NINE coaches\n\nNigel Sears\n\n\n\nBest known for coaching former top five players Amanda Coetzer, Daniela Hantuchova, Anett Kontaveit and Ana Ivanovic, Sears joined her team in April 2021 and oversaw her incredible breakthrough run to the Wimbledon fourth round.\n\n\n\nAndrew Richardson\n\n\n\nGuided Raducanu to her historic Grand Slam title at the US Open as a qualifier. Raducanu opted not to extend his trial contract immediately after the victory.\n\n\n\nTorben Beltz\n\n\n\nAngelique Kerber's former coach lasted only five months. They split in April 2022 with Raducanu transitioning towards a new training model involving LTA coaching support.\n\n\n\nDmitry Tursunov\n\n\n\nRaducanu took on the former pro on a trial basis during the summer of 2022 but Tursunov decided not to continue, later citing red flags in her camp that he felt could not be ignored for a long-term commitment.\n\n\n\nSebastian Sachs\n\n\n\nThe German joined in late 2022 but the partnership was cut short when Raducanu required multiple surgeries, leading to a mutual split.\n\n\n\nNick Cavaday\n\n\n\nThe 14-month stint was her longest professional partnership, helping her return to the top 60 before he stepped down in early 2025 due to personal health issues.\n\n\n\nVlado Platenik\n\n\n\nHired on a trial basis in March 2025, the partnership lasted only 14 days.\n\n\n\nMark Petchey\n\n\n\nAndy Murray's former coach provided crucial tactical knowledge through Wimbledon where she went out to world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, despite an encouraging display.\n\n\n\nFrancisco Roig\n\n\n\nAppointed in August 2025, Rafael Nadal's former mentor offered elite tactical clarity, but after her Australian Open exit in January 2026, Raducanu announced their split.\n\n\n\nRobson: Raducanu has 'same ideas' as Petchey\n\nImage: Petchey coached Raducanu during the grass-court season\n\nFormer Junior Wimbledon champion Laura Robson sees Raducanu's happiness on court as the biggest advantage and argues working with Petchey can only bring out the best in her.\n\nShe said: \"I think we make such a big deal out of the coaching situation and as long as she is feeling happy on the court, as long as she's confident out there then that's half the job done, and that's what coaches try and bring out in you when you do have one.\n\n\"She obviously gets on really well with Petch. They've been on and off for a fair few years now and it's someone she knows. They have the same ideas. They agree on so much that she needs to bring out there, so why not?\n\n\"As long as you've got someone who's taking care of the boring stuff like the logistics of booking practice, finding someone to practice with, racket re-strings - all of that. As long as that's taken care of, then you can just focus on trying to play.\n\n\"They have the same identity of how both of them feel she should be as a player.\"\n\nRaducanu is hoping to hoping to revert to a more aggressive style in order to compete with the top players and Robson says she has shown in the past she is capable of playing against the elite on the WTA Tour.\n\n\"For sure. We've seen how close her matches against Sabalenka have been,\" said former British No 1 Robson.\n\n\"It feels like everyone is adding different elements to their game all the time, so at the moment it feels like she wants to add that aggression back into her game and once you've got that you can start thinking about adding more variety again so you've got more strings to your bow.\n\n\"But you want to have a clear identity as a player before you go out onto any match court - so long as that's defined in your mind then that's half the job done.\"\n\nOverend on Raducanu finding the right balance\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Jonathan Overend believes that if Raducanu can find the right balance with the correct coach, she will be set up for a great year of tennis\n\nSpeaking earlier this month, Sky Sports commentator Jonathan Overend said Raducanu will only be able to find the right balance in her setup once she answers a key question.\n\n\"I think she has spent a lot of her young career re-evaluating,\" he said. \"In one regard, it explains why she has been through so many coaches and why she has been criticised for it.\n\n\"It's typical of Raducanu that she wants to keep re-evaluating and finding out what is best for her on and around a tennis court.\n\n\"That challenge continues, and to some extent it is a struggle, because finding the right balance is so hard, but I think she is slowly getting [it], not in terms of her Grand Slam results but in terms of that re-evaluation process.\n\n\"What is it she really wants for herself on a tennis court and in tournaments?\"\n\nWatch the ATP and WTA Tours, live on Sky Sports or stream with NOW and the Sky Sports app, giving Sky Sports customers access to over 50 per cent more live sport this year at no extra cost.

That is expected to change if the franchise invest a high NFL Draft pick in a quarterback.\n\nWhile Brady was not present in Indianapolis, 22-year-old Mendoza said they had spoken on the phone briefly, and was asked what he would think of working with the NFL legend.\n\nImage: Tom Brady is a minority owner for the Las Vegas Raiders and would be expected to help develop a young quarterback\n\nHe said: \"Yeah, I mean, who hasn't admired Tom Brady? I mean, more Super Bowl rings than anybody ... anybody!\n\n\"So, that opportunity would be fantastic.\n\n\"Brady, I believe, is the greatest quarterback of all time - by a wide margin - and to be able to have the opportunity to be mentored by him would mean so much.\n\n\"Especially to learn, and I'm all about learning. So from day one, I've got to learn a lot.\n\n\"It's going to be a long journey, and to potentially have a mentor like that, it would be pretty impressive and pretty meaningful.\"\n\nImage: Mendoza was a winner in college but will likely begin his NFL career on one of the worst teams in the league\n\nMendoza revealed that he had a \"great\" meeting with the Raiders, who appointed Super Bowl-winning Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak as their head coach earlier this month as they look to rebuild after a fourth straight losing season.\n\nAlthough he admitted there's no guarantee he will end up in Las Vegas after April's event in Pittsburgh, Mendoza was enthused about his meeting with the team.\n\n\"It was a fantastic interview,\" he said.\n\n\"The coaching staff were in there. We went over some of my previous plays and drew some plays on the board.\n\n\"I thought it was a great meeting, and I know they have the prospective No 1 pick, but anything can happen in the draft. I'm just excited for the opportunity.\n\n\"Whatever team drafts me, I'm just going to give everything I have to them.\""

            "content": "At the end of the season, how costly might this untimely slip prove for Aston Villa? Judging by the way Unai Emery fumed on the touchline, this defeat by near neighbours Wolves will hurt for a while yet and, significantly, it could have major implications on their hopes of returning to the Champions League.\n\nWolves understandably savoured every moment of just their second Premier League win of the season, every outfield player joining the celebrations as João Gomes fired in his first goal in a year just after the hour, and then again joyously when Rodrigo Gomes made it 2-0 in the 98th minute. The win meant Wolves at least can say they have beaten Derby’s record Premier League low points tally of 11 from 2007-08.\n\nBut Emery’s wait to taste victory at Molineux goes on, the Spaniard winless in all five visits here as a manager. For him and for Villa, Wednesday’s date with Chelsea at Villa Park just got a little bit meatier.\n\nUntil João Gomes started and superbly finished that Wolves move, the excitement in the stands was largely contained to the half-time break, a stimulating small-sided kids’ game between these local rivals. For the record, Wolves won that one, too, the goalscorer celebrating by sitting on the turf and mimicking a meditating Erling Haaland. It triggered a wave of positivity from the hardy souls in the stands and it was almost omnipresent when the ball crashed into Emiliano Martínez’s net in front of the South Bank.\n\nIt was never going to be an evening for the purists and driving rain did little to enhance this soggy Midlands derby as a spectacle. It was a contest bogged down by misplaced passes, clunky touches and the ball slowing unpredictably on a saturated surface. Ezri Konsa can vouch for that, the Villa centre-back nudging the ball back to his goalkeeper Emi Martínez with his big toe, just as Adam Armstrong sought to prey on Douglas Luiz’s loose pass. It was a night for the poncho-clad Wolves supporters in the uncovered Graham Hughes stand in a corner of this stadium. Hugo Bueno looked battle-hardened, the reverse of the Wolves full-back’s old gold shirt caked in mud.\n\nView image in fullscreen Ollie Watkins wastes Aston Villa’s best chance in the first half, delaying his shot long enough for Yerson Mosquera to get back and block it. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThe actual football, and particularly anything resembling Premier League quality, was limited. Ollie Watkins passed up Villa’s first and best first-half opening, electing to take Morgan Rogers’s clever pass on his right foot rather than his left, Watkins’s hesitancy inadvertently offering Yerson Mosquera time to intervene. From the subsequent corner the Villa defender Pau Torres glanced a header wide, the ball bobbling out for another corner via a Wolves shirt. Douglas Luiz sent a volley on target from a Matty Cash cross but it was too close to the Wolves goalkeeper José Sá.\n\nOn the sidelines Emery grew increasingly agitated. He exploded as Jadon Sancho declined to take a shot first time after the ball dropped kindly at the back post and there was also a restlessness within the home support. Rob Edwards, the Wolves head coach, gestured for calm as the locals aired their frustration at Jackson Tchatchoua looking inside for the perceived easy pass. Wolves struggled to hold on to the ball and when they did have it they surrendered possession cheaply, João Gomes among those guilty. Sá, wearing the captain’s armband, shanked a goal-kick straight out of play to the disbelief of those in the stands.\n\nThe second half took on a similar theme and approaching the hour, Emery had seen enough and turned to his bench, introducing Leon Bailey and Ross Barkley. Emery’s patient wait for Villa to find a killer moment that eluded them could only last so long. At the other end Cash had to throw himself at an inviting Tchatchoua cross after the Wolves wing-back zipped past Lucas Digne.\n\nView image in fullscreen A sodden Unai Emery tries to spur on his Aston Villa team as they struggled against Wolves. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters\n\nTchatchoua has been derided for much of the season, a symbol of the club’s struggles, but it was another of his crosses that prompted Wolves’s unlikely opener. Armstrong, whether by luck or design, killed laid the ball off perfectly for João Gomes, who sent a first-time shot in off the underside of the crossbar. It was just the tonic the Wolves support needed and they maintained their humour. “One-nil to the Championship,” came the chant from the South Bank.\n\nWolves, certainly not lacking in spirit, defended admirably. Tchatchoua did well to halt Ian Maatsen, one of those thrown on by Emery as Villa chased the game. Toti Gomes halted Leon Bailey, another second-half substitute, advancing. Bueno blocked off all avenues for Cash and turned to celebrate with the home fans. Then, at the final whistle after Mosquera had cleared off his own line, Wolves could celebrate."

            "content": "Arsenal’s journey under Mikel Arteta has long been a reference point for Chelsea’s owners. It is part of the club’s shift towards youth and potential after the Roman Abramovich era. Chelsea have built with a long-term view and, seeing how Arteta has reversed Arsenal’s decline since his appointment as manager in December 2019, have been keen to find a young coach capable of becoming a similarly galvanising force at Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt is not an easy task. Chelsea briefly thought they had their rising star when they hired Graham Potter in September 2022, only for his reign to end after seven months. Now there is hope that Liam Rosenior can become Chelsea’s answer to Arteta. Rosenior is young, confident, talented and a little unconventional in the way he presents himself. It is early days but the 41-year-old has made an encouraging start, winning eight of his first 12 games, and has transmitted enough authority to keep jibes about his inexperience at bay so far.\n\nDoes he have it in him to match Arteta though? More pertinently, will he be given the time to succeed? Just over six years on from turning to Arteta after firing Unai Emery, Arsenal stand five points clear at the top of the Premier League before hosting Chelsea on Sunday. They have benefited from a stable environment. Rosenior, by contrast, is the fifth permanent head coach under the ownership of Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly. Chelsea have had nine managers, including interims, during the Arteta era. It is impossible to ignore the upheaval when it comes to working out why Chelsea have not mustered a title challenge since winning the league in 2017.\n\nThey remain a strong cup team, capable of raising their level in one-off games, but the consistency required to keep up with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City in the league has been lacking. Rosenior has already felt it. Chelsea have been at their careless worst in their past two league games, home draws with Burnley and Leeds the consequence of a repeated inability to stay focused and defend a lead in mature fashion.\n\nDropping 19 points from winning positions this season says a lot about the squad’s mentality. Rosenior has to tackle the listlessness. Behind closed doors he should make clear that he did not like Malo Gusto wasting a promising attack with a pointless no-look pass against Burnley. Chelsea cannot afford to be cocky. They have to be honest about where they are short. They have to acknowledge that they have a discipline problem. They have had eight red cards this season and were pegged back by Burnley – whose stoppage-time equaliser arrived when one of Rosenior’s players dozed off at a corner – after losing Wesley Fofana to a needless second yellow card.\n\nView image in fullscreen Liam Rosenior is young and confident, and has transmitted enough authority to keep jibes about his inexperience at bay so far. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThe frustration is that there are times when Chelsea look like a serious team. They have beaten the champions of England, Italy, Spain and France in the past 12 months. They face Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League and it would not be a surprise if they went through. Chelsea are different in the big games. They have a daunting run-in but are not fearful of top opposition. The problem is more that they switch off when expected to win.\n\nRosenior has to lift standards. He has the youngest squad in the Premier League and needs time to instil good habits. Whether Rosenior lasts, though, will partly come down to whether Chelsea are capable of leaving the chaos behind. Can they hold their nerve when results dip? It is one thing to find your Arteta but another to stand by him when the pressure rises and fans are baying for blood.\n\nIt is worth remembering that it has not always been plain sailing for Arteta. The Spaniard was 37 when he replaced Emery and earned his first managerial role. He arrived with Arsenal struggling to move on from how the Arsène Wenger era fizzled out. There was a lot of damage to repair. The squad were a mess and although Arteta ended his first season on a high, winning the FA Cup thanks to surprise victories over City and Chelsea, it was not long before he was in danger of losing his job.\n\nArsenal were 15th and winless in seven league games before beating Frank Lampard’s Chelsea on Boxing Day in 2020. Arteta was in trouble. He needed Arsenal’s trust. Even then it was not until the second half of the 2021-22 season that Arteta’s vision truly became clear. Arsenal have had to fight their way to the top. They have also stuck with Arteta through three consecutive second-placed finishes. They have had to be resolute in their belief that he is the man to win their first title since 2004.\n\nArteta has driven the process. He is the manager, not the head coach, the individual knitting everything together. Arsenal have a sporting director but Arteta is the face of the club. There is no doubt about his power. Arsenal have thrown everything into winning now. They have targeted experienced, established players in an attempt to get over the line. They have filled holes that needed filling. Signing Martín Zubimendi, Noni Madueke, Viktor Gyökeres and Eberechi Eze last summer gave them depth and quality in every position, while exposing a key point of difference with Chelsea’s model of centring recruitment around young talents who will need time to adapt to English football.\n\nIt remains an issue for Chelsea that, for every hit, there is a signing struggling to meet expectations. João Pedro has shone since signing from Brighton last summer but Liam Delap has been disappointing and Alejandro Garnacho is still the winger who blew hot and cold at Manchester United. There has been too much volatility. Erratic performances are not a surprise. Chelsea are still to prove that their project will work. Their bet is that hoovering up some of the best young talent in the world will give them a team to fear. They are convinced that their collaborative structure, with a head coaching working in tandem with five sporting directors, breeds stability.\n\nYet it will take more than handing Rosenior a six-and-a-half-year deal to show that Chelsea understand why Arteta has flourished at Arsenal. There will come a time when the heat rises. Chelsea’s faith in Rosenior will be tested. How will they react?"

            "content": "Being teetotal, always asking questions and taking up yoga in his early 30s after a recommendation from Gareth Barry have played their part. But if one thing inspired James Milner to break the Premier League’s appearance mark then it is a trait honed during his formative years in Yorkshire: sheer bloody-mindedness.\n\n“Some things don’t change,” Milner says with a chuckle when asked whether his desire to prove people wrong was as strong as ever after his 40th birthday last month. “There’s people who are always going to doubt you but that’s always something that’s been at my forefront: to prove them wrong.”\n\nMilner credits his father for instilling the fighting spirit that has carried him through a remarkable 24 seasons in English football’s top flight. He started as a 16-year-old with Leeds under the watchful eye of Terry Venables, and has had spells at Newcastle, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Liverpool and now Brighton.\n\n“He knew what I was like and he used to say: ‘You don’t work hard enough, you’re not going to make it,’” he says of his father. “He’d never say it in a horrible way or anything like that. But he’d be like: ‘You got no chance of scoring the goal from there.’ And then [I would] take free-kicks and two shots later it’s in the top corner. He knew how to get the best of me.”\n\nThe same desire provided motivation after it seemed Milner’s career was finished in 2024 when he was unable to walk following knee surgery. He spent nine months on the sidelines before returning at the end of last season.\n\n“I think most people – the surgeon, the physio, people who knew what I had, probably every single person – thought I was finished; at my age being a footballer and what I had,” he says. “So it was probably that same thing that meant I’m still playing now: not to finish your career in a way that wasn’t really in your control. That was the drive really. I wanted to try to prove that I could get back from that because I don’t think many people could.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner salutes the fans after the final whistle in Leeds’ victory over Chelsea in December 2002, a month after his Premier League debut as a 16-year-old. Photograph: Gareth Copley/PA\n\nIt has been particularly satisfying for Milner that, having come off the bench more than 200 times in the Premier League, he started on his 654th appearance to break his former Villa teammate Barry’s record when Brighton overcame Brentford last week. “My body doesn’t agree to sitting still, so that’s why I don’t like being on the bench so much,” he says.\n\nHe relishes his role as the elder statesman of the Brighton squad and reveals that the teenage striker Charalampos Kostoulas has been joining him for yoga sessions. “I probably started maybe eight or nine years ago now, which I think Gareth put me on to actually,” he says. “We’re passing it down, so I’ve passed it on to Babis [Kostoulas] at this moment. He’s only 18, so he’s starting young.”\n\nMilner, whose rippling muscles bulge as he holds court at Brighton’s training ground in Lancing, recognises he has been fortunate that his career coincided with the rapid growth of sports science. He uses strengthening techniques created by the celebrated German athletics coach Frans Bosch to counteract injuries that have included a fractured ankle at Newcastle and 12 hamstring problems, meticulously tracks his sleep patterns and takes magnesium to boost a natural shortfall in his body. Milner believes the decision to never drink alcohol, made during his schooldays in Horsforth, outside Leeds, is another of the secrets to his longevity.\n\n“I’ve never had a problem with people drinking at all – I think it’s healthy,” he says. “Like if that’s the right time to do it and if that’s your thing to get away from football and go have a blast, then I’ve no problems with it all. But it’s just a decision I made that if it would help me, I wouldn’t do it.\n\n“When I first started playing you had maybe one or two physios, maybe a part-time masseur, one fitness coach. Now you’ve got five or six fitness coaches, you’ve got seven or eight in the medical team. So that’s been to my advantage that I’ve managed to learn from that to ask questions early.\n\n“I always ask questions: ‘Why are we doing this?’ Or: ‘Explain it to me so I understand and then I decide if it is the right thing to do. I’m not just going to do it because you say. Give me the information why. Give me the science behind it.’ It was interesting, a few of the messages I had over the weekend were: ‘You were a nightmare to work with,’ or ‘challenging to work with’. But I take that as a compliment that I push them to be better and ask questions and challenge them. The best people always come out and give you the exact reason why you’re doing it.”\n\nThings have changed from his youth, when Milner recalls “teacups flying and walls being punched” at half-time by irate managers. “You don’t see much of that now,” he says. “I just feel fortunate. I played through two eras; one when I was emerging and now another.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner, with then teammate Jordan Henderson, holds the FA Cup after Liverpool’s win in 2022. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nMilner was presented this week with three Guinness world records: one for the appearances, another for most consecutive Premier League seasons (23) and the third for the longest gap between his first and last Premier League goals (22 years and 248 days). The next milestone on the horizon is surpassing Teddy Sheringham’s record as the Premier League’s oldest outfield player at 40 years 272 days, though Milner has never been inspired by chasing records.\n\nHe is yet to open discussions with Brighton about extending his stay beyond this season – a prospect recently welcomed by his 33-year‑old head coach, Fabian Hürzeler – but is keen to stay and he denies fearing what retirement may bring.\n\n“When we have some days off I look forward to that: go and play golf, spend time with the family. So I feel whenever I finish, I’ll probably have a break and a rest because I’ve been so 100% for so long.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner with his three Guinness World Records certificates. Photograph: Paul Hazlewood\n\nHaving worked under Venables, Sir Bobby Robson, Roberto Mancini, Jürgen Klopp and many other of the game’s finest managers, Milner is well placed to judge what makes a good one. He rates his two seasons as a central midfielder at Martin O’Neill’s Villa as his best from an individual perspective, and has especially fond memories of winning City’s and Liverpool’s first league titles for a generation. There are doubts about his prospects of making the transition to the dugout when he hangs up his boots.\n\n“It’s such a hard gig, innit? You see managers getting a new contract and getting sacked in two months. People don’t get the time they deserve now. But the competitive guy in you thinks: ‘Yeah, I wouldn’t mind giving that a go.’\n\n“I’ve got a great array of different managers from different countries and different personalities to lean back on, so in one way I think it’d be a big shame to lose all that knowledge and experience I’ve built up, to not be able to use that.”"

            "content": "Liverpool had the highest wage bill in the Premier League when winning their 20th league title last season, the club’s latest set of accounts show.\n\nLiverpool’s wage bill increased by £42m to £428m in the year ending 31 May 2025, when a Premier League title triumph in Arne Slot’s debut season as head coach and a return to the Champions League increased revenue to a record £703m. The club’s wages-to-revenue ratio stood at a healthy 61%. It was the biggest wage bill in the division, ahead of Manchester City on £408m, and included bonuses for the record-equalling title triumph.\n\nCommercial revenue increased by £15m to £323m and matchday revenue by £14m to £116m. The figures contributed to an increase of £89m in revenue for the highest-ranked Premier League club in the Deloitte Football Money League. But the rise in wages, which pushed administrative costs up by £57m to £657m, resulted in a relatively modest post-tax profit of £8m. Liverpool had a £57m loss in 2023-24 after failing to qualify for the Champions League.\n\n“We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it,” said Liverpool’s chief financial officer, Jenny Beacham. “The 2024-25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men’s team winning our 20th league title.\n\n“The club does face significant cost challenges, including rises in administrative, staffing and operational costs, alongside the need for us to compete at the highest level of the game, across our men and women’s teams.”\n\nLiverpool’s latest set of published accounts do not include last summer’s record spend of almost £450m on new players, including the British record signing of Alexander Isak for £125m from Newcastle. Slot said recently that failure to qualify for the Champions League would be unacceptable for Liverpool this season and the competition “does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run”.\n\nOn Friday Slot said it was not difficult to resist the clamour to start Rio Ngumoha because the level-headed teenager had not been carried away by the hype. The 17-year-old made a huge contribution to Liverpool’s late win at Nottingham Forest last weekend after his 77th-minute introduction, especially after switching wings to replace Mohamed Salah on the right. That has prompted calls for Ngumoha to start against West Ham on Saturday, when Florian Wirtz will again be absent through injury, but Slot will continue to develop the youngster carefully.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rio Ngumoha made a big impact for Liverpool from the bench against Nottingham Forest. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\n“It’s totally not difficult because of how he is,” Slot said of putting Ngumoha on the bench. “And that is something special for a 17-year-old who has been hyped like he is throughout his whole career.\n\n“There has been a lot of talk about him because we can all see how special he is and his talent. He is handling that situation really well, which is a big compliment to him but also to his parents, who raised him that he is down to earth, works really hard, keeps going and doesn’t lose his head because a few pundits have given positive feedback about his game. If you start believing how special you are after a few comments from pundits, that is probably not the way to become the player he wants to become.\n\n“We have to keep his special quality and that is beating players in one v one. That is not 10 out of 10 times working, and it doesn’t have to be, but he has to keep trying. There are not many players in modern football that can take on one-v-ones on a regular basis and beat their opponents a lot of times. That is a special quality and that is why we want to take such good care of him because we have a lot of belief in how special he is.”"

The tie is a repeat of last summer’s Club World Cup final in New Jersey, which Chelsea won 3-0 thanks to two goals from Cole Palmer and with a team under the management of Enzo Maresca.\n\n“I’m so excited,” said Liam Rosenior, Maresca’s successor. “PSG are fantastic. I’ve experience of playing them in France [as Strasbourg manager] and I’ve always admired them. Luis Enrique has done a fantastic job there.\n\n“These are the games you live for, games that you come into football for. It’s going to be a great tie.”\n\nIn Rosenior’s three fixtures against PSG at Strasbourg he won one, drew one and lost one.\n\nLiverpool, meanwhile, will return to Istanbul as part of a tricky rematch with Galatasaray. Arne Slot’s side lost 1-0 in Turkey in a September league-phase meeting.\n\nArsenal have been handed a somewhat kinder draw in Bayer Leverkusen as they continue to compete on four fronts “We’re really excited,” said Mikel Arteta. “Let’s try to be there until the last stage of every competition. And then we’ll see what happens.”\n\nA Tottenham team likely to be prioritising Premier League survival will meet Atlético Madrid, meaning a swift reunion for Conor Gallagher, who joined Spurs from the Spanish club in January. With all 16 teams provided with a route map to the semi-finals, Atlético’s Diego Simeone and Tottenham’s Igor Tudor also know their sides are playing for a quarter-final date against either Barcelona or Newcastle. Should Spurs keep progressing, a north London semi-final against Arsenal is a possibility.\n\nIf Arsenal overcome Leverkusen, they will meet the winner of Bodø/Glimt versus Sporting in the last eight while Liverpool could face Chelsea, which would no doubt reignite memories of their Champions League battles from previous decades.\n\nShould Manchester City make it past Madrid in what will be a fifth Champions League knockout meeting in five years, Pep Guardiola could be set for a potential reunion with Bayern Munich on the basis that they overcome Atalanta, Italy’s remain representative in the competition, in the last 16.\n\nNewcastle’s meeting with Barcelona will reprise evocative memories of Sir Bobby Robson, who managed both clubs, as well as Faustino Asprilla’s treble at St James’ Park during a 3-2 Champions League win over the Spanish giants in 1997. The two sides also met at St James’ Park in September, with Hansi Flick’s side winning the league-phase encounter 2-1 thanks to two goals from Marcus Rashford.\n\nIn the Europa League, Nottingham Forest have been drawn against Midtjylland with the Danes doubtless bolstered by memories of their 3-2 win at the City Ground in the league phase in October. With Aston Villa, who face Lille, in the same side of the draw as Forest, there is no prospect of an all-English final, although they could clash in the semis.\n\nVilla and Lille crossed swords in a Conference League quarter-final two years ago, with Villa prevailing follow a rather chaotic penalty shootout featuring some theatrics from Argentinian goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez.\n\nCrystal Palace will face AEK Larnaca of Cyprus in the last 16 of the Conference League."

Only Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal have had more injuries, and those clubs have deeper squads.\n\nScott will take charge of an overhauled medical department, with the existing head of medical, Dr Prithish Narayan, understood to be leaving to return to work for the NHS.\n\nScott left Tottenham at the start of last season as part of a major restructure of Postecoglou’s backroom team, which led to the appointment of Adam Brett from Brighton as Spurs’ director of performance services. It was widely reported at the time that Scott had clashed with Postecoglou over the players’ workload and management of their recovery, with Tottenham declining to comment.\n\nTottenham’s squad has been devastated by injuries for the last two seasons under Postecoglou and Thomas Frank, with the club experiencing 41 injuries last season leading to 1,553 days out, the second-highest total in the Premier League after Brighton.\n\nForest have been drawn to face Midtjylland in the Europa League last 16.

In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on direct rivals. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season. Will Unwin\n\nBournemouth v Sunderland, Saturday 12.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Back in business: Granit Xhaka looks set to give Sunderland a timely boost. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea, where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in matchday chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) as they sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL interpreters will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here. Andy Hunter\n\nLiverpool v West Ham, Saturday 3pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Liverpool fans sing You’ll Never Walk Alone before kick-off at Anfield. Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images\n\n5 Centre stage for Gordon against old club\n\nNewcastle may be in the last 16 of the Champions League but they are also 11th in the Premier League, two places and one point behind Saturday’s visitors to St James’ Park, Everton. “We’ve raised our game at times in the Champions League, there’s no denying that,” says Eddie Howe. “But we want to get into Europe every season and we’re desperate to get our Premier League form back on track. We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left-winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German, who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire on Saturday. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track after a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croat’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and, considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance. WU\n\nFulham v Tottenham, Sunday 2pm\n\nView image in fullscreen João Palhinha (left) battles with Leandro Trossard during an uncomfortable afternoon in the north London derby. Photograph: Ian Walton/AP\n\n9 Amad to make way for Sesko?\n\nFor Michael Carrick to find a fall guy for Benjamin Sesko, who is seeking a first start under him, the interim manager need look no further than Amad Diallo. The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third goal in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes after the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "A European occasion that appeared ominous for Celtic instead provided evidence that it is never wise to write off Martin O’Neill. His side exited the Europa League in Stuttgart but the scale of spirit and togetherness visible during their 1-0, playoff second-leg victory emphasised that tales of their demise may be overstated.\n\nCeltic’s key attribute during a critical week, which begins at Ibrox on Sunday, is course and distance specialism. The shortcomings within, and patched-up nature of, O’Neill’s squad are blindingly obvious. This is, however, a club that has become accustomed to dominating Scottish football over more than a decade. Much earlier, O’Neill had demonstrated he could emerge successful from title scraps. Contrary to giddy analysis, there is nothing miraculous or remarkable about O’Neill’s work during his second short-term stint of the season. It is, though, immediately striking how a 73-year-old can achieve such buy-in from players. Faith in O’Neill within Celtic is absolute.\n\nThis Celtic season, typified by managerial upheaval and protesting supporters, retains a pulse. Stuttgart felt significant because Celtic, in makeshift form, displayed character. The easier option would have been to limp out of the Europa League. Instead, there was an unwillingness to concede an equaliser that reflects positively on O’Neill and his squad.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill (left) is in his second interim stint of the season at Celtic and has galvanised the players after a rocky period. Photograph: DPA/PA\n\nOn Sunday they face a Rangers team who are under considerable pressure to prove they will not deliver another campaign typified by false dawns. Rangers’ home form is strong but Danny Röhl’s team are yet to remove the sense of a soft underbelly, demonstrated by draws at Hibernian, Motherwell and Livingston. The most recent of those, last Sunday, was a horrendous result; Livingston had not won in 25 league matches. The stakes are huge for Rangers, who should be embarrassed if a net spend of about £30m is not sufficient to prise the title from Celtic – at one point managed by Wilfried Nancy – and a Hearts side assembled for buttons in comparison. Celtic’s seven Premiership losses to date match their combined tally from the previous two seasons.\n\nA Rangers win would place Celtic in tricky territory, five points behind their oldest foes. Celtic’s game in hand will be played in Aberdeen on Wednesday, before a return to Ibrox on Scottish Cup business. Hearts hope to extend their lead at the top to seven points on Saturday when Aberdeen visit Edinburgh. An Old Firm draw would suit Hearts perfectly.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rangers’ Danny Röhl speaks to the media on Friday – his side are four points behind Hearts and two above Celtic. Photograph: Luke Nickerson/Rangers FC/Shutterstock\n\nStuttgart gave O’Neill plenty food for thought. Luke McCowan’s terrific performance in midfield should afford him a start at Ibrox. O’Neill’s public backing of Kasper Schmeichel suggests he will restore the veteran goalkeeper despite almost weekly errors. Schmeichel’s deputy, Viljami Sinisalo, repelled Stuttgart. Auston Trusty’s suspension leaves Celtic weak in central defence. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was not in Celtic’s European squad, was surely signed to play in fixtures such as the derby.\n\nO’Neill is aware of a bigger picture, despite that hardly being his concern given he is due to leave in the summer. “European football is what big clubs in Scotland should be aiming for,” he said. “Not for the coefficient points to be dropping out of sight. It’s ridiculous. This is what it’s all about.”\n\nHis regular reference to the country’s coefficient, which is indeed dipping to a worrying level, is intriguing. There is a theory Celtic’s reluctance to spend heavily on players is linked at least in part to knowledge that their potential lack of access to European revenue in upcoming years could swallow up cash reserves. In a worst-case but feasible situation, Celtic could be staring at Conference League football. This does not, however, explain the horrendous lack of preparation for this season’s Champions League playoff tie. Sensible investment would have been sufficient to topple Kairat Almaty, who instead left Celtic with red faces.\n\nThe shadow boxing has started. McCowan has asserted no team in the league can touch Celtic when at their best. In truth, it would be more of a story had McCowan stipulated Celtic are also-rans. Röhl cast aspersions on Celtic’s approach in Stuttgart; this was amusing, given Rangers finished 32nd out of 36 in the Europa League table.\n\nAll Old Firm jousts are fascinating. This one carries more meaning than most. Events in Germany suggested Celtic are formed of the kind of substance that Rangers must be wary of."

Dr Suraj Kukadia, also known as Dr Sooj, took to TikTok to share his insights and explained the key difference between treatable and permanent issues.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\" If you want to protect your hearing, you need to know this red flag for hearing loss,\" Dr Sooj told his followers. \" Now, there are two main types of hearing loss. There's conductive, and there's sensorineural. And the difference really does matter.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFirst, Dr Sooj highlighted conductive hearing loss, which occurs when sound can't reach the inner ear through the outer or middle ear. Causes of this generally include earwax blockage, infections, and fluid behind the eardrum, among other issues that are often treatable, allowing hearing to improve.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nMeanwhile, sensorineural hearing loss describes damage to the inner ear or auditory nerve, typically arising from noise exposure, medications, tumours, and age-related factors. These issues are deemed irreversible but can be managed with hearing aids or cochlear implants.\n\nNonetheless, if sensorineural hearing loss occurs suddenly and rapidly over hours to days, it is considered a medical emergency. Dr Sooj claimed that most patients have a 72-hour window to start treatment in order to preserve hearing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAfter that window, the outcomes are considered 'much worse'. In his video, Dr Sooj continued: \"And you can tell which type you have by humming. This is my left side, this is my right side. If we close both ears with fingers and hum like this, where do you hear the hum loudest?\n\n\"If my left side is affected and the hum is louder in this ear, the one with the hearing loss, then that suggests a conductive hearing loss. The sound is trapped in the ear canal and in the middle ear, so conduction of sound waves through the bones is enhanced and feels louder.\n\nView 2 Images Sensoerineural hearing loss is generally deemed irreversible but can be managed with hearing aids or cochlear implants (stock image) (Image: Bymuratdeniz/Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"If the hum is louder in your good ear, so the one that is not affected by the hearing loss, then that suggests some sort of sensory neural hearing loss in the affected ear. Your inner ear or nerve on the affected side is damaged, so it can't process sound properly, even when it's conducted through bone.\n\n\"Now, if the hum is equal in both ears, but you're still struggling to hear, then you might have an issue affecting both ears, or something else entirely might be going on.\"\n\nBeyond this, Dr Sooj also flagged five key red flags that need urgent assessment. These include the following:\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSudden hearing loss in one or both ears Hearing loss with dizziness or vertigo Hearing loss with a severe headache Hearing loss after a head injury Hearing loss with facial weakness\n\nHe added: \"For gradual hearing loss, you should still get assessed, but it's less urgent. You should see your GP, who can examine your ears, remove wax if needed, and refer you to audiology for proper hearing tests.\"\n\nSimilarly, official guidance from the NHS states: \"There are lots of possible causes of hearing loss. It may be caused by something treatable or it may be permanent. Your symptoms may give you an idea what could be causing it. But do not self-diagnose, see a GP for advice.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFor more information, visit the NHS website here.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

He said that he had no information of his own on the source of the drone.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he did not know about the incident. Asked by reporters about Swedish officials linking the drone to the Russian ship, Mr Peskov said that \"it's quite absurd\" to claim that the drone was Russian just because a Russian ship was nearby.\n\nWestern officials say Russia is masterminding a campaign of sabotage and disruption across Europe with well over 100 incidents reportedly documented. Not all of them are public and it can sometimes take officials months to establish a link to Moscow.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWhile officials say the campaign - waged since Russia launched an all-out war against Ukraine in 2022 - aims to deprive Kyiv of support, they believe Moscow is also trying to identify Europe's weak spots and divert law enforcement resources."

He responded by launching a ferocious attack on her, which severed her spinal cord. When Easom called for an ambulance, he claimed she had \"an accident\" and \"fallen out of bed\".\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn a victim impact statement read to the court, Ms Burgess said: \"This crime has taken away everything I built, planned for and enjoyed.

You initially told the 999 operator that she had fallen from her bed.\n\n\"Once that call was over and you were waiting for the ambulance to arrive, she told you that this story would not stand up to scrutiny.

His reckless and repulsive actions could have very easily led to Trudi's death.\"\n\nSpeaking outside court on her behalf, Ms Burgess's brother Charlie said: \"I refuse to let the abuse I experienced be the final word on who I am. From this point on, I want to help others. Domestic abuse rarely begins with physical violence. At the beginning, abuse can be subtle, through manipulation and small behaviours that chip away at your confidence.\n\n\"I didn't recognise those signs early enough, I didn't know what coercive control was, and I know now how important it is that we talk about all of this openly.

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "The fans can sense it. So can the players and certainly Unai Emery too.\n\nAfter losing to a Wolves side who had won only one of their previous 32 Premier League matches, Aston Villa can feel a Champions League place slipping through their fingers for a second season in succession.\n\nIt is not yet time to panic. With five clubs set to qualify for Europe’s major club competition, Villa still headed into the weekend with a six-point cushion to Liverpool in sixth. They are also favourites for the Europa League, which guarantees safe passage to the Champions League.\n\nPlaying like this, though, they will succeed neither at home nor in Europe. Joao Gomes opened the scoring after an hour with substitute Rodrigo Gomes grabbing the second with virtually the last kick.\n\nHis midfield depleted by injuries, Emery is counting down the days until John McGinn and Youri Tielemans can return from injury. Villa must hope they do not come back too late.\n\nThis was a rare bright moment in a miserable season for Wolves and they deserved it. It will give Rob Edwards and his team new hope for the FA Cup fifth-round tie against Liverpool here on Friday. And with this win, they have now overhauled Derby’s record low total of 12 points from the 2007-08 season.\n\nAston Villa will have fears over their Champions League spot again after losing 2-0 at Wolves\n\nUnai Emery was left with his head in his hands as his third-place side stumbled at Molineux\n\nThough Emery already ranks as one of Villa’s finest managers, this was not his finest hour. Ollie Watkins has been labouring for most of the season and Tammy Abraham had scored in each of his last two games. Still Watkins was given the nod along with Lucas Digne, chosen at left-back ahead of the more adventurous Ian Maatsen. Emery has still never won at Molineux in five attempts.\n\nWhen Joao Gomes gave Wolves the lead just after the hour mark, only Ezri Konsa and Digne tried to encourage their team-mates. Soon after that, the game was halted due to an apparent issue with referee Craig Pawson’s earpiece. Already irritated, that development seemed to tip Emery over the edge as he paced frantically from one side of his technical area to the other. When the stoppage time board was held up, he lost it again, seeming to scream ‘Only seven?’ at the fourth official.\n\nHis players were angry, too. Ezri Konsa and Amadou Onana berated Emi Buendia for dragging his heels as he walked to the bench after being substituted and during the opening 45 minutes, Emery was constantly in the ear of Jadon Sancho. When Buendia and Digne were brought off, Emery seemed to ignore them.\n\nWolves know they are down but there are still certain matches that can bring some light in the darkness. One is next week’s FA Cup fifth-round tie against Liverpool. The other is the chance to knock over one of their local rivals.\n\nFor their part, Villa knew they were favourites but lacked the confidence you would expect from a team chasing Champions League football. The absence of key players is starting to take its toll and shorn of Boubacar Kamara, as well as McGinn and Tielemans, Villa look half the team.\n\nTaking only one point from matches against Everton, Brentford and Leeds suggested Villa were in poor health yet surely they would have far too much for one of the poorest teams in Premier League history. Wouldn’t they?\n\nThe early signs were not promising. Buendia’s clumsy challenge on Jean-Ricner Bellegarde gave Wolves a free-kick that Mateus Mane sent just wide from 22 yards. Many expected Abraham to be preferred to Watkins here and in the sixth minute Watkins wasted a great chance to repay that faith.\n\nSent clear by Morgan Rogers, Watkins hesitated just long enough for Yerson Mosquera to steal the ball before the forward could even shoot. Moments later, Pau Torres wasted a free header from Douglas Luiz’s corner.\n\nNoting Villa’s recent struggles against cautious teams, Wolves boss Rob Edwards instructed his side to sit deep and counter. Yet after Mane’s free-kick, their only other chance was when Toti Gomes’ miscued a volley from Mosquera’s knockdown.\n\nAs the rain poured, Emery was growing more and more agitated at Sancho’s failure to make runs behind the Wolves back line. Eventually Emery’s patience snapped and he gave the on-loan Manchester United winger an earful. No doubt Sancho was relieved to head for the opposite flank when the sides changed ends for the second half.\n\nJoao Gomes (above) struck midway through the second half to put Wolves in the ascendancy, before Rodrigo Gomes grabbed the hosts' second goal with virtually the last kick of the game\n\nVilla's dismal defeat marked just the second time Wolves have won in the league this season\n\nThe sole other incident of note before half-time was when Luiz connected well with Matty Cash’s cross but directed his volley straight at Jose Sa. It was Sa’s only serious save of the half.\n\nThe pattern did not change in the second half until, moments after Emery had made a double change, Jackson Tchatchoua crossed from the right, Adam Armstrong laid the ball off and Gomes crashed it in off the bar from 15 yards.\n\nMaatsen’s arrival made a difference and his rising shot forced Sa into another sharp stop and Mosquera cleared off the line from Abraham before Rodrigo Gomes sealed it in front of the South Bank."

            "content": "England have learned to deal with their imperfections in the T20 World Cup following New Zealand win - but their luck must run out eventually, writes RICHARD GIBSON\n\nEngland have spent this entire Twenty20 World Cup talking about playing the perfect game, yet remain firmly in the hunt to become the first country to win the tournament three times because they have learned to deal with their imperfections.\n\nThis astonishing late heist against New Zealand kept up their 100 per cent record in the Super Eight stage, meaning Harry Brook's team will, barring some extraordinary results this weekend, be heading for the second semi-final in Mumbai on ­Thursday — where the prospect of a frenzied atmosphere against co-hosts India or a replay of their group-stage meeting with West Indies, their only defeat here, awaits.\n\nMore top-order failure meant that for much of a chase of 160, it looked like they would be destined for Kolkata instead, until a seventh-wicket union between Will Jacks and the recalled Rehan Ahmed worth 44 off just 16 deliveries catapulted them to victory.\n\nIt speaks of the dysfunctional aspects of this team that Jacks, their No7 batsman and sixth bowler, has won four man-of-the-match awards in 20 days. On the balance of probabilities, their luck must run out eventually.\n\n'Yeah, you're right, because ideally I would do nothing, and I'm kind of at some stage the extra bowler and the extra batter. If I didn't bowl and didn't bat, we'd have had that perfect game that we keep speaking about,' Jacks said, following two for 23 with an unbeaten 32.\n\n'We've won six out of seven games and qualified for a semi-­final. We obviously want to play well but we're not gutted we ­haven't been perfect. What we've done well is in the key moments, we've kept a calm and clear head and managed to get those rewards.'\n\nWill Jacks starred with both bat and ball as England beat New Zealand at the T20 World Cup\n\nEngland required 42 off 17 when Ahmed, preferred to Jamie Overton because the match was contested on a used pitch, got off the mark by launching a 103-yard six off spinner Glenn Phillips, who had been reintroduced to the attack for his ability to dart the ball in from around the wicket, cramping his opponents for room.\n\nIt was almost fantasy cricket: as he left the dugout at 117 for six, all-rounder Ahmed received a walkie-talkie message from coach Brendon McCullum to bat like India great Virender Sehwag.\n\nTwo balls later, Jacks sent a skyscraper of a hit over the midwicket boundary to truly seize the momentum and with New Zealand reeling, he powerfully pierced the field for back-to-back fours.\n\nWhen Ahmed danced down the track to hit a second six from the final ball of the penultimate over, sent down by the usually parsimonious Mitchell Santner, they were on the verge of a victory set to an all too familiar template: Nepal, Scotland and Italy discomforting them until late in proceedings in the group stage.\n\nHowever, after New Zealand followed the way of Sri Lanka and Pakistan, captain Santner said of England: 'If you can get yourselves out of a tricky position to end up winning it does a lot for the team, and a lot for the confidence.\n\n'There's no better team at finding a way to win from anywhere. There's different guys stepping up at different times, which is what you want. I wouldn't want to face them, if we're in the semi-finals.'\n\nThe Kiwis face a nervous wait as defeat has presented the outside possibility of Pakistan pipping them for the last four. To do so, Pakistan must defeat Sri Lanka by a minimum of 64 runs or chase down their target in 13.1 overs in Pallekele today.\n\nIn England's favour is an extraordinary belief that they can win from anywhere, and an enviable team spirit. 'This is the era of Harry Brook as white-ball captain,' said Jacks, as if to emphasise the captain's popularity within a youthful squad.\n\nRehan Ahmed put on a more-than-useful partnership wirth Jacks to steer his side to their sixth win from seven games\n\nBut members of the old guard are an issue: the opening partnership of Jos Buttler and Phil Salt averages just 12 in the tournament, and Buttler has just 62 from seven visits to the crease.\n\nEngland have been effective at the start of bowling innings, taking 18 powerplay wickets in the tournament, before this fruitless return against Tim Seifert and Finn Allen.\n\nJofra Archer's form bodes well whichever opponents await. Here, he started with a maiden featuring a successful Seifert review for caught behind, but did not bowl out, as Brook opted to send down a record 16 overs of spin.\n\nThings will get tougher but despite being outhit by opponents, England's engine room has fired.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Jacks, who has figures in the Sri Lankan leg of 10-0-72-5, Sam Curran followed closing out the last-ball thriller versus Nepal with handy runs, and combined in a 42-run stand with Tom Banton that kept the prospect of another dramatic England win alive."

            "content": "The Last Dance: Why the penny has FINALLY dropped for Andy Farrell, how he can now BREAK Ireland's 40-year World Cup hoodoo and what the future holds for our GREATEST EVER coach post-Australia 2027...\n\nIRELAND head coach Andy Farrell is entitled to feel a degree of bemusement around the punditry and coverage of this Six Nations campaign.\n\nDespite the considerable credit he had built up over the years, there was a fair whack of criticism flung his way following the opening night hammering in France, including justifiable question marks over his long-term planning and loyalty to the old guard.\n\nBut Farrell got little credit when he then ripped up the script with his team selection to face Italy, leaving out established frontliners and rolling the dice on promising newcomers. The result was a surge of energy through the Ireland squad.\n\nA SENSE OF JEOPARDY\n\nAll of a sudden, there was a genuine sense of jeopardy, a brutal realisation that, no matter how big your reputation or how storied your career, if you do not perform to the standards expected, you are out.\n\nIcon: Andy Farrell is adored by Irish rugby supporters but the Ireland head coach was on the receiving end of heavy criticism after two games of this Six Nations Championship\n\nThis had not been the case previously on Farrell’s watch, with the general policy revolving around running the same established names almost regardless of form, an approach that persevered even after the 2023 World Cup failure.\n\nIt was a defiant change of direction, an era-altering policy shift, yet it was largely dismissed as ‘rotation’ for the perceived lesser challenge of facing the Italians at home.\n\nFor some, this correspondent included, the subsequent victory over Italy was hugely positive.\n\nYes, there were lots of errors and areas to improve in a win that could be more readily described as ‘nervy’ than ‘convincing’, but Italy are a decent side now and Ireland digging themselves out of a hole with a bunch of new faces catching the eye was a major plus.\n\nOn the front foot: Farrell did not get enough recognition for his bold selection calls against Italy\n\nOr so we thought…\n\nIt quickly became apparent that this was a minority opinion as the widespread reaction across was doom and gloom – with little recognition of what Farrell was, belatedly, trying to do in terms of widening options.\n\n‘TERMINAL DECLINE’\n\nPhrases like ‘terminal decline’ and ‘irreversible recession’ abounded after the Italy game and the general consensus was that Ireland’s efforts to extricate themselves from the deep trough they now found themselves in ‘could take years’.\n\nIt took Farrell a week.\n\nWhen he reinstated a clutch of his tried-and-trusted for the (on paper) daunting trip to Twickenham, they returned to a side re-energised by the Italy reshuffle and ruthlessly determined to prove their worth, driven by the unsettling knowledge that their places were no longer guaranteed.\n\nThe result was a performance of ferocious intensity that proved far too much for a brittle England side, still assailed with doubt after their shock Murrayfield humiliation.\n\nToo much: Ireland played with far greater intensity than England in their Twickenham win\n\nIt was a euphoric occasion for Irish rugby and, suddenly, the same heads who had been talking about the dark days being here to stay, did a 180 with frothy talk of ‘rebirth’ and ‘rejuvenation’.\n\nThere is a tendency in modern media – driven by the internet’s insatiable demand for clip-worthy reaction, and over-reaction – to get mired in the immediate.\n\nThere is also a lemming-like, ‘we are all individuals’ aspect to rugby analysis where nearly everyone dives frantically for the consensus and starts parrotting the same phrase du jour along the way.\n\nThis month it was ‘intent’ after Farrell questioned the lack of it from his players following their Paris pummelling.\n\nAs soon as he said it, the word ‘intent’ was being sprinkled excitedly across Irish rugby analysis, as though pundits had been gifted a secret sauce to use at will.\n\nEuphoria: Caelan Doris and Tadhg Beirne celebrate at the final whistle in Twickenham\n\nFarrell must be shaking his head at it all.\n\nNow, post Twickenham, the analysis has shifted to the head coach’s next career move, with stories linking Farrell to a return to his old haunt of Saracens in English rugby on a whopping €1.2million contract.\n\nThis has led to a cacophony of calls for Farrell to be handed an extended Ireland contract to keep at the helm for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnother knee-jerk, instant reaction to breaking events when it would be better to step back and assess the overall picture.\n\nTHE PENNY FINALLY DROPS\n\nFarrell’s time with Ireland has been a remarkable story of progression and success – with the obvious exception of the World Cup.\n\nAnd now, finally, it appears as though the penny has dropped and he is viewing everything through the prism of next year’s World Cup – because the rhetoric from Farrell, and his assistants, is radically different to what we have heard before.\n\nAfter the 2023 disappointment, it was ‘as we were’ with the message that the ‘journey continues’ and, while Farrell oversaw a thumping win over France in Marseille and landed a Six Nations, it all seemed a little ‘after the Lord Mayor’s show’.\n\nThis Six Nations feels a whole lot different, the right attitude seems to have been adopted (namely that this tournament is a means to a World Cup end) as Ireland continue to assess options for down the road.\n\nEven in the euphoria of the win over England last weekend, Farrell impressed hugely with his calm, bigger picture observations.\n\nMindset shift: Farrell has realised the need to look down the road and broaden his options\n\n‘I didn’t care whether we won or lost today, just whether we grew as a group because we know where we want to go,’ he said afterwards.\n\nIrish rugby has been waiting to hear those words from a head coach for 15 years.\n\nThe message, and mind shift, appears to have been embraced by everyone in camp, based on Johnny Sexton’s observations when asked about the contest for his old No 10 jersey between Jack Crowley, Sam Prendergast, Harry Byrne and Ciaran Frawley.\n\n‘All the criticism from previous World Cup cycles is that we did not develop guys and we have relied too heavily on one player in some positions,’ said Sexton, referencing the over-dependence on his own role at the 2015, 2019 and 2023 World Cups.\n\n‘So, we are doing it a different way now.’\n\nAmen to that.\n\nTHE LAST DANCE\n\nWhatever way you look at it, Farrell has been a phenomenally good coach for Ireland since coming on board as Joe Schmidt’s defensive coordinator in 2016.\n\nBy the time of the World Cup in Australia next year, the Englishman will have been 11 years working for the IRFU and living in this country, where he and his family are known to be very happily settled.\n\nHowever, every coach, no matter how talented, popular or successful they are, has a shelf life, and when his contract expires next year, it feels like a natural conclusion to this Irish rugby chapter.\n\nThe concern is that, if the IRFU were to make that decision and announce it later this year, there is the danger of Farrell becoming a ‘lame duck’ coach.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that this is what happened to Joe Schmidt in 2019 after Farrell was announced as the Kiwi’s successor a year out.\n\nThe New Zealander, who had been the most influential and transformative head coach in Irish rugby history up to that point, had difficulties selling his message in his final year as players began to gravitate towards his successor.\n\nHowever, there is less chance of that happening this time around.\n\nFor Farrell and the core of the squad he has been loyal to over the past five years, it’s ‘Last Dance’ time – the final chance to crack the World Cup code.\n\nThat incentive would be hugely motivating and more than enough to keep Farrell and the likes of Tadhg Furlong, Andrew Porter, Tadhg Beirne, Josh van der Flier, Jamison Gibson-Park and Garry Ringrose right on message through to the conclusion of Australia 2027.\n\nDown and out: Eddie O'Sullivan was given a new deal prior to the 2007 World Cup only for a highly-rated Ireland side to crash out at the pool stages with the coach gone not long after\n\nThe alternative approach, and one that has widespread support, is to hand Farrell another deal to keep him on board for yet another World Cup cycle – but Ireland have been burned this way before, most famously in 2007.\n\nThat summer, prior to the World Cup in France, the IRFU extended Eddie O’Sullivan’s contract and when the announcement was made to the squad, the story goes that, rather than the standing ovation which had been possibly expected, there was an awkward shuffling of feet and half-hearted murmurings of congratulations.\n\nIt was reflective of a bubbling desire for change, amid fringe frustration at O’Sullivan’s loyalty-driven selection policy, and when Ireland crashed horribly at that tournament, there was an enormous backlash against the contract extension and the head coach was gone within a matter of months.\n\nThere are obvious differences between the O’Sullivan landscape then and Farrell’s now – not least the English man’s focus on keeping a happy camp.\n\nBut, when you look at how a Farrell contract extension plays out, it does not make much sense.\n\nIf Ireland did manage to finally have a successful World Cup and reach a first semi-final or go further, it would be a tough mental challenge to start from scratch again on yet another four-year cycle, especially with the complication of the Lions tour to New Zealand in 2029 which Farrell is known to be keen to lead.\n\nAlternatively, if Ireland bombed out yet again at the quarter-final stage, or earlier, there would be a massive outcry for change and Farrell’s position would surely be untenable, regardless of past achievements.\n\nSuccession plan: Ronan O'Gara would be the ideal man to take over from Farrell next year\n\nFar better to take the ‘Last Dance’ approach, confirm Farrell’s departure after the World Cup, announce his replacement – ideally Ronan O’Gara – and pour everything into going out on a high.\n\nPERFECT ENDING\n\nAs for Farrell’s next move, he is not short of options. Saracens have hotly denied any approach or €1.2m contract offer but those words can be taken with a large dollop of salt – this is Sarries we are talking about, after all.\n\nEngland would also appear a highly plausible option; the RFU blazers watching Farrell’s team dismantle Steve Borthwick’s side in Twickenham last weekend would surely have been thinking how to break the bank to get the proud Englishman back on board – and few here could quibble if they did.\n\nWhatever happens, the good news for Ireland is that Farrell appears to have got his focus back in a big way following the drift post-2023.\n\nThat bodes extremely well for next year and what better way for Ireland’s greatest coach to step off the stage than by ending this 40-year World Cup hoodoo?\n\n\n\nThe perfect ending."

            "content": "Robin van Persie hits back at 'inappropriate' criticism of Raheem Sterling after former exiled Chelsea star was branded 'Bambi on Ice' during Feyenoord debut\n\nRobin van Persie has hit out at the 'inappropriate' criticism of Raheem Sterling after the former Chelsea star struggled to hit the ground running on his Feyenoord debut.\n\nSterling, who joined the Dutch club earlier this month after mutually agreeing to terminate his £325,000-a-week deal at Chelsea in January, came off the bench to mark his first appearance for the team during a 2-1 win against Telstar last Sunday.\n\nHaving spent nine months in exile at Stamford Bridge without making a single appearance for Chelsea this season, Sterling was understandably rusty on his debut and faced a wave of backlash on social media.\n\nFeyenoord boss Van Persie leapt to Sterling's defence on Friday ahead of his team's clash with FC Twente on Sunday, hitting out at his critics.\n\n'If you have a little sense of context, where he comes from, what he's achieved in the past, and that he hasn't had any team training for months,' Van Persie said.\n\n'I understand that there are expectations of an absolute top player, but to criticise him like that after half an hour - his first half hour after over six months - then you really don't understand anything at all.'\n\nDespite accepting that criticism is part of being a footballer in the Netherlands, the former Manchester United forward went on to label the backlash 'inappropriate'.\n\nRobin van Persie has hit out at 'inappropriate' criticism aimed at his player Raheem Sterling\n\nThe ex-Chelsea star (right) was ruthlessly criticised after his debut for Feyenoord last Sunday\n\n'A large part was positive, but some of it was also quite Dutch. Being blunt about everything that everyone thought wasn't right,' he added.\n\n'If you're five or six weeks in and you think he's not delivering, okay, then you have a point. But to throw out such strong opinions based on his first half hour, I thought, was inappropriate.'\n\nAfter Sterling's cameo appearance last Sunday, one Instagram account called FootballPark, boasting almost 100k followers, wrote that the ex-England international looked like 'Bambi on Ice' and even suggested he should consider retiring.\n\nThe author, who was by no means the only social media account ripping into the footballer, posted: 'Raheem Sterling's debut for Feyenoord was not exactly a success story – in fact, it looked like a veritable disaster from the Dutch club's point of view.\n\n'The English winger looked like Bambi on ice. On a downward spiral since 2022, lacking motivation, and seemingly unable to play under anyone who isn't named Pep Guardiola, Sterling is well and truly into his twilight years. Is it time to hang the boots up once and for all?'\n\nSterling's former Manchester City team-mate Jack Grealish jumped in to defend the 31-year-old star online, taking issue with the post.\n\n\n\n'What a f*****g stupid Instagram post man what's wrong with you guys. Guy hasn't played or trained for so long. Ppl like u guys is what wrong with the world. Have some respect,' he wrote."

You don't need any more proof. Vinicius got punished with a yellow card for dancing infront of these racist people.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, Benfica today said they won't carry out any investigation about the racist fans in their stadium.pic.twitter.com/1nbud0rlKo — LBW (@losblancoswrld) February 19, 2026\n\n'Benfica reaffirms that it does not tolerate any form of discrimination or racism and will continue to act firmly whenever behaviors that undermine the values ​​of the club, sport, and society are involved,' the club said in a statement.\n\nThe match in Lisbon was stopped for close to 10 minutes after Vinicius Jnr, 25, alleged that Prestianni had racially abused him following the Brazilian’s second-half goal. Referee Francois Letexier signalled the start of FIFA’s racial abuse protocol by crossing his wrists above his head.\n\nReal Madrid team-mate Kylian Mbappe claimed after the match that Prestianni had called Vinicius Jnr a 'monkey' five times.\n\nThe 20-year-old star has denied using racist language and instead claims he used the homophobic slur 'maricon', Spanish for 'f****t', in response to being taunted about his height.\n\nStanding at 5ft 5in, Prestianni is among the shortest players in the Champions League and was reported to have said he acted in retaliation after Vinicius referred to him as a dwarf.\n\n\n\nBoth racist and homophobic abuse are breaches of Article 14 of the UEFA's disciplinary rules, meaning Prestianni could be set for a lengthy ban regardless of whether his defence is believed."

            "content": "The previously unseen reaction from Geri Halliwell to her husband Christian Horner being booed by fans in the wake of his sex texting scandal has been revealed.\n\nHalliwell, 53, was a semi-regular fixture on race weekends alongside her husband, often appearing in the paddock at prominent races such as the British Grand Prix, before he was sacked as Red Bull chief during the last season.\n\nIn February 2024, the paddock was stunned by a leaked cache of suggestive messages purporting to be from Horner. Horner was later accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour by a female member of staff, with an internal investigation led by KCs twice clearing him of wrongdoing. Halliwell supported him throughout.\n\nRed Bull GmbH in Salzburg - the world champion team's parent company - said in a statement: 'The independent investigation into the allegations made against Mr Horner is complete, and Red Bull can confirm that the grievance has been dismissed.\n\n'The complainant has a right of appeal. Red Bull is confident that the investigation has been fair, rigorous and impartial.\n\n'The investigation report is confidential and contains the private information of the parties and third parties who assisted in the investigation, and, therefore, we will not be commenting further out of respect for all concerned. Red Bull will continue striving to meet the highest workplace standards.'\n\nGeri Halliwell's previously unseen reaction to Christian Horner being booed after his sex text scandal engulfed Formula One\n\nSpice Girl Halliwell stood by her husband (right) as he was subject to an internal investigation\n\nThe exact nature of the complaints remain unknown, but Horner was questioned by a KC for a full day at a secret location last year as the barrister gathered evidence that he wrote up in 150 pages for the Red Bull board's determination. Horner always denied the accusations.\n\nStill, at the F1 72 launch event at the O2 in February last year, fans opted to boo him vigorously as he took to the stage to carry out his speech.\n\nHe wore a grin, and said: 'It's a pleasure to be at the O2, anyway. I hope everyone is having a good night.'\n\nNetflix cameras, meanwhile, captured the reaction of Halliwell. The Spice Girl could be seen watching on, also smiling, but seemingly concerned for her husband.\n\nHorner told the documentary: 'When you become a serial winner the crowd and the audience, they don't wanna see that. In Formula One, there's this element of pantomime, we're now like the Kardashians on wheels.\n\n'But I'm way past even caring what other people think.\n\nHe later added: 'You have to be the pantomime villain. We are different, and that's what makes us who we are. This isn't a popularity contest it's Formula One and you're judged on the result sheets at the end of the day.\n\n'It's easier to be the hunter than the hunted and of course, for us, anything outside of total domination, is not good enough.' He would later repeat the villain line when sat in the audience.\n\nHorner was sacked from his role at Red Bull amid a suspected power struggle at the Thai-Austrian constructor\n\nAfter his speech, Horner was seen awkwardly looking for directions to his seat in the crowd.\n\nAs Horner was booed, Ferrari duo Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc watched on, as did Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Liam Lawson.\n\nHamilton, stunned, could be seen backstage saying 's***.' Lawson, meanwhile, said: 'I think we are going to get a lot of boos,' to which Verstappen replied: 'I don't give a f***.'\n\nHorner was also present at Red Bull's new car launch on February 15 - three days before the event at the O2 - and spoke for the first time since allegations came to light, claiming Geri had been 'very supportive' before insisting he would be present at the Bahrain curtain-raiser.\n\n'I have a very supportive family and a very supportive wife,' he said. 'My focus has been on the job and the season ahead.\n\n'There's been a day job to be getting on with. I feel the support within the business and our partners, and within the industry. It is overwhelming.\n\n'There's a process that's ongoing at the moment. Some allegations have been made, which I fully deny and I have fully complied with that process and will continue to do so until it's dealt with.\n\n'Everybody's focused on one thing, which is the performance of that car to go out and defend both the world titles that we've worked so hard to achieve over the last couple of years.\n\nA shocked Lewis Hamilton said 's***' as he heard the reaction to Horner's entrance at the O2\n\n'So the car is what everybody is invested in and I look forward to seeing it in action in Bahrain next week.'\n\nHorner won 13 world championships in charge of the team since taking over as a 31-year-old in 2005. Mid-way through the 2025 season, however, amid a suspected power struggle at the Thai-Austrian constructor - and one year on from his sex texting scandal - he was sacked, and eventually left the team in July after receiving an £80million package."

            "content": "Gareth Southgate has suggested only a high-profile role would tempt him back into management and claimed that he would have outperformed a string of head coaches who have struggled for success at big clubs.\n\nThe 55-year-old manager, who left his role as England boss after losing to Spain in the 2024 European Championship final, has admitted he is 'not actively looking' for a new role despite being away from the dugout for over 18 months.\n\nHowever, Southgate has refused to rule out a return to the Premier League after being linked with several top flight roles since leaving the Three Lions.\n\nManchester United, who sacked Ruben Amorim in January and have since enjoyed a resurgence under interim head coach Michael Carrick, are the club most strongly linked to Southgate, as they are expected to be in the market for a new manager at the end of the season.\n\nSouthgate, who previously coached Middlesbrough in the top flight before joining England, admitted he has very little interest in managing mid-table clubs.\n\nSpeaking on The Football Boardroom Podcast, he said: 'I’ve got no passion to just go and manage in the Premier League. I did that at 35, I finished 11th, 12th. Who is in those positions now, probably Bournemouth, Brighton?\n\nGareth Southgate has hinted only a high-profile role would tempt him back into management\n\nThe former England boss has been away from the dugout since losing the Euro 2024 final\n\n'So I don’t feel the need to just go and do it to say I’ve managed in the Premier League.\n\n'I’ve had one of the biggest jobs in world football so I’ve been spoiled. Huge nights, working with outstanding players. No owner interfering.\n\n'The bit that, externally, people are saying is, \"well, he didn’t win\". So how do you prove that you can win? You’ve got to one of those big clubs.'\n\nTowards the end of his time with the national team, Southgate was criticised for failing to get over the line in major finals, with England still yet to win a major trophy since the World Cup in 1966.\n\nConfident he could take on a 'big' role in the top flight, Southgate added: 'Now we know those big clubs… do I think I could have done the job that some people who have been in those clubs recently have done? Could I do better? I think I could.\n\n'But we’ve talked about the baggage that comes with me as an appointment if you’re an owner.\n\n'And there’s a reality around (that), I can understand what that noise is. There’s that bit which makes me potentially a complicated appointment for a club.'\n\nKeen not to rush back into management, Southgate admitted: 'I don’t want to go and manage a different national team.

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nBRADENTON, Fla. -- The first time Konnor Griffin visited Maven Baseball Lab in Atlanta, he did something no one there had ever seen. Since opening in 2022, Maven has assessed thousands of baseball players with force plates that use sensors to measure the amount of energy being transferred into the ground during a swing. Griffin was the top-ranked 16-year-old in the country, a 6-foot-4, 200-pound specimen, and the plate was no match for him.\n\nThough the plate was anchored into a portable frame that had withstood swings from perennial major league All-Stars and MVP-caliber players, the force Griffin was creating jarred it loose, cajoling it out of place. Once the awe of onlookers subsided, they scrambled to place 45-pound weights on each side of the plate, hopeful that would suffice in keeping Griffin from wrecking the setup. It did, though those at Maven learned that day what others in the world of Major League Baseball have in the years since: It's damn near impossible to keep Konnor Griffin -- and anything he touches -- down.\n\n\"You're looking at a Ferrari,\" said Tyler Krieger, the co-owner of Maven and a former Cleveland minor leaguer. \"You're not looking at a little Fiat.\"\n\nThis spring, the Pittsburgh Pirates are endeavoring to figure out whether they're ready to take their F40 for a spin. Now 19 years old -- and the No. 1 prospect in the game after a tour de force 2025 in which he dominated three levels and was the consensus Minor League Player of the Year -- Griffin entered camp with an opportunity to win Pittsburgh's every-day shortstop job. Regardless of whether he secures an Opening Day roster spot, Griffin will debut at some point this season and join Paul Skenes as the best pair of young players on any team in baseball.\n\nAnd until the Pirates make that decision, the eyes of the baseball world will be trained on Bradenton. Griffin represents more than a glimmer of hope for a woebegone organization. He is the dream of any franchise: top-of-the-scale power and speed, with a nifty glove and a shotgun-blast arm, the kind of work ethic that will make any slacker in his orbit feel like a lout, and a demeanor so polite and accommodating that the words \"yes\" and \"sir\" might as well be surgically attached to one another.\n\nNow, two years after missing out on earning a first-round draft pick because they kept Skenes in the minor leagues to start the season -- after he won the National League Rookie of the Year, they would have been awarded the pick through the prospect promotion incentive program -- the Pirates face a similar conundrum with Griffin. It's not exactly apples to apples. Skenes spent three years in college and was two weeks shy of his 22nd birthday when he arrived in May 2024. Griffin would be the first teenage hitter to debut on Opening Day since Ken Griffey Jr. in 1989.\n\nThe Pirates are nonetheless entertaining the possibility -- because they have postseason aspirations, sure, but more because Griffin is forcing them to. Inviting him to major league camp last spring just seven months after selecting him in the 2024 MLB draft, then watching him smash an opposite-field home run in his first Grapefruit League game, intimated the Pirates were open to fast-tracking Griffin, but to suggest anyone foresaw what followed -- a .333/.415/.527 line with 21 home runs, 65 stolen bases and sterling shortstop defense across Single-A, High-A and Double-A -- would be wrong. This, as those at Maven will attest, is something different.\n\nWhat it breeds is an all-timer of a cost-benefit analysis. Griffin could immediately be a star ... and he also could struggle with the truth that baseball excellence is far from linear. He possesses immense and magnificent tools ... and has under 100 plate appearances above Single-A. He could help Pittsburgh this year ... and if next season is lost due to a work stoppage and as part of an eventual deal the time to free agency is reduced from six years of service, his tenure as a Pirate could be even shorter-lived.\n\nThere are no clear answers, not this early in the spring, not even after Griffin's two-homer barrage Tuesday against the Boston Red Sox. Time is the ultimate judge. And with Opening Day a month away, Griffin has a finite amount in which to convince the Pirates that the benefit outweighs the cost.\n\n\"I fully trust what the front office and the coaches and everybody have done, how they're going about it,\" Griffin said. \"They've done a great job so far allowing me to be free in the minor leagues and be able to move and continue to face challenges. But this spring, I'm really trying not to think about it too much. There's a lot of noise. I'm just trying to treat it just like I did last spring. I knew I had no chance of just making the big league team. And so every day I was just trying to be a sponge and soak up the advice of these great players who've been through it. And I'm trying to do the same thing this year. I know there could be a chance I make the big leagues at some point soon, and that's great, but I just want to feel ready.\"\n\nIN LATE 2022, Paul Skenes met Konnor Griffin for the first time. After transferring from the Air Force Academy to LSU, Skenes was a few months from turning in one of the best seasons in college baseball history, capped by a College World Series win and being taken with the No. 1 selection in the amateur draft. Griffin already had reclassified to graduate high school a year early and was LSU's top recruiting target, a can't-miss kid the coaching staff knew would likely get poached in the draft before he set foot on campus. Still, the cachet of having a player of Griffin's talent even committed made the juice worth the squeeze.\n\nTwo other recruits accompanied Griffin in Baton Rouge that day -- and when they saw Skenes, they went full fanboy, asking for photos. Griffin did not.\n\n\"And I had so much respect for that,\" Skenes said. \"He had the presence. It's a feel thing. It's such a small world, and he probably knew at some point he would see me again.\"\n\nBreaking News from Jeff Passan Download the ESPN app and enable Jeff Passan's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first.

For more information, click here.\n\nThe two reconnected after Griffin slid to the Pirates with the ninth pick in the 2024 draft, met again last spring and have chatted more during Griffin's ascent toward the big leagues. Skenes' opinion of Griffin has only grown brighter. A top pick in the draft, the No. 1 prospect in the game -- few understand the deluge of hype, the potholes on the road to success, quite like them. And Skenes, a 23-year-old who carries himself like a 10-year veteran, can't get past the way Griffin conducts himself as a teenager.\n\n\"Goes to church every Sunday, doesn't cuss, doesn't do any of that stuff, married at 19,\" Skenes said. \"It's not common, but nothing about him is common. Everything screams uncommon. And if you want to be uncommon, you want to do uncommon things, it starts with thinking uncommon -- and he does that.\"\n\nThe uniqueness dates back to before Griffin was a teenager. His father, Kevin, is a longtime coach who had turned the softball team at Belhaven University -- a Division III college in Jackson, Mississippi, with an enrollment of around 1,000 undergraduates -- into a powerhouse. Konnor, the second of his three sons, was the tallest, strongest and fastest of his peers. Recruiting services pegged him as a future star at 12 years old. Agents chased him around the South, hoping to advise him. He latched on with Excel Sports, whose client Corey Dickerson, an 11-year major leaguer and Mississippi native, invited Griffin to a hitting session when he was 14 and already playing varsity at Jackson Prep as an eighth grader.\n\n\"At that point,\" said Josh DeMoney, the hitting coach they worked with that day, \"Corey's been in probably seven or eight seasons in the big leagues. And Konnor's going toe-to-toe with him every swing at 14 years old.\"\n\nGriffin found comfort with DeMoney, whose Grit Training facility in Flowood, Mississippi, was a two-minute drive from Jackson Prep. Kevin would accompany his son to hitting sessions and throw batting practice right-handed, and DeMoney countered from the left side. They would crank up a pitching machine to spit out fastballs with velocities that, accounting for the machine sitting 38 feet from the plate, were equivalent to hitting pitches of 100 to 105 mph.\n\n\"One thing that I look for is how quick a player can make adjustments,\" DeMoney said. \"You literally could tell Konnor, 'All right, try this,' and he would do it the first swing. He is very cerebral and very advanced. Some kids it takes a month or even a whole season to figure something out.\"\n\nThe 2026 Fantasy Baseball Draft Guide Rankings, tips, stats, strategy and more. Everything you need for the 2026 fantasy baseball season is here!\n\nCheck out the Draft Guide today! >>\n\nBaseball came naturally to Griffin. His physicality allowed him to dominate other sports -- he was featured on \"You Got Mossed\" as a freshman in high school after outjumping three defenders to snag a football -- but his love of baseball ran deep. The sounds, the smells -- even more than that, he said, the constant failures, which made the successes feel that much richer.\n\nGriffin became a regular at DeMoney's facility, running from midweek road basketball games to hitting sessions that didn't start until 10 or 11 p.m. Griffin's reclassification, in which he moved from the class of 2025 to 2024, forced him to take extra classes and attend summer school. Neither deterred Griffin; if this was the price to reach professional baseball sooner, he would gladly pay it. For years, he spent his weekends traveling around the country playing games and using off weeks to improve, like his five-hour treks from central Mississippi to Atlanta for maintenance sessions at Maven.\n\nUnable to quibble with his production, evaluators nitpicked Griffin's swing, wondering aloud about his hit tool. Sometimes he did overstride, his weight crashing forward and making him susceptible to strikeouts. At Maven, Griffin would take 12 swings on a force plate with motion-capture cameras recording his every movement and an algorithm would spit out weaknesses that coaches would devise drills to cure.\n\nGriffin needed to anchor his back leg into the ground to keep from almost leaping forward. He tightened up his swing, allowing his back elbow to guide the movement of his hands and carry his bat through the strike zone. With his hit tool cleaned up, he entered the 2024 draft with no discernible weaknesses. The power was extraterrestrial, the speed blazing enough to steal 87 bases in 88 tries during his final high school season, the glove in center field arguably even better than at shortstop, the arm good enough to pump 97 off the mound and warrant consideration as an early-round pitching prospect, too. Griffin won Gatorade National High School Player of the Year, then heard eight names -- all college players -- called before his in the draft.\n\nThe Pirates haggled with Griffin until the signing deadline, when he agreed to a $6.5 million signing bonus, nearly $300,000 over the assigned slot value. He played all of 2025 at 19 years old -- Griffin will turn 20 on April 24 -- and ingratiated himself as much with who he is as what he does.\n\n\"There's nothing bad you can say about him,\" said Pirates outfielder Jake Mangum, who graduated from Jackson Prep a decade before Griffin. \"Genuinely, he is an amazing dude that works really hard and does everything the right way. Mix that together with the talent he has, it's going to be something special. He works like he has no talent at all, and it's a really cool combo.\"\n\nFEW ORGANIZATIONS IN baseball suffer as many self-inflicted wounds as the Pirates. It's not just the bad trades of past front office regimes and decades of paltry payrolls, either. It's the removal of Bucco Bricks and replacing Roberto Clemente's retired number on the right-field wall with an ad for alcohol-spiked iced tea. More than anything, though, it's the lack of winning. The Pirates last made the postseason in 2015. Their last NL Central title came in 1992, Barry Bonds' final season in Pittsburgh.\n\nAnd for as great as Andrew McCutchen and Brian Giles were, Griffin is the organization's most talented position player since the home run king. Thirty-five years of pain doesn't vanish overnight, but a team that pairs Griffin with offseason lineup additions Brandon Lowe, Ryan O'Hearn and Marcell Ozuna could cause the biggest shock of all: a Pirates fan base that isn't openly hostile to owner Bob Nutting's skinflint spending. Complement those bats with a rotation featuring Skenes, Bubba Chandler, Braxton Ashcraft and Mitch Keller, with Jared Jones returning from Tommy John surgery and left-hander Hunter Barco and right-hander Antwone Kelly big-league-ready, and the Pirates could find themselves in postseason contention should they take their 26 best players back north. And Griffin, clearly, is among them on merit alone.\n\nESPN is now the home of MLB.TV All MLB out-of-market games. Live or On Demand. All in one place. Get access\n\n\"It absolutely says something about what we're trying to do,\" Skenes said. \"I mean, we haven't gone out and gotten a shortstop this offseason. I think they're going to give him a shot, but he needs to play well enough. And he knows that.\n\n\"I say this all the time to guys that are trying to come up: You make the team, and then what? Is that it? I know that's not how he's thinking now. There's a timeline on it for him. So for him, it's not about playing well and making the team. That doesn't matter. The only person that knows how good he can be is him. And even I don't think he knows exactly how good he can be, but there are a lot of expectations and people are saying a lot about him, and I hope he doesn't see that and read into it and try to fulfill those expectations rather than just be the best Konnor Griffin that Konnor Griffin can be. If he does, then he will learn from that. And the Pirates are going to be in a really good spot.\"\n\nThe easiest solution to Pittsburgh's dilemma is to take service time out of the equation. At some point this spring, the Pirates are expected to approach Griffin with a long-term contract extension, sources said. For comparison, Boston Red Sox outfielder Roman Anthony -- the No. 1 prospect in baseball entering last year -- spent the season's first two months at Triple-A as a 21-year-old. Less than two months later, he signed an eight-year, $130 million extension.\n\nGriffin's calculus is different. A debut at 19 would mean free agency at 25. The two most astounding contracts in baseball history were lavished on players who arrived in the majors as teenagers: Alex Rodriguez's $252 million deal with the Texas Rangers that doubled the previous highest guarantee, and Juan Soto's $765 million contract with the New York Mets that nearly did the same. The Pirates know that to lock up Griffin -- to nullify the years of trauma that have Pittsburgh fans reflexively counting down the days until he's traded or leaves in free agency -- will take a never-before-seen type of deal. The very type the Pirates have never bestowed on a player.\n\n\"Konnor looks at himself completely different than people look at him,\" DeMoney said. \"He's always thinking that he needs to get better. He's always trying to improve on something. He doesn't look at himself as a No. 1 prospect. Obviously, he knows it and it's all over the place, but his mindset is he is always trying to find ways to get better at the game and develop. You would think that could get to your head as a 19-year-old kid. And it doesn't even faze him. He doesn't even think about it. He is still working just as hard as when he was a kid trying to get to that spot.\"\n\nEven if a long-term deal that would guarantee Griffin's place in the middle of the lineup Opening Day doesn't get done, the Pirates don't necessarily have to play the service-time game. Though it's true that keeping him in the minor leagues for at least two weeks to start the season would ensure they control him through 2032 instead of 2031, the desire to win now -- to win back a generation of lost fans -- and the PPI program are strong enough incentive to warrant him helping raise the Jolly Roger in April.\n\nEither way, Griffin won't allow a decision that's ultimately out of his hands to dictate his mood. Nor will he rest on the past successes that have led to the spotlight on his every move as baseball's next teenage phenom.\n\n\"It was wonderful getting all those awards and really just brought the whole year together,\" Griffin said, \"but what I worked on was kind of closing that yearbook, taking everything I've learned and continuing to put in the work to prepare for what's to come. I haven't made it to the big leagues yet, and that's what matters. Awards in the minor leagues are great, but they're even better when you're in the big leagues.\n\n\"I always tell people my goal is to be in the Hall of Fame, and if I can make the Hall of Fame, then I'll sit back and be happy and be complacent. But right now I'm just trying to grow.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nSpring training camps are underway, which means it is time to look at the state of baseball. As part of our 2026 MLB season preview, ESPN's Buster Olney surveyed those around the industry to help him rank the top 10 players at every position as part of his annual positional ranking series.\n\nToday, we cap the series by ranking the best of the best at designated hitter.\n\nThe objective of this exercise is to identify the best players for the 2026 season, not who might be best in five years or over their career. We rolled out a position per day over two weeks. Here's the rest of the schedule: starting pitchers (Feb. 16), relief pitchers (Feb. 17), catchers (Feb. 18), first basemen (Feb. 19), second basemen (Feb. 20), third basemen (Monday), shortstops (Tuesday), corner outfielders (Wednesday), center fielders (Thursday).\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has a lot of options to sort through at the top of his lineup, juggling Freddie Freeman, Mookie Betts and now Kyle Tucker, whose four-year deal will pay him a record $57.1 million average annual salary. But Roberts is settled on this: Shohei Ohtani will be the leadoff hitter again, whether he's serving as the designated hitter or the Dodgers' starting pitcher.\n\nOhtani likes the idea of getting everything started, of getting into the game, Roberts said last year, and you cannot argue with the results: Ohtani has scored 280 runs over the past two seasons, by far the most in the big leagues. Over his past three seasons -- his final year with the Los Angeles Angels and his first two seasons with the Dodgers -- he has 153 home runs and an adjusted OPS+ of 184.\n\nIt shouldn't be any surprise, then, to find him at the top of our list of the top 10 designated hitters in MLB this upcoming season.\n\nTop 10 designated hitters\n\n1. Shohei Ohtani, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nHe went through some postseason struggles last year, and opposing pitchers will undoubtedly try to follow the script created by the Phillies in October -- Ohtani went 1-for-18 with nine strikeouts in the National League Division Series against them -- but he is known for his adjustments. Ohtani is an equal-opportunity masher, as borne out by some of his regular-season splits from 2025:\n\nHome OPS: 1.010\n\nRoad OPS: 1.018\n\nFirst half OPS: .988\n\nSecond half OPS: 1.054\n\nInnings 1-3 OPS: 1.019\n\nInnings 4-6: .979\n\nInnings 7-9 1.041\n\nOPS vs. starting pitchers: .977\n\nOPS Vs. relievers: 1.071\n\nOPS in high-leverage situations: 1.123\n\nMedium leverage: .975\n\nLow leverage: 1.021\n\n2. Kyle Schwarber, Philadelphia Phillies\n\nSchwarber was rewarded for his investment in his teammates and his work ethic, which has driven his improvements over the course of his career. A couple of years ago, Schwarber aimed to get better against fastballs, and now he has become one of the best fastball hitters of his generation.\n\nAgainst four-seam fastballs in his career:\n\n2023: .235 BA, .548 SLG\n\n2024: .222 BA, .493 SLG\n\n2025: .286 BA, .759 SLG\n\nAnd his improvement against lefties is ridiculous:\n\n2023: .758 OPS\n\n2024: .898 OPS\n\n2025: .964 OPS\n\nSchwarber turns 33 next month, and the idea that a DH-only player would get a $150 million deal, as he did over this winter, might have been unthinkable once. But given Schwarber's power, command of the strike zone, effort to get better and clubhouse impact, the thought of fielding a team without him must've been unthinkable for Phillies owner John Middleton.\n\n3. Yordan Alvarez, Houston Astros\n\nHouston is committed to keeping him at DH because of his injury issues in recent seasons -- he missed 48 games in 2023 and 114 games last year, including the last two weeks of the season as the Astros fought for a playoff spot. His slugging percentage dipped to a career-low .430 last season, and his adjusted OPS to 121. With a very right-handed lineup, Houston desperately needs the left-handed-hitting Alvarez to impact opponents again.\n\n4. George Springer, Toronto Blue Jays\n\nRanking MLB's best at every position As a new baseball season approaches, Buster Olney compares the elite at every spot on the diamond. Top 10s for 2026 »\n\nSpringer enters the last year of his six-year, $150 million contract with the Jays at 36 years old, and he's at the stage of his career where he'll be playing for another contract, if he wants that. But what he did last year was pretty spectacular: Only Aaron Judge and Ohtani, two of the game's biggest stars, had a higher wRC+ than Springer's 166, and he had a .309/.399/.560 slash line to go with it. Springer played 54 games in the outfield last season, but with Anthony Santander out for most of the year and with Addison Barger and Nathan Lukes manning the corners for the Jays, Toronto can reduce the grind on Springer's legs by keeping him at DH.\n\n5. Brent Rooker, Athletics\n\nAfter a 39-homer campaign in 2024 resulted in a contract extension that keeps him with the A's through 2029, Rooker compiled 73 extra-base hits last season, including 30 homers. The right-handed masher is a perfect hitter to line up behind the left-handed hitting Nick Kurtz, forcing opposing managers to make difficult choices; Rooker hammered left-handed pitchers last year for a .293/.385/.500 triple slash line.\n\n6. Yandy Diaz, Tampa Bay Rays\n\nTampa Bay exec Erik Neander has constantly turned over his roster to manage payroll, trading everyone from Blake Snell to Tyler Glasnow to Brandon Lowe. But Diaz remains -- this will be his eighth year with Tampa Bay -- partly because of his team-friendly contract but also because of his offensive impact. Over the past four years, he has compiled 13.4 WAR, a .379 OBP and an OPS+ of 138.\n\n7. Christian Yelich, Milwaukee Brewers\n\nManager Pat Murphy's priority is to keep Yelich's bat in the lineup, so it appears his days as an every-day outfielder are over. Yelich, who had a .795 OPS and 121 OPS+ last season, is entering his 14th season in the majors and approaching some benchmarks -- he needs 259 more hits for 2,000 in his career, and another 17 homers for 250.\n\n8. Giancarlo Stanton, New York Yankees\n\nAaron Judge is the leader of this team, but some players in the clubhouse say that the impact Stanton's words have on his teammates cannot be overstated. He has played 120 or more games only once since 2019, but he does damage when he's in the lineup -- Stanton had 24 homers and an OPS+ of 162 in 77 games last season. He's within range of 500 career homers, needing 47 more, with two years (plus a $25 million team option) left on his Yankees' contract.\n\n9. Kerry Carpenter, Detroit Tigers\n\nESPN is now the home of MLB.TV All MLB out-of-market games. Live or On Demand. All in one place. Get access\n\nDespite dealing with hamstring issues throughout last season, Carpenter still did big-time damage at the plate, with 18 doubles and 26 homers. He came off the bench in 21 of his 130 games, as Tigers manager A.J. Hinch worked to get the slugger as many matchups as possible against right-handed pitching -- he went .257/.300/.512 vs. righties and .217/.238/.400 vs. lefties last season. As Kevin McGonigle and Max Clark lengthen the Detroit lineup, Carpenter is likely to have more opportunities with runners on base.\n\n10. Ivan Herrera, St. Louis Cardinals\n\nMy colleague Paul Hembekides strongly believes Herrera should be much higher on this list, after a really nice offensive season last year -- a .373 on-base percentage and an adjusted OPS of 136 in 107 games. However, Herrera does not have as much of a track record as the players in front of him.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nSalvador Perez, Kansas City Royals: With Carter Jensen ascending to the big leagues and Vinnie Pasquantino at first and Jac Caglianone developing in the outfield, it's not clear how Perez, who hit 30 homers last season, will be used this year. But he had 38 games at DH in 2025, and that number is likely to grow in 2026.\n\nEugenio Suarez, Cincinnati Reds: He hit 49 homers last season between the Diamondbacks and Mariners, and he still had to wait until late in the winter to sign a one-year deal with the Reds -- probably due to his high strikeout rate and below-average defense.\n\nJurickson Profar, Atlanta Braves: He has made it clear this spring that he prefers to play the outfield, but it's hard to imagine Atlanta catering to a player who missed half of last season because of a PED suspension. Profar's defensive metrics in left field were also well below average in 2025, which informed the Braves' decision to sign Mike Yastrzemski to play alongside Michael Harris II and Ronald Acuña Jr. in the outfield.\n\nMLB's top 5 breakout teams for 2026 Which teams are about to get a whole lot better? We break down five potential breakouts.\n\nBradford Doolittle »\n\nRyan O'Hearn, Pittsburgh Pirates: He had a really nice season last year with a .281/.366/.437 slash line, with only 50 of his games coming at DH. But he might best fit Pittsburgh's lineup now at this spot.\n\nSamuel Basallo, Baltimore Orioles: His bat speed is unreal, and his power is immense. At just 21 years old, it'll be really interesting to see how Baltimore manager Craig Albernaz chooses to develop Basallo behind the plate and as a major league hitter."

            "content": "The Atlanta Falcons dismissed LaTroy Lewis from his role as assistant defensive line coach Friday after sexual assault allegations surfaced against him, the team announced.\n\nThe Ann Arbor Police Department confirmed Friday to ESPN that it is currently investigating allegations of sexual assault against Lewis. Spokesperson Chris Page said the Ann Arbor PD was \"just recently made aware\" of the woman's allegations, which stem from a Dec. 5, 2024, incident while Lewis was on the Michigan football staff.\n\nLewis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Paul Corliss, a spokesperson for Michigan, called the allegations \"deeply concerning.\"\n\nKaren Truszkowski, the woman's attorney, told ESPN that her client filed an incident report with the Ann Arbor PD and applied for a protective order against Lewis earlier this week.\n\nTruszkowski said her client and Lewis met on a dating app and started communicating in July 2024, while Lewis was an assistant defensive line coach at Michigan. Lewis' behavior \"became increasingly aggressive\" over text and phone calls, Truszkowski said.\n\nThe two met in person for the first time at Weber's Hotel in Ann Arbor in December 2024, where Truszkowski said Lewis was supposed to give back goods her client had given him. According to the attorney, Lewis raped and battered her client at the hotel.\n\nThe woman informed then-Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore, whom she knew personally, about the incident, according to her attorney. But Moore did not report Lewis and \"weaponized\" the incident against the woman, Truszkowski said, including sending her lewd and sexually charged text messages.\n\nMoore's attorney, Ellen Michaels, denied the allegations in a statement to ESPN.\n\n\"Sherrone Moore did not fail to report misconduct, did not reward wrongdoing and did not harass anyone,\" she said. \"These claims are false.\"\n\nIn January 2025, officers from the Milford Police Department, north of Ann Arbor, responded to a call to the woman's home after neighbors heard raised voices, according to the incident report obtained by ESPN. Both Lewis and the woman told officers at the time that they had gotten into a verbal argument that was not physical, according to the report.\n\nThe woman told police that Lewis was a coach at Michigan and \"stated that she didn't want to talk about it,\" according to the incident report. No charges were filed.\n\nTruszkowski said that Lewis physically abused her client during that incident, but that she was too afraid to tell police at the time.\n\nThe allegations against Lewis were first reported Thursday night by Darko State Media. The Falcons hired Lewis on Feb. 10 after coaching stints at Michigan, Toledo and UConn. He played defensive line at Tennessee and spent three seasons in the NFL.\n\nMichigan fired Moore on Dec. 10, 2025, for an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. He was then arrested on charges related to stalking and illegally entering the staff member's home, and he is awaiting trial.\n\nIn his statement, Corliss referred to Michigan's ongoing review of Moore's conduct and the culture of its athletic department and encouraged anyone with information to come forward.\n\nThe allegations against Lewis emerged less than three weeks after Falcons player James Pearce Jr. was arrested in Florida. The linebacker is facing five felony charges stemming from an alleged incident on Feb. 7 where he crashed his vehicle into a car driven by his ex-girlfriend, WNBA player Rickea Jackson, and struck a police officer with his vehicle to start a subsequent chase."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe NFL Players Association executive committee has narrowed its search for a permanent executive director to a group of finalists, including interim executive director David White and former union chief strategy officer JC Tretter, according to four sources briefed on the process.\n\nAlso among the finalists is American Conference commissioner Tim Pernetti, the sources said. The union's 32 player representatives will vote on the finalists at the annual NFLPA meeting in San Diego next month.\n\nIn a statement to ESPN, NFLPA president Jalen Reeves-Maybin said the executive committee is \"conducting a comprehensive search that includes a strong pool of highly qualified candidates. Out of respect for the integrity of the process and those involved, we will not comment on or disclose individual names.\"\n\nWhite, Tretter and Pernetti did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nThe NFLPA has been searching for a permanent leader since July, when then-executive director Lloyd Howell resigned following ESPN reporting that he had charged a pair of strip club visits to the union. ESPN also reported that he worked part time for the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that is seeking minority ownership in NFL franchises, and that the union and league had struck a confidentiality agreement to keep an arbitrator's rulings about possible collusion by NFL owners from players.\n\nIn August, the union elected White as its interim executive director. White is the former CEO of 3CG Ventures, an executive coaching and strategic firm, and a former board chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. He has extensive labor experience, having served as the leader of the SAG-AFTRA union, with 160,000 members who work in the entertainment industry, from 2009 to 2021. White was also a finalist when Howell was elected in 2023.\n\nWhile serving in the interim role, White has said union membership has \"no appetite\" for an 18th regular-season game, which NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has publicly contemplated.\n\nTretter, who served as the NFLPA's chief strategy officer under Howell, also resigned from his position in the wake of ESPN's reporting last year. Tretter is a retired Cleveland Browns offensive lineman who served as the player president from 2020 to 2024. He was reportedly a candidate to serve as interim executive director after Howell's resignation, but pulled his name from consideration when he stepped down.\n\nTretter led the 16-month search process that resulted in Howell's election in 2023 and presided over a vote that changed the NFLPA's constitution to make the search and election process more confidential. Last year, he told ESPN he made confidentiality a priority because candidates' names had leaked to the media in past elections.\n\nThe names of the finalists for this election are known to the executive committee and the finalists themselves, and confidentiality again has been a priority, other sources familiar with the process have told ESPN. Two player reps who spoke to ESPN this week said the executive committee hadn't yet told them who the finalists are.\n\nWhen he resigned, Tretter told CBS Sports that he denied having access to the collusion grievance or having any involvement in the confidentiality agreement that Howell struck with the league.\n\nPernetti has been the American Conference commissioner since June 2024. He was previously the president of Florida's IMG Academy, an athletic powerhouse high school that produces some of the top football recruits in the country. He has also held leadership roles at sports and entertainment company Endeavor and with Major League Soccer.\n\nOther candidates for the executive director role included Domonique Foxworth, a former player and an ESPN commentator who was the NFLPA president from 2012 to 2014; Matt Schaub, a former player rep who was a candidate in 2023; and Jeff Saturday, also a former player and an ESPN commentator, according to three other sources familiar with the process.\n\nSchaub did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Saturday confirmed to ESPN that he interviewed for the role with the firm the union hired to run the search but not with the executive committee. Foxworth also said he was interviewed by the firm but not by the executive committee.\n\n\"I'm extremely disappointed,\" Foxworth said. \"I hope they get it right this time.\""

The Heisman runner-up had to issue an apology after posting a message that included \"F-All THE VOTERS\" on social media.\n\nBut Pavia said his demeanor and approach are what made him a good leader at Vanderbilt. And his confidence, he said, comes from being constantly counted out in life, including when he started his career in junior college.\n\nThat has turned out to be a credit to him in his quest to make it in the NFL, he said.\n\n\"I feel like a lot of teams love the tenacity, the fight,\" he said. \"The life of an underdog, that's for sure. And, so, they ask questions. But you go back, you look at my record, ain't nothing on my record.\"\n\nHe added, \"I just want everyone to know what's true about me is I'm humble and I get my confidence from my process. And if you saw how much I put into this, you would see where I get my confidence.\"\n\nAnother thing NFL teams will need to weigh is Pavia's lack of size. He measures under 5-foot-10, a big detriment at the position in the NFL. But playing at that size against elite competition is nothing new, he said.\n\n\"I would just say turn on the tape,\" Pavia said. \"It's not like we're not playing these guys that are going first-round, second-round [picks] on Saturdays in the SEC. So, the SEC and the Big Ten probably have the most guys getting drafted in the first, second round. So, we're playing those guys and ain't nothing going to change.\""

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

Government remains committed to supporting private enterprises to grow and create sustainable jobs.\"\n\nHe stressed that waste management companies play an important role in safeguarding public health while simultaneously providing large-scale employment opportunities.\n\nHighlighting the government's proposed 24-hour economy policy, the Minister indicated that companies capable of sustaining continuous operations would receive strategic attention and support.\n\n\"The government is committed to creating value and supporting private businesses, especially under the 24-hour economy framework.\n\n\"Zoomlion is a strong example of the type of organisation we are looking to support, and this visit helps us better appreciate the scale of their work,\" he noted.\n\nAccording to him, initiatives that prioritise worker safety, environmental sustainability, and employment generation align directly with the government's economic transformation agenda.\n\n\"We are not pushing people to rush into waste management, but we will provide incentives for those willing to invest in the sector. Zoomlion is doing remarkable work and has enormous potential,\" he added.\n\nThe Minister further disclosed that the company's nationwide presence through numerous subsidiaries and operational facilities has contributed significantly to youth employment, noting that approximately 200,000 Ghanaians have benefited from opportunities created across the sanitation value chain.\n\nHe emphasised that facilities such as ACARP could benefit substantially from policies aimed at boosting productivity through round-the-clock operations.\n\n\"We are pursuing a reset agenda while supporting the 24-hour economy to function effectively. Organisations such as Zoomlion represent areas where government support can have a significant national impact,\" he said.\n\nThe Chief Operating Officer of the Environment and Sanitation Cluster of the Jospong Group of Companies, Mrs Florence Larbi, highlighted the company's transformation over the past two decades.\n\nShe explained that Zoomlion has evolved from basic waste collection into a comprehensive waste value-chain operator covering collection, storage, transfer, recycling, and treatment services.\n\nWith 36 waste treatment facilities across Ghana, including medical, liquid, and solid waste processing plants, the company now provides sanitation services to households and institutions nationwide.\n\n\"We have come a long way, and today we are proud to serve almost every household in Ghana,\" she said.\n\nShe added that the company remains well-positioned to support large-scale national sanitation initiatives, including youth employment programmes.\n\nThe Managing Director of Zoomlion Ghana Limited, Mrs. Doris Kweikwor Adjei, expressed appreciation to the Minister and his delegation, describing the visit as a strong affirmation of collaboration between government and the private sector.\n\n\"Your visit reinforces that labour is not only about policy discussions but about people, dignity, and the employment opportunities created for Ghanaians,\" she said.\n\nShe assured the delegation of the company's continued commitment to building a disciplined and motivated workforce capable of contributing meaningfully to Ghana's economic growth.\n\n\"We will not only clean Ghana but also continue to develop a workforce that supports national productivity and development,\" she added.\n\nOther management members of the Jospong Group present included Executive Director of the Environment and Sanitation Cluster, Mrs. Gloria Opoku Anti; Chief Corporate Communications Officer, Ms. Sophia Kudjordji; General Manager of ACARP, Mr. Paddy Tuwor; Director of Communications and Corporate Affairs, Ms. Emma Adwoa Appiah Osei-Duah; and Public Relations Manager, Mr. Ernest Morgan Acquah, among others.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Both institutions acknowledged culture as one of Ghana’s most potent soft power tools and a strategic pillar for inclusive growth.\n\nSpeaking during the engagement, the CEO of the GTA, Maame Efua Houadjeto, underscored the importance of synergy:\n\n“Tourism and culture are inseparable.\n\nGhana’s heritage is not just a memory of the past; it is a powerful economic engine for the future.\n\nStrengthening our collaboration with UNESCO allows us to harness culture, education, and innovation—particularly AI—to drive sustainable tourism growth.”\n\nShe said integrating AI into destination marketing, visitor experience management, data analytics and digital storytelling would position Ghana strongly in an increasingly competitive global tourism landscape.\n\nIn his remarks, Edmond Moukala highlighted UNESCO’s commitment to supporting member states in advancing education, science, culture and communication for sustainable development.\n\nEstablished in 1945, UNESCO works globally to safeguard cultural and natural heritage, promote quality education, foster scientific cooperation and encourage intercultural dialogue. Through initiatives such as the World Heritage Programme and Education for Sustainable Development frameworks, the organisation supports countries in translating heritage preservation into socio-economic gains.\n\nMr Moukala noted:\n\n“Ghana has immense cultural capital. The opportunity lies in connecting heritage, education, and emerging technologies to create sustainable value. UNESCO stands ready to support Ghana in protecting its heritage while embracing innovation to enhance tourism management and knowledge sharing.”\n\nThe discussions also covered youth engagement, digital documentation of heritage assets, curriculum integration to build tourism awareness and sustainable site management approaches aligned with global standards.\n\nAt the close of the engagement, Mr Moukala presented a copy of the book titled World Heritage for Sustainable Development in Africa to the GTA CEO as a symbolic gesture reflecting a shared commitment to ensuring Africa’s heritage becomes a foundation for sustainable economic transformation.\n\nThe CEO was accompanied by the Deputy CEO in charge of General Services, Ben Anane Nsiah; the Deputy CEO in charge of Operations, Ekow Sampson; and the Director of Corporate Affairs, Bright Asempa Tsadidey.\n\nTheir presence underscored the strategic importance the Authority attaches to partnerships that elevate Ghana’s cultural and tourism agenda on the global stage.\n\nThe engagement reaffirmed the Ghana Tourism Authority’s commitment to building strong international collaborations that leverage culture, education and innovation as drivers of national development. As Ghana strengthens its position as a leading tourism destination in Africa, partnerships with institutions such as UNESCO remain crucial in converting heritage into measurable economic and social impact.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) in the Ashanti Region has announced the restoration of full power capacity and improved voltage levels following the resolution of a major technical setback caused by infrastructure theft.\n\nAt least eight high-tension towers collapsed after being tampered with by unidentified criminals who removed bolts, nuts, and bases from the galvanised steel structures, forcing the pylons, vital lines connecting the Anwomaso Bulk Supply Point (BSP) to the Akyawkrom Substation, to topple.\n\nECG had to channel multiple feeders through a single source, characterised by chronic low voltage for thousands of customers, frequent power outages due to system overloads, and reduced operational flexibility for the technical team.\n\nSeveral communities in the Ashanti region on March 18, 2024, experienced several hours of power outages.\n\nThe development forced the Electricity Company of Ghana to launch immediate investigations.\n\nAt least eight towers, stretching several kilometres, had fallen onto the ground after some miscreants removed bolts, nuts, and the base.\n\nThe high-tension towers were transmitting power from Anwomaso Bulk Supply Point to the Akyawkrom Substation near Ejisu.\n\nBekwai, Anwiankwanta, Kumawu, Antoakrom, Manso Nkwanta, Jacobu, and Samfo-Aduam were some of the affected areas.\n\nOthers included Kumawu, Ejisu, Nsuta, Effiduase, and their environs.\n\nEngineers of ECG busily working to complete the construction of the 8 high-tension towers\n\nThe completion of the construction works on Wednesday, February 25, 2026 also coincided with a planned maintenance by ECG, which saw all customers on the broken towers restored to their normal positions.\n\nThis means residents and businesses in several districts within the Ashanti Region can now heave a sigh of relief.\n\nDaniel Mensah-Asare is the General Manager of the Ashanti East Region of Electricity Company of Ghana. He is elated ECG has restored the towers.\n\n“We have worked very tirelessly to resolve the problem. The problem occurred around the 18th of March 2024, exactly. So, as a result of the problem, it has created a situation where we have to manage to feed a lot of feeders through one source.\n\nAnd today as I speak, I am happy and on behalf of the entire ECG Ashanti Region, we want to say that we have resolved that problem and we have restored the stolen pylons and has restored power supply.”\n\nAccording to him, the construction of the eight-high tension towers mean a lot to ECG.\n\n“What has happened today is going to enable us to improve the voltage that we supply to our customers. It's going to minimise outage and as well give us what we call the flexibility in our operations.”\n\nIng. Mensah-Asare has been explaining to JoyNews what the restoration means to ECG and its customers.\n\n“From today, we can see that customers around this area and its environs and all those places who were experiencing some form of low voltage as a result of the incident that occurred on the 18th of March 2024. Today we have solved their problem and their voltages are going to improve.\n\n\"When we say low voltage, that's when you are not getting enough of power; the voltage that you require for a fridge or light or anything to work effectively. Comparing it to water, voltage is like the pressure that makes the water to flow. So the voltage was low.\n\n\"So most of our customers often say it is low current. So most of our customers who do not often see it low current, so the fridges are going to work better the air conditions are going to work better, the fans are going to turn better and every electrical gadget they are going to use in those areas is going to function or perform better.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ing. Mensah-Asare has commended residents in the Ashanti region for their patience as ECG worked on this capital-intensive project.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Assurances in Parliament that reforms and digital coordination will end emergency care refusals stand in sharp contrast to persistent reports of patients dying in corridors or being redirected across facilities.\n\nIs this a resource crisis, a coordination breakdown, or a question of professional conduct? And beyond promises, what measurable change is underway to guarantee that emergency care is truly non-negotiable?\n\nIn the power sector, public trust is under pressure as households report rapid depletion of prepaid electricity credits.\n\nThe regulator has ordered urgent explanations from the Electricity Company of Ghana, while investigations seek to determine whether the problem stems from tariff adjustments, technical faults, or deeper systemic lapses.\n\nConsumers want clarity, and potentially compensation. Will the probe deliver answers within days, and could the outcome reshape billing transparency and regulatory enforcement?\n\nAt the heart of the rural economy, tensions deepen over cocoa sector governance and pricing stress. As financial pressures mount and farmers raise alarms about hardship, calls are growing for accountability reviews involving the Office of the Special Prosecutor and the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice.\n\nAre these petitions grounded in evidence of conflict of interest, or are they political theatre in a moment of sector vulnerability? And what does this dispute mean for confidence in agricultural leadership during crisis?\n\nSecurity and social order also come under scrutiny amid rising concerns about school-related indiscipline and broader enforcement gaps affecting communities and local commerce. As incidents fuel anxiety about safety and governance capacity, the question becomes unavoidable: how does the state restore deterrence, discipline and public confidence without undermining rights and trust?\n\nAnd overarching all these concerns lies one defining question: Does the State of the Nation Address meaningfully confront these lived realities, or are citizens still waiting for policy to meet practice?\n\nJoin Samson Lardy Anyenini this Saturday at 9 a.m. on the JoyNews channels, on digital satellite channels 421 on DSTV and 144 on GoTV, and streams on JoyNews’ Facebook or YouTube channels on Saturdays from 8 am to noon and MyJoyOnline for a rigorous, solutions-focused national conversation.\n\nViewers can also follow the discussion by tuning in to Joy 99.7 FM or Luv 99.5 FM on the radio or stream the discussion live on either Google or Apple Podcasts.\n\nNewsfile is your most authoritative news analysis programme.\n\nIf it’s Saturday… it’s Newsfile.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Prof Hamidatu Saaka Darimani, revealed that for the first time in the institution's history, the university has admitted 17 differently-abled students into various academic programs.\n\nIn a major step toward inclusive higher education, the educational expenses for all 17 students will be fully absorbed under the free tertiary and persons with disabilities policy.\n\nThe university experienced a massive influx of interest this academic year, receiving a total of 2,575 applications. Out of that applicant pool, 1,967 candidates were offered admission.\n\nBreakdown the admissions data, the university admitted:\n\n768 students into Higher National Diploma (HND) programs.\n\n665 students into BTech/MSc programs.\n\n487 students into BTech/BSc programs.\n\n35 students into postgraduate programs.\n\nAddressing the economic hurdles of tertiary education, the Vice-Chancellor noted that 906 of the newly admitted Level 100 students have already successfully enrolled under the government's \"no fees stress policy,\" with others still undergoing documentation scrutiny.\n\nTo accommodate this 17% surge in the student population and ease the burden of off-campus housing, the university has commenced the construction of a 400-bed hostel facility aimed at providing a safe, conducive on-campus residential environment.\n\nOther major campus upgrades are currently underway to support the growing student body.\n\nThe vice chancellor highlighted the ongoing construction of the main entrance and access roads, the installation of solar street lights to boost campus security, and the outfitting of state-of-the-art laboratories to strengthen practical, industry-relevant training.\n\nIn a major demonstration of this commitment to practical skills, the matriculation ceremony was followed by the official commissioning of a state-of-the-art Cosmetology Laboratory.\n\nThe facility stands as the first of its kind in the entire region, specifically established to create direct employment pathways and equip students with high-level cosmetic science and practical skills.\n\nThe cosmetology department, currently operating with three staff members, is designed to offer specialised BTech and certificate courses. University management indicated that intensive recruitment efforts are underway to secure additional cosmetology faculty, allowing for the full enrollment of students into the program by the start of the next academic year.\n\nBeyond student training, the laboratory has been outfitted to offer premium, first-class cosmetology services to the general public, serving as both an educational hub and a revenue-generating enterprise for the university.\n\nClosing the ceremony, university management issued a stern warning regarding campus discipline and the student code of conduct.\n\nStressing that \"ignorance of these regulations would not be accepted as an excuse,” Prof Hamidatu urged matriculants to familiarise themselves with the rules and prioritise moral character alongside their studies.\n\n\"Remember that character and competence must go hand in hand,\" the Vice-Chancellor stated, reminding the students that \"academic excellence without integrity is incomplete\"\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Paramount is set to take over Warner Bro\n\nNetflix has backed away from its proposal to buy Warner Bros Discovery, clearing the way for Paramount Skydance to win a months-long battle for one of Hollywood's most storied studios in a deal worth around $111bn (£82.2bn).\n\nWarner Bros, which put itself up for sale last year, on Thursday said Paramount's latest bid was \"superior\" to the one from Netflix, which in turn refused to raise its offer.\n\n\n\nNetflix executives say they have declined to match Paramount's bid as \"the deal is no longer financially attractive\" at that price.\n\n\n\nThe buyer would gain control of the iconic studio along with its films and media networks - a takeover that could significantly reshape the media landscape.\n\n\n\nLast December, Warner Bros agreed to a takeover offer from Netflix for some of its assets, in a deal worth roughly $82bn (£61bn) including debt.\n\n\n\nParamount then made a rival proposal, which was rebuffed by Warner Bros, but an increased offer was made earlier this week, boosted by $1 per share.\n\n\n\n\"The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,\" Netflix co-chief executives Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement. \"However, we've always been disciplined.\"\n\n\n\n\"This transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price,\" the Netflix executives added.\n\nThe announcement came just hours after Sarandos had visited the White House on Thursday.\n\n\n\nIt caps off a dramatic months-long saga that - if approved by regulators - is likely to reshape Hollywood.\n\n\n\nBut California Attorney General Rob Bonta said later on Thursday that the potential merger \"is not a done deal\".\n\n\n\n\"These two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny - the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review,\" he wrote in a social media post.\n\n\n\nBonta had said earlier this month that his office would review any deal involving Warner Bros as the entertainment industry represents a \"critical sector\" for California's economy.\n\n\n\nParamount would also need approval from the US Department of Justice as well as European regulators.\n\n\n\nA deal between Paramount and Warner Bros could hold serious ramifications for the future of one of the US's biggest news brands - CNN. Warner Bros is the network's parent company.\n\nParamount, which is looking to transform itself into a Hollywood heavyweight, is backed by tech billionaire Larry Ellison and led by his son David.\n\n\n\nThe funding of Paramount's offer has drawn scrutiny, in part over the close ties between US President Donald Trump and Larry Ellison, a major Republican donor.\n\n\n\nTrump has frequently attacked the news network over its reporting of his policies. He said in December that he believed CNN should be sold as part of any Warner Bros deal. He called the people running CNN \"corrupt or incompetent\" and said they should not be entrusted to run the network.\n\n\n\nCNN head Mark Thompson sent an email to employees as news spread of the all-but-assured Paramount deal, telling workers to not \"jump to conclusions about the future until we know more\", US media reported.\n\n\n\nThe BBC has contacted CNN for comment.\n\n\n\nParamount's initial hostile bid was also supported by Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner through his investment firm, raising concerns about the president's influence over the deal.\n\n\n\nKushner's firm, Affinity Partners, backed away in December amid scrutiny over the deal.\n\nParamount's 2025 merger with Skydance also led to scrutiny amid negotiations with the Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission, which had to sign off on the deal.\n\n\n\nAmong the concessions made was Paramount's $16m settlement on behalf of CBS News. Trump had sued the network over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former vice president Kamala Harris, claiming that the network had engaged in election interference in the way the program was edited.\n\n\n\nThe two studios' merger later resulted in leadership shakeups and layoffs at CBS News.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, chief executive David Ellison welcomed the Warner Bros board's decision in favour of Paramount's sweetened offer. The proposal, he said in a statement, offers Warner Bros shareholders \"superior value, certainty and speed to closing\".\n\n\n\nIf Paramount's deal is approved by regulators, the company would fold Warner Bros' HBO Max streaming customers into its portfolio. It would also take ownership of CNN, the Food Network and a range of sports offerings.\n\n\n\nParamount's traditional networks already include brands such as Nickelodeon, CBS and Comedy Central.\n\n\n\nMany in Hollywood have viewed the bidding war between Netflix and Paramount as a battle with no good winner.\n\nCritics of a deal with Netflix voiced concern that the storied movie studio would be lost to the Silicon Valley streaming titan, paving the way for the depletion of cinema. But a merger with Paramount, which has touted itself among the last standing movie studios in Hollywood, also left critics unnerved over the company's perceived political connections to the Trump administration - a concern that has also riled the media landscape over the future of CNN.\n\n\n\nAcross the board, the selling of Warner Bros will have massive ramifications across Tinsel town, with all but assured cuts to staff in a city that has been marred by continued production cuts.\n\n\n\nIn December, Warner Bros said it had agreed to sell its film and streaming divisions, including HBO, to Netflix in a deal worth $27.75 per share or roughly $82bn (£61bn), including debt.\n\n\n\nWarner Bros said it would spin off the remainder of its business, including traditional television networks and the news channel CNN, as an independent company.\n\n\n\nBut in a last-ditch push, Paramount this week agreed to pay more for a Warner Bros takeover. The company offered $31 per share in cash, up from $30 per share, to take over the entire company.\n\n\n\nIt also agreed to pay $7bn should the deal fall through and cover the $2.8bn fee Warner Bros had agreed to pay Netflix in the event of a break-up of the merger plan."

Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "The Republican president, who has sought to expand US influence across Latin America, said of Cuba: ‘They want our help.’\n\nPresident Donald Trump has suggested the United States could take over Cuba, but on amicable terms.\n\nThe statement on Friday came as Trump was preparing to board his presidential helicopter, Marine One, on the White House lawn en route to Texas.\n\nApproaching the media scrum, Trump took questions about the tense relations the US has with countries like Iran and Cuba, two countries where he has suggested he would like to see new governments.\n\nIn Cuba’s case, Trump suggested a transition that would be “very positive for the people who were expelled or worse”.\n\n“The Cuban government is talking with us, and they’re in a big deal of trouble, as you know. They have no money. They have no anything right now, but they’re talking with us,” Trump told reporters.\n\n“And maybe we’ll have a friendly takeover of Cuba. We could very well end up having a friendly takeover of Cuba.”\n\nTrump has been pushing for regime change on the communist-led Caribbean island over the last two months, using economic and diplomatic pressure.\n\nIn Friday’s remarks, Trump reiterated his stance that Cuba is “a failing nation” teetering on collapse.\n\n“Since I’m a little boy, I’ve been hearing about Cuba, and everybody wanted to change, and I can see that happening,” Trump said.\n\nHe added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Cuban American known for his hawkish stance, is leading the initiative.\n\n“Marco Rubio is dealing on it and at a very high level, and you know, they have no money. They have no oil, they have no food, and it’s really right now a nation in deep trouble. And they want our help.”\n\n\n\nIncreasing pressure on Cuba\n\nThe US has long had strained relations with Cuba, an island just 145 kilometres, or 90 miles, from its shores. Since the 1960s, the US has imposed a full trade embargo on the island, weakening its economy.\n\nBut tensions have accelerated since January 3, when Trump authorised a military operation to abduct and imprison Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close ally of Cuba.\n\nAn estimated 32 Cuban soldiers were killed in the attack, alongside Venezuelan military personnel.\n\nIn the aftermath, Trump ratcheted up pressure against the island, publicly speculating that its government is “ready to fall”.\n\nOn January 11, he announced that no more Venezuelan oil or money would flow to Cuba. Then, on January 29, he issued an executive order threatening tariffs on any country that supplies oil directly or indirectly to the island.\n\nCuba’s energy grid largely relies on fossil fuels to generate electricity, and the United Nations has warned of the potential for an imminent humanitarian “collapse” on the island if supplies are not restored.\n\nA panel of UN human rights experts also cast doubt this month on Trump’s stated rationale that Cuba constitutes an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to US national security, due to its relations with China, Russia and other US rivals.\n\nThe fuel blockade, they explained, served primarily as “an extreme form of unilateral economic coercion” that violated international law.\n\n“There is no right under international law to impose economic penalties on third States for engaging in lawful trade with another sovereign country,” they wrote in a statement.\n\nTrump’s vision for a ‘growing nation’\n\nThe Trump administration, however, has made little secret of its desire to spread US influence, particularly in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nIn his inaugural speech in 2025, Trump pledged that the US “will once again consider itself a growing nation”, including through the expansion of its territory.\n\nSince delivering that address, Trump has proposed to “own” Gaza and “run” Venezuela, while pressuring countries like Greenland, Canada and Panama to cede sovereignty over their lands.\n\nHe has repeatedly referenced 19th-century expansionist policies like manifest destiny and the Monroe Doctrine to justify some of these efforts. He even married his personal brand to the latter, calling his plans for the Western Hemisphere the “Donroe Doctrine”.\n\nDuring his State of the Union address this week, he touted his military action in Venezuela as a success and announced that more than 80 million barrels of Venezuelan oil had been transferred into the US government’s possession.\n\n\n\n“We’re also restoring American security and dominance in the Western Hemisphere,” Trump told the crowd.\n\nThe Cuban government, however, has repeatedly denounced Trump’s campaign against the island as evidence of US imperialism.\n\nOn January 30, for instance, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel accused Trump of attempting “to strangle the Cuban economy” with the fuel blockade.\n\n“This new measure reveals the fascist, criminal, and genocidal nature of a cabal that has hijacked the interests of the American people for purely personal gain,” he wrote on social media.\n\nJust this week, Diaz-Canel’s government announced there had been a deadly shootout with a Florida-tagged speedboat close to its shores.\n\nThe US government has denied responsibility. But Cuba has described the boat as part of an “infiltration for terrorist purposes”.\n\nLoosening restrictions?\n\nAlready, there have been signs that the US might seek to ease some of the pressure on Cuba, while maintaining its stiff opposition to the island’s communist government.\n\nEarlier in February, the Trump administration announced $6m in humanitarian aid to the island, to be distributed through proxies like the Catholic Church, not the local government.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, the US Department of the Treasury revealed it would “implement a favorable licensing policy” for the resale of Venezuelan oil to Cuba, barring any transaction with the Cuban government or its military and intelligence services.\n\nCritics have argued that a humanitarian crisis in Cuba could trigger consequences for Trump, who has campaigned on cracking down on immigration and slashing government spending.\n\nCuba has seen multiple waves of migration to the US, the most recent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when nearly 2 million people fled the island due to economic instability and political repression.\n\nDiaz-Canel, meanwhile, repeated on Friday that his government would defend itself from any outside threat.\n\n“Cuba will defend itself with determination and firmness against any terrorist or mercenary aggression that seeks to undermine its sovereignty and national stability,” he said."

            "content": "Ukraine marked the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion with territorial gains in the south and improved air defences that kept the lights on in Kyiv, despite two barrages of drones and missiles during the past week.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday told the AFP that Ukrainian forces had regained 300 square kilometres (115 square miles) of territory in southern Ukraine, without specifying the time period.\n\nHis commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskii, two days later, said those southern gains were 400sq km (155 square miles), and had come since the end of January.\n\n“You can’t say that we’re losing the war … The question is whether we will win,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, attributed Kyiv’s successes to the fact that Ukraine persuaded Starlink to disconnect illegal Russian terminals in the theatre, and the fact that the Kremlin itself partly disabled the Telegram messaging service.\n\nRussian troops used both services for essential military communications, it said.\n\nAlthough limited in scale, Ukrainian counterattacks may have done enough to throw Russian preparations for a spring offensive off balance, said the ISW.\n\nOpen source intelligence suggests that Russia’s campaign has been flagging for a long time.\n\nEuropean leaders have publicly noted that over the past three years, it has seized 1.5 percent of Ukraine or less at a cost of hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\nThe battle for Pokrovsk, for example, a city in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, appears to have ended in victory for Russia in recent weeks,\n\n\n\nbut the campaign took two years for a town with a pre-war population of 60,000.\n\n“Pokrovsk was operationally significant given its use as an important logistics hub, but Russian strikes denied Ukrainian forces the ability to fully leverage the town for logistics as early as July 2025,” said the ISW. “Pokrovsk had long ceased to be an operationally significant town by the time Russian forces intensified their push to capture the town in Winter 2025.”\n\nPutin’s air campaign\n\nOn Tuesday, the fourth anniversary of Russia’s war, Zelenskyy noted that “[Russian President Vladimir] Putin understands he is not capable of defeating Ukraine on the battlefield, and the ‘second army in the world’ is fighting against apartment buildings and power plants.”\n\nHe was referring to Russia’s aerial campaign against the four-fifths of Ukraine that remain free, where he noted that “the Air Force has started performing better.”\n\nRussia attacked Ukraine during the week with just more than 1,500 drones and at least 90 missiles, but the two biggest attacks came two days before and two days after the anniversary.\n\nOn Sunday, Russia launched 197 drones and 50 missiles. Ukraine downed all but 26 drones and 31 missiles.\n\nThen, on Thursday, Russia launched 420 drones and 39 missiles. Ukraine neutralised 90 percent of the drones and 30 missiles. “We indeed managed to protect very important facilities,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nTo achieve even this success rate, Russia appears to be using all of its production capacity.\n\n“All the ballistics that come to us are made at the end of 2025 – the beginning of 2026. That is, we are actually being attacked with missiles from the factory,” said defence ministry adviser Serhiy Beskrestnov.\n\nUkraine’s Air Force said it had destroyed 3,855 long-range missiles used to target rear areas since the beginning of the war, as well as 67,000 long-range drones.\n\nUkraine strikes back\n\nUkraine has launched a strategic campaign to damage the Russian weapons and fuel supply chains. During the past week, that campaign saw significant successes.\n\nOn February 21, Ukrainian-made FP-5 “Flamingo” missiles struck the Votkinsk missile factory in Russia’s Udmurtia – about 1,200km (745 miles) from the Ukrainian border.\n\nMissile expert Fabian Hoffman said it was “the first time that Ukraine has successfully struck a core target of Russia’s missile industry directly using a heavy missile capability”.\n\n\n\nUkraine’s General Staff said the facility makes a series of ballistic missiles, including Russia’s “unstoppable” Oreshnik intermediate ballistic missile, which it has now stationed in Belarus and with which it has repeatedly threatened Europe.\n\nAt least one machine-building plant was struck, as satellite imagery later showed, though the extent of the interior damage was uncertain.\n\nThe Flamingo entered production in the second half of last year as part of an effort to increase the lethality of Ukraine’s long-range drones. It carries Ukraine’s largest warhead to date – 1,150kg (2,535 pounds) – but has been plagued by problems of accuracy.\n\n“The strike on the Votkinsk plant marks the first confirmed successful use of the Flamingo against a high-value target,” said Hoffman.\n\nOn the same day, Ukrainian drones struck the Neftogorsk Gas Processing Plant in Samara, damaging two gas condensate stabilisation plants.\n\nOn Monday, Ukraine struck the Kaleykino Oil Pumping Station in Tatarstan, described as a key facility for filling the Druzhba oil pipeline to Hungary and Slovakia.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ukraine struck a chemicals plant in Smolensk, causing explosions and fires.\n\nRussia did not mark the war’s fourth anniversary with any grand pronouncements, but Ukraine celebrated its survival.\n\n“Ukraine has come a long way – from the point when we were being given body armour to the point when we ourselves produce more than three million [first-person view] drones a year,” said Zelenskyy.\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa stood beside him.\n\nThe EU has become Ukraine’s biggest donor and supporter, sending 195 billion euros ($230bn) to date, and voting to send another 90 billion euros ($106bn) over the next two years.\n\n“Europe has stood with us throughout these difficult, really difficult years, and our people trust Europe,” said Zelenskyy."

He did not specify what those demands were, but the US has said it wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure entirely, limit its arsenal of ballistic missiles and stop supporting regional allies."

            "content": "Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi has met with United States Vice President JD Vance, amid growing fears grow of a potential US attack on Iran.\n\nAl Busaidi, a key mediator in ongoing talks between the US and Iran, met with Vance in Washington, DC on Friday. He said the nuclear negotiations have so far achieved significant, important, and unprecedented progress, according to the Oman News Agency.\n\nThe meeting focused on the indirect talks which are being mediated by Oman. American and Iranian officials held the latest round of negotiations in Geneva on Thursday.\n\nSince resuming talks last month, the US has said it wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure entirely, limit its arsenal of ballistic missiles and stop supporting regional allies. While Tehran has shown flexibility about discussing limitations on the enrichment of uranium for civilian use, it has so far treated missiles and proxies as non-negotiables.\n\nDuring his meeting with Vance, Al Busaidi said the negotiations had resulted in “creative and constructive ideas and proposals.”\n\nMiddle East tensions\n\nFriday’s meeting comes as concerns grow over a potential US military strike on Iran.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he favours a diplomatic resolution to the standoff, but has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran if it does not accept a deal. The US has amassed its biggest military arsenal in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the world’s biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, which arrived on Friday in the Israeli port city of Haifa, according to Israeli Channel 12.\n\n\n\nIran has said that it was not going to initiate a war, but that it was ready to respond if attacked, threatening to strike bases used by US forces in the region.\n\nOn Friday, the US authorised the departure of nonemergency embassy staff from Israel – the same order Washington issued for the US mission in Lebanon earlier this week.\n\nChina, Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy are amongst the growing number of countries that have urged their citizens to leave Iran in recent days."

            "content": "Trump tells reporters he would ‘love not to use’ military force against Iran but added, ‘Sometimes you have to.’\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to travel to Israel next week as President Donald Trump expresses displeasure with the ongoing negotiations with Iran.\n\nOn Friday, the US Department of State issued a notice that Rubio’s trip will run from March 2 to 3, and that its focus will be on relations with Iran and Lebanon, as well as implementing Trump’s 20-point plan for war-torn Gaza.\n\nThis will be Rubio’s fifth trip as secretary of state to Israel, a close US ally. He visited for the first time in February 2025, then in September and twice in October of last year.\n\nNo other details were provided about the latest diplomatic outing. But it comes at a delicate time for relations in the Middle East.\n\nJust this week, the US and Iran held a third round of indirect talks, this time in Switzerland, as the two sides attempt to negotiate a deal to restrict Iran’s nuclear programme.\n\nA new round of talks is slated to take place in Austria on Monday, the day Rubio arrives in Israel.\n\nStill, Trump used a public appearance on Friday on the White House lawn to voice frustration at the slow pace of negotiations.\n\n“I’m not happy with the fact that they’re not willing to give us what we have to have. I’m not thrilled with that. We’ll see what happens,” Trump said.\n\n“We’ll have some additional talks today. But no, I’m not happy with the way they’re going.”\n\nTrump added that he was not averse to using the military to accomplish his aims. “I’d love not to use it, but sometimes you have to. We’ll see what happens.”\n\n\n\nUpon his arrival in Texas, Trump added that he would not be satisfied with Iran merely reducing its enrichment of uranium, even for civilian energy projects.\n\n“I say no enrichment,” Trump told reporters. “Not 20 percent, 30 percent.”\n\nTrump’s latest comments are likely to feed ongoing fears of a military escalation with Iran, a conflict that could spill into the broader region.\n\nHis remarks coincided with an email from US Ambassador Mike Huckabee to embassy staff in Israel, giving them permission to leave the country, another signal that simmering tensions might boil over.\n\nHuckabee emphasised that those who leave “should do so TODAY”, according to media reports. He added, however, that there is “no need to panic”.\n\nA public notice from the US Embassy in Jerusalem acknowledged the authorisation to leave and cited “safety risks” due to “terrorism and civil unrest”.\n\n“Persons may wish to consider leaving Israel while commercial flights are available,” the notice said.\n\nThe State Department also issued a statement from Rubio designating Iran a “state sponsor of wrongful detention”. He also urged US citizens to not “travel to Iran for any reason” or leave immediately, if they were already there.\n\nThreat of Iran attack\n\nConcerns have been mounting, though, that the US may seek to take military action against Iran, a longtime adversary of Israel and the US.\n\nSince January, the administration of US President Donald Trump has deployed a “massive armada” to the waters near Iran, including two aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and the USS Abraham Lincoln.\n\nTrump has also hinted on several occasions that he is prepared to launch an attack, either to force a deal to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities or intervene on behalf of Iranian protesters.\n\nOn January 1, for instance, Trump responded to a deadly crackdown on antigovernment demonstrations in Iran by posting a message on Truth Social.\n\nIt said that the US military was “locked and loaded and ready to go” to “rescue” any protesters who might be killed.\n\nMore recently, during last Tuesday’s State of the Union address, Trump described his military threats as a successful tactic in stopping the execution of protesters.\n\n“We stopped them from hanging a lot of them with the threat of serious violence,” Trump said.\n\nHe added that he would not be afraid to act. “I will never hesitate to confront threats to America wherever we must,” Trump said in the primetime speech, which accused Iran of having “spread nothing but terrorism and death and hate”.\n\nOn Friday, however, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk signalled that eight protesters have nevertheless been sentenced to death, and 30 more are at risk of receiving the same penalty.\n\n\n\nTurk also warned against the possibility of military action, highlighting the risk of civilian harm.\n\n“I am extremely alarmed about the potential for regional military escalation and its impact on civilians, and I hope the voice of reason prevails,” he said.\n\nStill, the Trump administration cited human rights\n\nPushing for a deal\n\nBut the protesters have not been the only motive Trump has cited for his sabre-rattling.\n\nTrump has also indicated that military intervention may be necessary should Iran fail to agree to a nuclear deal.\n\nOn February 19, the president told reporters aboard his jet, Air Force One, that Iran had “10, 15 days, pretty much maximum” to strike a deal with US negotiators.\n\nShould it fail to, Trump indicated he would take his “maximum pressure” campaign a “step further”, appearing to imply military action.\n\n“We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen,” Trump had said earlier in the day at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace panel.\n\nIran, meanwhile, has said its position is “close” to that of the US on many issues, but it has called for the Trump administration to drop what it considers “excessive demands“.\n\nRecent reports have indicated that the US government not only wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear programme, but it also seeks to curtail its ballistic missile arsenal and sever its relations with regional allies and proxy groups, like Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nIran, however, has largely dismissed those demands as unrealistic, and it has argued that its nuclear enrichment programme is designed to produce civilian energy, not weaponry.\n\nIt has also warned of retaliation if the US proceeds with another military strike.\n\nLast June, the US bombed three Iranian nuclear sites, including the Fordow facility, as part of a 12-day war initiated by an Israeli attack. The Trump administration dubbed the campaign “Operation Midnight Hammer”.\n\nThe latest negotiations seek to mint a new nuclear deal following the collapse of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a multilateral agreement that saw Iran scale down its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nBut Trump’s decision, during his first term, to withdraw the US caused the deal to fall apart. As part of his withdrawal, Trump renewed US sanctions against Iran.\n\n‘There’s always a risk’\n\nBut the pressure on Iran has increased in recent days, particularly as media reports emerged that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, has been blocked from accessing the three sites targeted in Operation Midnight Hammer.\n\nThe agency has indicated that it cannot confirm whether Iran has suspended nuclear enrichment at the sites, nor can it estimate the size of Iran’s nuclear stockpile.\n\nThat news is likely to fuel the Trump administration’s efforts: It has long warned that Iran seeks a nuclear weapon, a claim Tehran denies.\n\nStill, the government of Oman, which is mediating the talks, issued a statement striking a positive note, following a meeting between its top diplomat and US Vice President JD Vance.\n\n\n\n“His excellency, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, clarified that the negotiations have thus far achieved significant, important and unprecedented progress, which could form the cornerstone of the desired agreement,” the statement said.\n\nIt added that Oman would continue “its efforts in supporting dialogue and facilitating rapprochement between the concerned parties” and that diplomatic efforts could resolve the impasse.\n\nStill, as Trump prepared to travel to Texas on Friday, he was asked about the prospect of a military strike sparking a wider, drawn-out regional war with Iran.\n\nHe largely shrugged off the possibility, citing successes with Operation Midnight Hammer as well as his decision to order the assassination of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020.\n\n“I guess you could say there’s always a risk. When there’s war, there’s a risk in anything, both good and bad. We’ve had tremendous luck,” Trump replied. “Everything’s worked out, and we want to keep it that way.”\n\nHe called on Iran to negotiate in “good faith and conscience”. Still, he ended with a note of scepticism: “They are not getting there.”"

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance’s merger agreement is now official. On Friday, the two companies announced plans to merge into a massive media company that will fold WBD’s studio, linear channels, streaming service, and gaming segment into Paramount.\n\nThough WBD initially signed onto an $83 billion agreement to merge part of Warner Bros. with Netflix, Paramount persisted with a hostile takeover bid, followed by a series of offers. That persistence paid off, as WBD determined that Paramount’s “best and final” offer is “superior” to Netflix’s deal. On Thursday, Netflix declined to match Paramount’s bid, calling it “no longer financially attractive.”\n\nParamount and WBD say the board of directors of both companies has signed off on the deal. The companies expect it to close in the third quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Under the agreement, Paramount will acquire WBD in a deal valued at $110 billion. Paramount has also agreed to cover the $7 billion regulatory termination fee and the $2.8 billion breakup fee owed to Netflix, which it has already paid, according to Bloomberg.\n\n“Together, Paramount and WBD will deliver greater choice for consumers through its leading streaming platforms with an exceptional intellectual property portfolio that has produced popular franchises such as Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Top Gun, the DC Universe and SpongeBob SquarePants,” the companies say in the press release.\n\nLawmakers and regulators are skeptical about the Paramount-WBD merger. “A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a statement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta also warned that the agreement isn’t a “done deal,” and that the state’s Department of Justice will be “vigorous” in its review of the merger."

            "content": "Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts, and have stopped getting a response. This week, thanks to a reader tip, we think we’ve found the original phone the T1 is based on.\n\nA long time ago, back when the Trump phone was but a single, inaccurate render and a contradictory spec sheet, we tried to figure out what other phone it might be based on. Now, eight months, two spec overhauls, and one redesign later, I have a good guess: the HTC U24 Pro.\n\nI didn’t spot this by myself. A reader first tipped me off to the similarities between the U24 Pro and the Trump phone I revealed a few weeks ago, which are numerous: a similar angled body and curved display, a unique front sensor array, and broadly similar specs, including oddities like a headphone jack and microSD card support.\n\nLet’s get one thing out the way at the top: I’m pretty sure HTC isn’t secretly building the Trump phone. Sohaib Ahmed, the company’s global director of PR, told me as much: “HTC does not design or manufacture phones for third parties.” But that doesn’t rule out another company playing a part in designing or building both phones, and given just how similar they look, I suspect that’s exactly what happened.\n\nIt’s a little hard to make out in this screenshot, but the Trump phone shares the sharply angled edges of the HTC U24 Pro. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nThe U24 Pro is an odd phone in its own right. It launched in 2024 for €549 (around $600 at the time), and was heralded in some corners as a return from the dead for HTC, despite the fact that it followed the U23 Pro a year earlier, and a string of smaller releases that targeted the Asian market. HTC, once one of the major players in the Android phone industry, had been greatly diminished ever since selling a large part of its smartphone business to Google for $1.1 billion in 2017.\n\nBoth the T1 Phone and the U24 Pro share a slightly asymmetric angular frame, jutting out into a point along every edge, with a heavily curved screen on the front. I cannot think of, nor find, another phone that is quite the same shape — even small details like the positions of the antenna lines around the power and volume buttons line up. Even more telling is the set of sensors along each phone’s top. The U24 Pro splits up its speaker grill, notification LED, and proximity sensor into three, resulting in an unusual design with a long bar, a small dot for the LED, and then a second shorter bar, at the point where the display meets the phone’s top. What looks like the same sensor design can be clearly seen on the Trump phone I was shown, though I can’t confirm that the sensors themselves are the same, or that the T1 Phone will also have a notification LED.\n\nBoth phones have near-identical sets of speakers and sensors about the front selfie camera, with headphone jack and microphone visible behind them on the top edges. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nOther details are subtler. It’s hard to tell exactly from the glimpses I got of the Trump phone, but along the top frame it certainly looks to have both a headphone jack and a microphone in the exact same positions as on the HTC device. Even having a headphone jack in the first place is evidence of the phones’ connection, given how rare the feature is in modern devices. The same can be said for the fact that both phones include a microSD card slot, sharing support for up to 1TB cards on top of a base 512GB of storage.\n\nWhile the rear cameras look completely different, which seems to scupper my theory, look again: The U24 Pro’s cameras are split into a pair close together, with a third lens lower down. The new Trump phone sets all its cameras in one mount, but they’re unevenly spaced, with a larger gap between the second and third lenses. These cameras may look totally different on the surface, but I suspect that underneath you’ll find they’re similar. And what we know of the specs matches too: Trump Mobile told me that its phone will have 50-megapixel sensors for both the main and selfie cameras, and my glimpse of its camera UI showed an ultrawide and a 2x zoom option — all of which you’ll find on the U24 Pro.\n\nThe two phones’ cameras look different at first, but the unusual lens placement might just line up. Screenshot: Dominic Preston / The Verge and Image: HTC\n\nAssuming that the two phones are essentially the same, does the U24 Pro tell us any more about what to expect from the T1? It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, matching what I’d been told about a Snapdragon 7-series chip in the Trump phone. The U24 Pro has a 6.8-inch OLED display, 60W wired charging and even wireless charging support, and an IP67 rating for dust and water protection. There’s reason to be cautious reading too much into the spec sheet, though: The U24 Pro released with a 4,600mAh battery, smaller than the 5,000mAh capacity I’ve been told will be in the Trump phone. If that spec differs, then other elements of the internals could well too — the bigger battery in particular might replace the wireless charging coils of the HTC phone.\n\nThe U24 Pro launched to middling reviews, which may not inspire much confidence in Trump Mobile’s offering. Tech Advisor gave the phone two and a half stars out of five, calling it “hard to recommend over rivals,” while Notebookcheck declared it “modern and yet out of date.” Still, it fared surprisingly well in a JerryRigEverything teardown and durability test.\n\nHe noticed, however, that this didn’t appear to be the HTC of old, lacking the sapphire crystal HTC previously used on its displays and optical image stabilization on the front camera it once pioneered. The U24 Pro and other HTC phones released in the last few years share little consistent design language, and ship with near-stock Android software. Speculation has been rife that HTC isn’t in fact manufacturing the phones internally, but had commissioned an ODM — original design manufacturer — to produce the hardware. ODMs design and manufacture phones for other companies, usually to a set of specifications provided by the consumer-facing brands, and often retain ownership of the designs, allowing them to reuse and repurpose them for other clients. I asked HTC for clarification, but the company wouldn’t confirm whether the U24 Pro was made in-house or contracted out.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that Trump Mobile, or its manufacturing partner, is simply ripping off the design of a little-known HTC device. But I think the most likely answer here is a more mundane one: HTC probably worked with some unnamed ODM to design and manufacture the U24 Pro, and Trump Mobile just happened to work with the same company. That manufacturer may have either dug out its old designs for HTC when developing the T1 Phone, or perhaps gave new life to old, unused components from HTC’s production run. Without knowing the hypothetical ODM involved, it’s hard to say for sure. Trump Mobile has previously confirmed that it’s working with a partner or partners to manufacture its phones outside the US, before their “final assembly” in Miami, but executive Don Hendrickson wouldn’t tell me the name of its manufacturer or where it’s based. I reached out to the company again for comment on this story, and received no reply.\n\nSo no, I don’t think that HTC made the Trump phone. But it does look likely that it is based, more or less, on one of that company’s phones. It remains to be seen how the T1 Phone will differ in its details, but the fact that its origins seem so closely tied to an unpopular midranger from two years ago doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the T1 Phone’s flagship credentials.\n\nGot inside information on Trump Mobile or the Trump phone?

CISA is also still without a Senate-confirmed director. Trump nominated Sean Plankey for the role last year, then renominated him in January.

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nOn Thursday morning, I attended a Q&A panel with four top Samsung smartphone executives. Until 2025, Samsung was the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer, and by association, the world’s largest maker of cameras. It’s still the second largest after Apple.\n\nSamsung handed me the microphone first. I asked:\n\nWe see a divide in society between people who want AI to do impressive things with their photos and videos, and those who don’t want AI to do anything with photos and videos because it’s eroding our ability to believe that what we have seen is real, destroying the concept of photographic evidence. Metadata tools like C2PA have utterly failed to stem the tide. Does Samsung have any new and different ideas on how to prevent AI images from taking over the world?\n\nSamsung’s four executives did not have any new and different ideas to share.\n\nI will credit Won-Joon Choi, the mobile division’s COO and R&D chief, for not dodging the question. He told the room that the erosion of reality is a problem and he wants to fix it.\n\nBut he, and other Samsung executives, suggested that the company needs to balance the desire for photographic reality with letting smartphone buyers be “more creative.” They passed the buck by suggesting it’s an industry-wide problem, one that requires a broader conversation, and suggested that Samsung has already partially solved it simply by adding a watermark to AI-generated images. A watermark that can easily be removed.\n\nGiven an opening later, an exec suggested our feelings toward AI-generated content might become more favorable in the future.\n\nHere are some of those answers.\n\n“We recognize the issue, because a lot of content is generated by AI,” Choi began. “On the one hand, people want to be more creative, so we believe we have to provide a solution so people can be more creative,” he said. “On the other hand, it’s really hard nowadays to distinguish the real photos and videos from the fake ones. I think this is a problem, we recognize that, and I think it’s a problem we have to solve at an industry level.”\n\n“The C2PA, you may view it as a failure, but it’s still enough to provide a mechanism if people want to validate that those pictures and videos are made by AI. I think we have to provide a mechanism so people can use it. I think it’s an ongoing effort throughout the industry to solve this problem,” he added.\n\n“I think if we make joint efforts to solve this problem, I believe that we should be able to do it,” he concluded.\n\nAs my colleague Jess Weatherbed wrote earlier this week, we’re starting to worry that this sort of “the industry will solve this together” rhetoric, and the C2PA itself, are substitutes for actual meaningful action.\n\nPerhaps responding to our Samsung AI slop watch reporting, Samsung America exec Dave Das also chimed in to say that the company’s still learning about how much AI is acceptable when creating its own ads. He admitted that the company has “just started utilizing some AI content in our creative, and the feedback has been pretty clear.”\n\n“We’re trying to discern what is the right place to use it, and absolutely how to be very clear about when we are using AI generated content vs naturally generated content,” Das said.\n\nBut Das still frames it as a balancing act between business priorities, not a social responsibility. “It really boils down to giving the creator choice,” he said, suggesting that Samsung’s job is to find “the right balance.”\n\nLater in the morning, KTLA-TV tech reporter Rich DeMuro felt out Samsung’s stance with a very different question. He asked whether Samsung might want to make it easier for customers to remove its AI watermark from AI-generated photos.\n\nThree screenshots taken from AI-generated Samsung ads on YouTube. More on Samsung slop watch here. Image: Samsung / The Verge\n\n“If I’m making a Christmas card with all your fun tools, do I really want that to say ‘AI-generated content?’” asked DeMuro.\n\nDrew Blackard, Samsung America’s SVP of mobile product management, took that one. He concluded by saying that “If we feel like consumers really want that ability to remove watermarks, and there are other ways to address the first point around authenticity at the same time, we’ll do both things and deliver the best of what people are wanting out of the experiences.”\n\n“At least right now, there’s enough concern from consumers around authenticity that that’s the primary thing we’ve solved for, in terms of the watermarking both in the metadata and on the photo itself. Not all services do that,” he said.\n\nBlackard also suggested we might look back one day and realize that AI-generated content isn’t such a big deal, that our perceptions might change over time, the same way perceptions changed toward user-generated content to begin with. People were concerned then with “the amount of content now flowing into the system” and how it wasn’t the professional video product they were used to, he said.\n\nI wonder if Samsung and fellow smartphone makers have considered the opposite: that perceptions of AI-generated imagery might become even less favorable after people lose their jobs in favor of cheap-to-produce AI slop, and after it becomes far easier to lie and cheat and steal in the absence of reliable recorded evidence.\n\nI wonder if they’ve considered solving this problem ”at an industry level” before they break the dam, and whether perception might turn against Samsung for helping create the flood that comes after."

Though FedEx covers the cost of duties and tariffs on a customer’s behalf when packages arrive in the US, it bills customers for the fees later on.\n\n“Our intent is straightforward: if refunds are issued to FedEx, we will issue refunds to the shippers and consumers who originally bore those charges,” FedEx says. “When that will happen and the exact process for requesting and issuing refunds will depend in part on future guidance from the government and the court.”\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court determined that the levies implemented by Trump under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) exceeded the president’s powers. Trump used this law to impose sweeping fees on imported products from China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as put “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of other countries. Days after the ruling, Trump imposed a new 10 percent tariff under the Trade Act of 1974.\n\nAlong with FedEx, over 1,000 companies, including Costco, Revlon, Bausch + Lomb, Dyson, and L’Oréal, have filed lawsuits in the US Court of International Trade in an attempt to recoup the funds that went toward Trump’s tariffs, according to NBC News and CBS."

The update is now finally rolling out to the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, making it an even better buy now that it’s on sale for $29.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target — $5 shy of its best price to date. If you want something cheaper and don’t mind waiting for the update to arrive, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Select is also on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, for $19.99 ($20 off), which is $2 more than its all-time low price.\n\nThe new Fire TV OS update makes navigating content even easier, adding tabs across the top for search, home, movies, TV shows, sports, news, and live content that pull recommendations from all of your subscriptions. Your apps now live on their own row, and you can pin up to 20 favorites instead of just six. You also get support for Alexa Plus, letting you search for specific types of content with your voice, jump to particular scenes, control compatible smart home devices, check sports scores, and more. The update also improves the remote, with a long press of the Home button opening a panel so you can quickly adjust audio or check on devices like Ring cameras.\n\nRelated Alexa Plus on the TV is made to save you from your phone\n\nThe Fire TV Stick 4K Plus is also a good streaming device on the hardware front. The middle child in the Fire TV stick lineup, it offers half the storage of the $40 Fire TV Stick 4K, but otherwise shares support for HDR10 Plus, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos. You also get an Alexa Voice Remote included, for quick access to apps and voice controls. For most people, it offers a good balance between features and price.\n\nWe’d recommend the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus overall, but if you just want a cheap and basic 4K streaming stick — maybe one for a second or third TV — the standard Fire TV Stick 4K is hard to ignore at $20. The redesigned Fire TV OS has yet to roll out to the stick, and it has half the RAM so it’s slower. It also lacks Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support, but it still supports HDR10, HDR10 Plus, and Alexa Plus while including an Alexa Voice Remote.

Anthropic is in heated negotiations with the Pentagon after refusing to comply with new military contract terms that would require it to loosen the guardrails on its AI models, allowing for “any lawful use,” even mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous lethal weapons.\n\nPentagon CTO Emil Michael is pushing for Anthropic to be designated a “supply chain risk” if it doesn’t comply, a label usually only given to national security threats. Anthropic’s rivals OpenAI and xAI have reportedly agreed to the new terms, but even after a White House meeting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei is still refusing to cross his company’s red line, stating that “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.”"

The president allowed for a six-month phase-out period for departments using the products, but emphasized that Anthropic was no longer welcome as a federal contractor.\n\n“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again,” the president wrote in the post.\n\nNotably, the post does not mention any plans to invoke the Defense Production Act or designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk. Instead, the President urged the company to be helpful during the six-month phase out period, threatening “major civil and criminal consequences” if it did not.\n\nThe dispute centered on Anthropic’s refusal to allow its AI models to be used to power either mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth found unduly restrictive.\n\nCEO Dario Amodei reiterated his stance in a public post on Thursday, refusing to compromise on the two points.\n\n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters — with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei wrote at the time. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”"

            "content": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard.

It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.\n\nTechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in example workflows on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial, or legal data; creating analysis; and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations.\n\nPerplexity invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company canceled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.\n\nThis tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.\n\nThe company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy.

The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done in Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.\n\nA visualization of model usage by Perplexity users over time. Image Credits:Perplexity\n\nIf one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.\n\nThe company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear.\n\nStill, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on user fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.\n\nAnd there is more on the horizon: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.\n\nOne executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.\n\nHowever, the execs at the briefing dismiss such complaints: “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” one said."

            "content": "A new set of main series Pokémon games is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2027, marking the 10th installment in the series.\n\nIn a livestream celebrating the release of the first Pokémon games exactly 30 years ago, the company unveiled Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves, open-world games set across a vast ocean of islands.\n\nThe three new starter Pokémon were announced as well: Browt, a Grass type “bean chick” that looks like an Angry Bird; Pombon, a Pomeranian-inspired Fire type who better not evolve into a bipedal man; and Gecqua, a Water type gecko with big pink eyes.\n\nImage Credits:The Pokémon Company\n\nLeakers have rumored that the new games are set in a region inspired by Indonesia and Southeast Asia — while the trailer doesn’t explicitly confirm this, it makes a good case for proving the rumors correct, showing us lush jungles, seaside mountains, tropical towns, and even underwater reefs. Fans have also honed in on a suspicious-looking cloud in the trailer, which looks like a Gyarados-slash-Lapras flying through the sky — perhaps it’s a nod to a new legendary Pokémon?\n\nPokémon already explored a tropical island vibe in the Hawaii-inspired “Sun and Moon” games, which came out nearly 10 years ago, but there’s still a ton to explore in that sort of setting, especially now that the franchise is embracing open-world maps. Not all tropical archipelagos are alike!\n\nMain series Pokémon games usually get released in November, which would mean that we have almost two years to wait before we can explore this new region … but hopefully we’ll be surprised. It already seems like forever ago since Pokémon Scarlet and Violet came out in 2022. But when that game came out, fans criticized it for feeling rushed and being rife with glitches. So if a later release date means we’ll get something incredible, I’m happy to wait.\n\nIn the meantime, Pokémon fans can buy reissues of the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen games today for the Switch … but they cost $20. It’s too bad that there isn’t an extremely easy and legally dubious way to get those games on your phone for free."

            "content": "The snow is melting, the days are getting longer, and I can almost smell the springtime ahead. Soon, we'll be cruising around town on ebikes and electric scooters instead of burning fossil fuels. For now, the weather hasn't quite caught up, which is great for markdowns. Many of the best electric scooters are still seeing significant discounts. If you've been thinking about buying one, now's the best time: prices are low, and sunny commuting days are just ahead.\n\nGear editor Julian Chokkattu has spent five years testing more than 45 electric scooters. These are his top picks that are also on sale right now.\n\nApollo Go for $849 ($450 Off)\n\nThis is Gear editor Julian Chokkattu's favorite scooter. The riding experience is powerful and smooth, thanks to its dual 350-watt motors and solid front and rear suspensions. The speed maxes out at 28 miles per hour (mph), which doesn't make it the fastest scooter on the market, but it has a good range. (Chokkattu is a very tall man and was able to travel 15 miles on a single charge at 15 mph.) Other Apollo features he appreciates: turn signals, a dot display, a bell, along with a headlight and an LED strip for extra visibility.\n\nApollo Phantom 2.0 for $2099 ($900 Off)\n\nThe Apollo Phantom 2.0 maxes out at 44 mph, with plenty of power from its dual 1,750-watt motors. It's a gorgeous scooter, designed with 11-inch self-healing tubeless tires and a dual-spring suspension system for a smooth riding experience. But with great power comes great weight. At 102 pounds, the Phantom 2.0 is the heaviest electric scooter Chokkattu has tested, so I would only recommend this purchase if you don't live in a walkup and/or have a garage.\n\nMore Discounted Electric Scooters"

            "content": "US President Donald Trump announced Friday that he was instructing every federal agency to “immediately cease” use of Anthropic’s AI tools. The move comes after Anthropic and top officials clashed for weeks over military applications of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump said that there would be a “six month phase out period” for agencies using Anthropic, which could allow time for further negotiations between the government and the AI startup.\n\nThe Pentagon and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Department of Defense has sought to change the terms of a deal struck with Anthropic and other companies last July to eliminate restrictions on how AI can be deployed and instead permit “all lawful use” of the technology. Anthropic objected to the change, claiming that it could allow AI to be used to fully control lethal autonomous weapons or to conduct mass surveillance on US citizens.\n\nThe Pentagon does not currently use AI in these ways, and has said it has no plans to do so. However, top Trump administration officials have voiced opposition to the idea of a civilian tech company dictating military use of such an important technology.\n\nAnthropic was the first major AI lab to work with the US military, through a $200 million deal signed with the Pentagon last year. It created several custom models known as Claude Gov that have fewer restrictions than its regular ones. Google, OpenAI, and xAI signed similar deals around the same time, but Anthropic is the only AI company currently working with classified systems."

Right now, both Amazon and Best Buy have the 2024 Roku Ultra discounted to $80, a $20 break from the usual price. It sports dual-band Wi-Fi and Ethernet for a more consistent connection, support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and the remote has a headphone port.\n\nWhile there are a ton of great Roku streaming devices to choose from, the Ultra stands out for a few reasons. Streaming in 4K requires a huge amount of bandwidth, and some wireless networks just aren't up to the task, particularly if your TV isn't near your router. A true dual-band Wi-Fi setup in the Roku Ultra helps ensure a stutter-free experience on all of your favorite streaming services. If you really hate buffering and dropped connections, there's an Ethernet port around back for a wired hookup, something most other streaming devices can't claim.\n\nAnother nice upgrade you get with your Roku Ultra kit is the remote, which includes a built-in 3.5-mm headphone jack. That's perfect if you like to sneak in a few episodes of your favorite show after everyone's gone to bed, or want to catch a movie without waking a sleeping baby. The Roku Ultra even includes a pair of earbuds you can use right out of the box, which are surprisingly good for what they are, and they include extra ear tips for getting the fit right.\n\nLike some of the other premium Roku streaming devices, the hands-free voice controls make it super easy to find what you're looking for. Rather than dig through all of your apps and services looking for a movie, you can just say the title into the remote and let Roku go and find it for you.\n\nIf you're ready to take your 4K streaming to the next level, both Best Buy and Amazon have the Roku Ultra marked down to $80. We also have a great guide that breaks down the differences between all of the available Roku streamers, and a roundup of our favorite media streamers, in case you're wondering what the Roku alternatives look like."

            "content": "A few months ago, a family came into Pasadena Cyclery in Pasadena, California, for a repair on what they thought was their teenager’s ebike. “I can’t fix that here,’ Daniel Purnell, a store manager and technician, remembers telling them. “That’s a motorcycle.” The mother got upset. She didn’t realize that what she thought was an ebike could go much faster, perhaps up to 55 miles per hour.\n\n“There’s definitely an education problem,” Purnell says. In California, bike advocates are pushing a new bill designed to clear up that confusion around what counts as an electric bicycle—and what doesn’t.\n\nIt’s a tricky balance. On one hand, backers want to allow riders access to new, faster, and more affordable non-car transportation options, ones that don’t require licenses and are emission-free. On the other hand, people, and especially kids, seem to be getting hurt. Ebike-related injuries jumped more than 1,020 percent nationwide between 2020 and 2024, according to hospital data, though it’s not clear if the stats-keepers can routinely distinguish between ebikes and their faster, “e-moto” cousins. (Moped and powered-assisted cycle injuries jumped 67 percent in that same period.)\n\n“We’re overdue to have better ebike regulation,” says California state senator Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat who sponsored the bill and represents parts of North County in San Diego. “This has been an ongoing and growing issue for years.”\n\nSenate Bill 1167 would make it illegal for retailers to label higher-powered, electric-powered vehicles as ebikes. It would clarify that ebikes have fully operative pedals and electric motors that don’t exceed 750 watts, enough to hit top speeds between 20 and 28 mph."

The employee, she said, “used confidential OpenAI information in connection with external prediction markets (e.g. Polymarket).”\n\n“Our policies prohibit employees from using confidential OpenAI information for personal gain, including in prediction markets,” says spokesperson Kayla Wood. OpenAI has not revealed the name of the employee or the specifics of their trades.\n\nEvidence suggests that this was not an isolated event. Polymarket runs on the Polygon blockchain network, so its trading ledger is pseudonymous but traceable. According to an analysis by the financial data platform Unusual Whales, there have been clusters of activities, which the service flagged as suspicious, around OpenAI-themed events since March 2023.\n\nUnusual Whales flagged 77 positions in 60 wallet addresses as suspected insider trades, looking at the age of the account, trading history, and significance of investment, among other factors. Suspicious trades hinged on the release dates of products like Sora, GPT-5, and the ChatGPT Browser, as well as CEO Sam Altman’s employment status. In November 2023, two days after Altman was dramatically ousted from the company, a new wallet placed a significant bet that he would return, netting over $16,000 in profits. The account never placed another bet.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former tech worker who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you.

In the 40 hours before OpenAI launched its browser, 13 brand-new wallets with zero trading history appeared on the site for the first time to collectively bet $309,486 on the right outcome,” says Unusual Whales CEO Matt Saincome. “When you see that many fresh wallets making the same bet at the same time, it raises a real question about whether the secret is getting out.”"

A looming Paramount Skydance merger with Warner Bros. Discovery would expand their empire even further.\n\nNow that Netflix has backed out of its bid to acquire WBD, the Ellisons stand to gain an entirely new trove of significant intellectual property, from DC Comics to Harry Potter. According to Reuters, Warner Bros. agreed to be acquired by Paramount Skydance in a $110 billion deal signed Friday, with Paramount Skydance agreeing to pay a $7 billion termination fee if federal regulators don’t approve the merger.\n\nParamount’s merger with Skydance has already brought about mass layoffs, including at CBS News, where Free Press founder Bari Weiss is leading a cultural overhaul as editor in chief. In January, Oracle became a partial owner of TikTok, giving the Ellisons even more cultural currency.\n\nHere’s everything the family would control if the WBD deal goes through.\n\nCBS and CBS News\n\nBesides its news division, which includes 60 Minutes, CBS is also home to hits like Tracker and Matlock, along with reality stalwarts Survivor and Big Brother.\n\nHBO and HBO Max\n\nAmong the most Emmy-winningest networks to exist, HBO’s library includes classics like Game of Thrones, The Wire, and Veep, as well as newer hits like The Pitt, The Gilded Age, and Thrones spin-off A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. (Outside of Canada, HBO Max is also a key distributor of the hockey smut drama Heated Rivalry.)\n\nCNN\n\nWhile CNN’s ratings dipped last year, it remains a news juggernaut and a top 5 cable network, featuring household names like John King, Kaitlan Collins, and Anderson Cooper (who recently announced he will be leaving 60 Minutes at the end of the current season).\n\nDC Comics\n\nThe merger would put Paramount Skydance in control of storied comic book franchises like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nThe wizarding world of Harry Potter, including all eight fantasy films and the upcoming HBO television series slated to premiere in 2027 would also be under the Ellisons’ purview.\n\nTikTok\n\nAs of a deal finalized in January, Oracle now holds a 15 percent stake in TikTok’s US operations.\n\nStar Trek\n\nAll 13 Star Trek movies and television shows are owned by Paramount Skydance. At a press event last year, Dana Goldberg, cochair of Paramount Pictures and chair of Paramount Television, said the franchise would be a “priority across the company.”\n\nWarner Bros. Studios\n\nHome to blockbusters like Barbie, The Dark Knight, and more recently, One Battle After Another and Sinners.\n\nComedy Central\n\nSouth Park announced a five-year, $1.5 billion deal with Paramount last July, just prior to the merger with Skydance. The show has since skewered Donald Trump and those in his administration regularly.\n\nAvatar Studios\n\nIn December, Paramount+ announced it would be the exclusive streamer of Avatar Studios content, including animated film The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender and series Avatar: Seven Havens.\n\nA Bunch of Cable Channels and Networks\n\nThe Food Network, HGTV, Discovery, TLC, OWN, Adult Swim, Showtime, TNT, and TBS are all part of WBD.\n\nOther Key Franchises\n\nOther notable titles that are or would be controlled by the Ellisons, pending the WBD takeover, include: The Lord of the Rings franchise, the Mission Impossible franchise, and the distribution rights to Dune: Part Three.\n\n2/27/26, 2:34 PM EDT: WIRED updated details about Paramount Skydance's deal with Warner Bros.

            "content": "Before last week the name Alap Shah didn’t ring a bell for many people. The 45-year-old financial analyst and tech entrepreneur had spent the past two decades working in relative obscurity. Then last weekend he coauthored a blog with the research firm Citrini titled “The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis.” It was a “thought exercise” about the impacts of artificial intelligence, and it predicted that in June of that year, AI would jack up unemployment past 10 percent and force the Dow down, down, down. Writing in a confident, Nostradamic tone—as if auditioning for starring roles in the next Michael Lewis book—the authors painted a picture of a flywheel in reverse: AI agents take jobs from workers, people spend less, and struggling corporations conduct layoffs on top of layoffs.\n\nThere wasn’t much in it that hadn’t been previously heard, or speculated about. Tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have already estimated that half the entry level white collar jobs will soon be gone, and earlier this year, Anthropic’s release of new agentic tools spurred a Wall Street selloff. Nonetheless the report hit with the force of the blizzard blowing through lower Manhattan. When the closing chimes sounded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow was down 800 points. The name Alap Shah was now ringing bells.\n\nThe achievement is less impressive than it seems. Wall Street, like the rest of us, is in a persistent state of anxiety about AI, and it doesn’t take much to trigger a mini-panic. Financial markets don’t necessarily map to reality, but the jitters reflect a wider disquiet. The AI future is in a William Gibson zone—it’s here, but unevenly distributed—and the news from those already living in the agent-packed, AI code-writing universe is both exciting and unsettling. Emphasis on unsettling.\n\nNo one—no one!—knows exactly how AI will impact the economy, but clearly it will be significant. Right now stocks are soaring, so it seems to make sense to keep the party going. But then along comes the latest doom manifesto, or a paper indicating that a traditional business sector might be threatened by AI, and suddenly money managers are reminded that the biggest issue of our time is totally unresolved. Case in point: earlier this month, a tiny company (valuation under $6 million) that had previously sold karaoke machines pivoted to AI-powered shipping logistics and put out a report saying that it had discovered some efficiencies in loading semi-trucks. That was enough to erase billions of dollars from the share prices of several major logistics companies, none of which had karaoke experience.\n\nAfter it did its job on Wall Street, the Citrini report came under considerable fire. Critics climbed over each other to proclaim its flimsiness. For one thing, they pointed out, AI has had very little discernable impact on the economy so far. Others cited the long history of resilience after technological upheavals. A mocking response by the respected trading firm Citadel Securities read, “For AI to produce a sustained negative demand shock, the economy must see a material acceleration in adoption, experience near-total labor substitution, no fiscal response, negligible investment absorption, and unconstrained scaling of compute.”\n\nThe most withering critiques disputed the report’s contention that much of the economy involves non-productive “rent-seeking” by middlemen and market makers, taking advantage of the laziness of the general population. When everyone has a few dozen AI agents working on their behalf, writes Shah, consumers will be able to effortlessly find the best goods for the best prices. Apps will be rendered unnecessary—just type what you want into the LLM and an army of agents will do everything for you. The “poster child” for this phenomenon, Shah says, is DoorDash. Instead of being limited to the restaurants on the app, consumers will send out AI agents to find their ideal meal options, contracting directly with restaurants and delivery people—no apps needed. Zero friction! The DoorDashes of the world are avocado toast!"

            "content": "Belt-drive bikes offer some huge upsides. First, they usually require less maintenance, with many belts often lasting twice as long as a typical chain. Second, there’s no grease to speak of, and therefore, no black smudges on your work pants. Third, in the case of the Soltera 3, the belt comes from the Gates brand, whose drivetrain belts are as good as it gets. Belt-drive bikes are silent and often smoother than their chain-driven counterparts.\n\nThat said, the inclusion of a low-maintenance element such as a belt drive paired with hydraulic disc brakes, which require bleeding roughly every year, struck me as an odd choice. If Aventon wanted to make the Soltera 3 as hands-off as possible, cable-actuated brakes would have been a more intuitive choice.\n\nThe other thing that immediately jumps out about the Soltera 3 is its relatively light weight. At 37 pounds, the Soltera 3 is heavy for an analog bike. But it’s certainly not heavy for an ebike, and it’s nearly as stiff, nimble, and navigable as a conventional bicycle. One issue I’ve always had with ebikes is their heft. Given that they’re often made to replace a car, they’re built with load bearing in mind. Also, ebike batteries are heavy.\n\nAdding to that sense of “this is just like my other bikes,” the Soltera 3 simply looks cool, which is often not the case when it comes to ebikes. The matte black my tester bike arrived in looks cool because matte black almost never doesn’t look cool. (Additionally, the Soltera 3 is available in dark matte blue and a sleek silver.) But beyond the finish, the bike’s geometry; its wide, almost perfectly flat handlebars; and its narrow (by ebike standards) 700 x 36 tires make it feel closer in DNA to a road bike than a traditional ebike.\n\nButton Press\n\nPhotograph: Michael Venutolo-Mantovani\n\nI’m 6′4′′, and the extra large Soltera 3 that I tested was at a maximum saddle height. It was suitable for me, but I couldn’t recommend anyone bigger than me riding the Soltera 3. That said, with four sizes ranging from small to extra large, the line covers a wide swath of riders, ranging from my height all the way down to 5′ tall."

            "content": "President Donald Trump on Friday called for US federal agencies to stop using Anthropic's Claude AI after the company refused to grant the Department of Defense permission to use it for mass domestic surveillance or for fully autonomous weapons systems.\n\nThe president posted on the Truth Social platform, which he owns, that he is ordering the federal government to \"IMMEDIATELY CEASE\" use of Anthropic's tools, saying there would be a six-month phaseout for agencies like the Department of Defense. He also decried Anthropic as a \"RADICAL LEFT, WOKE COMPANY.\" The post signaled the latest step in a showdown that escalated significantly this week between Anthropic and the federal government.\n\nClaude is widely used across the Pentagon, including in classified systems, but the Trump administration has sought to use the technology for \"any lawful purpose.\" Anthropic has insisted in its existing contract that the technology not be used for mass surveillance of Americans or in autonomous offensive weapons systems without human input.\n\nEarlier this week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei that he would invoke seldom-used powers to either force Anthropic to let the Pentagon use Claude for any lawful purpose or label the company a supply chain risk -- jeopardizing its use by the government or defense contractors. Hegseth gave Anthropic a Friday deadline to comply.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a statement that the company, which was founded with a stated focus on AI safety, \"cannot in good conscience accede to [the Pentagon's] request\" that it remove contract provisions stating Claude cannot be used in fully autonomous weapons systems or for domestic surveillance.\n\n\n\nWorries about AI and mass surveillance\n\nAmodei raised concerns that the law has not caught up with the potential for mass surveillance of Americans. The government can already buy information like Americans' browsing history and records of individual movements without a warrant, but artificial intelligence raises the stakes. \"Powerful AI makes it possible to assemble this scattered, individually innocuous data into a comprehensive picture of any person's life -- automatically and at massive scale,\" he wrote.\n\nMichael Pastor, dean for technology law programs at New York Law School, said in an email that it's typical in contract law for those involved to seek clarity on terms. \"Anthropic is right to press hard on what 'for lawful purposes' means,\" he said. \"If the Pentagon is unwilling to clarify whether it would use Anthropic's technology for mass domestic surveillance, that raises flags Anthropic seems justified in waving.\"\n\nAnthropic's Claude is reportedly the most widely used AI system by the US military. Alternatives could include tools from OpenAI, Google or Elon Musk's xAI.\n\nIn an internal memo reported by The Wall Street Journal Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly told employees that the company has the same red lines as Anthropic -- no mass domestic surveillance or autonomous offensive weapons. Altman said he believed those guardrails could be managed through technical requirements, such as requiring models to be deployed in the cloud. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\n\nEmployees of Google and OpenAI circulated a petition calling for their companies to stand with Anthropic in refusing to allow the use of AI models for domestic mass surveillance or fully autonomous lethal weapons systems. The petition said the Pentagon is \"trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in. That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.\"\n\nJust as in consumer technology, artificial intelligence systems have seen widespread adoption in government and military cases. These tools have seen their capabilities grow significantly just in the past few years, and that pace of change has not slowed. Regulation and oversight of AI haven't kept up. AI has magnified the potential harms of corporate or government surveillance by making it easier and cheaper.\n\nPastor said this dispute could have significant ramifications for what leverage governments and tech companies have against each other when their views on the appropriate use of technology clash. \"Anthropic may feel that yielding here opens a Pandora's box of uses for which Claude could be deployed,\" he said."

            "content": "NASA is shaking up its Artemis program in a big way. The space agency held a press conference on Friday to discuss the continued delays of the Artemis II mission and address various changes to the program, which should help reduce the long waits between launches.\n\nIn light of multiple Artemis II delays, NASA believes putting humans back on the moon with Artemis III is too ambitious. It's now delaying a moon landing until Artemis IV.\n\nThe Artemis II mission had been scheduled for launch in February but was pushed back after NASA's SLS rocket failed its first wet dress rehearsal due to a hydrogen and helium fuel leak. The second test run was more successful, but NASA again delayed the launch due to \"helium flow\" issues discovered after the test, which required the rocket to return to the hangar for additional repairs.\n\nThe new launch date for Artemis II is no earlier than April 1.\n\nSpeeding up the Artemis missions\n\nAccording to NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman, the Artemis II delay stems from the SLS rocket's extended launch cadence. Isaacman told reporters on Friday that after three years, skills can \"atrophy,\" and that asking personnel to stick around for years for the next launch is not tenable.\n\nThe key to more successful launches is to simply launch more frequently, he said.\n\n\"Launching a rocket as complex as the SLS every three years is not a path to success,\" Isaacman said during the press conference. \"When you are experiencing some of the same issues between launches, you take a close look at your process for remediation, whether you're getting the true technical root cause, or are you getting close to it.\"\n\nFor now, NASA is making changes to the agency and the Artemis missions, including shaking up personnel, standardizing the SLS rocket so it can launch more often and getting \"back to the basics\" to launch missions faster.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to have missions ready to launch every 10 months rather than every three years.\n\nWhen will each Artemis mission launch now?\n\nNASA still intends to put astronauts on the moon by 2028. Here is the new launch schedule for the Artemis missions:\n\nArtemis II: Will launch no earlier than April 1, 2026, and will send astronauts around the moon to conduct tests.\n\nArtemis III: Scheduled launch is mid-2027 to perform tests, connecting with lunar landers in low Earth orbit and testing gear that will go on Artemis IV.\n\nArtemis IV: Scheduled launch is early 2028, and it will send humans back to the moon.\n\nArtemis V: Could launch in late 2028 and send humans to the moon again. If Artemis III and IV are delayed, however, Artemis V will launch in 2029.\n\nWhat will Artemis III do now?\n\nNow that it's no longer set to be the moon-landing mission, the new goal of Artemis III is to launch into low-Earth orbit, rendezvous with NASA's lunar landers, perform tests and learn more about the effects of microgravity on lunar suits.\n\nPer Isaacman, this is in response to concerns raised by NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel that the gap in mission objectives between Artemis II and Artemis III was too great, posing a risk to astronauts. The extra test flight will give NASA more data to better protect astronauts when they do go to the moon.\n\n\"We did not just jump to Apollo 11, we did it through Mercury, Gemini and lots of Apollo missions with a launch cadence (of) every three months,\" Isaacman told reporters.\n\nThese discussions have been going on behind closed doors for quite some time, and NASA says that Congress and its commercial partners, like Boeing, are all-in on the new plan.\n\n\"As NASA lays out an accelerated launch schedule, our workforce and supply chain are prepared to meet the increased production needs,\" said Steve Parker, Boeing's defense, space and security president and CEO."

            "content": "As a fashion lover who's always hunting for outfit inspo, I've spent more hours than I care to admit trying to track down the exact pieces from a TV scene or red carpet look. So when Samsung unveiled an upgraded version of Circle to Search at its Galaxy Unpacked event in San Francisco that can identify multiple items from a single image, I made a beeline for the Galaxy S26 demo area to try it myself.\n\nCircle to Search, which first appeared on the Galaxy S24 phones and then expanded to other devices as Google Lens, felt like magic: Circle anything on your screen and get instant results. The AI-powered visual search tool can identify objects, translate text and surface contextual results without ever leaving the app you're on.\n\nNow it's gotten even smarter, and broader: Google says it's now also on Pixel 10 devices.\n\nAndroid's Circle to Search feature originally launched on Samsung Galaxy S24 and Pixel 8 phones in January 2024. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nInstead of just identifying a single item, it can recognize and surface information about multiple things you've presented it with, including an entire outfit. The feature can be used for just about everything, from identifying bird species to translating text, but Samsung says fashion and shopping are hands-down the most popular use case.\n\nSo of course I had to put it to the test by having it scan my outfit -- and I was genuinely floored. In the crowded event space under harsh lighting, I was skeptical it could deliver. It did.\n\nFirst, it pulled up an AI summary describing the scene: \"The look features a vibrant blue structured blazer, white top, dark fitted leggings and classic black leather boots.\" Right below that, I pressed the \"Find the look\" button and watched it do its magic.\n\nWithin seconds, I was staring at the exact same in-your-face cerulean blazer I was wearing, with a link to the online store I'd bought it from, along with a slew of strikingly similar shopping options ranging from upscale alternatives to budget-friendly picks. This level of stalking would've taken me at least 20 minutes to lock down.\n\nWatch this: Samsung Unpacked 2026: The Future of AI Has Arrived (Highlights) 10:34\n\nScrolling down revealed the same for my glossy black leggings. Despite being from many seasons ago and not available anymore, it returned convincing dupes from different retailers. It did the same for my decade-old knee-high boots and even pulled up a used pair from Postmark; a nod at the fact that mine are old AF. The only thing it failed to surface was the shirt I was wearing under the blazer that was clearly visible in the shot. Maybe layers is the next frontier for Circle to Search.\n\nSurprisingly, the hardest part of the process was figuring out how to use the feature. I had to ask a Samsung employee to take a full-body picture of me. Once I had it on the screen, I long-pressed on the home button at the bottom of the screen, which triggered a Google overlay. I then had to circle myself from head to toe. It's the kind of feature I'd program on an action button if I could -- although my wallet would likely suffer the consequences.\n\nIn doing this, Samsung and Google have virtually removed the friction between liking someone's outfit, and pressing the trigger on buying it. It wasn't that long ago that the closest alternative involved screenshotting a look, posting it to Pinterest and attempting to track down similar pieces. This is faster, cleaner and almost dangerously good for fashion lovers like me.\n\nIf this gets any better, Samsung may need to add a few guardrails for those of us prone to a little too much impulse shopping."
