T&Cs apply. gambleaware.org.\n\nCredit: THE SUN\n\nA blockbuster clash awaits as London rivals Arsenal and Chelsea meet in the Premier League at the Emirates on Sunday afternoon.\n\nSunSport betting experts have previewed the contest and selected the best bets, tips and exclusive sign-up bonuses from our leading betting partners.\n\n\n\nFind The Sun’s betting publishing principles here\n\nArsenal vs Chelsea preview\n\nNot another one! Yes, Arsenal and Chelsea meet again for the fourth time in 91 days – this time back in the Premier League with a huge amount at stake.\n\n\n\nLeaders Arsenal enter the weekend with a five-point advantage over title rivals Manchester City, who boast a crucial game in hand.\n\nMany thought that cushion would evaporate last weekend, but ‘Dr Tottenham’ lent a helping hand to restore Arsenal’s mojo following their disappointing 2-2 draw with Wolves at Molineux.\n\nThe Gunners fired four past their London rivals that afternoon and will fancy their chances of collecting maximum points against another local opponent this weekend.\n\nArsenal have won their last three home league games against Chelsea, while the Blues are winless in their last eight Premier League meetings with the Gunners – their longest such run since a stretch of 19 between 1995 and 2005.\n\n\n\nIn his second game in charge of Arsenal in December 2019, Mikel Arteta lost 2-1 at the Emirates to Chelsea. Since then, his side have lost just one of 15 matches against the Blues in all competitions (W10 D4), beating them twice in the Carabao Cup semi-final earlier this year.\n\nAs for the visitors, their fortunes have been mixed of late.\n\nFollowing a run of five wins on the spin, they’ve drawn their last two top-flight outings against Leeds and, inexplicably, Burnley – the latter conceding in stoppage time last week.\n\nThose results have seen them slip out of the top four, with Liverpool now breathing down their necks. A return to winning ways is therefore paramount, but hopes aren’t high given their recent record against Arsenal and the fact they’ve lost eight of their last nine away Premier League matches against sides starting the day top of the table.\n\n\n\nArsenal vs Chelsea preview betting odds\n\nArsenal 3/5 with Spreadex – CLAIM HERE\n\nDraw 14/5 with Midnite – CLAIM HERE\n\nChelsea 9/2 with BetMGM – CLAIM HERE\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publication and are subject to change.\n\nHow to claim £30 welcome bonus Midnite offer Download the Midnite app or create an account online HERE*\n\nRegister using the code: BETGET30\n\nDeposit a minimum of £10\n\nPlace a £10 sportsbook bet at minimum odds of 1/1\n\nFree Bets will be credited upon settlement of your qualifying bet Midnite: Get £30 in football free bets\n\nArsenal vs Chelsea preview betting tips and predictions\n\nGoalscorer\n\nWe’re backing Arsenal star Eberechi Eze to continue his goalscoring run, priced at 23/10 to score anytime with Betfair.\n\nThe attacking midfielder, 27, appears to have worked his way back into Mikel Arteta’s good books, registering four goal involvements in his last two starts (two goals, two assists).\n\nWhile he clearly enjoys facing Tottenham, his record extends across London derbies. Eze has scored each of his last 11 Premier League goals in London, with all six of his Arsenal strikes this season coming in London derbies.\n\nEberechi Eze to score at 23/10 with Betfair – CLAIM HERE\n\nFirst goalscorer and correct score predictions Arsenal vs Chelsea First goalscorer: Viktor Gyokeres at 4/1 with Midnite – CLAIM HERE Correct score: 2-1 at 7/1 with Betfred – CLAIM HERE\n\nCarded\n\nEnzo Fernandez has gone five games without a booking, which must be some kind of record for the Argentine. But we think that cardless streak ends here, priced at 5/2 with Betfair.\n\n\n\nFernandez has committed seven fouls and won 10 across his last six league outings for Chelsea, picking up one booking in that period. He’s accumulated nine cautions in total this season, five of which have come on the road.

            "content": "THE KINGS of London derbies face another challenger to their crown on Sunday – but the stats show that Arsenal should once again have the better of Chelsea.\n\nThe Gunners have only lost one of their last TWENTY-FIVE London derbies in the Premier League, winning 18 and drawing six, with the solitary defeat coming at home to West Ham last February.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, in their last 44 derbies in the competition, the Gunners have scored in 42, with the Hammers the only side to prevent them from scoring in that run, with a 2-0 win in December 2023 and last February’s 1-0 success.\n\nAnd against the Blues, their record is also phenomenal, with Mikel Arteta losing just two of his 16 games in all competitions against the West London side.\n\nThe first of those losses came in his second game in charge of the Gunners in December 2019, and the other a 2-0 loss at the Emirates in August 2021, when Romelu Lukaku and Reece James were on target.\n\nThe current run of eight Prem games without a win against the Gunners (D3, L5) is their longest since the pre-Jose Mourinho days, when the Blues – not the force they would become – went 19 matches and TEN YEARS without victory from May 1995 until August 2005.\n\n\n\nIt even took Mourinho three attempts to beat the Gunners in the league when he arrived in 2004, with Didier Drogba’s strike ending their long run without a win.\n\nThe omens just keep getting worse for the Blues when you factor in that the two sides have already met in 2026, with the Gunners winning both legs of their Carabao Cup semi-final tie – 3-2 at Stamford Bridge and 1-0 in the return.\n\nThose games are the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered so far in his Blues reign, winning eight and drawing two of the other 10.\n\nBut the Blues boss has made a positive start in the league, winning both of his first two away matches at the helm.\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nAnd he could be the first English manager to win his first three on the road in the league for 12 years, since Tim Sherwood enjoyed wins at Southampton, Manchester United and Swansea in December 2013 and January 2014 as Tottenham manager.\n\nThey also do not have a good record when playing sides at the top of the table – losing eight of their last nine away from home, the exception a 2-1 win at Manchester City in May 2021.\n\nThey have travelled to face Arsenal nine times in the top flight when the Gunners have been in top spot, winning just once in March 1948.\n\nAnd the Blues’ discipline has been called into question after Wesley Fofana’s red card against Burnley last weekend, which was their sixth in the league this season – the most of any side and already their joint-most in a Prem campaign.\n\nMoises Caicedo was sent off when the sides met earlier this season, the seventh time a Chelsea player has been red carded against Arsenal – only against Liverpool (eight) do they have more.\n\n\n\nAnd that could be one of the reasons why the Blues have found it tough to hold on to a lead, dropping a whopping NINETEEN points from leading positions in the Prem.\n\nOnly West Ham (20) have done so more, although it’s much more of a problem at home for Chelsea, having dropped 17 of those points at Stamford Bridge, including in their last two games where they were pegged back by Leeds and then Burnley.\n\nThe Blues must also be wary of Eberechi Eze, who netted twice in Arsenal’s 4-1 win at North London rivals Tottenham last weekend.\n\nEach of his last 11 Prem goals – five for Crystal Palace and all six so far for Arsenal – have been scored in London.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nAnd those six in red have all come in London derbies too, one against his former club and five against Spurs.\n\n\n\nThe last Gunners player to net more than six London derby goals in a season was Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in 2018-19 (seven), while no player has ever scored more in a season without scoring outside of a London derby."

Cole's two former clubs will meet on Sunday with Arsenal chasing the title and Chelsea looking to gain an advantage in the race for the Champions League spots.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCole, now 45, claimed Arsenal reneged on a contract agreement. The ex-defender ultimately made the controversial move to Chelsea for £5million in 2006, with Blues defender William Gallas going the other way.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe transfer led a section of the Arsenal support to believe the switch was fuelled by money. That theory was given ammunition after Cole notoriously revealed in his autobiography that Arsenal's new contract offer of £55,000 per week left him \"trembling with anger\", so much so that he almost steered his car off the road in disbelief.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\nHowever, speaking on That Peter Crouch Podcast in January 2025, Cole claimed it was Arsenal's failure to honour a higher salary they allegedly had agreed upon.\n\n\"My situation was I knew what I was worth,\" he said. \"If you don't want to pay it, no problem. But we did agree to pay it. Everything was agreed and then they pulled the rug [from] under me. They broke their promise - I couldn't tell you why.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLiam Rosenior blasts Chelsea stars after Burnley slip-up as two familiar failings return READ MORE :\n\nBack in 2005, Cole infamously met with Chelsea's then-manager Jose Mourinho and club chief executive Peter Kenyon in a London hotel, without informing Arsenal. The incident resulted in a £100,000 penalty for Cole, which was later lessened to £75,000 upon appeal by the Premier League with the low-key encounter branded as a 'tapping-up' affair.\n\nWhen Arsenal and Chelsea met in December 2006, pockets of the Arsenal support escalated their anger toward Cole by waving fake £20 notes bearing his image. They also slapped him with the moniker of \"Cashley\" - yet Cole said he understood their frustrations.\n\n\"It was hard [to leave],\" he said. \"People [don't] understand the pressure that I was under to leave or to stay,\" he said. \"Ultimately I felt disrespected, this is my point of view, I felt disrespected.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Ashley Cole left Arsenal to the dismay of the fans (Image: Phil Cole /Allsport via Getty Images)\n\n\"It is what it is, but sometimes when I speak to fans [and they say], 'You left, you hurt me', I'm like, 'Hold up'. People don't realise that I was the one who got hurt the most. That was my boyhood club, I'd been living the dream. But I got shafted.\"\n\nCole has maintained that his departure was not motivated by a desire for more money, but rather a search for respect that he believed was owed to him.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't that I felt I wasn't getting looked after because I was a young player,\" he added. \"I didn't ask for [Thierry] Henry's or [Patrick] Vieira's [wages]. I didn't want that. I was nothing to do with them. I just knew what I was worth and they broke their promise.\n\n\"I look back and I was bitter. In my head I was going, 'You put me through some s***'. And they just went like, 'Ash, you deal with it, and it's nothing to do with us'. And I'm whatever age I was, 23, and I'm like, 'You knew what happened'.\n\n\"I think [former Arsenal vice-chairman] David Dein came out and mentioned something recently. But it took him like 20 years. For 20 years I got abused. I don't blame fans [though]. I understand their frustration. They didn't know the full facts, they didn't know the truth.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Ashley Cole claims he nearly crashed his car after hearing Arsenal's wage offer before signing for Chelsea (Image: Chelsea FC via Getty Images)\n\nCole's contentious transfer to Chelsea ultimately paid off. Over his eight-year spell with the Blues, he racked up more than 330 appearances and claimed numerous titles, including the Premier League, Champions League, and four FA Cups.\n\nArsenal, on the other hand, won just one FA Cup during that time. Speaking on ITV's Play To the Whistle in 2017, Cole stated that he had no regrets about making the move to Chelsea.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

Asked if he elicited much joy out of Arsenal's lack of success after he left he added: \"If I'm honest, yeah - I still think to this day. I laugh to myself. I had a lot of history there and I think the way I left was maybe a bit dodgy but the lack of respect they showed me as well.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The Eagles' form has nosedived since the Austrian confirmed he would be leaving the south Londoners in an explosive press conference in January.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd while actions generally speak louder than words, the manner in which Glasner has unleashed further questionable verbal volleys since then - including digs at Steve Parish and the Palace fans - are not particularly enticing for any potential suitors, least of all United, who went through a similar experience with Amorim towards the end of his underwhelming reign.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

Whether that will be enough to land him the top job at the Theatre of Dreams permanently is another question.\n\nBut even if that particular boat has sailed for Glasner, the opportunity to outwit Carrick at Old Trafford is still a hugely significant one.\n\nView 3 Images Glasner hasn't held back with some of his comments in recent weeks (Image: PA)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPart of the reason why is that if Carrick carries on in this vein, then he is likely to be in the conversation for other big Premier League jobs in a summer where a flurry of managerial movement is already guaranteed.\n\nAnd with that in mind, It wouldn't be a total surprise if he and Glasner ended up in direct competition for jobs - even if not for the Manchester United one.\n\nGlasner has been linked with a number of bigger clubs since guiding Crystal Palace to victory in the FA Cup final last year; while he and Palace have endured a turbulent period, he is still the same coach who was viewed as an astute fit to take the squad Amorim assembled forward after enjoying significant success with a back three at Selhurst Park.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Michael Carrick is also likely to be on the market this summer if he doesn't land the Man United job (Image: Getty Images)\n\nGiven recent events, it feels like even a statement victory at Old Trafford may be a case of too little too late when it comes to his chances of landing the Manchester United job given Palace's slide down the league. Particularly with Carrick strengthening his own credentials for said role during the same period.\n\nBut it would give any of Glasner's potential summer suitors a timely reminder of why he was in the conversation for such a huge job in the first place.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Ronaldo, who had two stints at United, has recently dipped his toe into club ownership, acquiring a 25 per cent share in Spanish second-tier club Almeria.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRonaldo has gone on record to suggest that United, who have navigated various troubles on and off the pitch in recent years, would be in good hands should he acquire them. The Portuguese star's net worth is currently estimated at a whopping £900 million.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMcGregor, who has also addressed buying United, has a slightly smaller bank balance of around £150m.

I feel I could do big things for a club.\"\n\nReal Madrid legend Ronaldo made the investment in Almeria through his CR7 Sports company, as part of the club's ownership consortium led by SMC Group.

Maswanhise took a blow to the ribs from Vicko Sevelj's elbow and a penalty was given.\n\nMaswanhise was fully recovered in time to send Ashley Maynard-Brewer the wrong way.\n\nMotherwell went direct to trouble United - and that was the route to their second goal.\n\nWatt's free-kick from his own half found Maswanhise on the edge of the United penalty area and a great take and turn allowed him to fire towards goal. A deflection was enough to beat the goalkeeper.\n\nMaswanhise was released again in the 50th minute but he sent his hat-trick chance bobbling wide.\n\nGoodwin made a quadruple substitution just after the hour and one of those introduced, Kristijan Trapanovski, hit the far post direct from a corner.\n\nThat apart, Motherwell and their fans enjoyed playing with a lead.\n\nThe excellent Slattery whipped a superb attempt inches wide from 25 yards, while at the other end Stephenson got in behind the defence, only to clip an effort just past the far post.\n\nWhat the managers said...\n\nMotherwell boss Jens Berthel Askou:\n\n\"It's fantastic to have a player [Maswanhise] who can score a penalty every time, then know he'll get chances during the game.\n\n\"He was a little bit lucky, but you have to play the luck and force the luck by having a go.\n\n\"He deserved a goal or two. He does so well to break free of the tight marking and physical duels that go on around him, which can be a mental test.\"\n\nDundee Utd boss Jim Goodwin:\n\n\"A decision like that really takes it out the players. A coming together of two players like that happens 100 times in football.\n\n\"But that's what we're used to this season with the way games are being refereed.\n\n\"Players in general have to take some responsibility.\n\n\"We had a similar incident against Hearts when the Hearts player went down holding his face like he'd been hit hard and conned the ref.\n\n\"And Maswanhise went down like he'd been punched with full force in the ribs.\n\n\"It gives VAR something to look at, but I'd love a referee to see it again and say 'that's not a penalty' and play on.\n\n\"He obviously didn't deem it violent conduct because he gave him [Sevelj] a yellow.\n\n\"It's not a penalty and I wouldn't want penalties like that given.\n\n\"We seem to be saying the same things about refereeing in this country.

The wing-back got on the end of Tanser's delivery and his looping header hit the top of the cross bar.\n\nIn a lively first half, chances came at both ends of the pitch.\n\nImage: Livingston's Brooklyn Kabongolo scores to make it 1-1 against St Mirren\n\nMandron swept a left-footed shot from distance just over after the Lions got caught trying to play out before Livingston striker Robbie Muirhead drove an effort wide from inside the area.\n\nBoth of these teams have struggled for goals this term so it was no surprise that they were wasteful in the final third.\n\nThe same theme continued when Scott Pittman whipped a first-time shot wide from 15 yards in what was a promising position after being teed up by Liam Smith.\n\nSt Mirren goalkeeper Shamal George was then called upon to repel a stinging Smith drive after Alex Gogic made a mess of trying to head the ball back.\n\nBut it was the away team that stormed ahead a minute before the break through Nlundulu.\n\nThe striker was involved in the build up and was accused of handling the ball after falling to the ground just outside the box.\n\nSaints recycled the ball and Richardson played in Mandron down the side of the area and his cross was headed back across goal by the striker.\n\nIt was a familiar feeling for Livingston as the second half restarted although the home team should have drawn level through Muirhead.\n\nThe striker found himself in space from a Macaulay Tait pass but his right-footed shot from an angle was pushed behind by George.\n\nThe second period was not so open with the battle becoming more confined to the middle of the pitch.\n\nLivingston kept fighting and their perseverance paid off in the 76th minute with another goal from Kabongolo.\n\nSubstitute Barrie McKay swept a deep cross into the area the unmarked Kabongolo showed great composure to direct his header into the corner of the net from 10 yards.\n\nFellow substitute Joel Nouble then headed a McKay corner over from close range in what was the last meaningful chance of the game.\n\nWhat the managers said...\n\nLivingston boss Marvin Bartley:\n\n\"It's seven points at this moment in time, with nine games to go. It's something that can be turned around really, really quickly.\n\n\"We'll keep chipping away until we get to the split and then we'll see where we're at.\n\n\"But this team's more than good enough to do so.\n\n\"You know we will not give up. We will get out of this situation we're currently in.\n\n\"We spoke to the players when I first came in to take over as manager that we need to get as close as we possibly can by the split. And then after the split, we'll see where we're at but we're a point closer.\"\n\nSt Mirren boss Stephen Robinson:\n\n\"It's a point gained. It was a disappointing goal we conceded because I didn't see Livingston scoring.\n\n\"It's a long loopy ball into the box, that is again another poor individual decision and we get punished by it.\n\n\"It's a really poor goal but there were a lot of positives in it.\n\n\"I thought the first half we were good. We pressed much better, we looked a lot more solid and we hit the crossbar.\n\n\"But ultimately it takes us another point away from Kilmarnock and another point closer to the teams above us as well.\""

I think it would be a big achievement just staying in this league, so getting a sixth place - and we're not there yet, but that's where we are right now - I think it's a big achievement.\n\n\"It would be absolutely huge, probably the biggest achievement of anything that we've done previously.\n\n\"The standard is much, much higher than where we've been and the guys have responded and reacted to it enormously, adapting to it early and recognising that they were good enough to be in the league.\n\n\"That belief and confidence is just growing and growing and growing, and to go on and do that type of performance today is awesome.\"\n\nKilmarnock boss Neil McCann:\n\n\"I can only apologise to the fans here today. We filled out our section and I'm so sorry to them that we have put on that type of performance. That's not acceptable.\n\n\"We haven't served up that type of performance in my time here.\n\n\"It's very raw right now. I'm not going to get personal with any of the players.\n\n\"What I would say though is that we've collectively let the club down today. It's the first time I've felt so disappointed by the performance.\n\n\"Sometimes you've just got to accept that the other team were better on the day - and Falkirk were.\""

            "content": "Pep Guardiola has called on football supporters to “respect religion and diversity” after fans booed a brief stoppage in play at Elland Road to allow Muslim players to break their Ramadan fast.\n\nPlay was halted in the 13th minute of Manchester City’s 1-0 win against Leeds after the sun had set to allow the Muslim players to eat. At this point, despite a clear message on the big screen, fans audibly jeered the situation.\n\n“It is a modern world, right?” Guardiola said. “[You see] what is happening in the world today. Respect religion, diversity, that is the point. The Premier League says you can have one or two minutes, you can have for the [fasting] players to do it [break their fast]. It is what it is, unfortunately.\n\n“We took on a little bit of vitamins because [Rayan] Cherki, [Rayan] Aït-Nouri did not eat today. No more than that. The question is, can they do it or not? What is the problem?”\n\nThe Leeds assistant head coach Edmund Riemer – attending the press conference in place of Daniel Farke who was shown a red card after the final whistle for confronting the referee over perceived timewasting – added: “I’m probably the guy who doesn’t hear a lot because I’m really focused on the game, but I’ve heard about it. Obviously some of the supporters did it, so we try to learn from it. It’s disappointing, we need to do better next time.”\n\nPep Guardiola spoke on Friday about how Omar Marmoush, Aït-Nouri, Cherki and Abdukodir Khusanov deal with the complexities of being Muslim and a professional athlete.\n\nStoppages of this nature have become a regular feature in football matches in recent years during Ramadan. “They follow this religious tradition. We have good nutritionists and they adapt to what the team needs,” said Guardiola in his pre-match briefing. “We cannot adapt the schedule for the Premier League [kick-off] times and I think they are used to it – they are not young and have been playing [for] many years during this period.\n\n“For the players I think it is not new. Both Rayans, Omar and Khusa, it is not the first time for [observing] Ramadan and they know perfectly how to handle it.”\n\nKick it Out, the anti-discrimination charity, said in a statement: “It is massively disappointing that some Leeds United fans jeered when Manchester City’s players broke their fast during the first half of the match at Elland Road. This was compounded by the fact that an explanation was displayed on a big screen inside the stadium.\n\n“Pausing the game to allow Muslim players to break their fast during Ramadan has been an agreed protocol for several years now. It’s an important and visible part of making the game welcoming for Muslim players and communities. But as tonight’s reaction shows, football still has a long way to go in terms of education and acceptance.”"

            "content": "Benjamin Sesko’s career at Manchester United breaks into two distinct periods. In the first, he played 1,404 minutes of football and scored two goals. In the second, he has played 274 minutes and scored six goals: 702 minutes per goal and then 45 minutes 40 seconds per goal.\n\nThere’s a very obvious explanation. On 4 January, Sesko toiled in a 1-1 draw at Leeds. He didn’t manage a shot on target. He completed only 76% of his passes. He didn’t attempt a dribble but still lost possession five times. He was caught offside twice. On 5 January, Ruben Amorim was sacked.\n\nOn 6 January, Sesko scored both goals in a 2-2 draw at Burnley. It seems a little unfair to compare Amorim, who always came across as a thoroughly pleasant and decent man, to the White Witch from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, but the similar thawing impact of their removals is undeniable. The snows are melting, the flowers are blossoming and creatures that had been turned to stone are becoming flesh and blood once again.\n\nUnited, of course, have been here before, with an upturn under a beloved former player. The Ole Gunnar Solskjær experience means there is such a determination not to get carried away that there are some around United – fans and pundits – who are adamant Michael Carrick should not be given the job on a permanent basis almost whatever he achieves between now and the end of the season.\n\nBut there is a qualitative difference to what happened in 2019. Back then, there was a sense that United had decent players but they were diminished by the toxicity of the later part of José Mourinho’s reign. This season, there were doubts about how many of United’s players were any good at all.\n\nIt turns out, though, that a manager can make a huge impact by picking players in their best positions, restoring a hugely promising young midfielder ostracised because he didn’t fit a specific profile, and imbuing his charges with confidence.\n\nView image in fullscreen Benjamin Sesko’s early appearances showed a heavy touch and poor movement. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nAfter Sesko came off the bench to score the winner at Everton on Monday, he spoke of the importance of his sense that “everyone believes in me”. Which raises the obvious question of why that wasn’t true before. Did Amorim not rate him? Did Amorim not want him? Or was Amorim just bad at conveying to players on the fringes of the team how he saw them developing? And this is to do with Amorim. It’s not that Carrick is some sort of specialist Sesko-whisperer. The post-Amorim transformation was immediate, the Slovene scoring three goals in his two games under Darren Fletcher as interim manager.\n\nEvery day that has passed since Amorim left the club has made the decision to appoint him look worse. But the villain here is not Amorim, who told everybody he would always play 3-4-2-1 and then always played 3-4-2-1 at least until the very end, when fielding a back four felt like some sort of passive-aggressive act of defiance. The fault, rather, lies with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the process that imposed him on a disparate squad united only by their unsuitability for a manager who would play only 3-4-2-1, over the warnings of the then sporting director, Dan Ashworth, who left his role as a result. Amorim’s biggest fault was taking the job; little wonder he looked suddenly so much younger, so much more relaxed after being relieved of it.\n\nUnited’s upturn in form still doesn’t justify United spending £200m on three forwards in the summer when there were such obvious deficiencies in other areas – although recent events have shown how Ratcliffe struggles with numbers, so that perhaps offers some explanation – but it least it now appears that money was spent on players who may be part of a successful future. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have clicked up a level since Carrick took over, but it’s in Sesko that the starkest improvement has been seen.\n\nLast summer was characterised by Premier League clubs spending big money to sign orthodox strikers, with mixed results. Hugo Ekitiké has impressed. Alexander Isak, after his acrimonious move to Liverpool disrupted his pre‑season, was seemingly never at full fitness even before his broken leg. Rory Delap has struggled with injury at Chelsea. Even after his goals for Arsenal in the north London derby last Sunday, opinion is divided on Viktor Gyökeres.\n\nBut until early January, Sesko looked the most questionable of the lot. Allowances have to be made for the fact he is only 22, but he did not look in those early appearances like a £70m striker. His touch was heavy, his movement poor. But that’s the difference confidence and playing a coherent system can make.\n\nA simple video session with Fletcher before the 2-2 draw with Burnley was enough to restore in Sesko a basic faith in what he has done until now in his career. Sesko excels at making runs in the blind spot of defenders, which is exactly what brought both his goals that day: the first, because his run on to Bruno Fernandes’s through ball wasn’t tracked; the second, because, although Bashir Humphreys knew Sesko was behind him, he didn’t know whether he was going to go left or right to meet Patrick Dorgu’s cross.\n\nHe got away from Kenny Tete to score the winner against Fulham. He got in front of Axel Disasi for his remarkable finish to equalise against West Ham.\n\nView image in fullscreen Benjamin Sesko makes it 1-1 deep in stoppage time at West Ham. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA\n\nSesko’s movement is perhaps his greatest gift, but his physical attributes are obvious: he is good in the air, but also rapid over medium-to-long distances, as he showed in his winner on the break against Everton, confidence evident in every stride as he approached Mbeumo’s pass.\n\nHe’s less effective when given time to think but, given his age, that may come. And in his instincts to find space and finish, he’s already a hugely exciting talent, even if he is for now used mainly from the bench. It is remarkable what can happen when a manager uses a player in ways that accentuate his strengths rather than petrifying him with the wand of conformity to a strict tactical blueprint.\n\nNobody can pretend the background problems have gone away, but the tactical winter is over and Sesko is the frolicking avatar of the post-Amorim spring."

            "content": "Harry Kane scored twice again and Bayern Munich opened an 11-point lead in the Bundesliga with a 3-2 win at Borussia Dortmund in Der Klassiker on Saturday.\n\nJoshua Kimmich let fly with his left boot to score the winner with a volley in the 87th minute, just four minutes after Daniel Svensson equalised for Dortmund with a brilliant volley inside the left post. Nico Schlotterbeck put Dortmund 1-0 up at the break, but Serge Gnabry set up Kane’s response and the England captain got his second from the penalty spot – after a foul by Schlotterbeck on Josip Stanisic – to take his league tally to 30 goals this season.\n\nKane has scored two goals or more for the fourth successive game and is threatening Robert Lewandowski’s season record of 41.\n\nWerder Bremen finally ended their 13-game run without a win in the Bundesliga by beating relegation rivals Heidenheim 2-0 in their bottom-of-the-table scrap. Bremen missed a host of chances before Jovan Milosevic scored from Romano Schmid’s cross in the 57th minute, and an own goal from Hennes Behrens in stoppage time confirmed Bremen’s first win after three defeats under their new coach, Daniel Thioune. It was enough to lift Bremen above Wolfsburg into the relegation playoff place. Wolfsburg, who haven’t won any of their past six games, visit Stuttgart on Sunday.\n\nHeidenheim remained bottom, nine points from a safe position after St Pauli held on for a 1-0 win at high-flying Hoffenheim. Mathias Pereira Lage scored for St Pauli before the break, lifting the Hamburg-based club out of the relegation zone after their third win from four games.\n\nKevin Diks scored a stoppage-time penalty for Borussia Mönchengladbach to beat Union Berlin 1-0 and end Gladbach’s seven-game winless run. Jarell Quansah scored late for Bayer Leverkusen to salvage a 1-1 draw with Mainz, canceling out Sheraldo Becker’s second-half volley. But the draw was a blow to Leverkusen’s hopes of reaching fourth place in the race for Champions League qualification. Leverkusen remained sixth, and both Stuttgart and Leipzig could pull further away. Leipzig visit Hamburg on Sunday.\n\nLamine Yamal scored the first hat-trick of his career as Barcelona beat visitors Villarreal 4-1 to move four points clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. Barcelona have 64 points while second-placed Real are on 60 points before they host Getafe on Monday. Villarreal remain a distant third on 51.\n\nLamine Yamal put the hosts ahead in the 28th minute after Fermin Lopez robbed Pape Gueye and slipped a pass down the right for the 18-year-old to finish low inside the left post. He doubled the lead nine minutes later with a dazzling solo run, controlling a long ball on the right wing before cutting inside past Sergi Cardona and Alberto Moleiro to curl an unstoppable shot into the top corner.\n\nView image in fullscreen Lamine Yamal with the match ball at the final whistle. Photograph: Toni Albir/EPA\n\nGueye pulled one back from close range in the 49th minute, but Villarreal missed chances to equalise and paid the price as Lamine Yamal completed his hat-trick in the 69th minute with another counterattack. Robert Lewandowski came off the bench to add a fourth in added time, tapping in from Jules Koundé’s low cross from the right.\n\nJulián Alvarez struck in the 94th minute to snatch Atlético Madrid a 1-0 La Liga win over bottom side Real Oviedo and help his team climb to third. The Argentinian striker secured Diego Simeone’s side only their second win in five league games with his first league goal in nearly four months.\n\nThe Rojiblancos had an eye on Tuesday’s Copa del Rey semi-final second leg at Barcelona, where they hold a 4-0 advantage, and were extremely fortunate to emerge with three points. The cruel ending left Oviedo eight points from safety.\n\nInter moved 13 points clear at the top of Serie A with a comfortable 2-0 home win over lowly Genoa thanks to goals from Federico Dimarco and Hakan Calhanoglu. Inter have 67 points from 27 games, ahead of second-placed Milan, who visit relegation-threatened Cremonese on Sunday.\n\nDimarco put Inter ahead just past the half-hour mark with a sublime finish into the far corner from a tight angle on the left after a clever lofted pass from Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Calhanoglu wrapped up the points in the 70th minute with a precise penalty after a handball by Genoa’s half-time substitute Alexsandro Amorim to give in-form Inter their eighth consecutive Serie A win and 14th victory from their last 15 league games.\n\nRomelu Lukaku’s first goal of the season with the last kick of the match ended Napoli’s winless run. Lukaku, who had played just 41 minutes this campaign after a serious preseason thigh injury, pounced in the sixth minute of stoppage time to help Napoli win at bottom club Hellas Verona 2-1. He appeared to tear up when the final whistle blew seconds later. His last goal was on 23 May and was followed by a terrible few months. Shortly after his torn thigh, his father died suddenly in September at 58.\n\n“On a personal level soccer gives you a lot. It has given me everything but losing my father like I lost him weighs on me every day,” Lukaku told Dazn while struggling to hold back tears. “But it is what it is and I carry on for my daughters, for my brother and for Napoli which has given me so much.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Romelu Lukaku races away to celebrate his first goal of the season for Napoli. Photograph: Matteo Ciambelli/Reuters\n\nNapoli got off to a great start as Rasmus Højlund’s looping header from 12 meters gave them the lead after less than two minutes. However, Højlund was also involved in the equaliser in the 65th. He attempted to clear a Verona corner but it came out to Jean-Daniel Akpa Akpro, whose shot was deflected in by Højlund. The goal was credited to Akpa Akpro as the initial shot was on target.\n\nIn France, Paris Saint-Germain extended their Ligue 1 advantage to four points with a 1-0 victory at Le Havre thanks to a first-half goal from Bradley Barcola. PSG lead second-placed Lens, who have stumbled over the last seven days with a 3-2 home loss to Monaco last weekend and a 1-1 draw at Racing Strasbourg on Friday.\n\nPSG now have nine wins from their last 10 league games but it took 37 minutes for Barcola, in an unfamiliar centre-forward role, to break the deadlock by heading home a Lee Kang-in cross. Lee missed a good chance to double the score two minutes later and two minutes after that Dro Fernández, recently signed from Barcelona, had an effort disallowed for offside. Désiré Doué should have made it 2-0 from the penalty spot in the 79th minute after being tripped by Lucas Gourna-Douath, but his effort was saved by Mory Diaw.\n\nLe Havre, who stay nine points above the relegation zone in 13th place, struggled through most of the match but had a chance to equalise in the 54th minute when Issa Soumaré’s shot on the turn forced Matvey Safonov into a sharp save."

            "content": "The contrasting strengths of Liverpool and West Ham are reflected on the balance sheet, the team sheet and ultimately the score sheet. Arne Slot’s side improved their prospects of Champions League qualification with a peculiar victory at Anfield, the winning margin far more resounding than the performance.\n\nIn the week Liverpool announced record overall revenue of £703m in their latest accounts, most of it ploughed back into the bank balances of a title-winning team, West Ham warned that players will have to be sold this summer whether they stay up or not having suffered a £104.2m loss in the same financial year. Their prospects of avoiding relegation look bleak in the context of such a heavy defeat yet, strange as it seems, Nuno Espírito Santo could take encouragement from elements of West Ham’s display.\n\nThe visitors had a better xG than Liverpool but found Alisson in fine form and the champions devastating at set pieces. West Ham must have known it was not going to be their day when their bus got stuck on a ramp while attempting to leave the team hotel. “If I say it was a good performance I sound silly,” said Nuno. “But that’s what I saw.”\n\nAnd yet this game was effectively over by half-time. As damning as that was for West Ham, they retained hope of getting back into the contest before Alexis Mac Allister extinguished it in the 43rd minute. The midfielder’s brilliant volley was the third Liverpool goal to originate from a corner as Slot’s side continued their metamorphosis into the Premier League’s set-piece specialists.\n\nPoor at defending them and scoring from them in the first half of the season, resulting in the departure of the set-piece coach Aaron Briggs in December, Liverpool have now scored more set-piece goals than any other team in the division – excluding penalties – in 2026. West Ham were defensively weak as Liverpool took their set-piece goals total to eight for the calendar year.\n\nHugo Ekitiké gave the hosts an early lead after El Hadji Malick Diouf had cleared the first corner of the afternoon. Ryan Gravenberch returned a fine ball into the France international, who took his shot early and saw it nestle into Mads Hermansen’s bottom corner via a slight deflection off Konstantinos Mavropanos. Both the West Ham centre-half and goalkeeper could have done more.\n\nThe visitors responded well to their first setback. Mateus Fernandes and Crysencio Summerville were to the fore as Liverpool were opened up frequently, but West Ham could not find a finishing touch. Mavropanos scooped wildly over when a Jarrod Bowen corner landed at his feet and Mac Allister worked tirelessly to cut out a dangerous counterattack led by Summerville. The threat from West Ham was growing, then Liverpool scored another simple goal from a corner.\n\nView image in fullscreen West Ham captain Jarrod Bowen looks dejected after Cody Gakpo scores Liverpool’s fourth goal. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nVirgil van Dijk headed home Dominik Szoboszlai’s delivery after bumping aside Soungoutou Magassa and beating Tomas Soucek to the ball. It was the Liverpool captain’s second set-piece goal in three games and his team’s seventh of the year. Number eight was executed brilliantly. Mohamed Salah took a corner from the right, Van Dijk flicked on at the near post, Ekitiké cushioned the ball out to Mac Allister and he volleyed into the roof of the net via the head of Aaron Wan-Bissaka. The ball did not touch the ground from the moment it left Salah’s foot.\n\nWest Ham had their moments before the third goal, Alisson saving well from Soucek and gratefully from Bowen after hitting a clearance straight at the visiting captain, but were in for a long afternoon. To their credit, Nuno’s side did not concede to the inevitable. Soucek reduced the arrears early in the second half when sliding in to convert Diouf’s low cross.\n\nAnfield became noticeably edgy as errors crept into the Liverpool display and both Fernandes and Summerville drew good stops from Alisson. But Cody Gakpo restored the host’s three goal cushion when his low shot struck Wan-Bissaka and deflected into the far corner.\n\nWest Ham responded once again when Bowen’s corner sailed over a crowded six-yard box and Taty Castellanos scored with a free header at the back post. But a late, unfortunate own goal by Axel Disasi, who deflected a low cross from the Liverpool substitute Jeremie Frimpong beyond Hermansen, compounded a punishing day for West Ham. “You’re going down with Prince Andrew,” taunted the Kop.\n\nSlot reflected: “I’m very pleased with the set pieces, firstly because that is the reason we won and secondly because we played OK-to-good. We’ve played better this season and lost. We’ve started scoring from set pieces and things look brighter and better than when you don’t.”"

            "content": "As rain fell, incessantly, Eddie Howe wandered around the pitch alone. The final whistle had just gone and, with Everton celebrating a deserved win, Newcastle’s lingering hopes of a top-six finish were also blown.\n\nNewcastle look shattered, mentally as much as physically, by a Champions League campaign that will soon pit them against Barcelona and their Premier League form is suffering accordingly.\n\nAdmittedly it took a stunning stoppage-time save from Jordan Pickford to deny Sandro Tonali a late equaliser, but Newcastle’s players have forgotten how to defend, are far too careless in possession and seem alarmingly low on creativity.\n\n“It’s really hard to explain,” said Howe, after Newcastle lost a third consecutive home game for the first time since February 2021 under Steve Bruce; they have kept only two clean sheets in 21 league games. “It’s hugely frustrating, desperately disappointing.\n\n“We think we’re a good team, but we’re wildly inconsistent, even within games. I don’t see players not trying, I sometimes see them over-trying, but they’re not playing smart enough. Chasing the game took a lot out of us. It’s not a good look for us.”\n\nNewcastle were slapdash from the start and swiftly paid the price at a set piece. Jarrad Branthwaite’s expertly flicked header from James Garner’s corner was dispatched from the tightest of angles, brushing the unguarded far post en route into the back of the net.\n\nBranthwaite excelled in central defence, not something that can be said of his Newcastle counterparts. They have not kept a clean sheet in the 11 games since they beat PSV Eindhoven 3-0 here on 21 January, conceding 23 goals along the way. Small wonder cries of “Wake up!” echoed around the ground.\n\nView image in fullscreen Thierno Barry improvises to score the winning goal off his backside. Photograph: Richard Lee/Shutterstock\n\nHowe once again began with the England winger Anthony Gordon at centre-forward and his ineffective £69m Germany striker, Nick Woltemade, in an attacking midfield role. With Gordon struggling to make an impact against his former club, Howe quickly shifted Woltemade to No 9 and Gordon to the left.\n\nA slightly improved Newcastle equalised when Jacob Ramsey’s shot took a hefty deflection off Branthwaite, wrong-footing Pickford.\n\nA bad error on Nick Pope’s part enabled Everton to regain the lead after the keeper spilt a fairly routine shot from the impressive Dwight McNeil straight into Beto’s path. Everton’s No 9 gleefully accepted the invitation to stroke the ball into the empty net. Beto is often criticised for a perceived litany of shortcomings and would later miss a glorious chance, but he reacted with alacrity, moving far more rapidly than any of the defenders.\n\nNewcastle faced further disruption at the outset of the second half, when, after emerging from the tunnel for the restart, Ramsey vomited repeatedly on the pitch, prompting his replacement by Joe Willock.\n\nIt was not long before Anthony Elanga and Woltemade made way for Jacob Murphy and Harvey Barnes as Gordon reverted to centre-forward.\n\nBeto, making his first start since December, left Malick Thiaw for dust and found himself clean through with only Pope to beat. A third Everton goal beckoned, but his shot hit the bar and left Beto standing in isolation, his hands covering his face.\n\nSoon he was replaced by Thierno Barry and on, too, came Yoane Wissa, the hitherto overlooked £55m former Brentford centre-forward.\n\nHome spirits revived, albeit briefly, when Murphy’s slightly deflected volley from Joelinton’s cross flew past Pickford, but Everton recaptured the lead in barely a minute. Gordon’s concession of possession prefaced Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall squaring for Barry to bundle the ball across the line.\n\nIn stoppage time, Pickford reminded everyone why he is England’s goalkeeper. Tonali let fly on the volley and an equaliser seemed inevitable but Pickford tipped the ball over the bar.\n\n“Tonali’s technique was textbook,” said a delighted Moyes, whose side’s away Premier League record is bettered only by Arsenal’s. “Jordan’s save was out of this world.”"

            "content": "Scott Parker was left sad and disappointed by more video assistant referee controversy after Burnley’s spirited comeback came to nothing. The home side were 3-0 down in 34 minutes and facing hostility from their own fans, but fought back to level before having a fourth goal ruled out after Jaidon Anthony was adjudged to be a shoulder-width offside.\n\nMikkel Damsgaard then put Brentford back in front three minutes into injury time only for Ashley Barnes to net and spark scenes of jubilation, but his apparent equaliser was also chalked off, for handball, after a long delay.\n\nParker said: “Maybe a little bit of injustice. I’ve not watched it back. I saw it on the big screen and I was thinking it looks like his hand is beside his side. It looks so, so harsh.\n\n“We’ve gone and scored five goals in the space of 60 minutes, which is quite incredible. The world we’re in, we’re all looking for perfection. The game is looking for perfection.”\n\nLoud boos greeted the final whistle, but there had also been jeering and chants against Parker and the Burnley owner, Alan Pace, during and at the end of a woeful first half for the home side. They have not won at home in the league since October and ire towards team and hierarchy has been growing, but Parker hopes the response of his side will have won over some of the dissenters.\n\n“Walking in from half-time, it wasn’t nice,” he said. “Everyone has choices to vent how they want to vent. The fans were brilliant in the second half, but that was down to us. I understand the frustration of course, we’re all frustrated at 3-0 down.\n\n“There’s one thing our supporters can see leaving here , and you can be critical in certain moments, but the one thing you can’t be critical of is this group and what this shirt means, what playing for this team means and what we stand for. I hope the fans can see that.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Ashley Barnes reacts in shock after his late goal is disallowed. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA\n\nThe Brentford manager, Keith Andrews, who signed a new long-term deal this week, said he would not have been happy had the VAR decisions gone against his side, but felt they were ultimately correct.\n\nOn his team’s performance, he said: “The first half we were very good, played with a lot of conviction, we attacked with real speed and venom and belief.\n\n“The own goal just changed it a little bit and I knew we’d have to start the second half really well. I thought they’d make changes, they did, changed the system a little bit, and we didn’t deal with that particularly well. This was never going to be an easy game. If I’d been asked [beforehand] if I would accept a 4-3 victory, I would have taken it. It’s come in very crazy circumstances.”"

            "content": "Sir Alex Ferguson watched on as Hearts defeated Aberdeen 1-0 to move seven points clear of Rangers at the top of the Scottish Premiership.\n\nFerguson, the last manager to win the title with a team that was not Celtic or Rangers when his Aberdeen side were back-to-back champions from 1983-85, was at Tynecastle as a guest of the Hearts coach, Derek McInnes, and he saw Cláudio Braga score what proved to be the only goal of the game just before the half-hour mark.\n\nHearts had enough chances to have won more convincingly, but their supporters greeted the full-time whistle with jubilation as they stretched their lead over Rangers and Celtic, who face each other at Ibrox on Sunday.\n\n“It felt like a big game, I think the fans made it that, and the situation in terms of the context of the league made it that,” said McInnes. “It looks like a tight scoreline but I thought it was a very good performance. It was exactly the type of performance we needed it to be. We had more crosses in today’s game than we’ve had for a long time. It was the type of performance I was hoping for.\n\n“In an ideal world, you would want a second goal to enjoy that last part, but it was a good three points, no more than we deserved.”\n\nQuick Guide Scottish Premiership: Motherwell close on Celtic Show Motherwell moved a point behind third-placed Celtic with a comfortable 2-0 win at home to Dundee United. Tawanda Maswanhise scored either side of the interval as Motherwell extended their unbeaten league run to 11 games. The breakthrough came from Vicko Sevelj conceding a penalty for an off-the-ball altercation with Maswanhise. Dundee and Hibernian shared a six-goal thriller as their Dens Park clash ended in a 3-3 draw. Cam Congreve struck a fantastic equaliser for Dundee in the fifth minute of stoppage time after Hibernian had taken the lead through Owen Elding. Dundee led 2-1 through Simon Murray and Luke Graham, but Hibernian looked on the way to three points after Ante Suto and Jamie McGrath scored in the final 10 minutes. Falkirk all-but secured a top-six berth by thrashing relegation-threatened Kilmarnock 5-1, who remain firmly in relegation danger. An Ethan Brown own goal got the ball rolling before Dylan Tait and Barney Stewart bagged doubles, while Killie's consolation came from Greg Kiltie. Brooklyn Kabongolo scored for the second game running as bottom-placed Livingston drew 1-1 at home to St Mirren, who had led through Dan Nlundulu's powerful header on the stroke of half-time. PA Media Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nMcInnes said of the former Manchester United manager Ferguson’s presence at Tynecastle: “He sat in the office for about an hour before the game. It was nice for him to see Tynecastle the way it was and see a winning performance. He’s watched us a lot this season and he’s quite tuned in to what we’re doing so I’m grateful that he’s made the effort to come and see us today.”\n\nHearts were supposed to be going to Dubai on Monday for a warm-weather training camp but those plans have been shelved amid escalating hostilities in the Middle East.\n\n“We woke up this morning and were resigned to it that we’ll not be travelling,” said McInnes. “I think there’s more important things going on. It’s disappointing obviously, but we might push it down the line because there’s going to be opportunities between now and the end of the season where we could maybe just do a similar booking. But we’ll just train as normal in Edinburgh this week.”\n\nThere were two changes to the Hearts side that started last weekend’s victory over Falkirk as Jamie McCart and Landry Kaboré replaced Stuart Findlay and Islam Chesnokov. The Aberdeen interim manager, Peter Leven, made three changes to the side that started Tuesday’s 0-0 draw at Dundee United as the goalkeeper, Per Kristian Bråtveit, Tom McIntyre and Kenan Bilalovic were replaced by Dimitar Mitov, Liam Morrison and Topi Keskinen.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sir Alex Ferguson takes his seat in the stands at Tynecastle. Photograph: Steve Welsh/PA\n\nAberdeen had not won at Tynecastle since May 2017 and they swiftly found themselves on the back foot as Hearts, backed by a pumped-up home support, started strongly. Tómas Magnússon had the hosts’ first chance in the fourth minute when he headed wide from Blair Spittal’s cross.\n\nAlexandros Kyziridis then had a shot deflected into the arms of Mitov before Braga’s low effort from just inside the box was saved by the Dons keeper. Braga threatened again when he glanced a header over from Harry Milne’s cross.\n\nHearts were playing some scintillating football and they had a huge chance in the 21st minute when Kaboré got himself clean through but the forward’s lob over the advancing Mitov drifted agonisingly wide. Aberdeen had a rare foray forward in the 26th minute which resulted in Toyosi Olusanya lashing wide from Keskinen’s cross.\n\nThe breakthrough came for Hearts in the 28th minute when Marc Leonard sent Kaboré scampering down the right and the Burkina Faso striker rode the challenge of Morrison before cutting the ball back for Braga to steer home from six yards out.\n\nSpittal then rasped an effort just over from the edge of the box in the 36th minute as the league leaders had to be content with a one-goal advantage at the end of a first half they had dominated.\n\nFour minutes after the break, Kaboré had a ferocious shot pushed out by Mitov. Aberdeen countered and Nicky Devlin had an effort scrambled behind by McCart after being set up by Olusanya. From the resulting corner Kevin Nisbet volleyed narrowly wide. At the other end, Spittal had an effort deflected behind from the edge of the box before Braga was denied by the legs of Mitov.\n\nHearts’ failure to find a second goal meant they had to endure a stressful finale before closing out another crucial victory in their quest for a first league title since 1960."

            "content": "Football’s lawmaking authority, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), is to conduct a two-year review of the video assistant referee to ensure the technology is being used “to its best”. The announcement on Saturday came alongside a flurry of enhancements to the rulebook before the World Cup, including expanding the use of VAR into determining corner kicks.\n\nAnother proposal could mean punishments for players obscuring their mouths being fast-tracked for implementation at this summer’s tournament, after the alleged racist abuse of Vinícius Júnior by Benfica’s Gianluca Prestianni.\n\nThe VAR review was confirmed by the technical director of Ifab, David Elleray, on the 10th anniversary of the decision to first trial video technology. “We have agreed today that after 10 years we should be reviewing VAR to see where we want to go with it in the future,” Elleray said.\n\n“There is a very interesting debate over what direction VAR should go in because within football there are two contrasting philosophies: some that want as far as possible perfect decision making … and those who say we have to accept that refereeing errors are part of the game.”\n\nBefore the outcome of any review, Ifab confirmed that VAR’s powers are to be extended into three new areas. The first will give official permission to check and review any red card decision that comes from a “clearly incorrect second yellow card”. Second, they will be able to intervene when the referee punishes the wrong team for an offence.\n\nFinally, VAR will be able to review a “clearly incorrectly awarded corner kick”, albeit only under the condition that the review “can be completed immediately and without delaying the restart”.\n\nView image in fullscreen VAR will now be able to review a ‘clearly incorrectly awarded corner kick’. Photograph: Sebastian Frej/Getty Images\n\nAll of these developments are to be in place by June and it is expected that Ifab will confirm new disciplinary measures related to discriminatory behaviour too. There is to be a fast-tracked consultation over incidents where players “cover their mouth when confronting opponents during matches” or “unilaterally decide to leave the field of play as an act of protest” as in the case of the Senegal national side during this year’s Africa Cup of Nations final. Both actions are likely to be punished with a yellow card.\n\nThe first “semi-live” trial of VAR was conducted in 2016 during a men’s international friendly between France and Italy. A decade later video technology is now embedded in the top echelons of the game but has driven widespread dissatisfaction due to delays in decision making and matches being determined by marginal outcomes.\n\nThe English FA’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said it was key that rulemakers continued to innovate in their application of VAR. “There is a review going on looking at how we use VAR to its best,” he said. “If you look at the innovations that Fifa have brought through, particularly in semi-automated offside, I think they’re fantastic.\n\n“The speed with which decisions are made, and the accuracy, takes a big amount of frustration away from fans. The other interesting area is looking at what can we learn from other trials being done? The football video support system gives the coach a challenge system. Are there elements of that we should consider adopting for the future? Because that reduces the amount of times when there is a VAR intervention and effectively puts the emphasis on the coach.”\n\nView image in fullscreen The Fifa referees committee chair, Pierluigi Collina, spoke at the AGM. Photograph: David Davies/PA\n\nAt the AGM in his role as chair of the Fifa referees committee, Pierluigi Collina encapsulated the first decade of VAR with a metaphor. “In Italy we are used to saying that, in every wonderful marriage, there is a crisis after seven years,” he said. “So it might be possible that people fell in love with the VAR and then after some years, as with your wife, you have a small crisis.”\n\nIn addition to the extension of VAR protocols, the Ifab brought in new measures to tackle time-wasting and the disruption of tempo in matches. The successful introduction of the eight-second rule for goalkeepers has encouraged Ifab to go further on efforts to stop players slowing the game.\n\nReferees will be given the power to start a five-second countdown if they feel players are taking too long over throw-ins and dead-ball goal kicks, with the throw-in reversed or a corner kick the sanction for delaying. Substitutions must be completed in no more than 10 seconds, otherwise the substitute must stay off for at least one minute."

Later on Saturday, Sir Keir spoke to Mr Trump to discuss the situation and outlined the UK's role in defensive operations across the region.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (Image: KHAMENEI.IR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn a joint statement with the leaders of France and Germany, the Prime Minister condemned Iran's retaliation and called on Tehran to \"refrain from indiscriminate military strikes\" and \"seek a negotiated solution\".\n\nSpeaking from Downing Street, Sir Keir said the UK had not participated in the strikes, but had subsequently deployed aircraft \"as part of co-ordinated regional defensive operations to protect our people, our interests and our allies\". He further stated that security measures for British bases in the Middle East have been enhanced and the Government is \"reaching out to UK nationals in the region and doing everything we can to support them\".\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFollow our live blog for the latest updates by clicking here."

But, according to experts, Gary Oldman’s character in the TV series Slow Horses would make the better spy because his normal appearance lets him blend in.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTwo big exhibitions are shedding light on the art of espionage, drawing from stories of real spooks. Chris Costa, executive director of the International Spy Museum in Washington, DC and a former US Army intelligence officer, says: “Spying touches something fundamental in the human psyche: secrecy, danger, loyalty, betrayal.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“I think what drives the fascination is the tension between the ordinary and the extraordinary. Spies look like us yet they’re operating in a world of concealed identities and deception. And in a world that feels increasingly uncertain, espionage offers a window into how and why nations spy.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTom Hiddleston addresses doing Strictly despite having new baby with famous fiancee READ MORE :\n\nEspionage has been back in the headlines following the British government’s conclusion that Kremlin critic and Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was murdered by Vladimir Putin’s henchmen with a toxin taken from the skin of the poison dart frog. The US museum is about to launch Camouflage: Designed to Deceive, an exhibition exploring how spies hide in plain sight – something which Chris, 62, says the world’s most famous fictional secret agent often gets wrong.\n\nView 5 Images Daniel Craig as James Bond (Image: The Hollywood Archive)\n\nHe says: “James Bond can be misleading, because a tuxedo-wearing spy is the exception. A real intelligence officer’s first priority is to fit in, but Bond walks into every room and immediately becomes the most memorable person in it.” Ian Fleming’s fast-driving Scotsman is far from the only sharp-suited spy in literature, books and TV – with their good looks, John le Carre’s Jonathan Pine, played by Tom Hiddleston in the BBC series, and Mission Impossible’s Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) catch the eye.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut Chris adds: “For the most part, that is the opposite of sound tradecraft.” Amanda Mason, lead curator of the exhibition Spies, Lies and Deception at the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester, agrees with Chris that standing out from the crowd is a disadvantage to a secret agent.\n\nSome spies will go to great lengths to fade into the background, she reveals. She says: “The real stories of spies are sometimes more amazing than anything we’d see on screen or in a book. For instance, our exhibition has a permission form giving consent for plastic surgery to be carried out on a chap called Major Flemming Muus. He was leading organiser in Denmark for the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in WWII and had quite a distinctive nose. He was going into work undercover and it was thought he would be too identifiable, so he had plastic surgery to change his face.”\n\nThe Manchester exhibition, which examines a century of espionage, misdirection and camouflage and runs until August, also features the story of Ben Cowburn, one of the most successful agents within the SOE. Amanda adds: “He completed four highly dangerous missions to occupied France, working under false names and blending into the civilian population. But, as he later explained in his memoirs, he ‘wore no disguise in France… an undisguised [spy] could look the same and be different’.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images The Amazon poison dart frog (Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nChris, who ran intelligence and special operations in Panama, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, says clothes and looks can be part of the theatre of spying. He adds: “They can communicate class, profession, nationality, intent, often before a word is spoken.” But sometimes things can go wrong. Chris continues: “I remember once wearing a disguise in an intense training session in public... a thick moustache carefully glued to my upper lip. Unfortunately, I ended up eating an ice cream cone. Not a good idea. I was horrified that my moustache would not survive the experience. It did. Lesson learned.“\n\nAnd a spy’s behaviour is just as important. Chris says: “A light disguise of changed hair colour might get you past a camera, but how you move, how you make eye contact, respond to unexpected questions, what you do with your hands when you’re nervous – these are the things that expose you or protect you. The physical elements buy you seconds. Behaviour buys you the operation.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAs unlikely as tuxedo-wearing spies might be, they are not only confined to the big screen. Chris reveals: “My predecessor here at the museum was a CIA officer, the late Peter Earnest, a legendary intelligence officer. One evening, wearing a tuxedo, he went to a party overseas in some unnamed city. He ducked away from the party, got into a room at the residence to place a listening device.\n\nView 5 Images Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who was arrested during March 26, 2017 anti-corruption rally, gestures during an appeal hearing at a court in Moscow on March 30, 2017. The \"murder\" of late Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison in 2024 is now a \"science-proven fact\", his widow Yulia Navalnaya said on February 14, 2026 after five European countries said Moscow used a lethal toxic on the Kremlin opponent. (Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n“But somebody was coming to open the door; Peter hid, tuxedo and all, and eventually he was able to adjust and go back to the party like nothing happened.” And disguise can extend to more than just apparel. Amanda says: “During the First World War the army developed these things called camouflage trees. Soldiers would look across no man’s land, and where there was a tree – perhaps positioned on higher ground – they’d sketch it.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Then they’d re-create this tree with a sort of a steel core using natural materials to disguise it, so it was a perfect replica, and then in the middle of the night they’d switch them. Next morning it would look like the tree was there but it was actually an armoured observation post. Somebody could then get inside and have a vantage point over the enemy.”\n\nA sketch of one such tree is among items on display in Manchester, as is a box of matches with one match adapted so it can be used to write messages, and the pen nib of German WWI spy George Breeckow, which contains traces of invisible ink. Amanda is a big fan of spy novels, citing Mick Herron’s Slow Horses books, on which the Gary Oldman Apple TV series is based, as a favourite.\n\nView 5 Images Sir Alec Guinness as 'George Smiley', in 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' (Image: BBC)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nChris, too, enjoys fictional spy heroes. He says: “I have a soft spot for George Smiley - specifically Alec Guinness’s portrayal in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Here is a man who is rumpled, quiet, seemingly unremarkable. He wins not through physical dominance or gadgetry but through patience, observation and an ability to understand human motivation. That rings true to me.”\n\nFor Amanda, one real-life spy stands out: London-born Catherine Townsend, a talented linguist who served with the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry in the Second World War before being recruited to British intelligence. Amanda says of Catherine: “She went to work at Trent Park, a top-secret facility designed to eavesdrop on high-ranking German prisoners of war.\n\n“She rose through the ranks and eventually was put in charge of programming the listening equipment. We imagine the archetypal spy to be a man, but often women have played really pivotal roles.” Chris adds: “The myths are pervasive, that spies are always glamorous, that they work alone and gadgets win the day. In reality, intelligence is often unglamorous, and deeply dependent on human relationships – the ability to sit across from someone and make them trust you. The best intelligence officers I’ve known were exceptional listeners, not exceptional fighters.”"

            "content": "EXCLUSIVE: Mum's harrowing appeal to find missing daughter before grim truth emerges\n\nWhen Mary Isbell vanished without a trace, her whereabouts were a total mystery. It would take a shock confession eighteen months later before anyone discovered her fate\n\nView 5 Images “I think she got mixed up with the wrong people,” Mary Isbell's mother Debbie told the local press, as she begged for information about her missing daughter\n\nWhen Mary Elizabeth Isbell disappeared, her loved ones were left with unanswered questions, and her teenage son was left without a mum. Mary, 38, was last seen in late 2021. Her ex-husband reported her missing on 27 December when she didn’t call over the festive period to speak to their son.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMary’s mother, Debbie Wood, was very concerned. While Mary was a devoted mum and ran her own home remodelling business, she had also got herself involved in a “bad” crowd and had started dating a new man, but they were constantly arguing. “I think she got mixed up with the wrong people,” Debbie told the local press, as she begged for information about her missing daughter.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nToddler wearing penguin onesie found dead stuffed in bin as teen mum's lies unravel READ MORE :\n\nMary’s boyfriend had been arrested in September 2021 and had been released into a rehab facility two months later. That had essentially left Mary homeless and she had been moving around, staying with different friends in the Alabama area. At her last known location, there were “signs of a struggle,” and Mary hadn’t contacted anyone.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images When Mary Elizabeth Isbell disappeared, her loved ones were left with unanswered questions\n\nThere were some reports that she had been seen near her mum’s house and at her son’s school, but nothing was confirmed. The police started to investigate. Flyers bearing her photo were pinned to noticeboards and shared on social media, while volunteers drove through rural backroads and checked wooded areas, clinging to the hope that she might be found alive.\n\nA Facebook group was set up that continued to appeal for information. Mary’s mum said publicly, “Part of me wants to believe she’s still here, the other part says, ‘Get ready for a funeral if we can find her remains.’”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWith no contact from Mary, the police feared foul play, but without a body or a clear witness, building a case proved painstakingly slow. While there were few leads initially, they continued to keep Mary’s disappearance in the public eye. It would be 18 months before there was a break in the case.\n\nIn June 2023, there was a tip-off that led officers to two women. They had both been on the list of suspects when Mary had first gone missing, but there wasn’t enough evidence at the time to connect them. But with a credible tip-off, the case was about to be blown wide open.\n\nView 5 Images Loretta Kay Carr and her daughter Jessie Kelly\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe women were Loretta Kay Carr and her daughter Jessie Kelly. At first, they both denied any involvement, but then Kelly made a shocking confession. She said she’d helped her mum kidnap Mary, and they had thrown her off a cliff to her death. Kelly said Carr had also been having a relationship with the man Mary had been seeing and on 18 October 2021, they went to confront Mary about it.\n\nCarr and Kelly then attacked Mary and forced her into their vehicle. They drove her against her will to Wolf Creek Overlook at Little River Canyon National Park, about 75 miles away. Carr tied herself with a rope at the barrier at the overlook and forced Mary to climb over the barrier. She was then pushed to her death off the cliff and died at the bottom of the canyon below.\n\nIt was a barbaric act of extreme jealousy – Carr was intent on eliminating a love rival. Kelly agreed to testify against her mother for a reduced sentence and helped the police find the location where Mary died. On 28 June 2023, officers went to the canyon and found human remains at the bottom.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Little River Canyon National Preserve in Alabama\n\nTwo days later, on what would have been Mary’s 39th birthday, the remains were positively identified as the missing mum. The scenic spot known for breathtaking views was isolated, which made it easier for Carr and Kelly to carry out the attack unnoticed, believing the steep drop would conceal the crime indefinitely.\n\nWithout Kelly’s confession, Mary might never have been found but that didn’t mean Kelly deserved mercy. It was revealed that a month after the killing, Carr shared a selfie on social media, taken at the national park, near the murder site. It showed Carr standing on the edge of a cliff, holding the camera up high so it showed the distance to the bottom of the cliff behind her.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Day trip to Little River Canyon and Falls,” she wrote in the caption, adding that the nature preserve was “beautiful and only a little ways from the house”. Carr was there with her new fiancé. The investigator in the case described the crime as the most “heinous” he had seen in his career. Mary’s mother and son were heartbroken. Mary’s son left a message on social media that read, “Love you forever, like you for always, as long as I’m living, my mommy you’ll be.”\n\nView 5 Images Loretta Kay Carr poses by the cliff in Little River Canyon National Preserve, Alabama, where she allegedly threw Mary Elizabeth Isbell to her death\n\nCarr and Kelly were charged with murder. In August 2025, on the day her trial was supposed to start, Kelly, 24, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of murder. She was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Due to Alabama law, Carr was facing the death penalty, and her daughter was due to testify against her. But in February this year Carr, 46, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and kidnapping as part of a plea agreement.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nCarr was sentenced to life in prison and 20 years for kidnapping. The district attorney said, “This is an example of a senseless act destroying a family. A mother is left without a daughter, sisters are left without their sibling, and a son is left without his mother.”\n\nMary’s murder was horrific and Carr’s chilling selfie at the scene of the crime further confirmed her cruelty. While nothing could be done to save Mary, knowing what happened to her and being able to give her remains the dignity she deserved, has brought some peace to her loved ones."

Many suspect they could be codewords but what do they mean? From 'grape soda' to 'dentist', The Mirror explores the theories behind the 'codewords'\n\nView 3 Images The files show a further insight into the life of Jeffrey Epstein (Image: Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nJeffrey Epstein's stomach-churning \"billion-word crime scene\" is said to be littered with so-called 'codewords'.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhile many have focused on the names of the rich and powerful people that feature within the Epstein Files - including Donald Trump Elon Musk and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - it's the most mundane words that are providing some of the most chilling discussions.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFrom \"ice cream\" treats for \"the girls\" and his obsession with sending people to the 'dentist' after a chilling set-up was found at the island, digital sleuths are now trawling the convoluted mess of data and numerous theories have been spawned in the process. While being mentioned in the papers doesn't indicate any wrongdoing, the files also shed light on some other personal details of Epstein's life.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUK police issue major update as Epstein files reveal human trafficking claims READ MORE :\n\nView 3 Images The Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice are littered with words that sleuthes have seized upon (Image: Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)\n\n'Pizza'\n\nThere are more than 800 results in the files for the word pizza. While it may seem like a harmless, takeaway order, the word has triggered a resurgence of the debunked 'Pizzagate' - an unfounded conspiracy theory that claims Democrats harboured child-sex slaves at a pizza restaurant.\n\nThough the wild 2016 allegations involving a DC pizzeria were proven false, the files contain peculiar exchanges referencing the Italian dish. In a 2018 email, Epstein's urologist, Dr. Harry Fisch seems to reference Epstein’s prescription for erectile-dysfunction medication, writing: \"You have refills available.\" Fisch later texts, \"After you use them, wash your hands and lets go get pizza and grape soda.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe has not been accused of wrongdoing, and the appearance of his name does not imply wrongdoing.\n\nAnother email from a redacted contact said: \"Lets go for pizza and grape soda again. No one else can understand.\"\n\nIce Cream\n\nIce cream appears 583 times in the files, often in proximity to \"the girls\". According to New York's Intelligencer, an Epstein employee in Florida told the FBI that Epstein \"enjoyed getting ice cream from a local ice cream parlor with the girls.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman allegedly informed Epstein in a 2014 email that he'd sent two gifts to his Manhattan home, including \"ice cream. if you have any interest, you should try - else for the girls.\" He has not been accused of wrongdoing, and the appearance of his name does not imply wrongdoing.\n\nMr Hoffman has since called on Trump to ensure the victims of Epstein’s \"abhorrent and vile actions\" receive \"all the information they are seeking.\"\n\nElsewhere in the files it emerged Epstein wanted \"sushi and Oreo ice cream\" for a high-stakes meeting with bankers, New York Magazine reports.. That's one of the 35 times \"Oreo ice cream\" appears, while \"cookies and cream\" only appears twice. While \"Sushi\" appears 1,285 times in the files, \"pasta\" appears 409 times.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBeef Jerky\n\nOne of the bizarre \"rabbit holes\" involves 380 mentions of beef jerky. While it was reportedly one of Epstein's favourite snacks, some conspiracy theorists have outlandishly speculated that it's a codeword for cannibalism.\n\nHowever, the files show extensive correspondence from chef Francis Derby, who according to the files worked as Epstein’s private cook, made trips to Little Saint James, and spoke with other Epstein associates about making or supplying, and storing, large amounts of jerky.\n\nIn another email, from 2013, Mr Hoffman told Epstein that \"beef jerky” was one of \"many threads for our next call.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDentist\n\nView 3 Images A dentist's room covered in masks in Epstein's private island home (Image: X)\n\nThe word \"dentist\" crops up 1688 times, and the files show numerous emails to Epstein from people telling him they had just gone to the dentist. Other instances reveal Epstein paid for teeth cleaning and bleaching for others, including royalty.\n\nThe emails took a darker turn when photos taken on his island revealed a room containing a dentist's chair.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWhile his girlfriend Karyna Shuliak, was a dentist, the files suggest the topic was a reoccurring theme in his Manhattan life, with thousands of references to \"teeth\" and \"donations\" linked to medical professionals."

I eat well and exercise regularly but still can't quite shake the feeling that there's something seriously bad going on inside that is just waiting to reveal itself.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPain in my side? Probably cancer. Headache? Definitely a brain tumour. To give myself some credit and make myself sound a bit less unhinged, I have actually had the real-life experience of something seemingly innocuous in my body turning out to be cancer, so it's not as far-fetched a scenario as it sounds.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA couple of years ago I stopped eating ultra-processed food which led to dramatic changes in my weight and fitness. But that's not helped me shake the feeling that every day is a health disaster waiting to happen. So when I was offered the chance to take an at-home test to get a better idea of my health, I jumped at it.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMy Health Checked offers different tests for different aspects of your health, including cholesterol, energy levels, intolerances and vitamin deficiencies. I chose the General Health Blood Test (£95) which promised a \"comprehensive wellness profile, measuring key indicators of your heart, liver and kidney health to help you identify any areas that need attention\". This sounded perfect, especially since I am obsessed with the health of my liver despite rarely exceeding the 14 units a week of alcohol which is the official government guidance for consumption.\n\nThe test arrived in the post and involved taking a blood sample at home then posting it back in the packaging provided for laboratory testing which has met international quality standards and is used for NHS testing.\n\nHow was the test?\n\nIn a nutshell, the test involved pricking my finger with a lancing device then getting a small amount of blood into two separate capsules. All the equipment was provided and the process was carefully set out in written guidance. It was easy to follow, but there was quite a lot of it and it took a lot of concentration.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Steffan Rhys smiles for the camera as he holds a lance to his finger preparing to take a blood test (Image: Steffan Rhys)\n\nView 4 Images Two filled blood vials side by side on a kitchen table (Image: Steffan Rhys)\n\nBlood samples safely collected, I then just had to walk around the corner to a post box to get them sent off. The whole process, from opening the packaging and understanding the process to taking the tests and getting the results in the post, took around 30 minutes. The results were ready within three days, complete with a doctor's note.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe results\n\nWhen the results arrived on my personal My Health Checked dashboard a couple of days later I was nervous. And this is the reason I'm so glad I took the test. There was a message from a doctor to say: \"Everything looks good with your General Health Test results. Your biomarkers are in, or near, the normal range. These are considered markers of good health.\"\n\nThis was a massive boost and I've felt noticeably less anxious about my health in the days since. The results covered my:\n\ncholesterol levels\n\nblood glucose levels\n\nkidney health\n\nliver health.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEach of the above sections was also broken down into far more detailed results, with an explanation for why each one mattered. For example, the liver health element of the test included seven different markers, including bilirubin, albumin and protein levels. It was clearly explained that had these markers been outside the normal range, it could be a sign of liver damage or inflammation. But reassuringly, the results explained: \"If all these markers are in the normal range, it suggests your liver function is normal.\"\n\nView 4 Images Steffan holds up the packaged health test ready for posting (Image: Steffan Rhys)\n\nThey should also have returned a full blood count but there was a technical problem with being able to process this particular section of the test. But I followed up on this and received assurance that there was unlikely to be a problem hiding in these blood results given everything else was showing up as being in good health. They also said they could re-arrange to send a second test or discuss a potential refund as a result of this missing element of the test.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDoes this mean I am in perfect health?\n\nAfter receiving my results, I went back to My Health Checked to ask if I could now be categorically assured that I was in perfect health. They explained that while blood tests \"are not a full screening tool for all major diseases\" that it was fair to say that \"having normal blood results is an indicator that [I am] functioning well and in good health. Having normal cholesterol levels is also a marker of good health.\"\n\nWhat if my results had raised concerns?\n\nThe next step for abnormal results would depend on their significance. For mildly abnormal readings, simple lifestyle measures around diet, alcohol and exercise could be implemented to improve results. For more significant abnormal results, patients would be directed to speak with a healthcare professional such as a GP to discuss the results and next steps in more detail.\n\nHow do I feel about the results?\n\nI can honestly say the results have made a difference to my peace of mind. I may never permanently get rid of my health anxiety, but I have certainly felt a lot more confident about it in the days since I received my results. I'm so glad I took the test for this reason and can recommend it to anyone seeking peace of mind or more information about their health.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nYou can see and buy a My Health Checked test here."

And you don't have to use any injections that can aid in weight loss, as these simple changes could be all you need.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAs well as improving your overall wellbeing, losing weight may help lower your chances of developing issues such as high blood pressure, heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn good news, the NHS notes that weight loss doesn’t require a complete diet overhaul and through its Better Health website, the NHS has outlined a number of straightforward, practical steps that can help you with your goals. This is what you need to know.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSimple habits that can help you lose weight\n\nView 3 Images Weight loss is often achieved through a combination of regular exercise and a balanced diet (Image: Getty)\n\nTo lose weight, most people are advised to cut around 600 calories from their daily intake. This would mean aiming for approximately 1,900 calories per day for men and 1,400 calories per day for women.\n\nYou should also:\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAim for 2 or more portions of veg in a main meal means about half of your plate Always include some protein – like beans, pulses, fish, eggs, lean meat or other types. It helps you stay full. Carbs like potatoes, bread, rice or pasta should make up no more than a third of the food you eat in a day – and try to have wholegrain versions where you can If you eat fish, try to have 2 portions a week. At least 1 portion should be oily fish like salmon, sardines, trout, mackerel or herring Pick lower-fat milk and cheese and go for lower-fat and lower-sugar yoghurts Go for olive, sunflower and rapeseed oil, which have unsaturated fats Choose lower-fat spreads and only eat it in small amounts Drink 6 to 8 cups of fluid a day. Water, lower-fat milk, tea, coffee, sugar-free drinks all count\n\nCan coffee and tea really help me lose weight?\n\nWhile all things are good in moderation, it's not just water that's good for you. According to one study: \"The results of in vitro and animal studies suggest that coffee can reduce storing of fat in the body by several mechanisms.\"\n\nTea is another drink boating several benefits. In a post by Harvard Health, it notes that while \"you won't find many vitamins or nutrients in tea\", it is \"rich in phytochemicals - compounds that give plants their characteristics (such as colour and smell) and have pharmacological effects when we consume them. Tea's primary phytochemicals are caffeine and polyphenols.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Water isn't the only drink that is beneficial for your health (Image: Getty)\n\nAccording to Doctor Frank Hu, chair of the Department of Nutrition and professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health: \"Green tea has more polyphenols than black tea, but black tea has more caffeine.\n\n\"And matcha is dried green tea that's ground into fine particles. It's more concentrated - higher in caffeine and polyphenols than plain green tea.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nSo while water should be your main drink, remember that your regular cup of tea or coffee can also support your weight-loss goals.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

            "content": "Inside my wild night at a Las Vegas casino with Floyd Mayweather: Boxing legend splashed out on caviar, fine whiskey and dropped $500 tips galore - but he baulked at spending his cash on post-night snack, writes Daily Mail's CHARLOTTE DALY\n\nFormer world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr has announced a surprise return to the ring, revealing plans for a fourth comeback that will begin with an exhibition against Mike Tyson before a blockbuster professional rematch with Manny Pacquiao later this year.\n\nThe rivals are set to meet again on September 19 at the Sphere - 11 years after their long-awaited 2015 showdown, when Mayweather claimed a unanimous-decision victory in the so-called 'Fight of the Century.'\n\nPacquiao, now 47, returned to action in July 2025 and fought Mario Barrios to a majority draw for the WBC welterweight title, insisting his comeback is driven by a desire to become world champion again. Mayweather, meanwhile, says he 'still has what it takes to set more records,' despite questions regarding his financial status.\n\nA recent report by Business Insider suggested Mayweather’s widely publicised fortune may be overstated, citing liens, outstanding debts, foreclosures and heavily leveraged assets including property holdings and his private jet.\n\nBack in 2024, I caught a glimpse of life inside Mayweather's orbit - a whirlwind casino evening filled with luxury excess, eye-watering tips and one surprising moment of frugality.\n\nFloyd Mayweather invited Daily Mail Sport for a night out in Las Vegas in an extraordinary offer\n\nCharlotte Daly hit the strip with Mayweather for a big night out in Las Vegas (pictured above)\n\nWhen Floyd Mayweather invites you for a night out in Las Vegas, you know it will be extraordinary. Picture this: the neon lights of the strip reflecting off luxury cars, the pulsating energy of the city that never sleeps, and 'Money Mayweather' at the centre of it all.\n\nFrom exclusive cigar lounges to high-roller tables, this was no ordinary night out. We sipped 'Good Money Whiskey' and indulged in caviar before discussing Mayweather's relationship with his father, the key moments in his career, the current crop of boxers, and his exhibition earnings.\n\nIn true Mayweather style, he arrived at Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot, in a blacked-out SUV, wearing a £2,000 Gucci jacket and a gleaming Rolex. Fans clamoured for photos as he was greeted by models holding sparklers and a glowing Mayweather sign.\n\n'I do like the finer things in life', Mayweather quipped when asked about his love for luxury. 'I enjoy my cars and my watches but money don't make me, I make money.\n\n'I don't just keep all the money either, I give back to the less fortunate. My mother don't want for nothing, my loved ones don't want for anything. My team live a pretty good life. They travel the world, stay at five star hotels. But, the most important thing is, we are happy. I was happy before I made money. With or without money I am a happy person.'\n\nA fixture on the Vegas Strip with his 7,000-square-foot gentleman's club and top-tier boxing gym, Mayweather took charge behind the bar, crafting an Old Fashioned cocktail with his Good Money Whiskey - a brand now available in 10 states including Nevada, California, and Florida.\n\nWhen handed the five-year-old whiskey, Mayweather joked, 'She's come all the way from the UK, and you're giving her the five-year-old whiskey? She deserves the 10-year!'\n\nThough not drinking himself, Mayweather passed the cocktail with a knowing smile. 'It's just like boxing,' he said confidently. 'I had the best team, so I got the best results. I've got the best team working on my brands, too. Just try it and you'll see.'\n\nIn true Mayweather style, he arrived at Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot, in a blacked-out SUV, wearing a £2,000 Gucci jacket and a gleaming Rolex\n\nWith a drink in hand, we moved to Mayweather's exclusive area, adorned with Le Bon Argent Champagne and attentive waitresses ensuring my glass was always full. Intrigued by highlight reels of his career playing on the screens overhead, I asked the boxing legend about his favorite memory.\n\n'I'm not sure which one was my favourite fight but the best fighter I ever fought probably was Manny Pacquiao. I can see why he won so many fights, it's all the moves he would make. But, I reckon the roughest fight I ever had was Emanuel Augustus, he was very tough competitor. When I faced him, I think he was 26 with 14 losses but extremely tough.\n\n'That being said, I think around half of my 50 fights were world title fights, so they were all good fights'.\n\nMayweather faced and defeated some of the biggest names in boxing, including Manny Pacquiao, Oscar De La Hoya, and Canelo Alvarez. He also claimed world titles in five different weight classes: Super Featherweight, Lightweight, Light Welterweight, Welterweight, and Light Middleweight.\n\nBut the true highlight of his career was walking away unharmed—a poignant topic given his father and uncle, Roger, both suffered neurological damage resulting in memory loss.\n\n'The real highlight of my career is that I am still able to communicate. That I am still able to speak well. I am still able to read and write. I am able to spend time with my children and I am able to travel. I still have all my faculties. That's the part about my career I am most pleased with. Not everyone gets that luxury and I've seen it first hand.'\n\nMayweather's relationship with his father has been complex but pivotal. Mayweather Sr. was instrumental in shaping his son's career, developing the defensive style that became his hallmark. Despite public disagreements and periods of estrangement, their bond remains strong.\n\n'My dad was my inspiration growing up. Without my dad I wouldn't have any of this. Without my dad I wouldn't have the crazy real estate portfolio I have. I wouldn't have met my two best friends, James McNair and Ricki Brazil. I wouldn't be here with you today. My dad is my driving force, my dad is everything to me.'\n\nFans clamoured for photos with him as he made his way to Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot\n\nA stark contrast to when Mayweather lashed out at his father in 2011, shouting: 'You couldn't fight for s***. You weren't nothing but a motherf***ing cab driver... bum a** trainer. You weren't s*** as a fighter, so how you gonna be something as a trainer. Get the f*** out my gym f*****t!'.\n\nWhile other kids played, Mayweather's childhood was a whirlwind of responsibilities, juggling time between caring for his drug-addict mother and training with his father.\n\n'My dad was about business, ever since I was a kid. From 1985, my dad had me running five miles a day. He wouldn't let me run in sneakers either. He made me run five miles every day in combat boots while I was a child.\n\n'He also brought me out into the garden and made me chop wood. He always told me, there is no room for excuses. He said no matter how many fights you win, it's never good enough, you can always get better. There is always room for growth.\n\n'But, my dad gave me structure. He helped mould me into the man I am today. A man of honour, a man of dignity. A stand-up guy. A person that believes he can get better. It's all because of my father.'\n\nAs we chatted, one of Floyd's friends casually offered spoonfuls of caviar around the room. This wasn't your average caviar; it was the kind that likely costs more than my entire monthly salary. The nonchalant manner in which it was served, however, made it seem like an everyday snack.\n\nMeanwhile, Eddie Griffin, a comedian from American sitcom Malcolm & Eddie, flitted around the room casually cracking jokes before diving into the high-stakes action at the casino tables.\n\nHaving accompanied him to the high-roller area, I watched in awe as players casually dropped $500k per round on craps. It was clear I'd be spectating rather than participating in this high-rolling spectacle.\n\nA fixture on the Vegas Strip with his 7,000-square-foot gentleman's club and top-tier boxing gym, Mayweather took charge behind the bar, crafting an Old Fashioned cocktail\n\nWhile Mayweather wasn't one to splurge at the tables, he was exceptionally generous with his tips. When $500 slipped from his pocket, he handed it to a waitress without hesitation and quickly pulled out another $500 for her colleague, making sure everyone felt appreciated.\n\nMayweather's wealth stems from his boxing prowess. Known for his defensive mastery and unmatched ring IQ, he earned the nickname 'Pretty Boy' for his flawless, unmarked face. He firmly believes no boxer will ever match his unique skills.\n\n'There will never be another boxer like me because my IQ was just on another level. You've got guys that have fast hands, you've got guys who have great punching power but they will never compete with my IQ.\n\n'My IQ was just on a whole different level. I could make adjustments that other people wouldn't be able to do. Go look at the Shane Mosley fight. Guy hit me with a couple of good shots, I came back the next round and put on a master class.\n\n'I was zoned in and knew exactly what he was going to do. I didn't hear the crowd, I didn't hear my trainer, I just listened to myself. I knew exactly what he was going to do. I had the ability to turn a fight on its head like that. Completely change the dynamic of a fight. That's what it takes, a sharp mind, a good chin and the heart of a lion.'\n\nYet, despite his undefeated boxing record (50-0) and iconic status, Mayweather acknowledged personal defeats beyond the ring.\n\n'Losing my uncle was a defeat. Losing my grandmother was a defeat. Losing my housekeeper of 20-something years was a defeat. Losing the mother of my children was a defeat. Losing my best friend was a defeat. I have been defeated in ways like that. Everything you go through in life is an experience you can grow from. I just try to use those experiences to become stronger every day.'\n\nMayweather's resilience in the face of such personal trials is mirrored in his approach to the racism he faced during his career.\n\nEddie Griffin, comedian from American sitcom Malcolm & Eddie, flitted around the room casually cracking jokes before diving into the high-stakes action at the casino tables\n\nGriffin joking told Mayweather he was going to steal a couple bottles of his whiskey\n\n'You're going to get racism and you're going to have to deal with it. I knew I was going to deal with it but that never stopped me from being who I wanted to be. It never stopped me from believing in myself.\n\n'It was never going to stop me from taking myself to the top. I knew I was the best and nothing was going to hold me back. There are many fighters that will come after me that will experience the same thing.\n\n'I want them to be great and I don't want them to be held back by it. I want them to surpass me if they can. Records are there to be broken but there will never be another Floyd Mayweather. I know that for a fact.'\n\nEven in retirement, Mayweather keeps his love for boxing alive through exhibition bouts, taking on the likes of Deji Olatunji, Tenshin Nasukawa, and Logan Paul.\n\nHowever, the pinnacle was his 2017 clash with MMA's Conor McGregor. While Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and LeBron James collectively earned $259 million that year, Mayweather surpassed that sum in a single night, shattering boxing's pay-per-view record with 6.5 million buys.\n\n'People have such a problem with my exhibitions. Jeff Bezos is well off but he's still working. Warren Buffett, he's probably in his 90's now and he's still working. The Walton's who own Walmart are still working. Elon Musk is still working. So, it's okay for me to work.\n\n'There is no risk with these exhibitions. I am taking on former MMA guys and YouTubers. They can't get near me. It's not a crime for me to have some fun with them and entertain the crowd.\n\n'I feel like I deserve it. I am still one of the most talked fighters in the sport of boxing and I'm not even boxing professionally anymore. So, it's only right I am getting the payday to match it. I have plenty of offers I could show you on my phone. $300million, $100million, $50million, $20million, $17million. They are all offers sat on my phone right now. It all depends but if you pay, we play. It's as simple as that.'\n\nMayweather popped into the local doughnut shop. After ordering two boxes of doughnuts, Mayweather was floored when he was told the total would be $90 (pictured above)\n\nPulling out a thick wad of cash, he went to pay before pausing dramatically, spreading the bills across his hands and playfully quipping 'I've got the money, I just don't want to spend it!'\n\nThe hilarious encounter ended with him handing over the money and taking the doughnuts\n\nDespite having the potential to rake in $300million from an exhibition bout and being nicknamed 'Money Mayweather,' the 47-year-old had a hilariously human moment at the end of our night out.\n\nJust as Brits might hit a kebab shop on their way home, Mayweather popped into the local doughnut shop. After ordering two boxes of doughnuts, Mayweather was floored when he was told the total would be $90.\n\nPulling out a thick wad of cash, he went to pay before pausing dramatically, spreading the bills across his hands and playfully quipping 'I've got the money, I just don't want to spend it!'.\n\nMayweather will return to the ring this summer for a rematch against John Gotti III - the grandson of the late mob boss - having first faced the 31-year-old back in June 2023, with the fight ending in chaos after a brawl broke out when people stormed the ring.\n\n\n\nThe Good Money is a global brand created in direct partnership with Floyd Mayweather. The brand produces high-quality Champagne and Whisky, with their bourbon available to purchase at large retailers such as Total Wine, Specs, Lee's Liquors and WalMart."

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

No finder's fee, no compensation,’ Rueda allegedly wrote in an email to his publicists at the time.\n\nManny Pacquiao is suing a law firm and their client for allegedly fabricating a case against him\n\nThe message never came to light despite a judge ordering Rueda’s messages be turned over in 2018, and was only uncovered from a forensic analysis by Pacquiao’s team in 2023.\n\nPacquiao’s lawyers say they traced the gruesome texts of body parts back to a mass-distributed cartel scam.\n\nRecords cited by his new lawsuit allegedly show identical threats were sent to more than 100 other people unconnected to the case.\n\nAfter losing the case, Withers Bergman tried to withdraw as Rueda’s lawyers, and his attorney Amman Khan’s profile was removed from the firm’s website.\n\nOver a decade on from their first encounter, Pacquiao is set for a stunning rematch with Mayweather in Las Vegas later this year.\n\nA Hollywood waiter sued Pacquiao in 2016 after claiming he was owed an $8million fee for helping to arrange his blockbuster May 2015 fight against Floyd Mayweather (pictured)\n\nThe fight icons will meet again in September in the first ever boxing match at 'The Sphere' off the strip in Sin City, it was announced earlier this week.\n\nThe bout is set to be globally broadcast on Netflix as part of the streamer's growing investment into live sports.\n\nMayweather, 49, first has to take on Mike Tyson, 59, in an exhibition bout this spring. A date and location has not yet been confirmed.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile Pacquiao, 47, has a warm-up fight against Ruslan Provodnikov on April 18, almost a year after his draw with then-WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios."

            "content": "Frank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the administration had briefed several Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress in advance.\n\nIn the wake of the conflict, Mehdi Taj, the president of the Iranian Football Federation, cast massive doubt over their participation in the upcoming summer tournament.\n\nSpeaking on Iranian TV network 'Tehran', according to Marca, he said: 'With what happened today and with that attack by the United States, it is unlikely that we can look forward to the cup.'\n\nIran has reportedly threatened to pull out of this summer's World Cup after US and Israeli airstrikes killed the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (Pictured: Iran's national soccer team in March 2025)\n\nDonald Trump, pictured back in December alongside FIFA president Gianni Infantino, started a military campaign against Iran in the early hours of Saturday\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (pictured) is believed to have been killed after a devastating barrage of 30 bombs obliterated his compound in Iran\n\nHe added: 'But the sports chiefs are the ones who must decide on that.'\n\nShould they choose to participate, Iran could face the United States at the World Cup in Dallas on July 3 if both teams finish second in their respective groups.\n\nThe warning comes just 107 days before the Iranian national team is scheduled to kick off its tournament against New Zealand at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.\n\nFIFA bosses are now reportedly scrambling to manage the fallout just months before the tournament begins across the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nSpeaking at an IFAB meeting in Wales on Saturday, FIFA general secretary Mattias Grafstrom said: 'I read the news the same way you did this morning.\n\n'We had a meeting today and it would be premature to comment on that in detail,' he continued, as officials weigh up the safety of the upcoming summer event.\n\n'But of course we will monitor the developments around all issues around the world.\n\n'We had a final draw in Washington where all teams participated and of course our focus is to have a safe World Cup with everybody participating.'\n\nShould they choose to participate, Iran could face the United States at the World Cup in Dallas on July 3 if both teams finish second in their respective groups\n\nThe warning from Taj comes just 107 days before the Iranian national team is scheduled to kick off its tournament at SoFi Stadium\n\nOn Saturday, explosions were seen and heard across parts of the Iranian capital, with smoke rising above residential areas\n\nVehicles burning in Tehran on Saturday after air strikes by Israel and the US\n\nIran secured their place in a fourth successive World Cup by finishing atop Group A in Asian qualifying, marking them as one of the strongest teams in the AFC.\n\nThey are currently drawn in Group G and are scheduled to play Belgium and New Zealand in Los Angeles, with a final group stage fixture against Egypt in Seattle.\n\nThe team was slated to be based at the Kino Sports Complex in Tucson, Arizona, for the duration of the event, but those plans are now in significant jeopardy.\n\nThe latest intervention comes months after thousands of Iranians were killed by Iran's authoritarian regime in a desperate effort to quell uprisings and protests against Khamenei earlier this year.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump took to Truth Social to say that Khamenei was dead. 'Khamenei, one of the most evil people in History, is dead,' Trump wrote.\n\n'This is not only Justice for the people of Iran, but for all Great Americans, and those people from many Countries throughout the World, that have been killed or mutilated by Khamenei and his gang of bloodthirsty THUGS.\n\n'This is the single greatest chance for the Iranian people to take back their Country.'\n\nKhamenei's death does not guarantee regime change in Iran and Tehran has responded by launching its own attacks across the Middle East.\n\n\n\nIsrael said the initial strikes had targeted three locations in Tehran where intelligence had indicated that top Iranian officials were gathered."

            "content": "In 2016, an image of a topless Martin Castrogiovanni at a Las Vegas pool party alongside then Paris Saint-Germain superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic not only caused uproar, but also brought a dramatic end to the career of one of Italian rugby’s most decorated players.\n\nCastrogiovanni, the hair-bear prop, had told his club employers Racing 92 that year he had a personal matter to attend to in Argentina – the country where he was born – and could not feature in a crunch European semi-final with his old team Leicester.\n\nInstead, he headed Stateside with a throng of multi-millionaire PSG footballers including Ibrahimovic, David Luiz, Angel Di Maria and Marco Veratti for an excessive weekend of drinking and gambling. Castrogiovanni knew Ibrahimovic and Co. as they all played professional sport in Paris. When he was snapped alongside them and the picture went around the world, Castrogiovanni was in trouble. Big trouble.\n\nHe won circa £500 in the Vegas casinos but also lost his lucrative Racing contract and decided to retire later that year.\n\n‘It was tough the way I finished,’ the Azzurri legend tells Daily Mail Sport, ahead of struggling England’s Six Nations visit to Rome on Saturday.\n\n‘I’m now known as the guy who went to Vegas with Zlatan and all that s***.\n\nMartin Castrogiovanni admits he has become known as the guy who went to Las Vegas with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, after this 2016 picture caused uproar after missing a Racing 92 match\n\nThe Azzurri legend, centre, admitted it was tough the way his career ended with the focus drawn away from his achievements in rugby\n\n‘But the problem for me is that’s all people remember. They only remember one part of my life.\n\n‘When you do bad, you tend to pay. People say: “Oh Castro, he did stupid things.” They don’t remember I won four English titles, two French and two European Cups – the most titles of any Italian. They take away the rugby guy I was and remember me as a funny guy. That’s fine.\n\n‘I don’t want to change it because I am here today because of everything that happened.’\n\nAs he reflects on how he is perceived by others, it is unusual to see Castrogiovanni – always such an effervescent character – in serious mode. That soon changes.\n\nI ask him whether that night in Vegas was a good one, regardless of its severe consequences.\n\n‘Of course,’ he says, his smile returning.\n\nCastrogiovanni doesn’t go into further detail. After all, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.\n\nIt’s a funny story, but the forward is right when he says it’s unfair that it should define him. His Vegas antics only served to further establish him as one of rugby’s cult heroes. But Castrogiovanni was a remarkable player. He won 119 Italian caps and had seven trophy-laden years in English rugby with Leicester. The two countries mean a lot to him. Which is why when they meet in Rome on Saturday, Castrogiovanni will be a more-than-interested observer.\n\nCastrogiovanni enjoyed seven trophy-laden years in English rugby with Leicester\n\nAfter back-to-back defeats by Scotland and Ireland followed a 12-Test winning streak, Steve Borthwick’s side is reeling. England have never lost to Italy, but the weekend’s trip looks a potential disaster waiting to happen.\n\n‘England are the only team we’ve never beaten. To do it would be nice,’ Castrogiovanni adds. ‘Italy can win. On a good day, they can win against anyone but the team needs to keep working. Italy needs to be more clinical, but it’s been really, really nice to see the team develop.\n\n‘Now people come up to me and say: “Your team is so good!” That makes me proud. For a long time, all they did was take the p*** out of us.’\n\nAs the traditional whipping boys of the Six Nations, especially in Castrogiovanni’s era, Italy’s Championship place was routinely questioned in the past. Not now.\n\nItaly’s class of 2026 pack more than a punch. They’ve beaten Scotland, came within a disallowed try of downing Ireland (who they destroyed at the scrum) and pushed France far harder than the final scoreline of 33-8 suggested. Gonzalo Quesada’s side will certainly trouble England, whose confidence may be fragile on the back of consecutive, error-strewn displays. Home advantage also favours Italy.\n\n‘I think Italy can still get fourth in the Championship this year,’ Castrogiovanni adds. ‘The last three years have been really good. If we continue with this coach for another four years, it will really help us. We’ve changed coaches a lot and have had a problem with identity. Gonzalo has worked on that.\n\n‘In Italy, it used to be all about the forwards. Now, our forwards follow the backs.\n\n‘Now, the Italian team has an identity.’\n\nIt certainly does.\n\nItaly's current squad packs a punch with centre Tommaso Menoncello among their star names which have helped the national team shake of the status of being Six Nations whipping boys\n\nAnge Capuozzo's Six Nations-ending shoulder injury has been a blow to their chances of making history against England\n\nTheir forwards have a more-than-solid set-piece, as they did in Castrogiovanni’s day, but now behind the scrum Italy have pace and panache in the likes of star centres Ignacio Brex and Tommaso Menoncello and former England training squad member Louis Lynagh, the wing.\n\nA Six Nations-ending shoulder injury suffered by Ange Capuozzo is a blow to their chances of making history against England. Rugby and the Six Nations continues to be a big part of Castrogiovanni’s life. But it is not the be all and end all. On Saturday, he will play wheelchair rugby in Rome to support a charity initiative before heading to the Stadio Olimpico. Since retirement, he has worked in the more glamorous world of television as a presenter on Italian show Tú sí que vales.\n\nQuite the change from the brutal realities of propping the scrum at international level.\n\n‘The format of the show is a bit like Britain’s Got Talent,’ Castrogiovanni adds. ‘Of course, I would have liked to have played my whole life.\n\n‘But it’s not possible. Rugby taught me well for TV. Preparation, focus, how to manage pressure. I love it. In Italy we get maybe 32 per cent of the TV audience. It’s big pressure, but that is good.’\n\nWe finish on Castrogiovanni’s time in England.\n\n‘Leicester was my best club,’ he adds, taking a trip down memory lane.\n\n‘I left a piece of my heart there. We won many things. The Tigers made me the player and character I am.\n\n‘It was a beautiful time in my life. The love of the fans was something I’d never felt before. The style of play suited me a lot. The club was full of really tough people – Martin Corry, Lewis Moody, Manu Tuilagi. I did end up in France eventually, but at one point I was going to leave earlier.\n\nIn retirement, Castrogiovanni has worked in the more glamorous world of television as a presenter on Italian show Tú sí que vales, which he compares to Britain's Got Talent\n\n‘When the fans heard I might leave, they came to the matches dressed as me and drank beer. When I saw that, I realised I didn’t need to go away.\n\n‘I never wanted to leave such love.’\n\nLike the rest of the rugby world, Castrogiovanni has been hit hard by his former team-mate Moody’s motor neurone disease diagnosis.\n\n‘It’s a horrible situation,’ he says. ‘It’s always the best people. If I go to war tomorrow, Lewis is one of the guys I want to take with me – such a nice guy.\n\n‘Always happy. Always helping everyone. Always helping me.\n\n‘It’s so sad. But in rugby, we are taught we don’t leave anyone behind. We won’t do that with Lewis. Apart from it being such a horrible situation, it’s been beautiful to see the rugby world react to it. It is these sorts of situations that show we are different to any other sport.’"

            "content": "The unseen moment that gave Man City a vital win at Leeds as they chase down Arsenal, the star berated by Pep Guardiola and why his young players must heed his 'hectic' warning, writes JACK GAUGHAN\n\nPep Guardiola was conscious not to give Leeds United supporters any further encouragement on the eve of this trip to west Yorkshire when asked to name his favourite and most atmospheric away grounds across a decade in this country.\n\nHe offered up Craven Cottage and Goodison Park. Easy picks, in everybody’s top 10. But also ventured was Vicarage Road, a slightly left-field option which indicated that he had given the question some thought.\n\nAn old romantic, Guardiola said he respected the traditional nature of those places. Elland Road went unsaid but City’s players have been told in no uncertain terms the hostility of this ground and what to expect on each of the four occasions they have travelled over with the Catalan in situ.\n\nSo concerned with the fraught plans of his old friend Marcelo Bielsa, Guardiola once shocked his squad into a brutal double session the day before coming here in 2020.\n\nThe shock in the build-up to this was Erling Haaland’s absence, an injury picked up during training, and a significant blow given his penchant for physical battles – the sort of which Leeds teams have always craved and that is no different with Daniel Farke at the helm.\n\nGuardiola was wary of this descending into chaos, knowing that while City’s attacking players possess all the quality in the world, their tendency to rush has been to the team’s detriment this season. Teaching younger talents to exercise patience has always been something that has required a great deal of that exact trait from the man dishing out the sermons.\n\n‘Too hectic’ is how Guardiola described the forwards on the eve of this victory. Not yet capable of taking a beat, assessing their surroundings, and perfecting the final pass. ‘Always we have time, in football, always you have time,’ Guardiola said. ‘Good pass, good control.’\n\nPep Guardiola described his Man City forwards as 'too hectic' before their win at Leeds - and that's the exact trait they displayed\n\nThe need for calm was evident from the start as Leeds swarmed. Bernardo Silva’s loose pass 30 yards out was seized upon and Dominic Calvert-Lewin was missing a presentable chance just 11 seconds later.\n\nGuardiola called for Rayan Ait-Nouri to head back towards Gianluigi Donnarumma when inside the home half to take the sting out of proceedings. And he also went mad at Omar Marmoush for a rush of blood in choosing to shoot from an acute angle rather than squaring.\n\nMarmoush also rushed a ball into a crowded Antoine Semenyo after a superb line-splitting pass by Rayan Cherki.\n\nThese are the moments that Guardiola is pinpointing when discussing their need for improvement.\n\n‘We have a lot of actions this season, one against one, or two on two or even three on two and we didn’t finish it well,’ he said. ‘Relax, make a good pass and make a good shot. Always I had the feeling that you have one portion of time, one second.\n\n‘You believe you don’t have time but you (always) have one frame of time to take a better decision.’\n\nEnter Cherki, following these words to the letter during a debut Premier League campaign that is making his price tag appear better than a bargain at £31million. He didn’t execute the assist for Semenyo’s winner but without him listening to the manager, City do not win this game and do not go within two points of Arsenal.\n\nRayan Cherki's pass to Rayan Ait-Nouri, who assisted Antoine Semenyo's goal, typified the approach Guardiola wants his men to take\n\nAs the seconds ticked down to half-time, Cherki waited and waited for Ait-Nouri’s run. And then waited a bit longer. The Algerian bustled into a position of strength and the pass was perfect to gather, crossing for Semenyo to tap in. Guardiola could barely contain himself on the touchline, pointing in celebration at Cherki, the 22-year-old doing the same back. It had been exactly what was preached.\n\n\n\n‘For me, his best game,’ Guardiola said. When even the club’s maverick understands these Guardiola fundamentals, City must definitely be on a positive trajectory."

            "content": "A footnote in Formula One history is someone many of us thought was a washed-up American TV executive with bushy eyebrows and John McCricick-like sideburns.\n\nHe wore an extravagant collection of bespoke double-breasted blazers of varying patterns. His name was Sean Bratches, and he made fools of all us doubters, certainly in one significant regard.\n\nFor it was his initiative to go ahead with the Netflix series Drive to Survive that has converted a once ear-splittingly loud sport mostly for blokes, into a modern phenomenon for all ages, classes and sexes. Or a ‘phenom’, as Sean might say.\n\nIndeed, the F1 movie that broke box-office figures last year – Brad Pitt’s most successful film commercially – stood on the shoulders of Drive to Survive’s cut-through.\n\nThe cameras moved in after Liberty Media bought the business from Bernie Ecclestone, and CVC Capital, in 2017. That deal was done for between £5billion and £6bn. Now a single team, led by Ferrari, are valued at up to £4.8bn. Netflix and the impact of Sean RH Bratches, formerly a senior figure at ESPN and a keen lacrosse player in the Eighties, is a strand of the growth, helped by the serendipity of early broadcasts coming out during lockdown.\n\nWhat else was there to do back then other than sit back and watch a fun, fluffy, sometimes acted-for-the-cameras confection? Just you weren’t so keen if you were a diehard F1 fan. Too much showbiz for the purist.\n\nSean Bratches (above) made the decision to go ahead with the Netflix series Drive to Survive\n\nDrive to Survive has helped Formula One gain a much wider appeal than ever before\n\nRegardless, the ubiquitous boom microphones still hover overhead across all 24 paddocks telling its version of the season, and you wonder whether a private indiscreet word spoken privately to a friend will be aired to your embarrassment. And drivers, half aware of the spying eye, might tense up in ostensibly private discussion, though the teams have a right to veto coverage they don’t like before it is streamed.\n\nNetflix’s incursion is a price most of the F1 cast are prepared to accept with varying degrees of reluctance, aware of its overall importance to Formula One’s fortunes. Although especially aimed at an American audience and entry-levellers everywhere, the Netflix experiment has worked better than in most other sports. F1’s intriguing culture lends itself to fly-on-the-wall eavesdropping.\n\nNetflix stands in a line with the BBC, followed by Fleet St newspapers, as one of the biggest media promoters of the sport over the years.\n\nThe BBC’s coverage of James Hunt’s 1976 title win in the soaking wet in the foothills of Mount Fuji stands out, part of a TV rights deal brokered by Ecclestone that ran through the Seventies and Eighties and was even more transformational than Netflix.\n\nHunt wrote under his own byline the front-page splash in the Daily Mail that day in Japan with the help of his amanuensis, my late colleague Ian Wooldridge: ‘By all the laws of humanity I should not be motor-racing champion of the world,’ having driven through terrifying spray to pip Niki Lauda to the title. Hunt’s intro shows that no degree of hyperbole is entirely new in the presentation of Formula One tales for the titillation of mass audiences.\n\nWhich brings us on to Drive to Survive’s eighth series, which is airing now ahead of next Sunday’s opening race in Melbourne, where Lando Norris starts his championship defence for McLaren. Norris’s team appear to be third fastest going into the season, with Mercedes on top and Ferrari close behind, with Red Bull fourth, and then a big drop to the rest of the field. Haas and Alpine are perhaps next closest.\n\nSpeaking of Red Bull, Netflix leaned on their star protagonist, their hardy perennial pantomime villain, Christian Horner, who was sacked by Red Bull in July. He awaits his next crack at Formula One, and has secured serious financial backing to buy into Alpine, though he might be up for Ferrari if their high hopes fall flat on their face and he were given total control of affairs in Maranello. Which, if they had eyes to see, he would be.\n\nOne of the most captivating episodes is centred on Horner and his former Spice Girl wife Geri. It is only 38 minutes long, but I can reveal that he turned down overtures to star in a spin-off series based on him, and his life and wife, alone.\n\nIt would have looked too try-hard, too cringy, so he was probably wise to shun extra exposure, rather than play the slightly elder statesman awaiting his next job.\n\nWe see one scene that surely played a part in his defenestration: the 2025 season launch, at the O2. He went on stage, only to be roundly booed. ‘S***!’ said Lewis Hamilton. And Horner’s drivers Liam Lawson Max Verstappen were shocked: ‘Mate, how in London?’\n\nGeri Halliwell and Christian Horner feature in one of the more captivating episodes\n\nA shocked Lewis Hamilton said 's***' as he heard the reaction to Horner's entrance at the O2\n\nHorner got off stage and sat down next to his Red Bull nemesis Oliver Mintzlaff, bruised and battered by his churlish treatment, rather than rejoin him in triumph. It was a public humiliation, a weakening of his position, in front of sponsors and drivers. Yes, in London, a Brit ribbed by his own.\n\n‘He went up there, like “I’m going to rock the room,” but the room rocked him,’ smirked his detractor Toto Wolff, of Mercedes.\n\nHorner countered: ‘When you become a serial winner the audience doesn’t want to see that.\n\n‘In F1, there’s an element of pantomime. We are like the Kardashians on wheels. I am past caring what people think.’\n\nLater with Geri, in a stables at their Oxfordshire home, he says of his sacking: ‘All done and dusted. I feel a real sense of loss and hurt.\n\n‘I didn’t really get a chance to say a proper goodbye. I never imagined to be in this position. Your immediate reaction when you’re delivered a s*** sandwich like that is, “F*** them.” I’ve had something taken away from me that wasn’t my choice, that was very precious to me.’\n\nThe series has little access to Hamilton but his replacement as Mercedes No 1 George Russell is quite forthright, needling Verstappen, the four-time world champion with whom he is hardly bosom pals.\n\n‘The Verstappens clearly have a lot of power in Red Bull,’ he argued. ‘They like to manipulate situations quite a lot. ‘For whatever reason, they don’t like Horner and they are trying to get Horner out.\n\n‘I wonder if all of this (Verstappen to Mercedes rumours) are a bit of a play and a stir, trying to put pressure on Red Bull that he’ll only continue there if Christian is gone.’\n\nHorner disagreed, saying: ‘I think this was a decision that was made by Oliver Mintzlaff with Helmut (Marko, the now deposed motorsport adviser to the wider Red Bull group) advising from the sidelines.\n\nMax Verstappen (left) and George Russell (right) have plenty of needle in the series\n\n‘Ultimately things changed within the business, within the group. And after Dietrich (Mateschitz, Red Bull’s founder) died, I was probably deemed to have maybe too much control.’\n\nWhat else? McLaren’s internal title tensions between Norris and Oscar Piastri were dealt with on a superficial level, but no great fireworks were lit. Enter Flavio Briatore, de facto Alpine supremo, in his sumptuous and stylish home.\n\nThe wily old owl Briatore well-positioned to take over from Horner as chief pantomime villain. After all, he chucked his driver Jack Doohan under the bus pronto. ‘I’m not a dictator,’ explained Briatore. ‘But you do whatever I tell you to do or you are out.’\n\nNoting the emotional side of young drivers, the Italian opined: ‘Sometimes you want a stick to beat them over the head.’\n\nThat is old-school chat for a modern audience. Yet theatrical goldust to Netflix and Formula One. Ka-ching!"

            "content": "Dave Portnoy slams 'traitors' opposing Donald Trump's Iran strikes as it emerges Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is dead\n\nDave Portnoy has insisted the United States 'is on the right side of history' after attacking Iran alongside Israel and killing the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to try and bring about regime change.\n\nIsrael said on Saturday afternoon that Khamenei, 86, was killed in the airstrike on his compound in Tehran, the Iranian capital, with Donald Trump later confirming his death via Truth Social and vowing to continue 'heavy and pinpoint bombing... uninterrupted throughout the week or, as long as necessary to achieve our objective.'\n\nThe attack came shortly after Iran and the United States were in negotiations to curb Iranian efforts to ever obtain a nuclear weapon in exchange for sanction relief that has crippled the Iranian economy.\n\nIt appears those unsuccessful talks were the trigger for the intervention but Democrats decried that Trump had taken action without congressional authorization. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the administration had briefed several Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress in advance.\n\nWriting before Israel first said that Khamenei had been found dead Portnoy, a Trump supporter at the last election, slammed those attacking the President for making such a bold and risky move.\n\n'I always laugh at yo-yo’s who don’t have the 1st clue what information the President had that forced this decision. Even politicians who despise him but were briefed on the situation seem to agree with this operation,' Basrstool Sports founder Portnoy wrote.\n\nDonald Trump started a military campaign against Iran in the early hours of Saturday\n\nDave Portnoy said the United States 'is on the right side of history' with its latest actions\n\n'I guess lotta podcasters know better,' he added, with a crying-with-laughter emoji. 'Gotta keep the lights on somehow. Borderline traitors if you ask me.'\n\nThe latest intervention also comes months after thousands of Iranians were killed by Iran's authoritarian regime in a desperate effort to quell uprisings and protests against the Khomenei earlier this year.\n\nReferencing the violent response to those protests, Portnoy continued: 'Iran is a terror nation with a long history of some of the worst human rights atrocities in the world.\n\n'Nobody disputes that fact. They hate Americans. They hate Israel. They hate all Jews. They hate the West.\n\n'They would kill us all if given the chance. They just murdered tens of thousands of their own people. The rest of the Middle East is on our side.\n\n'The Iranian people are on our side. It isn’t that complicated to support our Troops and our country this morning. We are on the right side here. God Bless America.'\n\nIt comes as New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the attack was a 'catastrophic escalation', comments echoed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n'This war is unlawful. It is unnecessary. And it will be catastrophic,' she said.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is believed to be dead after strikes hit Tehran\n\nPresident Trump, meanwhile, took to Trutg Social to say that Khamenei was dead.\n\n'Khamenei, one of the most evil people in History, is dead,' Trump wrote. 'This is not only Justice for the people of Iran, but for all Great Americans, and those people from many Countries throughout the World, that have been killed or mutilated by Khamenei and his gang of bloodthirsty THUGS.\n\n'This is the single greatest chance for the Iranian people to take back their Country.'\n\nKhamenei's death does not guarantee regime change in Iran and Tehran has responded by launching its own attacks in the Middle East.\n\n\n\nIsrael said the initial strikes had targeted three locations in Tehran where intelligence had indicated that top Iranian officials were gathered."

I heard this noise and the light came on in my room. There were two people in there\",' Killick told News Corp.\n\n'He [the trainer] said his roommate picked up a chair. The intruders said \"this is Vegas\" and they ran out of the room.\n\n'Georgia Willey said the same thing happened to them.\n\nWomen's footy star Indie Bostock (pictured with Tevita Naufahu) woke up to find an intruder in her hotel room in the early hours of Friday morning\n\nThe bearded man, who was wearing a beanie, ran out of the room when Bostock and her teammate Georgia Willey (pictured) woke up\n\n'They woke up to a guy in their room with a beard and a beanie on. He ran out of the room.\n\n'Parents have trusted me [with their daughters].\n\n'A couple of the girls said sometimes when another door in the floor gets closed, their door gets open.\n\n'This could have been the worst outcome.'\n\nBostock summed up the frightening ordeal in a post to Instagram, writing: 'Hotel swap because while in Vegas for a tournament your hotel room gets broken into and five [sic] a six-foot man standing in your room at 4am.'\n\nKillick also revealed that parents who are in Vegas to watch their daughter play were confronted by an axe-wielding man in a supermarket, who was disarmed by security before he could rob them.\n\nDespite the drama, the Angels have won their way through to the final of the event, where they'll face the Sydney Roosters.\n\nThis year's Nines tournament in Sin City features 46 teams, many of which come from the USA and England.\n\nWilley (pictured playing for Canberra) and Bostock are part of the Aus Vegas Angels team that has made it through to the final of the Nines tournament in Sin City\n\nJeff Killick, who is coaching Bostock (pictured playing for the Dragons) in Vegas, said the incident with the intruder could have led to 'the worst outcome'\n\nThe chilling incident with the intruder isn't the first time rugby league's foray into America has been hit by crime.\n\nIn 2024, journalists were left fearing for their safety in the lead-up to the first matches in Vegas.\n\nOne footy reporter was bailed up by a knife-wielding man while working late at night in the beachside Los Angeles suburb of Santa Monica, with the Roosters and Broncos basing themselves in the city before flying to Vegas.\n\nThe man accused the journalist of damaging his car but left when the Australian denied the accusation.\n\nAnother incident saw a separate reporter and his TV crew fear for their lives when they were hemmed in by three cars during a late-night job in Westlake Village, a short drive north of Los Angeles.\n\nThey were filming their report when the vehicles converged on them from different directions and cornered them.\n\nThe crew managed to finish their report, with the journalist believing that one of his colleagues saved them when he made a phone call and possibly led the people in the cars to believe he was contacting the police.\n\n'It was the most terrifying experience of my life,' the reporter said.\n\n'It was the first time in my life that I thought I was going to die.\n\n\n\n'The honest feeling was we were either going to be robbed or killed. I was genuinely worried about not surviving.'"

'We have good nutritionists and they adapt to what the team needs.\n\n'We cannot adapt the schedule for the Premier League [kick-off] times and I think they are used to it - they are not young and have been playing [for] many years during this period.\n\n'For the players I think it is not new. Both Rayans, Omar and Khusa, it is not the first time for [observing] Ramadan and they know perfectly how to handle it.'\n\nThe break in play lasted for around a minute as Pep Guardiola relayed instructions to his team\n\nSpeaking on BBC Five Live, former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson highlighted the importance of the breaks.\n\nHe said: 'I think it's very good for the players. We talk about the athletes and how fine-tuned they are at the moment.\n\n'To go that long without food and drink, it is vitally important that they have that break.'\n\nThe Premier League confirmed earlier this month that Ramadan breaks would be used in matches again this season to allow players to break their fast during the holy month, which runs from February 17 to March 19.\n\nGiven sunset in the UK ranges from around 5PM to 6.30PM during this period, the only games that are affected are 5:30PM kick-offs on a Saturday and the 4:30PM kick-off on a Sunday.\n\nThe protocol for these breaks sees teams and match officials discuss pre-match whether a pause is required, before they settle on an approximate time when the stoppage will take place.\n\nIt was in 2021 when Ramadan breaks were introduced, with Leicester City's clash against Crystal Palace in April of that year being the first occasion they were seen.\n\nDuring that match, play was paused at a goal-kick on around 30 minutes to allow Leicester's Wesley Fofana and Palace's Cheikhou Kouyate to take on board liquids and energy gels.\n\nIt has since become a regular occurrence to see games halted during Ramadan.\n\nMan United's FA Cup clash against Fulham last March was one example, with the match stopped to allow Noussair Mazraoui to break his fast.\n\nAlongside the City quartet, Muslim stars in the Premier League include Mohamed Salah, William Saliba, Fofana and Amad Diallo, while City legends Ilkay Gundogan, Riyad Mahrez and Yaya Toure are also Muslim.\n\nSpeaking back in 2023, former Everton and Watford star Abdoulaye Doucoure hailed the top flight for its work in making Muslim players feel welcome.\n\n'In the Premier League you are free to do whatever suits you. They will never do anything against your faith and this is great,' he told BBC Sport.\n\n'I fast every day, I don't miss any day. It has become normal and very easy for me.\n\n'Training is still the same during Ramadan but when we go [for away matches], we might need to eat later than the others so the chef prepares food for us, making sure everything is in place as at home. We get halal food so there are no problems.'\n\nIn 2022, former Liverpool player Sadio Mane also revealed the club altered their training schedules to support their Muslim players during the month of Ramadan.\n\nA Kick It Out statement read: 'It’s massively disappointing that some Leeds United fans jeered when Manchester City’s players broke their fast during the first half of the match at Elland Road this evening. This was compounded by the fact that an explanation was displayed on a big screen inside the stadium.\n\n'Pausing the game to allow Muslim players to break their fast during Ramadan has been an agreed protocol for several years now. It’s an important and visible part of making the game welcoming for Muslim players and communities.\n\n'But as tonight’s reaction shows, football still has a long way to go in terms of education and acceptance.'"

We normally drop in the second half but that didn’t happen today: we didn’t concede anything.\n\n\n\n‘It was long balls where we struggled. It was more uncomfortable but we defended really well.

'Money' Mayweather ended up winning that bout by unanimous decision, though fans were left disappointed with the actual fight, believing the long-awaited bout came several years too late.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut boxing fanatics will now get the opportunity to see the pair face off once more. It marks the 49-year-old Mayweather’s first professional fight since he retired in August 2017 after beating Conor McGregor.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

He has since fought the likes of Logan Paul, Aaron Chalmers and John Gotti III in a series of exhibition bouts, most recently against the latter in August 2024.\n\nPacquiao, 47, retired from the sport to focus on his political career in 2021 but returned to the ring last July to fight WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios, who retained his title after a draw. The Filipino boasts a record of 62-8-3 and has fought eight times as a professional since his defeat to Mayweather.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFloyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao set for bank busting rematch at Las Vegas Sphere READ MORE :\n\nMike Tyson 'agrees' next super fight against Floyd Mayweather in shock location READ MORE :\n\nIt seems neither boxer will be fighting out of financial necessity, however, given their mammoth respective net worths. As of February 2026, Celebrity Net Worth claims the flamboyant Mayweather has a net worth of £74million ($100m). That’s despite his total career earnings standing at more than £888m ($1.2billion).\n\nMayweather's 2015 bout with Pacquiao became the highest-grossing fight in boxing history, generating over £444m ($600m). Just two years later, he came out of retirement to fight UFC legend McGregor in a crossover boxing event that earned him another nine-figure payday.\n\nYet, despite his nickname and his reputation as one of the wealthiest boxers on the planet, the American’s net worth is actually less than half of Pacquiao’s reported wealth.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Mayweather earned his biggest purse up to that point when he beat Pacquiao in 2015 (Image: JOHN GURZINSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe Filipino, who is also an actor, singer, endorser and a politician, reportedly has a net worth of £163m ($220m). He was born into poverty in the Philippines and began boxing professionally at the age of 16 to help support his family.\n\nThe 'PacMan' transitioned into politics in 2010, becoming a congressman and later a senator in his home country alongside his boxing career. Throughout his career, Pacquiao has earned at least £370m ($500m) from fights and various endorsements.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe fight against Mayweather was the biggest and most lucrative of his career. He raked in a reported £96m ($130m), while his opponent’s earnings were around £185m ($250m). That made him the second-highest paid athlete in the world in 2015 behind Mayweather. Pacquiao has also enjoyed a fruitful career in the entertainment industry, appearing in several Filipino films.\n\nMeanwhile, Mayweather is one of the few athletes to have earned more than $1bn across his entire career. He previously signed a deal with luxury watch company Hublot and has endorsed Burger King in the past. Mayweather is also known for wearing Cagau jewellery and promoting his own boxing company, TMT Promotions."

Only Worthy and John Ross (4.22 in 2017) were faster in that span.\n\nInterestingly, the player who ran just before Thompson on Saturday, LSU wide receiver Zavion Thomas, ran an official 4.28 clocking.\n\nSeveral personnel evaluators in Lucas Oil Stadium on Saturday said they couldn't remember players who had run 40s in the 4.2s on back-to-back attempts. Thompson and Thomas were also among three official 40 times at this year's combine that were timed under 4.30.\n\nMississippi State's Brenen Thompson was one of three prospects to post sub-4.3 times in the 40-yard dash at this year's NFL combine. AP Photo/Michael Conroy\n\nOhio State safety Lorenzo Styles Jr. ran an official 4.27 40 on Friday.\n\nThompson, who measured in at 5-foot-9 and 164 pounds at the combine, played one season at Mississippi State and set a school record with 1,054 yards receiving in 2025, which also was best in the Southeastern Conference last season. Thompson also played two seasons at Oklahoma and one at Texas.\n\nHe averaged 39.8 yards per touchdown over the course of his career. This past season he had 12 receptions of at least 30 yards and five of at least 50 yards."

Calipari was with Kentucky at the time.\n\nThe Gators (23-6, 14-2 SEC) closed an unbeaten February with their ninth consecutive win and locked up their first regular-season championship since 2014. They remain two games ahead of No. 17 Alabama with two to play and can wrap up the outright title Tuesday night at home.\n\nBut they didn't wait to celebrate.\n\nWith a sold-out crowd and ESPN's College GameDay on hand, Florida turned Billy Donovan Court into a party spot. Coach Todd Golden was front and center as the team doled out hats and T-shirts and cut down nets. It wasn't Golden's first time in the spotlight Saturday night, either.\n\nGolden and Calipari got double technicals early in the second half after screaming at each other near midcourt. Calipari's assistants pulled him away. Golden turned and riled up the 11,000-plus in attendance.\n\nRueben Chinyelu and the Gators clinched at least a share of the Southeastern Conference regular-season title with a 111-77 win over Arkansas on Saturday night. Travis Register/Imagn Images\n\nIt was one of the few highlights in a game that was pretty much over early.\n\nThe Gators dominated on both ends, making plays inside and out, and built a 30-point lead with 13 minutes to play. The biggest surprises were bench players Urban Klavzar and Isaiah Brown. Klavzar hit his first four 3-pointers and finished with 14 points, and Brown scored 11 thanks partly to two treys.\n\nBut it was Florida's big men who controlled the tempo most of the way. Haugh, Chinyelu and Alex Condon had their way inside, helping the Gators outrebound Arkansas 51-31 and win the battle in the paint.\n\nBilly Richmond III led the Razorbacks (21-8, 11-5) with 22 points, including 14 in the first 15 minutes. Darius Acuff Jr., who leads the SEC in scoring and assists, finished with 17 points and six assists.\n\nFlorida guard Boogie Fland, facing his former team, was one of seven Gators in double figures and helped end Calipari's six-game winning streak in Gainesville.\n\nFlorida has won six in a row against ranked teams and scored at least 90 points in each of those. It's the second-longest such streak in college basketball history. The longest mark is shared by UNLV and Loyola-Marymount, both in the 1989-90 season."

All three are records for quarterbacks since at least 2003, according to ESPN Research.\n\nIndianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr., who was selected with the No. 4 pick in the 2023 draft, had the previous bests for a quarterback in the vertical and broad jumps in that span -- 40½ inches and 10 feet 9 inches respectively. Green's 40 time is now the first sub-4.4 clocking for quarterback since at least 2003.\n\nThe previous best 40 for a quarterback was a 4.41 by Robert Griffin III, coming off a Heisman Trophy season at Baylor, at the 2012 combine.\n\nGreen's performance comes in a year when the quarterback rankings, beyond the expected No. 1 pick of the draft in Indiana's Fernando Mendoza, are still in flux for many in the league. Green is the No. 8-rated quarterback in ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr.'s latest position rankings.\n\nGreen was a four-year starter in college -- two years at Boise State and two at Arkansas. This past season he threw for 2,714 yards with 19 touchdowns and 11 interceptions to go with 777 yards rushing as well as eight rushing touchdowns.\n\nHe had eight 300-yard passing games in his two seasons at Arkansas.\n\nSome scouts have said he will need to gain more consistency in his throwing motion, which is an extended delivery."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nMIAMI -- If Kevin Durant ultimately decides to chase more Olympic gold, Erik Spoelstra seems interested in coaching him.\n\nSpoelstra, the Miami Heat coach who will lead the U.S. men's basketball team at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, said Saturday he's aware of Durant's recent comments about the potential of playing for what would be a fifth gold medal.\n\nAnd the concept is clearly intriguing.\n\n\"Just him saying that is incredible,\" Spoelstra, an assistant on the 2024 Olympic team, said before the Heat beat Durant and the Houston Rockets 115-105. \"You know, that's the culture of USA Basketball. You just want the best American players to raise their hand and say, 'I want to do this.'\"\n\nWhen the 2024 Games were complete, Durant said he wouldn't rule out playing in the Olympics again. And Durant told ESPN's Vincent Goodwill in a recent interview that he \"would love to\" play in the Los Angeles Games, adding that he wants his level of play between now and then to convince USA Basketball managing director Grant Hill, national team director Sean Ford, Spoelstra and anyone else involved in the selection process that he's worthy of a spot.\n\n\"I want to produce on the floor and make Grant and whoever is making the decisions want to put me on the team,\" Durant said in that interview. \"I don't want -- not just for seniority. I want to still prove I can help the team win.\"\n\nSaturday he elaborated: \"Hopefully I get that chance. I've got to stay on top of my game. I keep saying that. I want to earn my spot on the team. Got to stay on top of my game and hopefully I'm out there with Coach Spo and his staff.\"\n\nDurant gave his time with Spoelstra at the Paris Games rave reviews.\n\n\"I've always been impressed with Coach Spo from afar, but to be in the same locker room with him, to see his intensity, his scouts just made me want to run through a wall,\" Durant said. \"He was so enthused about being an assistant coach on Team USA and he understood that we wanted to make a statement out there as a team and he backed us.\"\n\nDurant's place in USA Basketball lore was secured long ago.\n\nHe's the only four-time gold medalist in men's Olympic basketball history after winning golds in London 2012, Rio de Janeiro 2016, the Tokyo Games that were delayed a year until 2021, then Paris in 2024. In Paris, he became the career leader in points for the U.S. in Olympic competition, passing Lisa Leslie for that mark.\n\n\"You can feel his passion for representing the country and having the USA on the jersey,\" Spoelstra said. \"He's been incredible in those competitions.\"\n\nDurant said one of the big takeaways from his time with Spoelstra in Paris was how someone who is a head coach -- an NBA champion head coach, at that -- serve as an assistant. As part of Golden State coach Steve Kerr's staff in Paris, Spoelstra was on the floor after practices and before games to work with players individually, throwing passes in warmups, even rebounding for them.\n\n\"Just doing the dirty work. Spo was great at that,\" Durant said. \"He made it exciting to come into work every day.\"\n\nSpoelstra says the 37-year-old Durant's game is timeless -- proven by the fact that the No. 6 scorer in NBA history, who is on pace to pass Michael Jordan for the No. 5 spot in the coming weeks, is still putting up numbers almost unheard of for someone at that age. At 26.2 points per game this season -- 32 of them coming Saturday -- Durant could pass Jordan in about 10 games, or sometime around the third week of March.\n\n\"He's an absolute tactician in terms of his work ethic and how he drills,\" Spoelstra said. \"It's a great lesson for all the young players coming into the league. There's one thing to get up shots and there's another thing to really work player development and I think that's a takeaway that we all had, watching him work during the summer, those six weeks.\n\n\"After practice, before practice, the days in between, he's going in there with intention to try -- even at this age -- to get better and improve. What a beautiful mindset that is.\"\n\nInformation from the Associated Press was used in this report."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nMichigan guard L.J. Cason suffered a torn right ACL and will miss the rest of the season, the school announced Saturday.\n\nThe injury occurred in the Wolverines' win over Illinois on Friday night.\n\n\"This isn't how I wanted my season to end, but I trust God's plan, and I'll attack rehab the same way I approach everything -- with focus and determination,\" Cason said. \"We've got many goals as a team, and I'll be locked in supporting my brothers every step of the way.\"\n\nCason, a 6-foot-2 sophomore, had emerged as one of the premier backup guards in college basketball this season, providing a consistent boost off the bench for No. 3 Michigan. He was averaging 8.4 points and 2.4 assists in 18.6 minutes, making more than 40% of his 3-point attempts. Cason had nine points and two assists in just 13 minutes against Illinois before suffering the injury.\n\nHe had scored in double-figures in four of his last six games entering Friday night, including an 18-point performance in the Wolverines' comeback win against Northwestern earlier this month.\n\n\"First and foremost, our hearts hurt for L.J.,\" coach Dusty May said. \"You never want to see a young man who has poured so much into this program have something like this happen. However, if there's anyone equipped to handle this and the rehab process, it's L.J. He's resilient, he's disciplined, and he has an incredible support system around him.\"\n\nWith Cason out, the point guard duties will fall almost solely on Elliot Cadeau. Cadeau has made major strides since transferring from North Carolina last spring, but Cason's consistent play has limited Cadeau. He has played more than 30 minutes just twice since January. The junior guard is averaging 10.1 points and 5.5 assists, shooting a career-best 38.4% from 3.\n\nMichigan, which clinched the outright Big Ten regular-season title Friday, wraps up the regular season with games against Iowa and Michigan State next week."

            "content": "FIFA has introduced a new system for the 2026 World Cup knockout stages that will see the top four seeded teams avoid each other until at least the semi-finals of next summer's 48-team tournament.\n\nIn a tennis-style, similar to the one adopted by FIFA during last summer's Club World Cup, the top two teams in the current FIFA rankings - Spain (1) and Argentina (2) - will be on opposite draw pathways, as will the third and fourth-ranked sides, France and England, to ensure competitive balance.\n\nAs a result, the four nations will be placed in different quadrants of the knockout phase and will be separated into pots. Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

You can't even dream about something like that.\"\n\nWhen Troy Parrott arrived for international duty with the Republic of Ireland last Monday, little did he know that six days later, he would have catapulted his country to the World Cup play-offs.\n\nFirst, there was an impressive 2-0 win against Portugal.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, was killed in a joint American-Israeli operation targeting Iran, state media confirmed on state media Saturday.\n\nThe Iranian government has announced 40 days of mourning. The country's supreme leader was killed following an attack launched by the U.S. and Israel on Saturday against Iran as part of a major military campaign intended to topple the Islamic regime.\n\nIsrael's military said that top Iranian security officials were among those killed, including the country's defense minister, the commander of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, and the secretary of the Iranian Security Council, a close adviser to Khamenei.\n\nHours earlier, Trump posted on Truth Social that Israel, with U.S. support, had killed Khamenei.\n\n\"He was unable to avoid our Intelligence and Highly Sophisticated Tracking Systems and, working closely with Israel, there was not a thing he, or the other leaders that have been killed along with him, could do,\" Trump said. He added, \"The heavy and pinpoint bombing, however, will continue, uninterrupted throughout the week or, as long as necessary to achieve our objective of PEACE THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AND, INDEED, THE WORLD!\"\n\nKhamenei was killed by an Israeli strike, a person briefed on the strike told NPR. The NPR source requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly. Trump did not confirm that the strike was carried out by Israel.\n\nIran also did not confirm the deaths of other leaders.\n\nThe wave of airstrikes began after sunrise in Iran, with huge explosions ringing out in the capital Tehran. Videos showed large plumes of thick smoke.\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry called the attack a \"gross violation\" of its national sovereignty. A statement said the airstrikes hit both military and civilian targets.\n\nThe Iranian Red Crescent Society relief group said more than 200 people were killed in strikes across Iran.\n\n\"They have hit many targets around me and we hear fighter jets and missiles exploding,\" said a resident in western Tehran reached by phone before communications were cut in Iran. Like other Iranian residents interviewed by NPR, they did not want to use their names for fear of arrest. \"People were panicking and trying to get to their homes. Children are running out of school.\"\n\nIranian state media said one of the airstrikes hit a girls' primary school in southern Iran, killing at least 85 children, according to the local prosecutors office. The prosecutors said more girls were still buried under the rubble. Saturday is the start of the Iranian school and work week. NPR is asking Israeli officials for comment on the report a school was hit.\n\nCapt. Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson for U.S. Central Command, told NPR on Saturday it was aware of reports about civilians being harmed.\n\n\"We take these reports seriously and are looking into them,\" Hawkins said. \"The protection of civilians is of utmost importance, and we will continue to take all precautions available to minimize the risk of unintended harm. Unlike Iran, we have never — and will never — target civilians.\"\n\nIran responded with missile and drone launches of its own, spreading the conflict to the wider region. Air raid sirens wailed in Israel as it came under attack. Several countries in the Gulf also reported Iranian strikes, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait. The Jordanian government, which also hosts major U.S. military bases, reported it downed 49 drones and ballistic missiles threatening its territory.\n\n\"Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people,\" Trump said in an eight-minute video posted on Truth Social.\n\nTense lead-up to the strikes\n\nThe joint U.S.-Israeli attack — called \"Epic Fury\" by the Pentagon and \"Roaring Lion\" by Israel — came after weeks of escalating tensions and a major U.S. military buildup in the region. The U.S. had said it was trying to negotiate a deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program, holding the most recent round of talks on Thursday in Geneva. But Trump said those efforts had failed.\n\nIn the run-up to the military strike, analysts speculated on whether Trump might choose a brief, limited attack — as he has done previously in Iran and many other cases over the past year — or if he would opt for a more expansive operation. The initial impression — and the president's own words — pointed to a large-scale, open-ended bombardment.\n\n\"We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally, again, obliterated,\" Trump said, adding, \"We're going to annihilate their navy.\"\n\nThe president claims Iran was rebuilding its nuclear program ahead of the attack — Trump had often said the program was \"totally obliterated\" in the U.S. and Israeli attacks last June.\n\nTrump also told the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to surrender: \"Lay down your arms. You will be treated fairly with total immunity, or you will face certain death.\"\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitored Iran's program for years, as well as other nuclear experts, have said there's no evidence that Iran has resumed the enrichment of uranium, the centerpiece of the program.\n\nPrior to launching the attack, Trump said he preferred a negotiated deal, but would also welcome regime change. Otherwise, he offered little insight into his ultimate goal in Iran.\n\nBut in his video, he made clear that he wants Iran's religious leadership, which has ruled for 47 years, to fall.\n\nSpeaking directly to the Iranian people, he told them to take shelter for now, while bombing is taking place. Then, he added, \"When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations.\"\n\nHowever, the Iranian security forces brutally suppressed mass street protests last month. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activist News Agency says more than 7,000 people were killed. Trump has put the death toll at 32,000 without citing his source.\n\nA Tehran resident reached by NPR said Saturday that internal security forces were flooding the streets in some residential neighborhoods.\n\n\"Many of them are on the streets on motorbikes, showing off their guns,\" she said. \"They want to create fear.\"\n\nThere's no sign the U.S. will send ground troops into Iran, and military analysts say it will be extremely difficult to topple the government with air power alone.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to say whether Iran's leadership might be vulnerable to a domestic uprising, or if it would be able to crush protests as it did earlier this year.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Saturday condemned the strikes by the U.S. and Israel, as well as the retaliatory strikes by Iran.\n\n\"We are witnessing a grave threat to international peace and security. Military action carries the risk of igniting a chain of events that no one can control in the most volatile region of the world,\" Guterres said during an emergency UN Security Council meeting. \"Let me be clear: There is no viable alternative to the peaceful settlement of international disputes. Lasting peace can only be achieved through peaceful means, including genuine dialogue and negotiations.\"\n\nHundreds of targets struck\n\nIsrael's military said it completed its biggest air force operation in the country's history, with about 200 fighter jets hitting about 500 targets in western and central Iran, including aerial defense systems and missile launchers, expanding Israel's aerial superiority over Iran.\n\nAn Israeli military official told reporters that the U.S. and Israeli militaries spent months building up an extensive bank of targets in Iran and were looking for the right moment to strike when senior Iranian officials would meet. The official said three separate gatherings of senior officials were struck simultaneously Saturday morning.\n\nHours before Trump announced the supreme leader's death, NPR was told by a person briefed on the strikes that Israel's assessment was that Supreme Leader Khamenei was hit, and later, from another source with knowledge of the strikes, that he was killed by an Israeli strike.\n\nThat account conflicts with what Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had earlier told NBC News — that Khamenei and Iran's president were still alive \"as far as I know,\" as were other top officials.\n\nThe military said the operation was conducted with \"full synchronization and coordination\" between the Israeli and U.S. militaries.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu said the goal of the joint U.S.-Israeli attack is to \"remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran.\"\n\n\"Our joint action will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands,\" Netanyahu said in a video.\n\nA person briefed on the operation told NPR it was expected to last a few days, with Israel's military focusing on targeting Iran's missile program.\n\nIsrael has closed its airspace to all passenger flights, and civil defense protocols have been activated. Regional military forces remain on high alert.\n\nA 48-hour state of emergency was declared nationwide. Air raid sirens sounded across Israel, with authorities warning civilians to enter bomb shelters.\n\nTrails of smoke streaked the sky above Tel Aviv as Israeli interception systems fired at incoming missiles. A hospital in central Israel began moving operations to an underground fortified compound.\n\nIn the Gulf, several countries offered details on Iranian attacks.\n\nBahrain's government said an Iranian airstrike hit the U.S. naval base that is home to the U.S. Fifth Fleet.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, another U.S. ally, said it intercepted Iranian missiles. It said shrapnel from one of the missiles killed a national of an unspecified Asian country in Abu Dhabi.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Saturday afternoon that the president has spoken with leaders of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Tawfic Abdul Mumuni\n\nThe family of Tawfic Abdul Mumuni, a young man caught in the crossfire of a violent political clash in Maamobi nearly a year and a half ago, has broken their silence to issue a heart-wrenching appeal to President John Dramani Mahama.\n\nDespite the initial national outrage following the October 2024 shooting, the victim remains incapacitated, with his family alleging that he has been neglected by the state while his health deteriorates.\n\nTawfic was one of five people seriously injured when a routine weekend campaign walk between supporters of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) descended into a bloody confrontation involving firearms.\n\nA life on hold\n\nFor Tawfic, the political euphoria of the 2024 election cycle ended in a permanent nightmare. Since the day he was shot, the once-active youth has struggled to walk, with medical experts indicating that only an urgent and costly surgical procedure can restore his mobility.\n\nWith the family unable to raise the tens of thousands of cedis required for the operation, Tawfic’s future remains in the balance.\n\nHis mother, Samira Mohammed, was moved to tears during a press briefing at their family home on Saturday, February 28, where she knelt to address the Flagstaff House directly.\n\n“Mr President, I am on my knees, pleading with you to come to our aid,” she sobbed, describing the daily agony of watching her son wither away without the necessary medical care. The ‘Neglect’ of a victim\n\nThe family’s frustration is compounded by what they describe as a lack of follow-through from government officials who initially promised support in the wake of the violence.\n\nMisbaw Yussif, the victim's uncle, noted that while the incident remains a dark blot on the country's democratic record, the human cost has been conveniently forgotten.\n\n“Our main concern is that our son is suffering. Since the incident, nobody has come to check on him. We are pleading with the government to come to our aid so he can get better,” Yussif stated.\n\nThe Maamobi shooting was a precursor to the heightened tensions that characterised the 2024 general elections.\n\nWhile the political landscape has since shifted, Tawfic’s family argues that true reconciliation cannot happen without justice and care for the victims of political thuggery.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "William Brafu-Insaidoo, a Professor of Economics at the University of Cape Coast\n\nGhana’s hard-won macroeconomic stability is facing a grave external threat as escalating hostilities in the Middle East risk undoing months of progress in curbing inflation.\n\nWilliam Brafu-Insaidoo, a Professor of Economics at the University of Cape Coast, has issued a warning that the recent surge in regional conflict could trigger a domestic price spike, potentially pushing inflation back out of the single-digit bracket.\n\nThe warning follows a dramatic weekend of military escalation, including U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iranian leadership and the subsequent closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a chokepoint through which nearly one-third of the world’s seaborne oil transits.\n\nThe ‘Hormuz’ effect on domestic fuel\n\nWith Iran’s Revolutionary Guards confirming that no vessels will be allowed passage through the vital corridor, global energy markets have been thrown into disarray.\n\nProf. Brafu-Insaidoo, speaking on Channel One Newsroom on Saturday, 28th February 2026, explained that the geographical distance of the conflict provides no shield for the Ghanaian consumer.\n\n“The other angle we can look at this is in terms of global oil prices. Higher global oil prices will immediately increase domestic fuel and transport costs. The trickle-down effect is that once fuel and transport costs go up, it affects almost every other economic activity,” the Professor cautioned. The 'Cost-Push' contagion\n\nThe primary concern for economists is the contagion of rising transport costs into the broader economy.\n\nBecause the majority of essential goods in Ghana are moved by road, any increase at the pump is rapidly mirrored in the price of food, medicine, and manufactured goods.\n\nThis phenomenon, known as cost-push inflation, threatens to reverse the downward trend in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) that the Bank of Ghana and the Finance Ministry have touted as a major success in early 2026.\n\n“When that is factored into other activities, the fact that a number of essential goods are transported and it will cost more to transport them, then obviously it is going to push up inflation. What we normally call cost-push inflation. And this is likely, if we are not careful, it can derail Ghana’s recent success in bringing inflation down to single digits,” Prof. Brafu-Insaidoo added. A region on the brink\n\nThe economic anxiety is fuelled by a sharp deterioration in Middle Eastern security.\n\nFollowing retaliatory drone attacks on U.S. bases, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed a significant escalation, claiming that Israel had successfully destroyed the compound of Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei.\n\nAs the international community calls for restraint, the Ghanaian government is being urged to prepare contingency measures to cushion the impact of potential fuel price hikes.\n\nThe \"single-digit\" milestone, once seen as a sign of recovery, now appears increasingly vulnerable to the volatile geopolitics of the Persian Gulf.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Manchester City have often been accused of being too reliant on Erling Haaland this season. There are signs that could be changing.\n\nJanuary signing Antoine Semenyo scored the only goal in a tense 1-0 win against Leeds United at Elland Road on Saturday as City, without the injured Haaland, moved to within two points of Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\nSince signing from Bournemouth for £62.5m, Semenyo has scored six goals in 11 appearances, making him the club's top scorer this year and easing the goalscoring burden on Haaland.\n\nSemenyo's arrival has coincided with an impressive run of form for Pep Guardiola's side as four league wins in a row - and one loss in seven games - have helped them pile the pressure on long-time leaders Arsenal.\n\nThe Gunners host Chelsea on Sunday but, with Arsenal and City due to meet in April, they will feel their presence close behind.\n\n\"It means everything,\" said 26-year-old Semenyo. \"We just want to win with our games on our side and, whatever Arsenal do, we just have to wait and see.\n\n\"We just need to control what we can control, win our games, and we will see what happens.\"\n\nGuardiola strode on to the pitch after the match and blew kisses in the direction of his family in the stands.\n\nThat will also have contained a large dose of smugness towards the Leeds fans, who had been throwing insults towards him during the game, according to the Spaniard.\n\n'We are building these players'\n\nSemenyo's winner silenced a raucous and rowdy crowd with a real poacher's finish, reacting quickest to latch on to Rayan Ait-Nouri's cross and converting with aplomb.\n\n\"We made a lot of passes that we needed to do to survive without much intention to attack,\" said Guardiola.\n\n\"The reaction was amazing - unbelievable with the goal we scored. A complete game in a tough, tough place, and 10 games left in the Premier League. Time to be decisive.\n\n\"Now we are building these players and they have a long, long time here. It is important for the future for the club.\"\n\nSemenyo is taking the goalscoring burden off Haaland's shoulders - only his team-mate with 29 and Brentford's Igor Thiago (19) have been involved in more Premier League goals than Semenyo's 18.\n\nSince signing for City, Semenyo has scored four league goals and provided one assist, a goal contributions record which is bettered only by Chelsea pair Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro, who have six apiece.\n\nIn late November Haaland had scored 58% of City's goals, taken 30% of their shots and had 57% of their expected goals (xG).\n\nHe had scored 19 goals in all competitions. Burnley's Maxime Esteve was City's second highest scorer in the league thanks to his two own goals in the game at Etihad Stadium.\n\nNow, while Haaland's impressive haul of 29 goals for the campaign still leads the way, Semenyo - and others - are silencing those who feared City were too reliant on the Norwegian's goals.\n\n'It's not a big issue'\n\nGuardiola did not reveal the extent of Haaland's injury and could not say if he will be fit for the game against Nottingham Forest at Etihad Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nHis omission came as a surprise as there was no hint beforehand of Haaland missing out on the trip to Leeds.\n\n\"We don't have spies in the training centre to deliver the info to our media,\" said Guardiola. \"I think it is not a big issue. We will see.\"\n\nIt was the first Premier League match Haaland has not been involved in this season.\n\nA surprising statistic, though, shows that since the start of the 2022-23 season City have won 14 of their 18 league games without Haaland, averaging 2.4 points per game in his absence compared to 2.1 when he features.\n\nVictory over Leeds means City have lost only one of their past 15 games when playing a day before Arsenal.\n\nThe first direct blow between the sides will be struck next month in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Urging Iranians to overthrow their clerical rulers, the US launched \"major combat operations\" along with Israel against Iran early on Saturday.\n\nThe US is calling the operation \"Epic Fury\", while the Israelis call it \"Lion's Roar\".\n\nUS President Donald Trump said Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had been killed.\n\nIt came two days after US-Iranian talks on Tehran's nuclear programme ended without a deal.\n\nIran launched counter-attacks throughout the Middle East in retaliation to what its foreign minister called an \"unprovoked, illegal\" attack by the US and Israel.\n\nHere's what we know so far:\n\nWhy did the US attack Iran?\n\nShortly after explosions were reported in the Iranian capital on Saturday, Trump took to social media to accuse Tehran of waging an \"unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder targeting the United States\".\n\nTrump argued Iran had rejected every opportunity to renounce its nuclear programme and claimed it was developing long-range missiles that could threaten Europe, US troops overseas, and even \"soon reach the American homeland\".\n\nHe further cited the violent takeover of the US embassy in Tehran in 1979, resulting in dozens of Americans being held hostage for 444 days, as well as Iran's proxies bombing a US Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983 that killed 241.\n\nThe US president had also pledged in January to intervene when Iranian security forces crushed protests amid an economic crisis.\n\nIn June last year, the US bombed three nuclear facilities in Iran. Trump said the US Operation Midnight Hammer had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear programme.\n\nLast summer's US attacks paved the way for a ceasefire in a 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel.\n\nIsrael had launched air strikes on Iranian nuclear, military and infrastructure sites. Tehran had retaliated by firing hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel.\n\nIs Iran's supreme leader dead?\n\nYes.\n\nTrump announced on social media that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had died, describing him as \"one of the most evil people in History\".\n\nIranian state TV later confirmed the death of Khamenei, 86, who had ruled since 1989, and declared 40 days of mourning.\n\nAn intelligence source and a military source told the BBC's US partner CBS that around 40 Iranian officials were also killed in the strikes.\n\nBBC Verify obtained satellite imagery taken over Tehran that showed significant damage to part of Khamenei's office in the Iranian capital.\n\nIs the US at war?\n\nIn his video announcement, Trump described the US-Israel attacks on Iran as \"major combat operations\".\n\nCongress reserves the power to officially declare war, as written in Article I of the US Constitution, but it has not done so.\n\nThe Constitution does, however, give the president broad authority to engage in military action.\n\nThis grey area has been the source of much debate recently in Washington.\n\nReactions on Capitol Hill to the US-Israel attack on Iran have fallen largely along partisan lines. Republicans, who currently control both chambers of Congress, were mostly in support.\n\nKentucky Senator Lindsey Graham, who has long called for a US attack on Iran, wrote on X: \"This operation is necessary and long justified.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, said the Trump administration had notified the \"Gang of 8\" - a bipartisan group of congressional leaders - ahead of the strikes.\n\nDemocrats mostly denounced the attacks, accusing Trump of launching a war without congressional approval.\n\nDemocratic Senator Tim Kaine, on the Armed Services Committee, called the conflict \"Trump's illegal war\".\n\nDemocrats renewed calls for Congress to take up a war powers resolution, like the bill that failed last year for lack of Republican support.\n\nIf another war powers resolution were introduced and passed, it could block the president's unilateral use of force without congressional approval.\n\nBut the odds of such a bill passing appear unlikely for now.\n\nFew Republicans have indicated they would back such a measure, except for congressman Thomas Massie and Senator Rand Paul.\n\nWill there be US boots on the ground?\n\nThe US has about 13 military bases across the Middle East, with 30,000 to 40,000 troops normally deployed between them.\n\nBut there is no indication that US combat troops will be deployed on the ground in Iran, not least because of the low appetite among the American public for a ground invasion.\n\nThe US military has been building its presence in the Middle East for weeks and has two aircraft carriers, USS Gerald R Ford and USS Abraham Lincoln, in the region.\n\nBBC Verify tracked a total of 12 US ships in the Middle East and a large number of US aircraft, including F-35 and F-22 fighter jets, refuelling tankers, and surveillance aircraft. But US military action has amounted to air raids so far.\n\nHow many have died?\n\nTrump said \"the lives of courageous American heroes may be lost\", although the US military said it had received no reports of combat casualties so far.\n\nMore than 200 people have been killed across Iran and more than 700 injured, according to the Red Crescent on Saturday.\n\nThe first-aid organisation said that 24 of Iran's 31 provinces had been hit. At least 108 people have died in an explosion at a school in southern Iran, according to a local prosecutor.\n\nOne person died and at least 20 were wounded when an Iranian missile hit several buildings in central Tel Aviv, reports the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.\n\nIn counterattacks, Iran also fired drones and missiles at Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar the UAE, all of which have a US military presence.\n\nOne person was killed in Abu Dhabi, UAE state media said.\n\nTrump warned bombing would continue throughout the week, so the death toll may rise.\n\nDoes Iran have the capability to attack the US?\n\nThe Iranian regime has always denied it wants a nuclear weapon, but it has enriched uranium to a level that has no civilian use in a nuclear power programme, says the BBC's international editor Jeremy Bowen.\n\nSo far Israel and the US have published no evidence that it was about to build the bomb, he adds.\n\nThere have been no public reports of a pending attack on the US mainland, but local authorities have said they are on high alert.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said emergency management officials were taking \"proactive steps\" in \"sensitive locations\" out of an abundance of caution.\n\nOn the west coast, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said police had stepped up patrols, although \"there are no known credible threats at this time\".\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "From Jessie Buckley in a reworking of Bride of Frankenstein to Tommy Shelby's big-screen debut, these are the films to watch at the cinema and stream at home this month.\n\n1. Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man\n\nFrom 2013 to 2022, Peaky Blinders chronicled the fortunes of a Birmingham street gang through the 1920s and into the '30s. The series helped to turn Cillian Murphy into a major star, as well turning flat caps into major fashion accessories, so it was no surprise when a spin-off film was announced. The Immortal Man is set during World War Two, when Murphy's anti-hero, Tommy Shelby, is dragged back to Birmingham while the city is being devastated by German bombs. There are some familiar faces from the series, alongside new guest stars including Rebecca Ferguson, Tim Roth and Barry Keoghan as Tommy's son. But is this the last we'll be seeing of Tommy himself? Stephen Knight, the series' creator and the film's screenwriter, hasn't confirmed anything. \"I hope it feels like the end of a novel,\" he said in Empire. \"It's the last few chapters of a long novel, where you get to round it off. And prepare people for what comes next.\"\n\nReleased on 6 March in cinemas in the US and the UK, and on 20 March on Netflix internationally\n\n2. Hoppers\n\nThe 30th animated feature film from Pixar Studios, Hoppers approaches a time-honoured cartoon staple – talking animals – from a new angle. The premise is that a girl named Mabel (voiced by Piper Curda) has her mind \"hopped\" into the body of a robotic beaver. This allows her to communicate with animals of all kinds (just go with it), and she soon learns that they are sick of being mistreated by humans. Will Mabel stick with her furry friends when they rise up against us? And can we assume that the animal-friendly premise will stop Hoppers from having any tie-in deals with burger restaurants? \"There were times I was crying with laughter, but then I'd cry from horror, but then I'd also cry because of the tenderness in the story,\" says Lauren Ashton in Animation Scoop. \"It's bold and feels ambitious, especially coming from Pixar. It's something really fresh and different.\"\n\nReleased on 4, 5 and 6 March in cinemas internationally\n\n3. The Good Boy\n\nStephen Graham won three Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe for co-writing and starring in Netflix's hit series, Adolescence. Now he can be seen in a somewhat different story about a troubled British teenage boy. He and Andrea Riseborough play a couple with their own ideas about disciplining the younger generation. Having watched the drink-and-drug-fuelled social-media videos posted by a rowdy 19-year-old (Anson Boon), they kidnap him and chain him up in the basement of their suburban house. And they won't free him until they've trained him to be a \"good boy\". Jan Komasa's black comedy thriller is \"A Clockwork Orange by way of Misery, Pygmalion with stun guns and a telescopic baton\", says India Block in The Standard. \"There are many stand-out moments that had the audience in fits of nervous laughter that are too good to spoil. You never know which way a scene will turn, towards charm or squirmy fear.\"\n\nReleased on 5 March in Italy, 6 March in the US, 7 March in Germany, and 20 March in the UK\n\n4. The Bride!\n\nAfter years of success as an actor, Maggie Gyllenhaal made her directorial debut in 2021 with an Elena Ferrante adaptation, The Lost Daughter, which co-starred Jessie Buckley. Gyllenhaal's second film is inspired by a 1935 horror classic, The Bride of Frankenstein. But she was less interested in what that classic included than in what it left out. \"I watched the movie, and I realised [the Bride] doesn't speak,\" Gyllenhaal said in Entertainment Weekly. \"She's only in it for five minutes at most. She's still formidable, but I thought, there's a problem with this concept. It's called The Bride of Frankenstein, but it's really Frankenstein. So, who is she?\" To answer that question, Gyllenhaal cast Buckley as a woman who is murdered in 1930s Chicago, and brought back to life by a patchwork monster played by Christian Bale. The Bride!, then, isn't a gothic horror film set among misty European mountains, but an explosive, brightly coloured gangster caper about two gun-toting lovers on the run. Gyllenhaal's husband, Peter Sarsgaard, and her brother, Jake Gyllenhaal, join in the fun.\n\nReleased in cinemas internationally on 4, 5 and 6 March\n\n5. Saipan\n\nWith the FIFA World Cup approaching, this is the ideal moment to catch a comedy drama set in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Japan and Korea. Saipan is based on the true story of a fierce clash – not between two teams, but between a player and a manager who were supposedly on the same side. The Republic of Ireland's captain, Roy Keane (Éanna Hardwicke), is appalled by the training facilities on the island of Saipan: the pitch is a wasteland and there aren't even any footballs available. But as far as Keane is concerned, the situation is made even worse by the relaxed attitude of Ireland's manager, Mick McCarthy (Steve Coogan). \"If you are not steeped in football lore or are no particular fan of the game, you might consider Saipan a film for sports enthusiasts only,\" says Jeremy Aspinall in the Radio Times. \"However, thanks to fabulous performances and a witty, perceptive script that's more concerned with the game of life than the game itself, it has something for everybody.\"\n\nReleased on 13 March in the US\n\n6. Reminders of Him\n\nNever mind Marvel's superhero comics or Stephen King's horror stories. If you're a Hollywood producer searching for some source material right now, look no further than Colleen Hoover's bestselling romance novels. It Ends with Us was one of the biggest hits of 2024 (even if its success has been overshadowed by the subsequent legal tussles between its stars, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni); Regretting You came out last year; Anne Hathaway and Dakota Johnson will appear in Verity in the autumn; and this month's Hoover adaptation is Reminders of Him. Maika Monroe stars as a woman who was sent to prison after she was in the car accident that killed her boyfriend. Returning to her hometown, she tries to reconnect with her long-lost daughter – and to connect with a hunky bartender (Tyriq Withers). \"Colleen was a producer, and on set every day, which she hasn't been on one of her [other adaptations] yet, so she was super involved,\" Monroe told the Radio Times. \"We did a pretty great job of following the book, so I feel like the fans will be really happy.\"\n\nReleased on 12 and 13 March internationally\n\n7. Marc by Sofia\n\nIn Marc by Sofia, the Marc and Sofia in question are Marc Jacobs, the New York fashion designer, and Sofia Coppola, the writer-director of Lost in Translation, Marie Antoinette and Priscilla. The pair have been friends and collaborators since Coppola was at Jacobs' divisive \"grunge\" show in 1992, so she is the perfect person to make an intimate documentary about the designer's influences and motivations. She focuses on the lead up to the launch of Jacobs's spring/ summer 2024 collection, but jumps back and forth in time to create \"a kind of moving mood board which takes us inside Jacobs's brain\", says Radhika Seth in Vogue. \"It offers not a conventional, talking heads-heavy fashion history lesson, but a total immersion in his world… a moreish treat that works as both a nostalgia hit and a closer look at one of the most fascinating minds in fashion.\"\n\nReleased on 20 March in the US\n\n8. Ready or Not 2: Here I Come\n\nMarch is an exciting month for anyone who enjoys seeing young women fighting wealthy satanists. One of the best films in that particular sub-genre is Ready or Not (2019), in which Samara Weaving's Grace has to battle her new in-laws or else be sacrificed to the devil. In the sequel, inevitably named Ready or Not 2: Here I Come, Weaving returns, along with the first film's writers and directors, which means that Grace's troubles aren't over. Shortly after her eventful wedding night, she and her sister (Kathryn Newton) are chased around the grounds of a stately home by a whole cabal of homicidal super-rich families. But that's not all. A week later, on 27 March, there's They Will Kill You, which stars Zazie Beetz as a maid, fighting her way out of an exclusive Manhattan apartment block owned by a demon-worshipping cult. Maybe someone should make a crossover film called Ready or Not, They Will Kill You…\n\nReleased on 20 March in the US, 27 March in Canada, and 10 April in the UK\n\n9. Project Hail Mary\n\nIf you fancy a deeply researched story of a scientist stuck on his own in space, then Andy Weir is your man. His debut novel, The Martian, was made into a hit film scripted by Drew Goddard, and directed by Ridley Scott. A decade on, Goddard has scripted another film adapted from one of Weir's novels, Project Hail Mary. Directed by Christopher Miller and Phil Lord (the directors of The Lego Movie and the producers of the Spider-Verse cartoons), this sci-fi adventure stars Ryan Gosling as Ryland Grace, a biologist-turned-school teacher who is called in by the European Space Agency when energy-absorbing microbes are found to be dimming the light between the Sun and the Earth. With no trained astronauts available, Grace is sent on a solo flight to investigate – but he does bump into a friendly alien. \"What's great about this movie is that there are so many things that make it harder to make,\" Miller said at San Diego Comic-Con, as reported in Gizmodo. \"All of the zero G, all of the centrifugal gravity, the characters have to have a wall between them because their atmospheres are different… That difficulty is what makes it interesting and makes it special.\"\n\nReleased on 18, 19 and 20 March in cinemas internationally\n\n10. Alpha\n\nJulia Ducournau, the French writer-director of Raw and Titane, returns with a typically dark, visceral and challenging drama that divided critics when it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival last year: it's not so much a love-it-or-hate-it film as a love-it-or-be-baffled-by-it one. Its titular heroine, Alpha (Mélissa Boros), is a 13-year-old a schoolgirl who appals her mother (Golshifteh Farahani) by getting an amateur tattoo at a party. A deadly virus is turning its victims into stone, and the mother, a nurse, is afraid that her daughter and her drug-addicted brother (Tahar Rahim) will catch it. Despite having had a sceptical review from the BBC, Ducournau's apocalyptic film is certainly a unique and haunting experience. \"Alpha has continued to burrow the right sort of unease into my brain,\" says Donald Clarke in The Irish Times. \"Few will endure its attack without admitting they've sat through something out of the ordinary.\"\n\nReleased on 27 March in the US and Canada, and 17 April in the UK.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Global energy markets have been thrown into a state of emergency following the total blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, a move that has already sent crude oil prices spiralling past $91 per barrel.\n\nDuncan Amoah, Executive Secretary of the Chamber of Petroleum Consumers (COPEC), warned on Saturday, February 28, that the sudden escalation of conflict in the Middle East has effectively decapitated the world’s primary oil artery, with direct and severe consequences for fuel prices in Ghana.\n\nMr Amoah described a deteriorating situation where diplomatic efforts have been replaced by a high-stakes maritime standoff.\n\nThe blockade is reportedly being enforced by a strategic alliance referred to by Mr Amoah as the Iron Triangle.\n\nHe confirmed that the naval assets of Iran, Russia, and China have been deployed to seal the narrow chokepoint, through which a significant portion of the world's energy flows.\n\n“What I can confirm is that the Strait of Hormuz is blocked as we speak,” Mr Amoah stated in Channel One. “The iron triangle is already active. Iran, Russia and China have paraded their maritime infrastructure. Whatever they can deploy in that tunnel is already active. The US is also heading toward that corridor, which means no oil whatsoever has made passage since morning.” Price shock: From $67 to $91 in 24 hours\n\nThe impact on pricing has been instantaneous and violent. Before the latest military flare-up, which included reported U.S.-Israeli strikes and the claimed death of Iran's Supreme Leader, crude was trading in the stable range of $67 to $69. By Saturday afternoon, those figures had been decimated.\n\nAmoah revealed that market signals indicate a surge of over 30 per cent in a single day.\n\n“Over 22 percent of the global oil supply that should have moved since last dawn has not moved. Inventories across Europe, the US and Asia will now attract higher premiums. You cannot expect anyone holding oil at this point to sell it cheaper,” he explained. Implications for the Ghanaian consumer\n\nFor Ghana, a country already navigating fiscal challenges highlighted in the President’s recent State of the Nation Address (SONA), the $91 price point is a harbinger of a new wave of inflation.\n\nCOPEC warns that the \"fluid\" nature of the conflict means that unless the corridor is reopened by U.S. naval intervention, the cost of refined petroleum products at the pumps will skyrocket.\n\nThe geopolitical risk premium is currently at its highest level since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. With Emirates flights from Accra already cancelled due to airspace closures and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs advising against travel to the region, the economic isolation of the Middle East is rapidly becoming a domestic crisis for Ghana.\n\nMr Amoah’s assessment of the immediate future was sobering. As the U.S. carrier strike groups move toward the corridor to challenge the blockade, the risk of a full-scale naval confrontation looms.\n\n“The situation is fluid and not looking very kind,” Mr Amoah concluded, suggesting that the current inventories held by OMCs (Oil Marketing Companies) will likely be repriced to reflect the new global reality of a $90+ barrel.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Dr. Hilla Limann Technical University (DHLTU) has officially marked a historic 2025/2026 matriculation ceremony, recording a 17% increase in admissions while announcing a groundbreaking financial initiative for differently-abled students.\n\nAddressing the newly admitted students, the Vice-Chancellor Prof. Hamidatu Saaka Darimani revealed that for the first time in the institution's history, the university has admitted 17 differently-abled students into various academic programs.\n\nIn a major step toward inclusive higher education, the educational expenses for all 17 students will be fully absorbed under the free tertiary and persons with disabilities policy.\n\nThe university experienced a massive influx of interest this academic year, receiving a total of 2,575 applications. Out of that applicant pool, 1,967 candidates were offered admission.\n\nBreaking down the admissions data, the university admitted:\n\n* 768 students into Higher National Diploma (HND) programs.\n\n* 665 students into BTech/MSc programs.\n\n* 487 students into BTech/BSc programs.\n\n* 35 students into postgraduate programs.\n\nAddressing the economic hurdles of tertiary education, the Vice-Chancellor noted that 906 of the newly admitted Level 100 students have already successfully enrolled under the government's \"no fees stress policy,\" with others still undergoing documentation scrutiny.\n\nTo accommodate this 17% surge in the student population and ease the burden of off-campus housing, the university has commenced the construction of a 400-bed hostel facility aimed at providing a safe, conducive on-campus residential environment.\n\nOther major campus upgrades are currently underway to support the growing student body. The vice chancellor highlighted the ongoing construction of the main entrance and access roads, the installation of solar street lights to boost campus security, and the outfitting of state-of-the-art laboratories to strengthen practical, industry-relevant training.\n\nIn a major demonstration of this commitment to practical skills, the matriculation ceremony was followed by the official commissioning of a state-of-the-art cosmetology laboratory.\n\nThe facility stands as the first of its kind in the entire region, specifically established to create direct employment pathways and equip students with high-level cosmetic science and practical skills.\n\nThe cosmetology department, currently operating with three staff members, is designed to offer specialised BTech and certificate courses. University management indicated that intensive recruitment efforts are underway to secure additional cosmetology faculty, allowing for the full enrollment of students into the program by the start of the next academic year.\n\nBeyond student training, the laboratory has been outfitted to offer premium, first-class cosmetology services to the general public, serving as both an educational hub and a revenue-generating enterprise for the university.\n\nClosing the ceremony, university management issued a stern warning regarding campus discipline and the student code of conduct.\n\nStressing that \"ignorance of these regulations would not be accepted as an excuse”, Prof. Hamidatu urged matriculants to familiarise themselves with the rules and prioritise moral character alongside their studies.\n\n\"Remember that character and competence must go hand in hand,\" the Vice-Chancellor stated, reminding the students that \"academic excellence without integrity is incomplete\".\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

If he wants to repent, he should come to the Sunday rally and publicly declare that he has changed his mind so that we can receive and forgive him.\n\n\n\n\"But once the election is over and he decides to return to the party, he can stay for eight years without getting the opportunity to contest for any position.”\n\n\n\nWatch as Asiedu Nketiah jabs Ntim Fordjour over cocoa pod display at SONA\n\n\n\nHe further emphasised his warning with a metaphor, “If you are sick and you are injected, you may survive if you are lucky, but if you are not lucky, you may die. Once it happens, it happens. After the election, he cannot come back to contest anything in the party for about eight years.”\n\n\n\nMohammed Umar Sanda announced his decision to contest the Ayawaso East seat as an independent candidate against the NDC’s parliamentary candidate, Baba Jamal, citing what he described as the monetisation of the party’s primary election process.\n\n\n\nAM\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, watch GhanaWeb’s exposé on the 'dark side of Kayamata' and its devastating impact"

            "content": "Business News of Sunday, 1 March 2026\n\nSource: www.ghanaweb.com\n\nThe Member of Parliament for Bekwai, Ralph Poku-Adusei, has criticised President John Dramani Mahama over what he describes as a disconnect between government’s macroeconomic claims and the lived realities of ordinary Ghanaians.\n\n\n\nSpeaking in reaction to the President’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) delivered in Parliament on Friday February 27, 2026, the Bekwai legislator questioned both the length and substance of the address, arguing that it amounted more to a public lecture than an honest account of performance.\n\n\n\n“The government has been in office for just one year, and it has taken two and a half hours to deliver a State of the Nation Address,” Poku-Adusei said.\n\n\n\n“What does that tell you? It tells me that you are giving a public lecture because there is virtually nothing concrete that you have done.”\n\n\n\nThe MP took particular aim at government’s emphasis on fiscal discipline and improving macroeconomic indicators, including declining inflation and relative currency stability.\n\n\n\nWhile acknowledging that such indicators may appear positive on paper, he insisted they have not translated into tangible relief for struggling citizens.\n\n\n\n“You talk about fiscal discipline. You talk about inflation coming down. You talk about the cedi appreciating against the dollar. But these are theories,” he stated. “Does that put food on the table of cocoa farmers who have not been paid? Does it put a roof over the head of the common Ghanaian?”\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the “true state of the nation” is one marked by widespread hardship and economic stagnation, which he attributed to what he described as government’s reluctance to spend.\n\n\n\n“The government is simply not spending, and that is affecting you and it is affecting me,” he said. “Until government spending stimulates the economy, nothing comes into your pocket. If you are not spending and at the same time you are bringing inflation down and stabilising the currency, then clearly you are imposing untold hardship on ordinary citizens.”\n\n\n\nGovernment increases feeding grant for special schools from GH¢8.00 to GH¢15.00\n\n\n\nPoku-Adusei further criticised the administration over alleged delays in payments to cocoa farmers and what he described as unjustified job losses among the youth. He argued that fiscal discipline should not come at the expense of livelihoods.\n\n\n\n“You cannot score marks for fiscal discipline when ordinary Ghanaians are suffering when cocoa farmers are not being paid, when young people are being laid off, and when many families do not have money to buy food,” he said.\n\n\n\nWhile conceding that the government has outlined several policy intentions and manifesto promises, the Bekwai MP maintained that there is little evidence so far of successful implementation.\n\n\n\n“What we heard was largely a repetition of manifesto promises — what the government intends to do,” he said.\n\n\n\n“We will pray for the government to succeed. But as it stands now, the true state of the nation is that the government has not been able to execute any of its major policy promises successfully.”\n\n\n\nAM\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, watch GhanaWeb’s exposé on the 'dark side of Kayamata' and its devastating impact"

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "War with Iran contradicts the US president’s own criticism of regime change policies in the Middle East, analysts say.\n\nPresident Donald Trump stood in front of regional leaders during a visit to the Middle East in May and declared a new era of US foreign policy in the region, one that is not guided by trying to reshape it or change its governing systems.\n\n“In the end, the so-called nation-builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,” the US president said in rebuke of his hawkish predecessors.\n\nLess than a year later, Trump ordered an all-out assault on Iran with the stated goal of bringing “freedom” to the country, borrowing language from the playbook of interventionist neoconservatives, like former President George W Bush, whom he spent his political career criticising.\n\nAnalysts say the war with Iran does not fit with Trump’s stated political ideology, policy goals or campaign promises.\n\nInstead, several Iran experts told Al Jazeera that Trump is waging a war, together with Israel, that only benefits Israel and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n“This is, once again, a war of choice launched by the US with [a] push from Israel,” said Negar Mortazavi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, DC.\n\n“This is another Israeli war that the US is launching. Israel has pushed the US to attack Iran for two decades, and they finally got it.”\n\nMortazavi highlighted Trump’s criticism of his predecessors, who had waged regime-change wars in the region.\n\n“It is ironic, because this is a president who called himself the ‘president of peace‘,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nHistory of warnings of the Iranian ‘threat’\n\nNetanyahu, who promoted the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, has been warning for more than two decades that Iran is on the cusp of acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nIran denies seeking a nuclear bomb, and even Trump administration officials have acknowledged that Washington has no evidence that Tehran is weaponising its uranium enrichment programme.\n\nAfter the US bombed Iran’s main enrichment facilities in the 12-day war in June last year – an attack that Trump says “obliterated” the country’s nuclear programme – Netanyahu pivoted to a new supposed Iranian threat: Tehran’s ballistic missiles.\n\n“Iran can blackmail any American city,” Netanyahu told pro-Israel podcaster Ben Shapiro in October.\n\n“People don’t believe it. Iran is developing intercontinental missiles with a range of 8,000km [5,000 miles], add another 3,000 [1,800 miles], and they can get to the East Coast of the US.”\n\nTrump repeated that claim, which Tehran has vehemently denied and has not been backed by any public evidence or testing, in his State of the Union address earlier this week.\n\n“They’ve already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America,” he said of the Iranians.\n\nTrump has been building the case for a wider war with Iran since the June conflict, repeatedly threatening to bomb the country again.\n\nBut the US president’s own National Security Strategy last year called for de-prioritising the Middle East in Washington’s foreign policy and focusing on the Western Hemisphere.\n\nMeanwhile, the US public, wary of global conflict after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has also been largely opposed to new strikes against Iran, public opinion polls show.\n\nOnly 21 percent of respondents in a recent University of Maryland survey said they favoured a war with Iran.\n\nThe first day of the war saw Iran fire missiles against bases and cities that host US troops and assets across the Middle East in retaliation for the joint US-Israeli strikes, plunging the region into chaos.\n\nTrump acknowledged that US troops may suffer casualties in the conflict. “That often happens in war,” he said on Saturday. “But we’re doing this not for now. We’re doing this for the future. And it is a noble mission.”\n\n‘Ignoring the vast majority of Americans’\n\nThe Trump administration had appeared to step back from the brink of conflict earlier this month by engaging in diplomacy with Tehran.\n\nUS and Iranian negotiators held three rounds of talks over the past week, with Tehran stressing that it is willing to agree to rigorous inspections of its nuclear programme.\n\nOmani mediators and Iranian officials had described the last round of negotiations, which took place on Thursday, as positive, saying that it yielded significant progress.\n\n\n\nThe June 2025 war, initiated by Israel without provocation, also came in the middle of US-Iran talks.\n\n“Netanyahu’s agenda has always been to prevent a diplomatic solution, and he feared Trump was actually serious about getting a deal, so the start of this war in the middle of negotiations is a success for him, just like it was last June,” Jamal Abdi, the president of the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Trump’s embrace of regime change rhetoric is a further victory for Netanyahu, and loss for the American people, as it suggests the US may be committed to a long and unpredictable military boondoggle.”\n\nWhile announcing the strikes on Saturday, Trump said his aim is to prevent Iran from “threatening America and our core national security interests”.\n\nBut US critics, including some proponents of Trump’s “America first” movement, have argued that Iran – more than 10,000km (6,000 miles) away – does not pose a threat to the US.\n\nEarlier this month, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that “if it were not for Iran, there wouldn’t be Hezbollah; we wouldn’t have the problem on the border with Lebanon”.\n\nCarlson said, “What problem on the border with Lebanon? I’m an American. I’m not having any problems on the border with Lebanon right now. I live in Maine.”\n\nOn Saturday, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib stressed that the US public does not want war with Iran.\n\n“Trump is acting on the violent fantasies of the American political elite and the Israeli apartheid government, ignoring the vast majority of Americans who say loud and clear: No More Wars,” Tlaib said in a statement."

            "content": "Democratic lawmakers have largely condemned the strikes on Iran, emphasizing the lack of congressional approval.\n\nLawmakers from the Democratic Party have condemned the US attacks on Iran as a “dangerous” and “unnecessary” escalation, and called on the Senate to immediately vote on legislation that would block the president’s ability to take further military action without congressional approval.\n\nSenator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees and the primary author of the war powers resolution, called President Donald Trump’s order to attack Iran a “colossal mistake”.\n\n“The Senate should immediately return to session and vote on my War Powers Resolution to block the use of US forces in hostilities against Iran,” Kaine said in a statement on Saturday. “Every single Senator needs to go on the record about this dangerous, unnecessary, and idiotic action.”\n\nHouse of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries echoed Kaine, saying that House Democrats are committed to forcing a floor vote on a measure to restrict Trump’s war powers regarding Iran.\n\n“Donald Trump failed to seek Congressional authorisation prior to striking Iran. Instead, the President’s decision to abandon diplomacy and launch a massive military attack has left American troops vulnerable to Iran’s retaliatory actions,” he said in a statement. “The Trump administration must explain itself to the American people and Congress immediately.”\n\nThe push for a legislative check on Trump’s executive power has gained significant bipartisan momentum in the Senate, of which the Republican Party maintains a slim majority.\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demanded on Saturday that Congress be briefed immediately about the Iran attacks, including an all-senators classified session and public testimony, criticising the administration for not providing details on the threat’s scope and immediacy.\n\n“The administration has not provided Congress and the American people with critical details about the scope and immediacy of the threat,” he said in a statement.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, described the strikes in a statement posted on X as “a deeply consequential decision that risks pulling the United States into another broad conflict in the Middle East”.\n\nHe questioned the urgency and intelligence behind the attack, warning of repeating “mistakes of the past”, like the Iraq war.\n\n“The American people have seen this playbook before – claims of urgency, misrepresented intelligence, and military action that pulls the United States into regime change and prolonged, costly nation-building,” he said.\n\nNot just Democrats\n\nWhile the push to curb executive military authority is largely driven by the Democratic caucus, a growing contingent of Republican lawmakers has signalled a rare break from the White House to join the effort.\n\nRepublican representative Thomas Massie, one of the most outspoken critics, described the strikes as “acts of war unauthorised by Congress”.\n\n“I am opposed to this War. This is not America First,” he wrote on X.\n\nIn the Senate, Republican Senator Rand Paul, who also co-sponsored the war powers resolution, said his opposition to the war is based on constitutional principles.\n\n“My oath of office is to the Constitution, so with studied care, I must oppose another Presidential war,” he said on X."

            "content": "Figures from across the United States political spectrum have reacted to President Donald Trump’s joint attack with Israel on Iran, with Republicans largely expressing support and Democrats failing to offer a robust and unified response.\n\nThe attacks have reportedly killed at least 201 people, including more than 80 in a school in southern Iran, many of them children.\n\nIran has launched retaliatory strikes on Israel as well as US bases across the region, located in countries such as Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Kuwait, prompting fears that the conflict could spiral out of control and plunge the region into violence.\n\nAn initial YouGov poll conducted on February 28, after the strikes, suggested that 33 percent of US adults approved of the US attacking Iran, while 45 percent disapproved. Among Democrats and Independents, approval was just 10 percent and 21 percent, respectively, while 68 percent of Republicans expressed support.\n\nHere’s how some of the US’s most prominent elected representatives and political figures have reacted.\n\nPresident Donald Trump: “A short time ago, the United States military started major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people. Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world.”\n\nRepublican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson: “Today, Iran is facing the severe consequences of its evil actions. President Trump and the Administration have made every effort to pursue peaceful and diplomatic solutions in response to the Iranian regime’s sustained nuclear ambitions and development, terrorism, and the murder of Americans—and even their own people.”\n\n\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader John Thune: “For years, Iran’s relentless nuclear ambitions, its expanded ballistic missile inventory, and its unwavering support for terror groups in the region have posed a clear and unacceptable threat to U.S. servicemembers, citizens in the region, and many of our allies. Despite the dogged efforts of the president and his administration, the Iranian regime has refused the diplomatic off-ramps that would peacefully resolve these national security concerns. I commend President Trump for taking action to thwart these threats.”\n\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries: “Donald Trump failed to seek Congressional authorization prior to striking Iran. Instead, the president’s decision to abandon diplomacy and launch a massive military attack has left American troops vulnerable to Iran’s retaliatory actions. We pray for the safety of the men and women of the US military as they have been put into harm’s way in a dangerous theatre of war.”\n\nDemocratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer: “The administration has not provided Congress and the American people with critical details about the scope and immediacy of the threat. Confronting Iran’s malign regional activities, nuclear ambitions, and harsh oppression of the Iranian people demands American strength, resolve, regional coordination, and strategic clarity. Unfortunately, President Trump’s fitful cycles of lashing out and risking wider conflict are not a viable strategy.”\n\nDemocratic Representative Rashida Tlaib: “The American people do not want a war with Iran. Trump is acting on the violent fantasies of the American political elite and the Israeli apartheid government, ignoring the vast majority of Americans who say loud and clear: No More Wars.”\n\nDemocratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: “The American people are once again dragged into a war they did not want by a president who does not care about the long-term consequences of his actions. This war is unlawful. It is unnecessary. And it will be catastrophic. Just this week, Iran and the United States were negotiating key measures that could have staved off war. The president walked away from these discussions and chose war instead.”\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani: “Today’s military strikes on Iran — carried out by the United States and Israel — mark a catastrophic escalation in an illegal war of aggression. Bombing cities. Killing civilians. Opening a new theatre of war. Americans do not want this. They do not want another war in pursuit of regime change. They want relief from the affordability crisis. They want peace.”\n\nDemocratic Senator Bernie Sanders: “This Trump–Netanyahu war is unconstitutional and violates international law. It endangers the lives of U.S. troops and people across the region. We’ve lived through the lies of Vietnam and Iraq. No more endless wars. Congress must pass a War Powers Resolution immediately.”\n\n\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Van Hollen: “Trump is lying to the American people as he launches an illegal, regime-change war against Iran. This is endangering American lives and has already resulted in mass civilian casualties. This is not making us safer & only damages the US and our interests. The Senate must immediately vote on the War Powers Resolution to stop it.”\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham: “I fervently pray that the long-suffering people of Iran will have their oppression ended soon. I also fervently pray that we’re on the verge of a new dawn in the Middle East, with historic opportunity for lasting peace and prosperity. As to our allies in Israel, President Trump and all under his command, your bravery has set in motion the end of evil and darkness, and the beginning of the light. Well done.”\n\nDemocratic Representative Ro Khanna: “Trump has launched an illegal regime change war in Iran with American lives at risk. Congress must convene on Monday to vote on Representative Thomas Massie and my WPR [War Powers Resolution] to stop this. Every member of Congress should go on record this weekend on how they will vote.”\n\nRepublican Representative Thomas Massie: “I am opposed to this War. This is not “America First.” When Congress reconvenes, I will work with Representative Ro Khanna to force a Congressional vote on war with Iran. The Constitution requires a vote, and your Representative needs to be on record as opposing or supporting this war.”\n\nRepublican Senator Tom Cotton: “Iran’s missile program poses an imminent threat to the United States and our allies. I’m thankful President Trump is taking necessary action to protect our homeland.”\n\nDemocratic Senator Adam Schiff: “Trump is drawing our country into yet another foreign war that Americans don’t want and Congress has not authorised. The Iranian regime is a brutal and murderous dictatorship. But that does not give Trump the authority to unilaterally initiate a war of choice.”\n\nDemocratic Senator John Fetterman: “Operation Epic Fury. President Trump has been willing to do what’s right and necessary to produce real peace in the region. God bless the United States, our great military, and Israel.”\n\nFormer Democratic Presidential Nominee Kamala Harris: “Donald Trump is dragging the United States into a war the American people do not want. Let me be clear: I am opposed to a regime-change war in Iran, and our troops are being put in harm’s way for the sake of Trump’s war of choice.”\n\nFormer Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene: “We said “No More Foreign Wars, No More Regime Change!” We said it on rally stage after rally stage, speech after speech. Trump, Vance, basically the entire admin campaigned on it and promised to put America FIRST and Make America Great Again. My generation has been let down, abused, and used by our government our entire adult lives and our children’s generation is literally being abandoned.”"

He said one of the injured people was in serious condition.\n\nThe Interior Ministry issued an emergency alert urging the public to stay away from military sites and remain indoors, warning people not to approach or handle any unidentified debris and to report any to authorities.\n\nQatar’s Ministry of Defence said it had “successfully intercepted” a second wave of attacks targeting several areas. It said all missiles were intercepted before reaching the country’s territory, and urged residents to remain calm and follow official instructions.\n\nQatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned what it said was the targeting of Qatari territory with Iranian ballistic missiles, calling it “reckless and irresponsible”, as well as a “flagrant violation” of sovereignty and an escalation threatening regional stability.\n\nIbrahim Sultan Al-Hashemi, the head of public relations at the Foreign Ministry, said the attack was inconsistent with the principles of “good neighbourliness”, and that Qatar reserved the right to respond “in accordance with international law”.\n\n\n\nThe ministry also called for an immediate halt to escalation and a return to negotiations.\n\nThe missile barrage came as Iran launched strikes across the Gulf after the US-Israeli attacks on Iran, an escalation that prompted air-defence interceptions over several countries. The news agency Reuters reported that Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain said they intercepted Iranian missiles, while Jordan also intercepted missiles.\n\nThis is not the first Iranian attack on Qatar. In June 2025, during the 12-day war between Iran and Israel, Iran launched missiles at the Al Udeid airbase, a key facility hosting US forces near Doha.\n\nSaturday’s barrage came after the United States and Israel carried out strikes on Iran, raising fears of a wider conflict and increasing pressure on Gulf states that host US forces and critical energy infrastructure.\n\nThe developments heightened anxiety across the Gulf, where Ramadan routines were disrupted by air raid alerts, interceptions and warnings about unexploded fragments, as leaders urged restraint amid fears of a widening confrontation."

There were reports that he had been killed in the attack, but he was later confirmed to have survived. He was pulled from the rubble of his home, and had sustained severe injuries.\n\nHe was recently appointed the secretary of Iran’s Defence Council, which was created after the war and coordinates Iran’s defence and national security policies, while mobilising resources to address threats.\n\nIn January, he warned that Iran’s response to any US military action would be “immediate, all out, and unprecedented, targeting the heart of Tel Aviv and all those supporting the aggressor”.\n\nHe led the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) for a decade until 2023, making him the second-longest-serving security chief since 1979 after former President Hassan Rouhani, who was SNSC secretary for nearly 16 years.\n\n\n\nBorn in Ahvaz in Iran’s Khuzestan, Shamkhani and his family moved to Los Angeles in the United States when he finished school. He later returned to Iran, where he studied engineering.\n\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, Shamkhani was a commander in Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and went on to be a commander of both of Iran’s navies, the IRGC Navy and the Iranian Navy.\n\nHe was the minister of defence between 1997 and 2005, and was the first Iranian defence official to visit Saudi Arabia since the revolution. He also came third in the 2001 presidential elections before returning to his role as defence minister."

The system went live publicly on Tuesday, February 24th, and on the first night dropped some 800,000 alerts about asteroids, supernovas, and feasting black holes. And that number is only expected to climb to the multiple millions per night.\n\nThe observatory released the first images taken with its car-sized Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) camera in June of last year. But researchers and stargazers have been eagerly anticipating the launch of this system. Every night, the camera captures about 1,000 images and then compares those against a reference image taken when the telescope first went online. Differences are automatically flagged, and an algorithm can distinguish between potential supernovas and approaching asteroids to send alerts to interested parties, all in just a matter of minutes. This means scientists can quickly turn their attention to fleeting celestial events.\n\nThankfully, the alerts aren’t all-or-nothing. They can be filtered by event type, brightness, or even the number of events within a given time period. That should help keep researchers from becoming overwhelmed by alerts as the Rubin Observatory ramps up the rate of discoveries."

            "content": "Here’s what we can tell you. If you’re thinking of picking up the Galaxy S26 Ultra at launch, putting in your preorder now isn’t a bad idea. It’s also a great time to pick up the midrange QuietComfort Headphones and what many of us at The Verge consider to be the game of 2024: Astro Bot. And who doesn’t want to save on a slick handheld vac?\n\nNow let’s get to it.\n\nIf you’re craving a little peace and quiet, Bose’s QuietComfort Headphones are currently on sale at Amazon in multiple colors for $199 ($150 off), which is the best price we’ve seen this year.\n\nThe standard QC Headphones are essentially a refresh of the last-gen QC45s with some new software tricks, including the ability to adjust noise cancellation levels and set custom listening modes. That being the case, you still get up to 24 hours of battery life, excellent comfort, and multipoint support, making it easy to switch between Bluetooth devices on the fly. They lack Bose’s immersive audio mode and the higher-quality Bluetooth found in the newer QC Ultras, though, as well as support for lossless audio over USB-C. Then again, that probably shouldn’t come as a surprise given they’re retailing for $250 less.\n\nAs we alluded to earlier, Samsung announced its Galaxy S26 lineup this week. There are already plenty of preorder deals to consider, but one of the best comes courtesy of Amazon, which is throwing in a $200 gift card alongside a free storage upgrade when you preorder the 512GB Galaxy S26 Ultra starting at $1,299.99. Other retailers are also running promos ahead of the phone’s March 11th release date, mind you, though they’re not as impressive; Best Buy is only providing a free storage upgrade, while Samsung is offering a mere $150 in credit.\n\nWhile the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus both feel like underwhelming, iterative updates, the 6.9-inch Galaxy S26 Ultra actually impressed our resident phone reviewer, Allison Johnson. That’s largely because of the new Privacy Display, which can help shield your screen from people sitting near you (if desired), and a more powerful camera array that should improve low-light performance. Plus, like the rest of the S26 lineup, the Ultra is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, which supports more advanced generative AI tools and a souped-up version of Gemini that can carry out certain tasks in third-party apps on your behalf. No one likes calling an Uber themselves, anyway.\n\nYou can still grab a physical copy of Astro Bot at Walmart for $32.99 ($27 off), an all-time low. The fantastic PlayStation 5 exclusive — which won Game of the Year at the 2024 Game Awards — has players take on the role of Astro, a lovable robot who sets off on a space adventure after his crew is lost in a sudden attack. Despite the prior game being a pack-in title for the PS5, Team Asobi’s full-sized sequel brims with inventive platforming, whimsical power-ups, and a kind of lighthearted fun that recalls the best of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon. Thankfully, it never feels outdated, even if ‘90s vibes are totally there.\n\nIf you’re looking for a relatively compact handheld vacuum that can reach into car crevices and suck up crumbs on your desk, Fanttik’s foldable Fold V10 Apex is still on sale at Amazon for $85.49 (about $65 off), matching its best price to date.\n\nFanttik’s 17,000Pa vac features an extendable nozzle that pivots up to 210 degrees, along with a built-in LED light to help illuminate the dark corners of your vehicle. An onboard display, meanwhile, indicates the remaining battery life and suction mode, as well as the status of the washable filter. It also comes with a range of useful add-ons, including an upholstery tool, two brush heads, and an extendable hose with a crevice tool for hard-to-reach areas. It even charges via USB-C, making it easy to juice after the battery runs out in about 30 minutes or so.\n\nMore ways to save this weekend\n\nsecond-gen AirTags for $99.99 ($24 off) at You can pick up fivefor $99.99 ($24 off) at Costco , though non-members will have to pay a $5 surcharge. That’s the first discount we’ve seen on Apple’s latest location tracker, which builds upon its predecessor with an upgraded ultra-wideband chip and extended range, allowing for more precise tracking from up to 50 percent farther away. It’s also better at locating items in multi-story homes, and the built-in speaker is up to 50 percent louder, making it easier to hear.

The 1440p display is a great entry-level OLED, with a sharp 16:9 panel and a speedy 240Hz refresh rate. As a QD-OLED monitor, it delivers the deep blacks and vibrant colors the technology is known for, along with G-Sync compatibility to help reduce screen tearing. It also includes a three-year warranty for added peace of mind.\n\nSharge Pixel 100 from You can snag thefrom Amazon (with Prime) and Sharge for $69.90 ($30 off) right now, which is its lowest price to date. The small, retro-inspired GaN charger delivers up to 140W of power, which is enough to charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50 percent in about 25 minutes. It also features three USB-C ports for powering multiple devices, along with a customizable dot-matrix display that shows the real-time wattage for each port."

On one end of the tracker you’ll find an integrated metal loop that can be attached to a keyring or clipped to a carabiner without the need for an extra case.\n\nThe Xiaomi Tag is compatible with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub tracking networks and mobile apps, but not at the same time. You’ll need to choose one or the other during setup. Like Apple’s AirTag, the Xiaomi Tag is powered by a replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery good for up to a year of use, and boasts an IP67 dust and water resistance rating, so it can survive a short dunking. There are also NFC capabilities that others can use to load your contact details should they find a lost device with the tag attached.\n\nAlthough it doesn’t have a clip, the Xiaomi Tag has a metal loop on one end so you can attach it to other things without needing a case. Image: Xiaomi\n\nOne big differentiator is that unlike Apple’s AirTags, the Xiaomi Tag lacks ultra wideband (UWB) functionality for pinpointing its exact location. You’ll instead have to rely on audible alerts to locate it once you’re nearby. If that’s not a deal-breaker, the Xiaomi Tag will be a cheaper alternative to Apple’s AirTags, selling for £12.99 (around $18) each, or £44.99 (around $61) for a four-pack. A single second-gen AirTag is $29, or $99 for four."

            "content": "is a news editor with over a decade’s experience in journalism. He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nXiaomi and Leica’s long-running phone partnership just got a little closer. Alongside the new international release of its 17 Ultra flagship, Xiaomi has been entrusted with manufacturing a separate version that is the first Leica Leitzphone to release outside of Japan, following three Sharp-made models exclusive to the country.\n\nIn truth, the Leitzphone is a 17 Ultra with Leica branding and a rotatable camera ring, and apart from a few design tweaks, it’s mostly the same as the Leica Edition of that phone already available in China. But the branding is a big deal: Leica hasn’t let Xiaomi use its red dot logo on hardware until now, even though the companies have partnered on Xiaomi’s flagship cameras since 2022. The jump to a fully Leica-branded phone is a vote of confidence from the camera company.\n\nAfter two weeks using the Leitzphone version of the 17 Ultra, it’s clear that confidence was well placed. This is my favorite phone of 2026 so far, Leica logo or not, though most buyers would be better off saving money with the standard 17 Ultra.\n\nThe 17 Ultra and its original Leica Edition launched in China on December 25th, 2025. The international version and the Leitzphone were launched at Xiaomi’s pre-MWC press conference in Barcelona on February 28th, alongside the regular Xiaomi 17. The 17 Ultra starts from £1,299 / €1,499 (about $1,750) with 512GB storage, rising by £400 / €700 for the Leica version. That’s a hefty premium, but there are a few differences from the regular 17 Ultra.\n\nLet’s start with the Leica of it all. It’s obvious first and foremost in the design: an ever-so-slightly glossy black finish on the back, an industrial touch in the knurled aluminum-alloy edges, and Leica’s red dot logo in one corner. It’s a slightly different design to the 17 Ultra Leica Edition that released in China at the end of December, which has a two-tone finish and orients the Leica logo the other way. It also ships with branded accessories, including a faux leather case with a Leica lens cap, a microfiber cleaning cloth, and a bright red wrist strap.\n\nThe Leica logo isn’t just printed on; that lettering is raised metal. The textured edges make the phone more grippy, even without a case. My favorite accessory by far is this case, which preserves the red dot logo and adds a lens cap.\n\nOther changes run through the software. While both versions of the 17 Ultra run Xiaomi’s HyperOS 3, based on Android 16, the Leitzphone’s interface has been customized. There are dedicated Leica widgets, including photo galleries and a golden-hour timer, and custom monochrome app icons for the most popular apps from Xiaomi and third parties — which look great when you first turn the phone on, but less so once they’re mixed in with all the non-monochromatic apps you’ll inevitably download from elsewhere.\n\nLeica and Xiaomi’s design languages coexist in the camera app.\n\nMost of the customization is in the camera. There’s an expanded array of Leica filters, and the interface uses Leica fonts and red as its accent color, instead of Xiaomi’s usual yellow. A new Leica Essential shooting mode lets you pick between two camera simulations: a color re-creation of the M9 and a monochromatic take on the M3. The Leitzphone also adds the option to enable C2PA content credentials on every shot you take.\n\nNone of this is as novel as the Leitzphone’s unique hardware feature: a rotatable camera ring. The edge of the camera island can be twisted round, with a satisfying haptic buzz to emulate the feel of gears clicking. It makes for an excellent fidget spinner, though its real purpose is to control zoom in the camera app, or cycle through exposure settings or filters if you prefer.\n\nThe metal rim of the camera island is the part that twists round.\n\nThis sounds like a great idea, and it’s something I’ve wanted to see on more phones since spotting it on Nubia’s Focus 2 Ultra. In practice, it’s not that useful. The camera island may be enormous by phone standards, but it would be small on a real camera, and it’s too flush against the body to hold comfortably. I’ve had to force myself to use the camera ring to zoom, finding the onscreen controls quicker and more natural every time. Perhaps with persistence I could drill it in my muscle memory; for now, I mostly rotate it by accident and get annoyed when I do.\n\nThe addition of the zoom ring makes sense given the 17 Ultra’s headline photography feature: a telephoto with continuous optical zoom. While Xiaomi’s 15 Ultra featured two telephoto cameras, the 17 Ultra combines them into one. (The company skipped 16 to catch up with Apple.) A single 1/1.4-inch type 200-megapixel sensor is paired with a Leica APO zoom lens that covers 3.2-4.3x magnification — the equivalent of 75-100mm — adjusting the aperture from f/2.39-2.96 as it goes.\n\nThe obvious criticism is the same we levied at Sony’s Xperia 1 IV, which boasted continuous 3.5-5.2x zoom: This is too short a spread to make much difference. It’s rare that the framing of a photo changes drastically as you move through the range, and outside those limits you’re back to the same digital zoom and sensor cropping that every other phone offers.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 20 I took all of these photos using the 17 Ultra’s telephoto camera.\n\nPhotos are excellent. The large sensor delivers natural bokeh, along with macro support at a minimum distance of 30cm. It can handle challenging lighting conditions, with good results in dim light — though it did once struggle with the inverse, blowing out highlights on an especially bright day. Mostly I’ve shot exclusively on the Leica Authentic mode — the other option being Leica Vibrant — which I like for its filmic qualities, preserving more of the highlights and shadows than most phones and avoiding the flattened sheen of excessive HDR.\n\nThe other lenses are just as impressive, though I do find myself defaulting to the telephoto. The main camera has a large 1-inch-type sensor, and the same 50-megapixel resolution as the ultrawide and selfie camera. It’s one of the first phones to include a LOFIC (lateral overflow integration capacitor) sensor, which expands the dynamic range for highlights, helping me take some of the most dramatic skyline shots I’ve managed on a phone, and contributing to excellent performance in nighttime shots with bright lights.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14 These are a mix of photos from the other lenses.\n\nDespite the Leica logo, this isn’t just a camera. The Leitzphone has all of the flagship specs you’d expect: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, 16GB of RAM (in this economy?!) and 1TB of storage (with an option for 512GB on the regular 17 Ultra), a 6.9-inch 1-120Hz LTPO OLED display, and IP68 protection.\n\nThe battery is another standout feature. The 6,000mAh silicon-carbon cell isn’t the biggest around, and is smaller than the phone’s Chinese edition, but it’s still impressive. Even powering a demanding phone with a big display, I’ve usually been able to just about get two days of use from it between charges, though with very little left in the tank afterwards. 90W PPS wired charging and 50W wireless top it back up fast, though you’ll be limited to slow Qi speeds over third-party wireless chargers, and there’s no support for the magnetic Qi2 standard.\n\nThis is my favorite phone of the year so far.\n\nThe biggest problem the Leitzphone has is that it’s mostly a more expensive version of the 17 Ultra, which shares most of its best features. I prefer the look of the Leitzphone, and like a few of the Leica-specific shooting styles and the included case. But those aren’t worth £200, and the rotatable camera ring isn’t either. Unless that little red dot is very dear to your heart, there’s not quite enough reason to shell out extra for it — but mostly because the 17 Ultra is such a good phone in its own right.\n\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nAgree to Continue: Xiaomi 17 Ultra Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.

            "content": "is a news editor with over a decade’s experience in journalism. He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nXiaomi has just given a global launch to two of its latest flagship phones, the Xiaomi 17 and 17 Ultra, along with a Leica-branded Leitzphone edition of the Ultra. There’s no sign, however, of the 17 Pro, which launched in China with an additional display mounted next to the rear cameras.\n\nThe 17 and 17 Ultra will apparently be available soon in the UK, Europe, and select other markets. The 17 — pitched as a rival to the likes of the iPhone 17 and Samsung Galaxy S26 — will cost £899 / €999 (about $1,200), while the larger and more capable Ultra starts from £1,299 / €1,499 ($1,750). The limited-edition Leitzphone will be substantially more expensive at £1,699 / €1,999 ($2,300), though it includes 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, along with a few extra accessories.\n\nI like the simple, sleek aesthetic of the phone. The 6.3-inch display isn’t tiny, but it does make the phone small by modern standards. All three of the phone’s rear cameras are 50-megapixel.\n\nThe 17 is an extremely capable small-ish flagship, with a 6.3-inch OLED display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and large 6,330mAh silicon-carbon battery (though sadly smaller than the 7,000mAh version launched in China). I won’t be writing a full review of the 17, but did spend a week using it as my main phone, and found that the battery cruised past the full-day mark, though wasn’t quite enough for two full days of my typical usage. That’s far better battery life than you’d find in similarly sized phones from Apple, Samsung, or Google.\n\nThe cameras impress too, with 50-megapixel sensors behind each of the four lenses, selfie included. Pound for pound, you won’t find many better camera systems in any phone this size.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 10 I’ve been largely impressed by the Xiaomi 17’s cameras.\n\nThe Ultra, unsurprisingly, takes things to another level. It’s much larger, with a 6.9-inch display, and weighs a hefty 218g. Despite that, the 6,000mAh is actually smaller, though I found it delivered pretty similar longevity.\n\nThe 17 Ultra is larger in just about every respect, but strangely has a smaller battery.\n\nThe enormous camera is, as ever for Xiaomi’s Ultra phones, the highlight. There are 50-megapixel sensors for each of the main, ultrawide, and selfie cameras, with a large 1-inch-type sensor behind the primary lens. The periscope telephoto is even more impressive: 200-megapixel resolution, a large 1/1.4-inch sensor, and continuous optical zoom from 3.2x to 4.3x, the equivalent of 75-100mm. Xiaomi isn’t the first to pull off a true zoom phone — Sony’s Xperia 1 IV got there first in 2022 — but the telephoto camera here is far more capable than that phone’s, with natural bokeh and impressive performance even in low light.\n\nThis is the Leica-branded Leitzphone version of the 17 Ultra.\n\nThe camera capabilities are supported by Xiaomi’s ongoing photography partner Leica, but it’s the pair’s Leitzphone that really emphasizes that. Slightly redesigned from the 17 Ultra Leica Edition that was released in China last December, this includes Leica branding across the hardware and software, a range of Leica filters and shooting styles, and a rotatable rear camera ring that can be used to control the zoom. It’s the first Leica Leitzphone produced by Xiaomi — after a trio of Japan-only Sharp models — and comes with additional branded accessories, including a case with a lens cap and a microfiber cleaning cloth.\n\nXiaomi has plenty of other announcements alongside the 17 series phones at MWC this year, including a super-slim magnetic power bank, the Pad 8 and Pad 8 Pro tablets, and a smart tag that supports both Google and Apple’s tech-tracking networks.\n\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge"

            "content": "I never knew how easy it was to die in an orgy. But that’s just one of the many threats facing Geralt of Rivia in his latest adventure. The studio behind the Reigns series of Tinder-like choose-your-own-adventure games has now adapted The Witcher, following a handful of original titles and a take on Game of Thrones. And for Francois Alliot, creative director at Reigns studio Nerial, the series’ structure actually makes it an ideal way to ease players into sprawling fantasies like this. “There’s something about the way you can bring really complex universes, lore, and storylines to simple actions,” he says. “It can work in a lot of contexts.”\n\nWhat makes Reigns so approachable is the way it distills every action into a binary choice. As you play, you’re presented with cards, and you progress by either swiping right or left. In the case of The Witcher, for instance, an elf might ask Geralt for protection, and your options are simply to say either yes or no and then deal with the consequences. Each run through the game involves making a number of these decisions to progress a storyline until, well, you die.\n\nThe idea was for Reigns: The Witcher to work on two levels. For existing fans, it’s a fun way to play around and experiment in the world. “It’s not a new Witcher,” Alliot notes. “It’s a meta game around this universe, a bit like a fanfiction simulator.” But for those who might be intimidated by the franchise, which spans multiple books, games, and TV shows, it’s also a good place to start. “It works nicely as an entry point because you can really get a feel for the tone and rules, or lack of rules, of the world,” says narrative designer Oscar Harrington-Shaw. “But you’re not having to commit to a complex RPG.”\n\nThere are several aspects of the Reigns formula that had to be tweaked to work with The Witcher. One of the key conceits in the games is that you can die; in the original Reigns you played as a king, and when that was over you picked up as their successor. But that doesn’t really work when you’re playing a character like Geralt who can’t die. So you aren’t actually playing as Geralt; instead, you’re his bard pal Dandelion, singing tales of Geralt’s exploits that may or may not be true. This allowed the team at Nerial to “free ourselves from the lore,” as Alliot describes it, and have fun with things. This is especially apparent in the deaths, which come in the form of the aforementioned orgies or even from Geralt drinking himself to an early grave.\n\n“It really helped in two ways,” Harrington-Shaw says of coming up with the Dandelion idea, which came about from discussions with Witcher studio CD Projekt Red. “One is that it helps explain the loop; it gives a really neat end point. And we can have loads of fun deaths because it’s just a satisfying ending to a song. But we think it adds a really fun tension because you are playing as Geralt and you’re trying to survive, but you’re also trying to write good content.”\n\nImage: Devolver Digital\n\nAs I played, this setup made me much more open to experimenting. Instead of trying to roleplay as Geralt, I would often make odd choices just to see what happened. This, in turn, helps open up new storylines, giving some payoff for making the seemingly wrong decision. Even an early death can lead somewhere interesting in future runs.\n\nThe other notable addition in Reigns: The Witcher is a combat system. It wouldn’t be The Witcher if Geralt wasn’t slaying some monsters, but the idea of battles also had the potential to complicate the streamlined Reigns structure. The team settled on a sort of rhythm game, where you’re moving Geralt side to side on a board to attack or avoid monsters. What makes this system work within the confines of Reigns is that you’re still using the same commands; whether you’re making a pivotal decision or staring down a striga, everything comes down to swiping either right or left.\n\nDespite those changes, Harrington-Shaw says that The Witcher universe is an almost ideal fit for Reigns thanks to its dark sense of humor and frequently bleak world full of opposing factions. More important, though, is the main witcher himself. “Geralt is always facing these tricky binary choices,” he says. “The world of The Witcher is full of murky, gray morality, and that seemed perfect to translate.”\n\nReigns: The Witcher is out now on PC and mobile."

Welcome to Installer No. 117, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, please send Android tips, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)\n\nI also have for you the first big phone launch of the year, a new-old weather app, a way to maybe make your YouTube a little cheaper, a bunch of stuff to watch this weekend, and much more.

And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, forward it to them and tell them to subscribe here.)\n\nThe Drop\n\nScreen share\n\nMeredith Haggerty is one of those people you meet and you’re immediately like, Oh, you’re much cooler than I am. The more I get to know Meredith, a new(ish) editor here at The Verge, the more I realize how correct my first assumption was. Meredith has written about fashion and culture and brands and TV shows and also recently made a Pride and Prejudice joke that made me laugh so hard I spilled coffee all over my keyboard. Technically, Meredith owes me a keyboard.\n\nI asked Meredith to share her homescreen with us, both because I think it’s a fun way to get to know new people here and because I want her to tell me about cool things but I don’t want to just constantly badger her for TV recs. Here’s her homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why:\n\nThe phone: An iPhone 17. Until very recently, I was clinging to an iPhone 12 mini that I’d gotten as a hand-me-down corporate gift from a friend; it was so tiny and good and I had the perfect phone case. (Ben Affleck smoking a cigarette in a mask. A conversation starter!) But the battery became glacial, even after a couple of trips to the Genius Bar, and I had to give it up.\n\nThe wallpaper: A screenshot of Roku City, fall edition. I find Roku City very calming, so I decided to keep it with me.\n\nThe apps: Spotify, Messages, Mail, Chrome.\n\nI’m especially dependent on Notes, and here you can see my three main categories of Note: things I need to do, things I need to buy, thoughts I probably would have tweeted a few years ago. I love that the MTA app will tell me when I should leave for the train, but I almost never check it before I leave my house. For the weather, I actually rely on the New York Metro Weather Instagram account; my boyfriend hates it when I tell him what number the vibes are.\n\nTo be clear, this attempt to simplify my homescreen hasn’t alleviated my time-wasting at all. Beyond this page, I have a loopy number of apps, mostly put into folders to keep me away from them, which doesn’t work. I’m still always scrolling to the last page, to the last folder, to the last page of that last folder, so I can play a mobile game I don’t enjoy called Drop the Cat. There’s maybe nothing worse in my life than the hold that mobile games I don’t enjoy have on me. I’m not even a cat person.\n\nI also asked Meredith to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she sent back:\n\nLove Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette . I’m appropriately ashamed of watching this show (I’m sorry, Schlossberg family!), but it’s a fantastic combination of cool and dumb. One second it makes smoking a cigarette in 1994 while wearing Calvin Klein look like the apex of human existence; the next, Fake JFK Jr. is pointing to an actor in a thick white wig, saying, “Have you met my uncle Teddy?” We shouldn’t even talk about the scene where Jackie O dances to Camelot.

It parses the deluge of recommendations from TikTok or Instagram, if you happen to be on the “wealthy children pose with food” side of those apps. You screenshot the clip, send it to Rodeo, and it grabs the relevant information and can save it in fairly handy lists.\n\nThe library. This might be stolen valor from the Meredith who had not yet downloaded Drop the Cat, but a little over a year ago I moved closer to the library and have really been cashing in on how free those books are. Plus, the Brooklyn Public Library app is so good, letting me put things on hold whenever I happen to think of them. I’m currently reading Louise Erdrich’s The Sentence , which I am probably incorrectly not as into as her The Mighty Red , and we don’t have to talk about how many times I’ve renewed it because I’ve been playing phone games instead.\n\nNirvanna the Band the Show the Movie . I’d never watched Viceland’s Nirvanna the Band the Show before I went to see the movie, and you currently cannot do so legally, so probably I still haven’t. I didn’t need it to enjoy the movie, though, which is hilarious and sweet and made me go “How did they do that???” so many times.\n\nCrowdsourced\n\nHere’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads and this post on Bluesky.\n\n“Marathon (a new extraction shooter game by Bungie) is having an open play-test / demo this weekend so that’s what I’ll be into for the next few days.” – Janego\n\n“Really enjoying Agnes Aubert’s Mystical Cat Shelter by Heather Fawcett (author of the delightful Emily Wilde series). Feels like a cross between Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell and Howl’s Moving Castle.” — Spencer\n\n“Since 1Password have upped their price I’ve spent a few hours moving over to Apple Passwords and Uplock. Was mostly okay, but it’s a shame you can’t transfer over all your passkeys to Apple Passwords. Uplock having a lifetime purchase is a big plus.” — Matthew\n\n“Been watching Demon Slayer this past month, and FINALLY watched the Infinity Castle movie in a theater, and, it’s so clear how these anime movies are wildly different (and spectacular!) in tone, direction and characterization from our current crop of Hollywood blockbusters.” — Anshuman\n\n“I just yesterday switched my family from my grandfathered free Google Apps plan for our custom domain email to Fastmail. Fastmail is private but supports industry standard IMAP and CalDAV protocols, so we can use the built-in mail apps on our phones and computers.” — Mike\n\n“I’ve been listening to Comedy Bang Bang! Still super funny. Big Paul F. Tompkins fan.” — Mo\n\n“Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown. Despite the occasionally brutal RNG, it’s so fun to be able to dive into my favourite Trek stories and tweak the outcomes.” — Jono\n\n“Reading the first book in the On the Calculation of Volume series. It’s a time loop story, like Groundhog Day but way more realistic and sorta sad but it’s great so far!” — Colin\n\n“The news of the YouTube app coming to the Apple Vision Pro made me re-watch the only good use of 360 video I’ve seen: ‘How TV screens made watching movies worse,’ a fully 3D-animated, 20-minute video essay about how the home releases of movies differ from their theatrical cuts and why that matters, and how the physical size of TV screens makes an impact on content. If you have a Vision Pro it’s worth pulling out just for this video. After that, watch everything else that YouTuber (Noodle) has made.” — Nathan\n\nSigning off\n\nThis winter has been a disaster, where I live and many other places. So much snow, so many snow days, so much chaos. First of all, I hope you’ve all stayed safe and warm and well! Second of all, there is one bit of good news in all this: Casey Neistat is out in New York City vlogging again. All these years later, nobody YouTubes quite like Casey YouTubes. Between this and the return of Paul Ford’s blog, it almost feels like the good internet is coming back. Here’s hoping.\n\nSee you next week!"

            "content": "Friday afternoon, just as this interview was getting underway, a news alert flashed across my computer screen: the Trump administration was severing ties with Anthropic, the San Francisco AI company founded in 2021 by Dario Amodei. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had invoked a national security law to blacklist the company from doing business with the Pentagon after Amodei refused to allow Anthropic’s tech to be used for mass surveillance of U.S. citizens or for autonomous armed drones that could select and kill targets without human input.\n\nIt was a jaw-dropping sequence of events. Anthropic stands to lose a contract worth up to $200 million and could be barred from working with other defense contractors after President Trump posted on Truth Social directing every federal agency to “immediately cease all use of Anthropic technology.” (Anthropic has since said it will challenge the Pentagon in court.)\n\nMax Tegmark has spent the better part of a decade warning that the race to build ever-more-powerful AI systems is outpacing the world’s ability to govern them. The MIT physicist founded the Future of Life Institute in 2014 and helped organize an open letter — ultimately signed by more than 33,000 people, including Elon Musk — calling for a pause in advanced AI development.\n\nHis view of the Anthropic crisis is unsparing: the company, like its rivals, has sown the seeds of its own predicament. Tegmark’s argument doesn’t begin with the Pentagon but with a decision made years earlier — a choice, shared across the industry, to resist regulation. Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind and others have long promised to govern themselves responsibly. Anthropic this week even dropped the central tenet of its own safety pledge — its promise not to release increasingly powerful AI systems until the company was confident they wouldn’t cause harm.\n\nNow, in the absence of rules, there’s not a lot to protect these players, says Tegmark. Here’s more from that interview, edited for length and clarity. You can hear the full conversation this coming week on TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC Download podcast.\n\nWhen you saw this news just now about Anthropic, what was your first reaction?\n\nThe road to hell is paved with good intentions. It’s so interesting to think back a decade ago, when people were so excited about how we were going to make artificial intelligence to cure cancer, to grow the prosperity in America and make America strong. And here we are now where the U.S. government is pissed off at this company for not wanting AI to be used for domestic mass surveillance of Americans, and also not wanting to have killer robots that can autonomously — without any human input at all — decide who gets killed.\n\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026: The tech ecosystem, all in one room Your next round.

San Francisco, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic has staked its entire identity on being a safety-first AI company, and yet it was collaborating with defense and intelligence agencies [dating back to at least 2024]. Do you think that’s at all contradictory?\n\nIt is contradictory. If I can give a little cynical take on this — yes, Anthropic has been very good at marketing themselves as all about safety. But if you actually look at the facts rather than the claims, what you see is that Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind and xAI have all talked a lot about how they care about safety. None of them has come out supporting binding safety regulation the way we have in other industries. And all four of these companies have now broken their own promises. First we had Google — this big slogan, ‘Don’t be evil.’ Then they dropped that. Then they dropped another longer commitment that basically said they promised not to do harm with AI. They dropped that so they could sell AI for surveillance and weapons. OpenAI just dropped the word safety from their mission statement. xAI shut down their whole safety team. And now Anthropic, earlier in the week, dropped their most important safety commitment — the promise not to release powerful AI systems until they were sure they weren’t going to cause harm.\n\nHow did companies that made such prominent safety commitments end up in this position?\n\nAll of these companies, especially OpenAI and Google DeepMind but to some extent also Anthropic, have persistently lobbied against regulation of AI, saying, ‘Just trust us, we’re going to regulate ourselves.’ And they’ve successfully lobbied. So we right now have less regulation on AI systems in America than on sandwiches. You know, if you want to open a sandwich shop and the health inspector finds 15 rats in the kitchen, he won’t let you sell any sandwiches until you fix it. But if you say, ‘Don’t worry, I’m not going to sell sandwiches, I’m going to sell AI girlfriends for 11-year-olds, and they’ve been linked to suicides in the past, and then I’m going to release something called superintelligence which might overthrow the U.S. government, but I have a good feeling about mine’ — the inspector has to say, ‘Fine, go ahead, just don’t sell sandwiches.’\n\nThere’s food safety regulation and no AI regulation.\n\n\n\nAnd this, I feel, all of these companies really share the blame for. Because if they had taken all these promises that they made back in the day for how they were going to be so safe and goody-goody, and gotten together, and then gone to the government and said, ‘Please take our voluntary commitments and turn them into U.S. law that binds even our most sloppy competitors’ — this would have happened. Instead, we’re in a complete regulatory vacuum. And we know what happens when there’s a complete corporate amnesty: you get thalidomide, you get tobacco companies pushing cigarettes on kids, you get asbestos causing lung cancer. So it’s sort of ironic that their own resistance to having laws saying what’s okay and not okay to do with AI is now coming back and biting them.\n\nThere is no law right now against building AI to kill Americans, so the government can just suddenly ask for it. If the companies themselves had earlier come out and said, ‘We want this law,’ they wouldn’t be in this pickle. They really shot themselves in the foot.\n\nThe companies’ counter-argument is always the race with China — if American companies don’t do such and such, Beijing will. Does that argument hold?\n\nLet’s analyze that. The most common talking point from the lobbyists for the AI companies — they’re now better funded and more numerous than the lobbyists from the fossil fuel industry, the pharma industry and the military-industrial complex combined — is that whenever anyone proposes any kind of regulation, they say, ‘But China.’ So let’s look at that. China is in the process of banning AI girlfriends outright. Not just age limits — they’re looking at banning all anthropomorphic AI. Why? Not because they want to please America but because they feel this is screwing up Chinese youth and making China weak. Obviously, it’s making American youth weak, too.\n\nAnd when people say we have to race to build superintelligence so we can win against China — when we don’t actually know how to control superintelligence, so that the default outcome is that humanity loses control of Earth to alien machines — guess what? The Chinese Communist Party really likes control. Who in their right mind thinks that Xi Jinping is going to tolerate some Chinese AI company building something that overthrows the Chinese government? No way. It’s clearly really bad for the American government too if it gets overthrown in a coup by the first American company to build superintelligence. This is a national security threat.\n\nThat’s compelling framing — superintelligence as a national security threat, not an asset. Do you see that view gaining traction in Washington?\n\nI think if people in the national security community listen to Dario Amodei describe his vision — he’s given a famous speech where he says we’ll soon have a country of geniuses in a data center — they might start thinking: ‘Wait, did Dario just use the word country? Maybe I should put that country of geniuses in a data center on the same threat list I’m keeping tabs on, because that sounds threatening to the U.S. government.’ And I think fairly soon, enough people in the U.S. national security community are going to realize that uncontrollable superintelligence is a threat, not a tool. This is totally analogous to the Cold War. There was a race for dominance — economic and military — against the Soviet Union. We Americans won that one without ever engaging in the second race, which was to see who could put the most nuclear craters in the other superpower. People realized that was just suicide. No one wins. The same logic applies here.\n\nWhat does all of this mean for the pace of AI development more broadly? And how close do you think we are to the systems you’re describing?\n\nSix years ago, almost every expert in AI I knew predicted we were decades away from having AI that could master language and knowledge at human level — maybe 2040, maybe 2050. They were all wrong, because we already have that now. We’ve seen AI progress quite rapidly from high school level to college level to PhD level to university professor level in some areas. Last year, AI won the gold medal at the International Mathematics Olympiad, which is about as difficult as human tasks get. I wrote a paper together with Yoshua Bengio, Dan Hendrycks, and other top AI researchers just a few months ago giving a rigorous definition of AGI. According to this, GPT-4 was 27% of the way there. GPT-5 was 57% of the way there. So we’re not there yet, but going from 27% to 57% that quickly suggests it might not be that long.\n\nWhen I lectured to my students yesterday at MIT, I told them that even if it takes four years, that means when they graduate, they might not be able to get any jobs anymore. It’s certainly not too soon to start preparing for it.\n\nAnthropic is now blacklisted. I’m curious to see what happens next — will the other AI giants stand with it and say, ‘We won’t do this either?’ Or does someone like xAI raise their hand and say, ‘Anthropic didn’t want that contract, we’ll take it’? [Editor’s note: Hours after the interview, OpenAI announced its own deal with the Pentagon.]\n\nLast night, Sam Altman came out and said he stands with Anthropic and has the same red lines. I admire him for the courage of saying that. Google, as of when we started this interview, had said nothing. If they just stay quiet, I think that’s incredibly embarrassing for them as a company, and a lot of their staff will feel the same. We haven’t heard anything from xAI yet either. So it’ll be interesting to see. Basically, there’s this moment where everybody has to show their true colors.\n\nIs there a version of this where the outcome is actually good?\n\nYes, and this is why I’m actually optimistic in a strange way. There’s such an obvious alternative here. If we just start treating AI companies like any other companies — drop the corporate amnesty — they would clearly have to do something like a clinical trial before they released something this powerful, and demonstrate to independent experts that they know how to control it. Then we get a golden age with all the good stuff from AI, without the existential angst. That’s not the path we’re on right now. But it could be."

Discovery, setting the stage for Paramount Skydance to win ownership of the Hollywood studio.\n\nAt the time, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said they were being financially disciplined. Now reporting in Bloomberg offers more details about why Netflix executives backed down from a bidding war that it seemed to win back in December.\n\nFor one thing, the streaming giant’s shareholders appeared deeply skeptical that the acquisition was a good deal — Netflix’s share price declined 30% since announcing the deal, while the subsequent news that it was backing down sent Netflix stock up nearly 14%.\n\nFor another, Netflix’s commitment to the deal reportedly wavered after Paramount came in with an increased offer and seemed willing to go several more rounds in a bidding war.\n\nBy the time Sarandos met with Trump administration officials on Thursday, he may already have decided to concede. In fact, since President Donald Trump had previously warned him not to overpay, Sarandos reportedly told him, “I took your advice.”\n\nMeanwhile, employees at Warner Bros. now worry about major studio layoffs and conservative political pressure on CNN."

            "content": "The streaming and entertainment industry just witnessed one of its most high-stakes megadeals ever, stunning industry observers. Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to disrupt Hollywood and the media business as we know it.\n\nAfter years of Warner Bros. Discovery struggling under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by declining cable viewership and fierce competition from streaming platforms, the company has been considering major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.\n\nSeveral major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant and in December, Netflix announced it would acquire WBD’s studios and streaming for $82.7 billion.\n\nBut in a surprise eleventh-hour move this month, it now looks like the David Ellison-run Paramount will actually be the winner of this bidding war, offering $111 billion to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery’s assets, including its studios, HBO, streaming platforms, games, and TV networks such as CNN and HGTV. Paramount was itself recently acquired by Ellison with significant support from his father, the Oracle chairman, world’s sixth-richest person, and major Trump donor Larry Ellison.\n\nParamount’s offer still awaits formal approval from WBD’s board of directors, and any potential agreement may also face pressure from regulators.\n\nLet’s break down exactly what is happening, what’s at stake, and what could come next.\n\nWhat has happened so far?\n\n​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) revealed it was exploring a potential sale after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.\n\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026: The tech ecosystem, all in one room Your next round.

San Francisco, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\n​The bidding process quickly became competitive, and Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with Paramount initially viewed as the frontrunner.\n\nHowever, WBD’s board eventually determined that an offer from the streaming giant Netflix was the most attractive. Netflix offered $82.7 billion for just Warner’s film, television, and streaming assets.\n\nThus began the bidding war. Paramount believed its bid, of approximately $108 billion for all of Warner’s assets, was superior to Netflix’s offer that focused on just the studios and streaming. To sweeten its deal, Netflix amended its agreement in January to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per share of Warner Bros. Discovery, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed.\n\n​Paramount persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD. Still, the Warner board repeatedly rejected its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal, including concern over the suite of investors bankrolling Paramount’s bid, which includes Saudi, Qatari, and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take at the time.\n\nIn January, Paramount filed a lawsuit seeking more information about the Netflix deal. A month later, the company sought to sweeten its deal by announcing it would offer a $0.25 per share “ticking fee” to WBD shareholders for each quarter the deal fails to close by December 31, 2026. It also said it would pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee if Warner backs out of its deal with Netflix.\n\nThen, in a final attempt to secure a deal, Paramount increased its offer to $31 per share in February. This prompted the WBD board to prolong discussions with Paramount regarding a potential agreement, considering it as a superior offer. Netflix declined to increase its bid and withdrew from the negotiations.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement on Feb. 26. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nIn addition to the billions Paramount already holds in debt, the company is also set to assume the approximately $33 billion in debt Warner Bros. Discovery holds under the agreement. The deal will be backed by a $54 billion debt commitment from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, and Apollo Global Management, as well as $45.7 billion in equity from Larry Ellison.\n\nRegulatory hurdles and other concerns\n\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch\n\nIn addition to the assumption of substantial debt posing a significant financial burden, Paramount faces several other hurdles in its deal with WBD that could impact the success of the transaction.\n\nFor one, Ellison has warned about significant job reductions that are expected in the near future. There have already been widespread concerns among critics about potential job losses and lower wages.\n\nEllison is also a controversial figure in the industry, and his ownership of CBS News has been seen as sympathetic and supportive of the administration of Donald Trump, of whom his father, Larry Ellison, is a major donor. Under Ellison’s ownership of Paramount, reporting critical of the administration has been shelved or received increased scrutiny from Ellison or his appointed head of CBS News, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss.\n\nThis has led to some concern among employees at Warner-owned CNN. Trump has personally sought concessions from news divisions critical of him, including a $16 million settlement from CBS, before his FCC would approve the Ellison takeover of Paramount. Before Netflix bowed out of the deal, Trump pressured the company to fire the former Biden White House official Susan Rice from its board. He has publicly stated his intentions to bring CNN to heel under new owners.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny is another hurdle. Such a large-scale merger has attracted attention from lawmakers.\n\nFor instance, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement on February 26 that “these two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny — the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review.”\n\nA day before Netflix backed out, it was revealed that a coalition of 11 state attorneys general urged the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to review the merger under concerns it will stifle competition and increase subscription prices. This comes months after U.S. senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal voiced their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition.\n\nThat said, Ellison’s father, the Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, is a significant Trump donor and has close ties to the Trump administration. His deal to acquire Paramount last year cleared quickly after acquiescing to c\n\nWhen is the deal expected to close?\n\nThe deal is not yet final.\n\nInitially, a deal with Netflix was expected to lead to a stockholder vote around April, with the deal anticipated to close within 12 to 18 months following that vote. However, the transition to the Paramount deal will likely create a new timeline for approval. Plus, regulatory approvals are still pending, and scrutiny could shape the final outcome.\n\nStay tuned…"

            "content": "It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.\n\nBelow, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.\n\nMicrosoft’s 2019 investment in OpenAI\n\nThis is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash.\n\nIt was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.\n\nThe partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. Last year, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. Microsoft has also begun exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.\n\nOpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs.\n\nThe rise of Oracle\n\nOn June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company’s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle a spot alongside Google as one of OpenAI’s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company’s stock went shooting up.\n\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026: The tech ecosystem, all in one room Your next round. Your next hire. Your next breakout opportunity.

San Francisco, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nA few months later, it happened again. On September 10, Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle’s stock climbed even higher, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith.\n\nBut before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with.\n\nNvidia’s investment spree\n\nAs AI labs scramble to build infrastructure, they’re mostly buying GPUs from one company: Nvidia. That trade has made Nvidia flush with cash — and it’s been investing that cash back into the industry in increasingly unconventional ways. In September 2025, Nvidia bought a 4% stake in rival Intel for $5 billion — but even more surprising has been the deals with its own customers. One week after the Intel deal was revealed, the company announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, paid for with GPUs that would be used in OpenAI’s ongoing data center projects. Nvidia has since announced a similar deal with Elon Musk’s xAI, and OpenAI launched a separate GPU-for-stock arrangement with AMD.\n\nIf that seems circular, it’s because it is. Nvidia’s GPUs are valuable because they’re so scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way. You could say the same thing about OpenAI’s privately held stock, which is all the more valuable because it can’t be obtained through public markets. For now, OpenAI and Nvidia are riding high and nobody seems too worried — but if the momentum starts to flag, this sort of arrangement will get a lot more scrutiny.\n\nBuilding tomorrow’s hyperscale data centers\n\nFor companies like Meta that already have significant legacy infrastructure, the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that the company plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028.\n\nIn the first half of 2025, the company spent $30 billion more than the previous year, driven largely by the company’s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent $10 billion deal with Google Cloud, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers.\n\nA new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, dubbed Hyperion, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas.\n\nThat kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk’s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that experts say violate the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe Stargate moonshot\n\nJust two days after his second inauguration last January, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history.” OpenAI’s Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.”\n\nIn broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman’s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.\n\nAs the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. In August, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of eight data centers in Abilene, Texas, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.\n\nThe capex crunch\n\n“Capital expenditures” are usually a pretty dry metric, referring to a company’s spending on physical assets. But as tech companies lined up to report their capex plans for 2026, the rush of data center spending made the figures a lot more interesting — and a lot bigger.\n\nAmazon was the capex leader, projecting $200 billion in 2026 spending (up from $131 billion in 2025), while Google was a close second with an estimate between $175 billion and $185 billion (up from $91 billion in 2025). Meta estimated $115 billion to $135 billion (up from $71 billion the previous year), although that figure is a little deceptive because a lot of the data center projects have been kept off their books entirely. All told, hyperscalers are planning to spend nearly $700 billion on data center projects in 2026 alone.\n\nIt was enough money to spook some investors. The companies were mostly undeterred, however, explaining that AI infrastructure was vital to their companies’ future. It’s set up a strange dynamic. As you might expect, tech executives are more bullish on AI than their Wall Street counterparts — and the more tech companies spend, the more nervous their bankers get. Add in the huge amounts of debt many companies are taking on to fund those buildouts, and you start to hear CFOs across the valley grinding their teeth.\n\nThat hasn’t put a damper on AI spending yet, but it will soon — unless of course, hyperscalers show they can make those investments pay off.\n\nThis article was first published on September 22."

            "content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced late on Friday that his company has reached an agreement allowing the Department of Defense to use its AI models in the department’s classified network.\n\nThis follows a high-profile standoff between the DoD — also known under the Trump administration as the Department of War — and OpenAI’s rival Anthropic. The Pentagon pushed AI companies, including Anthropic, to allow their models to be used for “all lawful purposes,” while Anthropic sought to draw a red line around mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons.\n\nIn a lengthy statement released Thursday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said the company “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner,” but he argued that “in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.”\n\nMore than 60 OpenAI employees and 300 Google employees signed an open letter this week asking their employers to support Anthropic’s position.\n\nAfter Anthropic and the Pentagon failed to reach an agreement, President Donald Trump criticized the “Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic” in a social media post that also directed federal agencies to stop using the company’s products after a six-month phase-out period.\n\nIn a separate post, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth claimed Anthropic was trying to “seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military.” Hegseth also said he is designating Anthropic as a supply-chain risk: “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\n\nOn Friday, Anthropic said it had “not yet received direct communication from the Department of War or the White House on the status of our negotiations,” but insisted it would “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.”\n\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026: The tech ecosystem, all in one room Your next round.

            "content": "China’s humanoid robots grabbed global attention with kung fu flips at the nation’s televised Spring Festival Gala, while Chinese phone maker Honor is set to unveil its first humanoid robot at MWC in Spain.\n\nRobotics was flagged as a priority under the country’s “Made in China 2025” plan, albeit originally focused on factory automation, rather than humanoids. Now, rapid advances in multimodal AI are accelerating so-called embodied AI — autonomous machines operating in the real world — a push officials say could help offset labor shortages and drive productivity gains.\n\nAt this early stage of humanoid robot development, Chinese companies are outpacing their U.S. rivals in both speed and volume, Selina Xu, a China and AI policy lead at the office of Eric Schmidt said.\n\n“China has a more robust hardware supply chain — much of it built up through the EV sector, from sensors to batteries — and the world’s strongest manufacturing base, allowing companies to iterate far faster than Western competitors,” Xu told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result, not only are Chinese robots cheaper but companies can also release new models more quickly, Xu noted, adding that leading Chinese player Unitree shipped roughly 36 times more units last year than U.S. rivals Figure and Tesla.\n\nGlobal humanoid robot shipments totaled just 13,317 units last year, according to a Forbes report released last month. That is a tiny base for an industry expected to nearly double annually and reach 2.6 million units by 2035. (Still, the figures should be viewed with caution. The report notes it remains unclear how many units represent commercial sales versus demo models or pilot deployments, underscoring the early-stage nature of the industry.)\n\nThe top humanoid robot makers by 2025 shipments were led by China’s Agibot and Unitree, followed by UBTech, Leju Robotics, Engine AI, and Fourier Intelligence, underscoring Beijing’s early dominance in the sector.\n\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026: The tech ecosystem, all in one room Your next round.

San Francisco, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe biggest shift recently has been from “demo-driven excitement” to “operations-driven adoption,” Yuli Zhao, chief strategy officer at Galbot, told TechCrunch. Galbot’s humanoid robot, the G1, appeared at this year’s Spring Festival Gala, China’s annual, state-run lunar New Year’s Eve television show, alongside robots from Unitree Robotics, Noetix, and MagicLab.\n\n“More customers are asking: Can the robot run stably in real environments and actually take work off people’s plates? That practical pull is strengthened in China because policy and industrial strategy encourage automation upgrades, and the manufacturing ecosystem makes iteration extremely fast,” Zhao said.\n\nWhile increased funding toward humanoid startups “has definitely accelerated” the pace of progress, “the most durable adoption comes when you can show reliable and repeatable value in production or service operations, not just a one-off showcase,” Zhao added.\n\nStill, investing helps and Chinese robotics makers are securing it. Last year Unitree was valued at around $3 billion after closing its Series C, with ambitions to reach as much as $7 billion in a future IPO. Meanwhile, Galbot has raised more than $300 million in fresh funding, reportedly pushing its valuation to $3 billion, one of the largest financings in China’s humanoid robotics sector to date.\n\nU.S. companies are moving beyond flashy demos as well to focus on real-world deployments. Plus, they are pursuing their own aggressive goals. U.S. startup Foundation, for instance, plans to build 50,000 humanoid robots by the end of 2027.\n\nBut China is already targeting a mix of affordable mass-market models and high-end applications, rapidly expanding humanoids across industrial, consumer, and rehabilitation sectors, according to a December TrendForce report.\n\nBottlenecks to China’s dominance\n\nWhen it comes to AI systems and integrated software, it’s still unclear where Chinese humanoid firms truly stand. The industry is largely betting on vision-language-action models and “world models,” but both technologies remain in early stages. Nvidia currently leads the space with its end-to-end humanoid software stack, according to Xu, so naturally most humanoid startups in China are powered by Nvidia’s Orin chips. However, domestic chipmakers are developing homegrown alternatives, she said.\n\nYet humanoid robotics makers are still working on fundamental problems. The challenge is enabling robot foundation models to predict the “next physical state” the robot will face in unpredictable environments, like how large language models predict the next word. But unlike LLMs, humanoid robotics companies can’t simply scrape the internet for training data, Xu said. So most are relying on simulation environments, which generates synthetic data, though real-world data collection remains essential.\n\n“Because of the data scarcity problem, humanoids are still far away from autonomy. The hardware is currently ahead of the software — the robot body can handle a lot more dexterity today than years ago (though it has reliability issues, as we saw with the robots that broke down at humanoid marathons), but the brain is still nascent,” the analyst said.\n\nSafety is a major hurdle for humanoid robots, too. One high-profile accident could trigger public backlash, and China is likely weighing how to roll out the technology quickly without moving too fast. As the industry matures, more regulations are expected.\n\nGiven the lack of data, Zhao believes that demand for humanoids will grow first in fairly contained workplaces.\n\n“Early momentum is likely to be in industrial manufacturing, warehouse logistics, and retail, where tasks are repetitive, hours are long, and processes are clear — creating real demand and ideal conditions for humanoid robots to deliver value at scale,” he said.\n\nOther APAC players\n\nHumanoid robot development is not a two-country race. Japan’s robotics ecosystem — from startups to semiconductor heavyweights — is targeting humanoid mass production by 2027. Long a pioneer through projects like Honda’s Asimo, Murata Manufacturing’s Murata Boy, and SoftBank Robotics’ Pepper, Japan leans on precision and advanced control. One area unique to this nation: Humanoid robots are increasingly used in eldercare.\n\nCoral Capital CEO James Riney, who invests in tech companies in Japan, believes Tokyo will continue to thrive in the humanoid robotics industry. “There are three factors likely to drive the adoption of robotics in Japan. One is the labor shortage and the desire to depend less on mass immigration. The second is the widespread cultural view of robots as our friends — more Doraemon vs. Terminator. The third is that Japan is already dominant in many parts of the robotics supply chain.”\n\nHyundai Motor’s Boston Dynamics unit introduced a new Atlas humanoid for factory use by 2028, with plans to produce up to 30,000 units annually in the U.S. as part of its AI-driven robotics push.\n\nStill, for China, government policy, industrial strategy, labor shortages, and private capital are all converging to turbocharge the country’s humanoid robotics push.\n\n“China’s leadership is best understood as a speed-to-scale advantage,” Zhao said. “The ecosystem here compresses the entire cycle — R&D, supply chain, manufacturing, integration, and customer deployment — into a very tight loop. That means humanoid companies can move from prototype to real-world deployment faster, learn from real operations, and iterate at a pace that’s difficult to match elsewhere.”"

            "content": "Minutes after Donald Trump announced that the US and Israeli governments had launched a “major combat operation” against Iran in the early hours of Saturday morning, disinformation about the attack and Tehran’s response flooded X.\n\nWIRED has reviewed hundreds of posts on X, some of which have racked up millions of views, that promote misleading claims about the locations and scale of the attack.\n\nElon Musk’s social media platform is a verifiable mess: In some cases, alleged video footage of the attack shared in posts on X are actually months or years old. In several posts, video footage of apparent attacks have been attributed to incorrect locations. A number of images shared on X appear to be altered or generated with AI. Other posts attempt to pass off video game footage as scenes from the conflict.\n\nX did not respond to a request for comment. Under Musk’s stewardship, X has become a haven for disinformation, especially during major breaking-news events. At the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, and more recently during anti-immigration enforcement protests in LA, the platform has drowned in inaccurate and faulty posts.\n\nAlmost all of the most viral posts reviewed by WIRED on Saturday came from accounts with blue check marks, meaning they pay X for its premium service and could be eligible to earn money based on how much engagement their posts generate, even if the content is false. While some posts with disinformation have a community note appended beneath them to correct the record, they remain up on the site, and it’s unclear how many people viewed them before the notes appeared.\n\nOne video posted by a blue-check-mark account claimed to show ballistic missiles over Dubai; the clip actually showed Iranian ballistic missiles fired at Tel Aviv in October 2024. The post has been viewed over 4.4 million times.\n\nOne of the most viral clips shared on X in the hours after the attack claims to show an Israeli fighter jet being shot down by Iranian air defense systems. The video has been shared by dozens of accounts, including one post that has been viewed more than 3.5 million times. The provenance of the video is unclear, but there have been no credible reports of any Israeli jets being shot down over Iran on Saturday.\n\nAnother account that claims to be an expert in open source intelligence posted a video showing explosions, alongside the caption: “6 Iranian Hypersonic Missiles hit the Indian-invested Israeli Haifa port. Massive damages reported.” The video has been viewed 64,000 times, but the footage was actually captured last July and shows an Israeli attack on the defense ministry in Damascus, Syria.\n\nIn a number of cases, pro-Iranian accounts have been using images and footage from Saturday’s attacks to falsely claim successful strikes against Israel. “IRANIAN MISSILE IMPACT IN TEL AVIV RIGHT NOW,” the Iran Observer account wrote in a post featuring an image of Dubai. The post had been viewed over 200,000 times before it was deleted, but dozens of other posts sharing the same image and making the same claims remain on X.\n\nTehran Times, a news outlet aligned with the Iranian government, posted what appears to be an AI-generated image on X which claims to show that “an American radar in Qatar was completely destroyed today in an Iranian drone strike.” The use of AI-generated images was flagged on X by Tal Hagin, a senior analyst with open source intelligence company Golden Owl. While there are reports that drone and missile attacks targeted the US Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters in Bahrain, there are no reports yet of similar successful attacks in Qatar.\n\nA pro-Trump account, which also features a blue check mark, posted images claiming to show the before and after pictures of the palace of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, which was targeted during Saturday’s missile attacks. (In a post on Truth Social, Trump claimed Khamenei was killed in an attack.) While the after picture appears to accurately show the palace after the attack, the before picture shows the Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini, which is located on the other side of Tehran. The post has been viewed 365,000 times."

            "content": "“This is just not the right pathway forward,” Isaacman said.\n\nA senior NASA official, speaking on background to Ars, noted that the space agency has experienced hydrogen and helium leaks during both the Artemis I and Artemis II prelaunch preparations, and these problems have led to monthslong delays in launch.\n\n“If I recall, the timing between Apollo 7 and 8 was nine weeks,” the official said. “Launching SLS every three and a half years or so is not a recipe for success. Certainly, making each one of them a work of art with some major configuration change is also not helpful in the process, and we’re clearly seeing the results of it, right?”\n\nThe goal therefore is to standardize the SLS rocket into a single configuration in order to make the rocket as reliable as possible, and launching as frequently as every 10 months. NASA will fly the SLS vehicle until there are commercial alternatives to launch crews to the moon, perhaps through Artemis V as Congress has mandated, or perhaps even a little longer.\n\nIs Everyone on Board?\n\nThe NASA official said all of the agency’s key contractors are on board with the change, and senior leaders in Congress have been briefed on the proposed changes.\n\nThe biggest opposition to these proposals would seemingly come from Boeing, which is the prime contractor for the Exploration Upper Stage, a contract worth billions of dollars to develop a more powerful rocket that was due to launch for the first time later this decade. However, in a NASA news release, Boeing appeared to offer at least some support for the revised plans.\n\n“Boeing is a proud partner to the Artemis mission and our team is honored to contribute to NASA’s vision for American space leadership,” said Steve Parker, Boeing Defense, Space & Security president and CEO, in the news release. “The SLS core stage remains the world’s most powerful rocket stage, and the only one that can carry American astronauts directly to the moon and beyond in a single launch. As NASA lays out an accelerated launch schedule, our workforce and supply chain are prepared to meet the increased production needs.”\n\nSolid Reasons for Changing Artemis III\n\nNASA’s new approach to Artemis reflects a return to the philosophy of the Apollo program. During the late 1960s, the space agency flew a series of preparatory crewed missions before the Apollo 11 lunar landing. These included Apollo 7 (a low-Earth-orbit test of the Apollo spacecraft), Apollo 8 (a lunar orbiting mission), Apollo 9 (a low-Earth-orbit rendezvous with the lunar lander), and Apollo 10 (a test of the lunar lander descending to the moon, without touching down).\n\nWith its previous Artemis template, NASA skipped the steps taken by Apollo 7, 9, and 10. In the view of many industry officials, this leap from Artemis II—a crewed lunar flyby of the moon testing only the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft—to Artemis III and a full-on lunar landing was enormous and risky."

They came not from the government advising caution, but from an apparently hacked prayer-timing app called BadeSaba Calendar that has been downloaded more than 5 million times from the Google Play Store.\n\nThe messages arrived in quick succession over a period of 30 minutes, starting with the phrase ‘Help has arrived’ at 9:52 am Tehran time, shortly after the first set of explosions. No party has claimed responsibility for the hacks.\n\nScreenshots shared with WIRED Middle East show messages urging Iranian military personnel to surrender their weapons with the promise of amnesty. They also urged army personnel to join “the forces of liberation” and to “defend your brothers.”\n\nThe push notifications are all titled “Help is on the way” and call on Iranian military members to surrender. Screenshot: WIRED Middle East\n\n“The time for revenge has come,” one notification received at 10:02 am read (translated from Farsi). “The regime's repressive forces will pay for their cruel and merciless actions against the innocent people of Iran. Anyone who joins in defending and protecting the Iranian nation will be granted amnesty and forgiveness.”\n\n“For the freedom of our Iranian brothers and sisters, this is a call to all oppressive forces—lay down your weapons or join the forces of liberation. Only in this way can you save your lives. For a free Iran,” another message sent at 10:14 am read.\n\nCybersecurity analysts confirmed that BadeSabah users had received notifications around the time of the strikes, but have not been able to identify the source of the hack. “At this point, we genuinely do not know who is behind them, whether it was Israel or other anti-government Iranian groups,” says Narges Keshavarznia, digital rights researcher at the Miaan Group, adding that no hacker group has claimed credit."

            "content": "After Israel and the US launched joint attacks on Iran on Saturday, Tehran responded with missile attacks across the Gulf, targeting US military bases in those countries. Within hours, the UAE Ministry of Defense confirmed that its air defense systems had successfully intercepted several incoming ballistic missiles.\n\nAccording to the ministry, the missiles were destroyed before impact. However, debris from one interception fell in Abu Dhabi, killing one civilian. Abu Dhabi sits near several strategic military installations, including Al Dhafra Air Base, which hosts Emirati and US forces.\n\nFor many residents, the event unfolded as a series of distant flashes and muffled explosions in the sky. Behind those brief moments, however, is a complex network of radars, interceptors and command systems designed to detect, track, and destroy ballistic missiles traveling at hypersonic speeds.\n\nUnderstanding what happened in those seconds means understanding how the UAE’s layered missile defense network works.\n\nThe System Designed to Stop Ballistic Missiles\n\nThe UAE’s missile shield includes multiple layers of defense, such as the high-altitude Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and the lower-altitude MIM-104 Patriot.\n\nA Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile, a PAC-3 air defense missile, and a PrSM precision-strike missile at the Lockheed Martin Corp. Photograph: Jose Sarmento Matos/Getty Images\n\nDeveloped by Lockheed Martin, THAAD is designed to intercept ballistic missiles during the final phase of their flight, when they descend toward their target.\n\nUnlike traditional air defense missiles that explode near a threat, THAAD interceptors destroy incoming missiles through direct kinetic impact, basically colliding with them at extremely high speeds in what is known as “hit-to-kill” interception.\n\nThe UAE became the first country outside the US to deploy THAAD in January 2022, having received the system in 2015 as part of a multibillion-dollar defense agreement.\n\nA Layered Defense Network\n\nTHAAD is only one component of the UAE’s broader air- and missile-defense architecture. The country also operates the MIM-104 Patriot system, which is designed to intercept aircraft and ballistic missiles at lower altitudes.\n\nTogether, these systems form what defense planners describe as a layered missile-defense architecture, giving operators more than one opportunity to intercept an incoming threat before it reaches the ground.\n\nIn a typical interception sequence, several steps happen within seconds:"

            "content": "I’ve been reviewing Xiaomi’s smartphones for several years, and I always look forward to the new Ultra. If you’ve never sampled its wares, preferring the latest Apple or Samsung iteration, you might be surprised at just how good these devices are. The Chinese company is the third-largest phone maker in the world behind Apple and Samsung, and it packs all the latest cutting-edge hardware into its annual flagship release. Xiaomi’s Ultra line has long battled for the camera king title.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nAmusingly, Xiaomi skipped the 16 series to compete directly with Apple’s latest iPhone generation. There’s no radical redesign for the 17 Ultra over last year’s Xiaomi 15 Ultra, but there is refinement and a special version called the Leitzphone, designed with Leica, that may prove irresistible to fans of the German camera brand. The Xiaomi 17 Ultra is easily one of the best phones you can’t officially buy in the United States. While importing a Chinese smartphone is not without potential pitfalls, this one will tempt keen American photographers.\n\nLeica a Lot\n\nI’ve always appreciated Leica’s minimalist industrial design. Textured black and silver materials with a splash of red add some identity. It strikes me as a careful balance between form and function, and it comes through very strongly in Xiaomi’s Leitzphone. The aluminum alloy frame is ribbed for enhanced grip, you can rotate the ring around the camera for fine zoom control, and the user interface has an elegant Leica-themed makeover. I’m surprised there’s no dedicated shutter button, though you can add one with the optional photography kit (more on that later)."

            "content": "Others We Tested\n\nThere were multiple great bags we tried whose features or designs just didn't add up to a place in the top spots above. However, everyone has something different they're looking for in a toiletry bag, so while not perfect for us, some of these options may still be perfect for you.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nPatricks BB1 Bathroom Bag for $189: This crush-resistant, shock-absorbing rectangular bag is basically a heavier-duty, unisex version of the Flat Lay, below, except it costs four times as much. I tested it in the Triple Black colorway, which is “strictly limited to 1,000 pieces globally.” This one’s got two interior flaps with a slim, shallow zippered pouch on either side, but otherwise is just one big compartment that led to too much clinking and clanking of contents during my test. It’s great for full-sized products, but my testers and I all preferred bags that hold the products securely upright, as in the less expensive Parallelle Kit, above.\n\nFlat Lay Makeup Box Bag for $37: Available in opaque-fabric and clear (\"jelly\") styles, this unassuming pouch looks like a chubby rectangle with a handle on the end but actually unzips into a flat tray for easy access. There's only one compartment, so I didn't love it as a toiletry bag, but I did love it as a pool and beach accessory bag for sunscreen and makeup.\n\nMonos Metro Toiletry Case for $95: This durable, structured case, available in either nylon or vegan leather, exhibits the class and quality construction Monos is known for. It has one main roomy compartment with three small pockets inside; one zippered. It did a great job of protecting its contents while still being squishable enough to fit in a tightly packed carry-on, though I did find myself wishing it had a handle for carrying.\n\nCalpak Clear Cosmetics Case for $85: Constructed largely of water-resistant, wipe-clean PVC, this clear cosmetic case (I tested the Medium size) zips all the way around and folds flat to reveal two zippered compartments and one smaller zippered mesh bag. It also looks like a cute little purse with its 16 trendy color options, dual handles, and metal bottom studs. However, contents aren't as easy to access as other cosmetic bags that just open from the top—you have to lay the Calpak flat to open both sides, which requires a 16-by-10-inch footprint.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nVera Bradley Toiletry Bags for $30: The erstwhile must-have accessory of both early-aughts Southern sorority girls and their grandmothers, Vera Bradley bags are back with a new spokesperson (Zooey Deschanel), new designs, and updated fabrics like smooth twill and cotton gabardine. (Die-hard fans can rest assured that the staple quilted paisley options are still available.) The new line includes multiple styles of toiletry bags and makeup bags that are lightweight, giftable, and can add a pop of color and personality to your travel setup. I tested several, and my favorite was the Lay-Flat Travel Organizer—its two interior clear zippered compartments and three mesh slip pockets were roomy yet snug enough to keep all contents of my morning routine secure, and a rather large spill of soap in the large pocket cleaned up quickly. However, even though the fabric is padded, which provides some protection for the interior contents, the exterior is somewhat absorbent and not machine washable (though other designs are), so be forewarned that light-colored options could attract stains.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBagsmart Blast 4.5L Toiletry Bag for $30: This rectangular toiletry bag can sit on a counter (with about a 10 x 5-inch footprint) or hang with a 360-degree rotating hook. It's machine washable and has a bright orange interior for visibility, sporting five mesh pockets. Both my testers and I liked it a lot. The only thing that kept it from nabbing a top spot is how much space it took up when not hanging, and when it did hang, it stuck out more than the traditional flat hanging styles.\n\nBeis the Dopp Kit for $68: I’ve had Beis' Dopp Kit for four years now, and it’s still my go-to for any trip. The poly canvas material is durable and easy to spot-clean. Plus, I opted for the black version to mask the inevitable scuffs and smaller stains. What I love the most, though, are the compartments. The water-resistant section is a total game-changer when packing liquids or fragrances. If something leaks, a quick wipe gets the job done. The waterproof bottom is also a huge bonus when I’m getting ready at a bathroom sink. —Boutayna Chokrane\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nThule Aion Toiletry Bag for $65: This spacious, 5-liter bag with an 11 x 5-inch footprint features many thoughtful touches, including a wipe-clean interior with a rubbery, water-resistant bottom to protect it from wet countertops. (Though there's also a handy strap that snaps to hang on any-diameter hook or rack.) The sides snap down to compress, almost like a packing cube, and I like that it's squishable to fit into a smaller suitcase. It also comes with a removable translucent bag for taking liquids through the airport security line. However, it does take up a lot of space when not snapped down, and the waxed canvas does attract a lot of lines and marks, which may not be to everyone's aesthetic taste.\n\nNex Dopp for $73: The small and large Dopp kits I tested, part of Nex’s 2024 Hawaii collection, consisted of a roomy, single compartment with a dual zippered strip. They’re made of microfiber leather, which is a higher-quality synthetic leather, said to be softer and more durable. The bags were stiff and well-structured, which felt protective of my cosmetics when jammed into my carry-on. There is a slight synthetic smell from the microfiber leather, which is hard to miss, since you must lean your face quite close to the bag to see the contents in the cavernous single compartment. I also felt that when the bag was unzipped, the zippered strip was either in the way or had to be splayed out, which took up too much space on my tiny hotel-bathroom shelf. Otherwise, this is a fine option that offers both a lifetime warranty and an unlimited trade-in program.\n\nCotopaxi Nido Accessory Bag Cada Día for $50: Cotopaxi’s trim little bag is meant not just for hygiene items, but any collection of odds and ends. It’s made from light recycled deadstock nylon (so, probably not for you if you are carrying glass bottles or anything that needs padding) and weighs in at a modest 6.5 ounces. Your colorway will be unique! I like the surprisingly capacious 4-liter capacity spread over three different compartments, with a big middle compartment for your quart-size, TSA-approved bag of liquids and two other compartments with separate, smaller pockets. I do have to admit, though, that I like hooks better than loops, and hanging is more convenient with a clamshell toiletry bag design than with this one, which can't be hung while open. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nKusshi Hair Tools Bag for $89: Unlike similar bags that just bunch up your hair tools into a roll, this hair tool carrier has two organized pocket sections; a zippered pouch in the middle for hair products or, in my case while I was testing, attachments for my Shark FlexFusion; and a pocket on the outside for rubber bands or small accessories like lip balm. It's also made of neoprene that's heat-resistant up to 380 degrees Fahrenheit, so you don't have to worry about waiting for your tools to cool down before packing them away. Keep in mind, though, that the initial off-gassing is strong with this one—you may want to let it sit in a well-ventilated area for several days before packing it in your suitcase, lest it make everything else smell plasticky. This included the air from my hair dryer when I used it. There are also reports online of it not accommodating some Dyson tools, though it did fit an Airstrait and Corrale.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nAer Travel Kit 2 Ultra for $79: Does the average traveler need a toiletry bag made partially of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which is 15 times stronger than steel by weight? Perhaps not, but it definitely makes for an interesting bag. Part of Aer’s 10th Anniversary Ultra Collection, this hardy, chunky little Dopp kit incorporates the collection's Ultra400X fabric (in black only) by Challenge Sailcloth, known for its high-performance sails for yacht racers and kite surfers. Despite its strength, the Travel Kit is still pretty lightweight at 8 ounces. However, the hook is thick plastic and too small for a towel rack, and the rubbery “Aer” brand tags on the outside and inside seem to accumulate toothbrush and soap residue, as does the mesh zippered pouch in the top compartment. Both proved somewhat difficult to clean.\n\nEagle Creek Pack-It Trifold Toiletry Kit for $50: Eagle Creek's travel accessory game is extremely strong. Its toiletry bags, packing cubes, and various organizers are affordable, sturdy, and exceedingly well designed, and this toiletry bag is no exception. At first glance, it looks like two toiletry bags snapped together, but each side unzips to make a hanging organizer with six compartments. The only problem is that one side of the bag holds products upside down until it's unfurled, which led to items falling out in my tests.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nState Bags Benson Toiletry Kit for $65: This is a solid, simple bag with three mesh pouches and a snap-in/snap-out plastic envelope that can hold a toothbrush and toothpaste or shower items like soap. The navy version I tested had a coated polyester wipe-clean exterior and interior made from recycled bottles, and I liked that it had the option to hang. However, the organization was more rudimentary than similar-category bags we tested, and it was missing some of the thoughtful details featured on other bags in the same price range, like a quick-access pouch on the back and a larger hook with a rubber tip to prevent slipping. (This bag's thick, small plastic hook wasn't even wide enough to hang on a towel rack.)\n\nCuyana Travel Beauty Case for $298: Those still chasing the quiet luxury aesthetic will love this elegant zippered cosmetic case, available in black or pale pink. It’s made of high-end-feeling Italian pebbled leather both inside and out, with gold hardware and “Cuyana” discreetly printed on the bottom. It opens clamshell-style, and the lid contains a snap-close cover concealing a brush holder with elastic loops. A removable pouch snaps onto that lid cover, and the main compartment has a pocket for securing tubes, bottles, and small tools. Contents aren’t as immediately accessible as they are in other cosmetic cases I tested, but they are more secure. This bag is also on the heavy side, even for a cosmetics case, weighing in at 1.6 pounds, but if you can swing the price, this is a well-made, timeless investment for your travel arsenal.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nCincha the Toiletry Bag for $55: After testing nearly every style of toiletry bag in existence, I thought I had seen it all, but this thoughtfully designed bag from Cincha surprised me. The large size is essentially the tackle box of toiletry bags. It zips open in the middle to reveal four roomy compartments—two on each side, each topped with a small, translucent vinyl zippered pouch. I could not believe the amount of stuff I was able to fit into this thing, and yet I never had trouble closing it, despite packing it to the absolute max. I ended up taking it on a five-day getaway where I had to share a bathroom with two other people, and I found that I loved being able to flip it over and lift the “lid” of whatever side I needed, in order to keep the counter footprint small.\n\nJuly Hanging Toiletry Bag for $85: I own and love July's carry-on suitcase, so I was excited to try the brand's popular hanging toiletry bag. It's a great design with a zippered pouch on the back, plus a body that zips flat to reveal PVC and pouch zip compartments and a large, rubber-tipped metal hook that tucks away. It looks well-made and stylish with leather trim and gunmetal hardware, but my husband took it on a business trip and found that its pockets are actually quite small, confirming a worry I had when I tested it in my bathroom at home. It wouldn't be an issue if the bag itself were small, but it took up a full quarter of the carry-on.\n\nTumi Alpha Bravo Response Kit for $225: This rugged-looking, ballistic nylon bag has the classic Tumi Tracer inside to help facilitate its return to you if it gets lost, as well as an antimicrobial lining. It can hang, stand up, or lie flat and has several convenient internal pockets and an external zipped pouch. It's a lot of money for a toiletry bag with many of the same features as ones half the price, but if you're a Tumi fan and need a toiletry bag to match your luggage, you could do worse than this model.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBeautifect Go Mini for $177: WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe loved the larger Beautifect Box, and I tested the Mini to see if it would work for travel. While the smaller size does make it more portable (along with a purse-like carry strap), the multifunction lighted mirror and its battery made the lid top-heavy, so it kept flopping forward when I tried to use it on a soft, uneven surface like my lap or a bed. It's also got a very hard case and is a bit heavy at almost 2.5 pounds, so as much as I wanted to take it with me on a plane, I ended up bringing a smaller bag instead. Worth a buy if you want a makeup case with a lighted mirror, but it's definitely best for day trips.\n\nFjallraven Kanken Toiletry Bag for $60: I love this thing, which makes me feel like a Red Cross nurse on the battlefields of World War II. It’s made from a proprietary Fjallraven fabric blend that combines organic cotton with recycled polyester, so it feels like fabric but is more waterproof and durable. It has a clamshell design with a sturdy interior plastic hook. My quart bag of bottles goes into the enormous lower zip compartment, my toothbrush and deodorant in the top compartment, and there are mesh pockets and MOLLE webbing so that your tiny things are easily visible. However, its dimensions are very large, so this might not be for you if you’re a minimalist with just a toothbrush and a comb. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nTom Beckbe Canvas Dopp Kit for $195: Known for its high-end jackets, field hats, and vests for fishing and waterfowl hunting, Birmingham, Alabama-based sports outfitter Tom Beckbe also makes a Dopp kit made of full-grain distressed leather and the brand’s proprietary Field Canvas. It matches the genteel Southern vibe of Tom Beckbe’s collection of other travel bags and related accessories like camo whiskey totes and insulated shooting gloves. If the Marlboro Man ever left the ranch, this is definitely the Dopp kit he would have used. The only downside is that the bag is relatively large—and dark inside—for what’s essentially one compartment.\n\nEagle Creek Pack-It Isolate Quick Trip for $25: This little bag is a simple design, made from recycled bottles, with a zipper on the top and on the side. However, its light weight and semi-structured shape make it perfect for holding a wallet and keys at the gym, or even as a tech pouch for work purposes.\n\nKusshi Neoprene Wristlet Clutch for $39: It's a purse! It's a toiletry bag! It's a purse that doubles as a toiletry bag! This clutch is the perfect size for a larger phone, e-reader, or small tablet, with a couple of mesh pockets for makeup. I used it to tote a day's worth of makeup and skincare around town and found it was just heavy enough to be burdensome, but if you like the neoprene look and your essentials are lightweight, this clutch, like most Kusshi products, is sturdy and well-made.\n\nSympl Dopp Kit for $75: I liked this bag’s durable Cordura exterior and stow-away clip for hanging, as well as the fact it has a lifetime warranty. The bag opens clamshell-style to reveal four simple waterproof zip pockets—two thin and horizontal, one small rectangle, and one larger rectangle. It's an interesting idea, but in practice, this severely limits utility since a user is restricted to specific toiletry-sized products that fit the shape of each of the pockets. (My deodorant did not fit, nor did a toothbrush in a case.)\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBagsmart Paz Hanging Toiletry Bag for $35: With its stylish, padded exterior; generously sized carry handle; and ability to transport up to eight full-sized products, this one had me reaching for it long after the testing period was over. The thin, tipped metal hanger makes it easy to hang anywhere, and there's an easy-access compartment on the front with loops for makeup brushes or other long, thin items. In fact, this is almost a small toiletry briefcase rather than a bag—the whole thing unfurls into a 33-inch-long organizer with four separate compartments (two with sections to hold full-sized products). It will almost certainly be too much for anyone who likes to travel light, but if you check your luggage, will be on the road for a long time, or just don't want to deal with decanting your personal care products, this is a well-designed and easy-to-use solution.\n\nSaltyface Everywhere Bag for $36: Technically designed to store Saltyface self-tanners and bronzers, this puffy black fabric bag spent an indordinate amount of time on my counter, simply because I liked how it looked. Practically speaking, though, the handle was too small for an adult-sized hand, and I found myself becoming irritated with the single zipper pull, so it's not ideal as a general-purpose travel toiletry bag.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow I Test Toiletry Bags AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron For bags our team hasn’t already been using for years, I spend a four-week period rotating new toiletry bags during my morning routine. I note any annoyances or unique details, volume, how easy it is to store and retrieve items, how much space each one takes up on the vanity, how they survive being splashed with water and soap, and, if the bag can hang, how easy it is to retrieve items once hanging. About every three months, my family goes on trips that require stays in hotels. I always take different groups of bags and determine how easy it is to use multiple bags at once in a small space, if hook designs allowed for multiple places to hang, and whether the contents spilled in or otherwise dirtied the bags, and if so, how easy they are to clean. For bags I am not able to take on trips, I lend them to friends and family members who are traveling and take down their notes to consider alongside my own home testing. How Does WIRED Obtain Toiletry Bags for Testing? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Some toiletry bags are review samples requested from the manufacturer, while others are purchased and expensed. Review samples are only accepted without promise of editorial coverage. Toiletry bags chosen as picks are reused for durability testing purposes, while all other bags are donated upon completion of testing. What Kind of Toiletry Bag Do You Need? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Dopp kits, cosmetics cases, hanging bags … the differences between categories aren’t always clear. Here are some of the more common types of toiletry bags you'll come across, and what to consider with each. Dopp kit: Named for leather craftsman Charles Doppelt, who provided “Dopps,” or toiletry kits, for WWII soldiers. “Dopp kit” has evolved over time to indicate any kind of portable toiletry organizer, but commercially, toiletry bags labeled “Dopp kits” tend to be smaller and hold just a handful of necessities for short trips as opposed to larger fold-up hanging bags and cosmetics cases. Cosmetics case: Designed for those who need more than just the necessities, a cosmetics case is usually a much larger boxlike container with specialized compartments for makeup, skin care, hair care, and other necessities. They often come with extras like brush holders and mirrors. Hanging toiletry bag: A bag that, as the name indicates, comes with a hook so that it can be hung on a hook, towel rack, tree, or someplace it won’t take up space on the counter. Often, the user needs to hang them to be able to access all the storage compartments. Something to consider is that hooks can be used up quite quickly if everyone in your hotel room has a hanging bag. All the hooks in our bathroom were taken almost immediately, so my husband ended up having to hang his bag over the toilet, which he wasn’t thrilled about. A good hanging toiletry bag will also have a hook that's thin enough to slip over just about any hook, and be rubber-tipped so it won't slide off.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "Shopping for a MicroSD card can be a little daunting. There are a ton of numbers to consider, a huge number of brands producing cards with similar-sounding features and names, and words like Pro, Extreme, and Express getting thrown around everywhere.\n\nTo make a long story short, unless you're shooting a ton of photos and videos, and doing so even semiprofessionally where losing those shots might be detrimental to your professional reputation, you're fine to buy a MicroSD card from any company whose name you've heard before. I prefer cards from PNY, SanDisk, and Lexar. Keep an eye out for the “U” symbol with a 3 inside, or a “V30” on the card for the best balance of speed and price. There are two exceptions to that suggestion:\n\nIf you're shooting on a high-end camera, you should consider a V60 MicroSD card, if you can find one for a reasonable price. Some cameras have extra video features you can enable with a faster MicroSD card, so check your manual for more info on whether you need to upgrade.\n\nIf you're buying for a Nintendo Switch 2, you'll need an unfortunately more expensive MicroSD Express card. While you can transfer images and videos from your Switch 2 with most regular MicroSD cards, you'll need an Express version to use it for actually running games.\n\nCapacity\n\nHow much storage you need will largely depend on your needs, but there are a few things to consider when debating between 128 GB and 1 TB. The first is that MicroSD cards are tiny, and having to swap them out on the road can be a risky proposition. Costs tend to go up exponentially for 1 TB and 2 TB cards, but the gap between 256 GB and 512 GB isn't that large, so I recommend sizing up a bit.\n\nThe other factor is that storage sizes are also separated into different standards, so you'll want to make sure your device actually supports that larger card. Cards that are 64 GB are higher are technically “SDXC” for Extended Capacity, and are currently the most common type, and you should be able to use them in most modern situations.\n\nSpeed\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about MicroSD speeds, we have a write-up with a full explanation of the different speeds and how they interact, but I'll give you the quick rundown here too.\n\nEach MicroSD card will have its actual minimum sequential write speed indicated by a letter and number on the card. The number indicates the speed in MB/s, with the letter representing the generation. A C10, U1, and V10 are all essentially the same speed, just written differently, so you're likely to see multiple symbols printed on each card. I'd recommend checking out the SD Association's page on speeds with a handy chart showing the full comparison.\n\nIn practice, you have to go out of your way to find a MicroSD card that's slower than V30/U3 at most retailers, though you may find them included with some electronics that don't require anything more substantial."

            "content": "The idea of using a laptop cooling pad feels antiquated. These days, laptop chips have become extremely efficient. The fans on MacBooks (if they even have them) are barely used, and both Intel and Qualcomm are pushing efficiency on the Windows front.\n\nBut people keep buying laptop cooling pads, so surely there is a use case in 2026 that actually makes sense, right? I tried out a couple cooling pads paired with a couple of different gaming laptops, and walked away surprised at how effective they could be.\n\nDo Cooling Pads Actually Work?\n\nPhotograph: Luke Larsen\n\nLaptop cooling pads have been around for decades, and the idea has always been simple: provide extra air to blow through a laptop that’s otherwise restricted by its own cooling system. In theory, more air means lower temperatures—and, ultimately, better performance. This is the whole idea of the power modes that exist in Windows, which ramp up the RPMs (rotations per minute) of the fans to add more air to both improve performance. More than that, less heat also means a longer-lasting laptop that doesn't degrade as quickly over time. It’s by that same logic that laptop cooling pads offer help.\n\nThe problem, however, is that a cooling pad is a rather inefficient way of transferring air into your device. Most laptop cooling pads, including the two that I tested, use one large fan or two smaller fans to blast cold air across the bottom of the laptop. This is the first reason why the vast majority of modern laptops won’t benefit much from a cooling pad, as these laptops tend to only have vents along the hinge. Without vents or open holes, blowing air across a sheet of metal or plastic isn't going to do anything to cool the components on the other side. It'll only generate a bunch of fan noise.\n\nGaming laptops are the main exception, though, which is why they are the primary use case for such an accessory. Most gaming laptops have a few open vents, usually above the fans, like the Razer Blade 16, which is one of the laptops I used to test these cooling pads. Laptops like the Blade 16 are designed for intensive tasks like gaming, video editing, or local AI processing—and use a high-wattage GPU and CPU to get the kind of performance you need. My model has two of the most powerful laptop components on the market: the RTX 5090 and Ryzen 9 HX 370. As you might guess, they generate a lot of heat when cranked up. Modern chips tend to max out at 100 degrees Celsius, before throttling back performance to bring down temperatures.\n\nMost laptops use fans to cool these components, but the thickness of the laptop chassis is also a determining factor in how much the system will need to throttle back performance to keep temperatures down. In the end, it's geometry and physics, and every millimeter of space in the laptop chassis has an effect on how cool it can keep its internal components. And unlike in a large desktop PC, you have very restricted space. That's especially true in the modern era, where even gaming laptops have become increasingly thin."

            "content": "While my esteemed CNET colleagues were in San Francisco for the release of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series, I was in Barcelona ahead of MWC 2026, seeing the sights and eying the fancy cars that ply the Spanish city's streets.\n\nOnce my colleagues arrived with the Galaxy S26 in tow, I found a novel use for one of its coolest features: shooting videos of Europe's expensive automobiles.\n\nIt's not uncommon for a Porsche or Maserati to zoom down the streets of the upscale neighborhoods in Barcelona. To capture them on video, I tried out the Galaxy S26's new Horizontal Lock, an extremely forgiving image stabilization mode. As my colleague Abrar Al-Heeti noted in her first take, with the camera feature turned on, you can tilt the phone as much as you want while the horizon remains steady.\n\nHorizontal lock keeps your image's horizon level even when the phone isn't during video recording. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nFirst, I reviewed CNET's hands-on sessions with the new mode. I overrotated the phone 90 degrees in one direction and flipped it 180 degrees in the other. Horizontal Lock worked exactly as advertised, showing smooth footage you'd believe was shot with a phone held very still.\n\nThis was a great feature to try out on Barcelona's streets, turning my wiggling arm into a steady hand behind the camera as I tracked flashy autos speeding down Passeig de Gracia and Carrer d'Arago in the Quadrat d'Or.\n\nWith Horizontal Lock straightening my footage, I could send videos back to my friends at home with undeniable proof that I'd seen some beautiful cars -- like the Porsche Carrera GTS in the image above (a 904 from around 1964, if my Googling skills are to be believed).\n\nThe Galaxy S26's Horizontal Lock is a perfect assistant if you're shooting fast, agile subjects darting around unpredictably. The feature could also salvage videos from unusably shaky footage, a clear advantage when recording during emergencies, disasters or in war zones.\n\nAnd for everyday Galaxy S26 owners, Horizontal Lock makes casual videos easier to watch, ensuring they end up on the good photography subreddits rather than the bad ones."

            "content": "The entrance to Mobile World Congress in 2025. Tara Brown/CNET\n\nMobile World Congress 2026 is kicking off on Monday, teeing up a week that's likely to be filled with product announcements and futuristic phone concepts.\n\nOur expectations for this year's MWC 2026 include upcoming phones that we already know about -- including the Nothing Phone 4A that's set to launch March 5 -- along with launch events from companies like Xiaomi and Honor. Motorola's also attending, and considering the company revealed its upcoming Razr Fold at CES 2026, we'd expect the company to provide more details about the book-style folding phone.\n\nWe've also historically seen concepts at MWC that have never made it beyond the development stage but are still so cool to see. That's included Motorola debuting a flexible phone concept that you can wear on your wrist and Lenovo showing a solar-charging laptop.\n\nAnd even though Apple isn't expected to attend MWC, it's quite possible that the company might be debuting the rumored iPhone 17E over the course of the week. Apple has announced that it's going to be making new product announcements starting Monday in the lead-up to a March 4 event in New York, London and Shanghai. We'll certainly be keeping an eye out in case a new iPhone is one of them.\n\nWe'll be covering all the reveals, concepts and fun highlights we find in Barcelona in this live blog. Keep checking back for more updates."
