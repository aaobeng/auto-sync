And believe me, with the arrival of Michael Carrick, things are looking good for everyone, including him.\n\n“He is clearly talented and his gifts are rare. The next thing is for him to go back there and fight for his spot.\n\n\n\nBEST FREE BETS AND BETTING SIGN UP OFFERS\n\n“Andre has always excelled when faced with a challenge. He thrives when he’s given a fair chance to prove himself.”\n\nJeremi added that big clubs demand big characters.\n\nHe said: “In my career I enjoyed playing in teams with big ambitions and big personalities.\n\n“If I had a few bad games, there was always someone knocking on the manager’s door asking for a chance.\n\n“That meant I had to stand up, be counted and not walk away.\n\n\n\n“But that is for Andre to decide.”"

Mason Mount and Matthijs De Ligt are two of the notable absentees for United, with Carrick on hand to issue new fitness verdicts on both.\n\nHe said: \"Mason (Mount) is getting closer, he’s on the grass, he’s looking to train and be around it. We’ve just had to be patient really. Matthijs (De Ligt) has had a back issue, which has been a little bit sore to progress really. He’s heading in the right direction.\"\n\nOn the latter, Carrick added: \"It’s the nature of the injury, the issue in the back, it’s a difficult one to pin down time wise. He’s definitely improving.\" De Ligt has been unavailable since early December with his last appearance coincidentally the reverse fixture against the Eagles.\n\nMount meanwhile, has missed the last few weeks and looks set for a return soon given Carrick's update. Having not played since late January, the English midfielder is more likely to return next Wednesday away at Newcastle as opposed to this Sunday's visit of Palace.\n\nLisandro Martinez is one player that could be back this weekend despite picking up a recent injury which saw him miss Monday's 1-0 win over Everton with a calf injury. Carrick revealed before that clash that it was a minor injury and it did not look too bad.\n\nBryan Mbeumo hobbled off at Hill Dickinson Stadium earlier this week, but has since been training and with no mention of injury, the suggestion is that he is fine.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!

The draw for the last-16 took place in Nyon on Friday afternoon, with clubs learning their potential opponents.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpanish opposition is the order of the day, with Manchester City’s clash with Real Madrid a blockbuster tie.

Newcastle\n\nThe only Premier League side to book their spot in the last-16 via the play-offs, Newcastle have been handed a nightmare draw, with Barcelona set to come. And should they somehow get through that tie, they will likely return to Spain with a trip to Atletico Madrid.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe semi-finals are relatively kind - except for Arsenal - but given the testing run of fixtures that Eddie Howe’s men face between then and now, they could be flagging before then.\n\nPotential route:\n\nLast-16: Barcelona\n\n‌\n\n\n\nQuarter-finals: Atletico Madrid or Tottenham Hotspur\n\nSemi-finals: Bodo/Glimt/Sporting Lisbon/Arsenal/Bayer Leverkusen\n\nView 3 Images Clubs also know their potential runs to the final (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\n5. Chelsea\n\nIt could be argued that Chelsea have the hardest run of all of the Premier League sides. They commence their knockout campaign against PSG, although they did beat the French side already this season in the Club World Cup, they could go into that game with confidence.\n\nReigning Premier League champions Liverpool will likely represent their next opponents, while Real Madrid, Manchester City or Bayern Munich would be very tricky semi-final opponents for Liam Rosenior’s men.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPotential route:\n\nLast-16: PSG\n\nQuarter-finals: Liverpool or Galatasaray\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSemi-finals: Manchester City/Real Madrid/Bayern Munich/Atalanta\n\n4. Tottenham Hotspur\n\nGiving their Premier League woes, there is a strong argument for Spurs to be rock bottom of this list. But having been placed on the same side of the draw as their North London rivals Arsenal, Tottenham have arguably been handed a welcome draw, albeit they face a tricky start against Atletico Madrid.\n\nShould they progress, they could potentially face Newcastle and Bodo/Glimt on the way to the final should either of those teams progress. It seems highly unlikely they will make a deep run, but it could have been worse for Igor Tudor...much worse.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPotential route:\n\nLast 16: Atletico Madrid\n\nQuarter-finals: Newcastle or Barcelona\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSemi-final: Arsenal/Bayer Leverkusen/Bodo/Glimt/Sporting Lisbon\n\n3. Man City\n\nIt’s a little bit of de ja vu for Pep Guardiola following the round-of-16 draw, with Real Madrid set to come. Given City have managed to get the better of their Spanish opponents on a few occasions recently, it’s not as daunting as first thought.\n\nThey will certainly be hoping that they will face either Atalanta or Galatasaray in the following rounds, however unlikely that may be. The more likely prospect of back-to-back games against Madrid and Bayern Munich could concern them.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPotential route:\n\nLast 16: Real Madrid\n\nQuarter-finals: Atalanta or Bayern Munich\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSemi-finals: PSG /Chelsea/Liverpool/Galatasaray\n\nView 3 Images Pep Guardiola will take on Real Madrid once again (Image: Getty Images)\n\n2. Liverpool\n\nWhen it comes to Liverpool’s draw, they were handed a relatively kind last-16 tie, with Turkish giants Galatasaray to come. But should they progress past the Turkish side, reigning holders PSG could lie in wait.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt’s then a nightmare clutch of clubs to come in the semi-finals, with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester City all potential opponents. But the Reds are still a talented side and their European pedigree should stand them in good stead.\n\nPotential route:\n\nLast 16: Galatasaray\n\n‌\n\n\n\nQuarter-finals: PSG or Chelsea\n\nSemi finals: Real Madrid/Manchester City/ Atalanta/ Bayern Munich\n\n1. Arsenal\n\nMikel Arteta’s side not only have the kindest run of the Premier League teams but arguably of every team in the competition. Their last-16 clash with Leverkusen is followed by a showdown with either Bodo/Glimt or Sporting Lisbon.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe difficulty cranks up slightly when it gets to the semi-finals, with Barcelona potentially lying in wait but it’s a dream run for the Gunners, who will now see reaching Budapest as hugely attainable.\n\nPotential route:\n\nLast-16: Bayer Leverkusen\n\n‌\n\n\n\nQuarter-finals: Bodo/Glimt or Sporting Lisbon\n\nSemi-final: Atletico Madrid/Tottenham Hotspur/Newcastle/Barcelona\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The neighbours have both made the England and Nottingham Forest star one of their main transfer targets.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnderson has emerged as one of the best midfielders in Europe since joining Forest from Newcastle for £35m in 2024. The 23-year-old has gone on to establish himself in the England team - and will be part of Thomas Tuchel's World Cup plans this summer.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUnited and City are both keen to strengthen midfield this summer - and will find themselves in a bidding war for the £75m-rated ace.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

Anderson knows he could be relegated with Forest this season.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut whatever happens, he will have his pick of top clubs and believes he is ready to take that step up to the next level.

I think I’ve done pretty well, to be honest, in the time I’ve been here, on and off the pitch.\n\n\"I think I've matured as a person as well.

The UEFA presenter apologised for \"embarrassing\" his counterpart with the well-wishes.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe draw was just concluding when Pinto attempted to wish Marchetti a special day. Except he got his numbers mixed up, which made for an awkward few seconds on stage.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"That'll do it for us at the house of football, fantastic to have Ivan [Rakitic] here,\" said Pinto to his guests. \"Well done as always, Giorgio.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It's a special day because it's the last day of the UEFA Champions League season, also because it's Giorgio's birthday. So, I'm sorry to embarrass you, but I think he deserves a round of applause.

Former Barcelona and Croatia midfielder Rakitic was an unwilling bystander as the exchange drew to a conclusion, and he was likely as relieved as anyone to see the back-and-forth draw to a close.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHaving been made aware of his mistake, Pinto appeared as keen as anyone to move on. Meanwhile, Marchetti was left with the unfortunate gift of being told he looked older than his actual age on live television.\n\nAside from that communication hiccup, Friday's draw proceeded without a glitch. It produced some incredibly enticing home-and-away matches for what is set to be an unforgettable round of 16.\n\nView 2 Images Real Madrid stand in Manchester City's way as they clash in the last 16 (Image: DeFodi Images, DeFodi Images via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most significant narrative of the draw is a reunion between last year's FIFA Club World Cup final opponents, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain. They'll clash once more as reigning European champions, PSG, seek retribution for the 3-0 loss they endured against the Blues in the United States last summer.\n\nThe tournament will also bid adieu to at least one titan as Real Madrid face off against Manchester City. Pep Guardiola will confront his old nemesis in the hopes of orchestrating another run at glory, though the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Jr stand in his way.\n\nWatch the Champions League on TNT Sports This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The Old Trafford icon confirmed on Thursday he has bought a 25 per cent stake in Spanish side Almeria.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt signals the start of a new era for the 41-year-old, whose own playing career is still very much alive at Al-Nassr. However, the building blocks are already being put in place for what lies in store when he leaves the Saudi Pro League.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn fact, one could say Ronaldo has been laying the framework for his segue into club ownership for some years now. At least, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner has made little secret of his intentions to invest once his own days on the field are done.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd there's a fine chance that road may lead back to United if Ronaldo gets his way. Mirror Football takes a look back through every subtle (and some not-so-subtle) nod and hint Ronaldo has given that suggest he's bound for a United takeover one day.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\n'Fixing' United comments\n\nIn typical Ronaldo fashion, the forward has already gone on record to say he can be the man to lift United out of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson haze. Of course, he was unable to do so during an ill-fated second spell as a player, which ended in 2022, but he has since made a fairly big claim about taking the Red Devils back to the glory days as investor.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's Man Utd hint and huge net worth revealed after he buys stake in club READ MORE :\n\nCristiano Ronaldo sent transfer request after buying 25 per cent stake in club READ MORE :\n\nSpeaking at the 2024 Dubai Globe Soccer Awards, Ronaldo suggested he would get everything in order if it was him calling the shots as United owner. \"The problem of Manchester United is the same.\n\n\"The problem is not always the coach. It's much more than that. If I will be the owner of the club, I will make things clear and adjust things that are bad there.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's tenure as minority stakeholder does appear to finally be yielding some fruit with Michael Carrick in charge of the squad. Admittedly, however, there's a long way to go before the club is back to the heights it resided at during Ronaldo's first stint under Ferguson.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Many a United fan might love the idea of having Ronaldo making the decisions at Old Trafford (Image: Maja Hitij - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)\n\nOwnership milestone\n\nThis week's news that Ronaldo was investing in Almeria potentially presents a significant moment for the sport as a whole. Not purely because of the name now attached to the club's board, but because of the clarity it provides for a post-Ronaldo era.\n\nThe more invested someone like Ronaldo is in an idea, the easier he'll find it to bid farewell to his first love of playing football. What's more, it's easy to envision that while this may be his 'toe-dip' moment as an owner, it may not be long before his portfolio expands exponentially.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn a press release via his company, CR7 Sports Investments, he said: \"It has been a long-time ambition of mine to contribute to football beyond the pitch...I look forward to working alongside the leadership team to support the club’s next phase of growth.\"\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nRonaldo is but the latest major sports figure or retired athlete to purchase a stake in a Spanish club. Namesake Ronaldo Nazario is the owner of second-tier side Real Valladolid, while ex-NBA stars Steve Nash and Steve Kerr are shareholders in Mallorca.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe transition may not be instant, but success with one investment will likely only lead to more. And while buying a piece of the United pie might not be realistic right now, it's inevitable that will be considered one of, if not the ultimate end goal.\n\nCriticism of the Glazers\n\n\"Anything you can do, I can do better.\" It wouldn't be Cristiano Ronaldo if there wasn't some part of his brain that felt that way in most areas, and the Glazer family is no different.\n\nThere were issues at United during Ronaldo's first tenure, though Ferguson managed to make hay despite the fact. However, it only became clearer as to just how deep-set some of these problems are, and Ronaldo was only too happy to point them out as his second stay at Old Trafford came to an explosive end.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Ronaldo didn't hold back in his stance on the Glazer family during an explosive 2022 interview (Image: @PiersUncensored/Twitter)\n\n\"The Glazers, they don’t care about the club,\" he said during a 2022 interview with Piers Morgan, which unsurprisingly led to another departure. \"Manchester is a marketing club. They will get money from the marketing—the sport, they don’t really care, in my opinion.\"\n\nAnd it wasn't just squad investment where Ronaldo felt funds were lacking. He also criticised the club's failure to upgrade certain facilities since his first stint at the club, which ended more than a decade prior in 2009.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Nothing has changed,\" he said when referring to the club's gym, catering and pool facilities. And United clearly concurred on some level given renovations to those same facilities were some of the chief priorities after Jim Ratcliffe's arrival at the club in 2024 to take charge of football operations.\n\nOwnership ambitions\n\nDespite what some might think concerning his potential to be a manager, Ronaldo has long been clear he wasn't interested in that side of the sport. However, he's been candid regarding a potential avenue in ownership for some time now.\n\nSky Sports discounted Premier League and EFL package This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

No,\" he said at the Globe Soccer Awards in December 2024. \"But maybe I could become a club owner.\"\n\nFor anyone in doubt as to whether he'd be able to afford moving in that direction, Ronaldo's finances are unparalleled among current of former footballers. At least that's according to Bloomberg, which reported in 2025 that the Portuguese sensation had become football's first legitimate billionaire.\n\nIt was back in 2023 that Ronaldo said: \"I don't rule out becoming a club owner. It's something I thought about a few years back. I probably would like to own a [football] club. I'm at the end of my career, two to three years maximum.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nIt's now been three years since he made those comments, and the goal has been realised. Knowing Ronaldo's insatiable appetite, however, the objective won't be truly fulfilled until he's in control of a club truly close to his heart."

            "content": "Ahead of a busy Saturday filled with quality racing, the Weekend Winners team discussed their best bets for Newbury, Doncaster and Kelso.\n\nThe panel of Kate Tracey, Sam Boswell and Declan Rix paid special attention to Newbury's BetVictor Greatwood Gold Cup Handicap Chase - which is live on Sky Sports Racing at 3.45pm.\n\nVincenzo and Twinjets are towards the head of the market for this contest over two miles and four furlongs, which was won in sensational style by Booster Bob last term at the expense of the former.\n\nDeclan Rix\n\n\"It's obviously a competitive race. There's a combination of horses that have been walloped for wins last time out and horses who are not well-handicapped. I kept going further and further down and ended up with Josh The Boss for two reasons.\n\n\"Firstly, he's a novice and is unexposed to a degree over fences. He's had more runs than I've had hot dinners this year. This will be his seventh start of the season. He is backing up after running at Newcastle last week but he clearly takes his racing well. He jumps well for a novice and I thought last time out he had the run of the race and jumped well aside from nodding on the back of four out.\n\n\"His old nemesis Prairie Wolf will not be in to beat him this day and although it's a worry that he won't be able to dominate this field, I do believe he wants a good, even gallop over this trip because he'll probably stay a little further. If he's bounced out of the race alright, with Jamie Neild taking 7lbs off he has got a handicapping chance.\"\n\nKate Tracey\n\n\"Vincenzo is a standout for me, he looks as if he's got so much more to come. Last time out at Ascot he won by two lengths from Bad. It was a messy race overall but it was really good form in terms of talented horses and a testament to him that he can still produce this kind of effort, sticking to his task really well after hitting the front at the last.\n\n\"He's only been given a 2lb rise for that and I thought that was very fair and he could be even better going back left-handed, which suits him really well. I hope he's got plenty more mileage in his mark.\"\n\nSam Boswell\n\n\"The good news about Heltenham, if you like him like I do, is he loves it around Newbury. He's had one bad run from about six efforts, with three wins and a second to his name. His second was on seasonal reappearance this year against Twinjets. He got beaten by 10 lengths but there's a stone in favour today in favour of Heltenham, which is a massive plus point.\n\n\"I know we don't get the services of Harry Skelton but these are the types of races they're winning en route to a championship and Heltenham is going to be a massive plus point through the spring. He obviously went up against Jonbon last time, which was effectively a run to get round - he managed that.\n\n\"I do hope going back to his favoured Newbury will bring out the best in him. Charlie Todd has ridden the horse before to reasonably good effect when finishing third. We're a double digit price and he's an each-way play, I don't know why he won't be all out to take a really valuable prize.\"\n\nWatch Weekend Winners in full on the At The Races YouTube channel..."

Two years on from a dramatic penalty shoot-out win against Lille in the Conference League, the two sides meet again.\n\nPantomime villain Emiliano Martinez starred on that day, saving the decisive penalty after avoiding a red card midway through the shoot-out, despite receiving his second booking of the game.\n\nTrademark celebrations soon followed as he soaked up the animosity from the French crowd. That, coupled with his antics from the World Cup triumph with Argentina over France, could create quite the cauldron at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy when he returns.\n\nImage: Emi Martinez celebrates Aston Villa's ECL victory over Lille in 2024\n\nVilla will be tasked with replicating the same success over two legs to continue their quest to end their 30-year wait for a trophy and if they do achieve that, the drama won't stop there.\n\nA meeting with Roma and on-loan striker Donyell Malen could then await, should they be successful in the tie against Bologna. UEFA rules state no team can influence what line-up their opponent selects and that would allow Malen to face off against his parent club in a bid to dump them out of the competition.\n\nPorto, Nottingham Forest, Midtjylland and Stuttgart make up the rest of that side of the bracket. Villa were undoubtedly handed a harder route to glory; the storylines running alongside it just add to the drama.\n\nWhen will fixture dates be announced?\n\nThe last 16 match schedule will be available on Friday night.\n\nThe quarter-finals and, in principle, the semi-finals match schedule will be communicated on March 20.\n\nHome advantage in second legs for seeded teams\n\nThe top eight teams from the league phase in both competitions are seeded and will have home advantage in the second leg of their round of 16 games.\n\nThis will extend to the quarter-finals for the teams that finished in the top four of the league phase if they progress.\n\nThe top two will also have home advantage in the second leg of their semi-final if successful.\n\nAny team that eliminates a seeded team will take their privileges.\n\nWhen are the 2025/26 knockout stages?\n\nRound of 16: March 12 and 19\n\nQuarter-finals: April 9 and 16\n\nSemi-finals: April 30 and May 7\n\nFinal: May 20\n\nWhere are the finals?\n\nThe Europa League final will be held at Besiktas Park in Istanbul on May 20.\n\nThe Conference League final will be one week later at the Leipzig Stadium on May 27."

The schedule is expected to be released on Friday night.\n\nMan City, Liverpool and Chelsea have been placed in what appears to be the hardest side of the draw.\n\nWere City to progress past Real Madrid, they will face either Bayern Munich or Atalanta in the quarter-finals, while Chelsea and Liverpool will meet in the last eight if they knock out PSG and Galatasaray respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Arsenal will play either Bodo/Glimt or Sporting if they beat Leverkusen.

Win that tie, and it's Bodo Glimt or Sporting next. It's a favourable draw, especially given the alternative was a potential quarter-final against Manchester City.\n\nIt's only two years since Leverkusen won the Bundesliga under Xabi Alonso but they are no longer the same team.

Arne Slot has them in better shape ahead of their next meeting.\n\nThe Reds have avoided a last 16 tie against Atletico Madrid but their route to the final, beyond the meeting with Galatasaray, for which they will be strong favourites, looks daunting, with Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich potentially standing in their way.\n\nBefore that, though, it's a potentially awkward trip to Turkey, and a reminder that any side containing Victor Osimhen has to be taken seriously.\n\nMonterosa Monterosa , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

He kept on nicely when winning at Kempton last time and must have a strong chance despite another 3lb rise.\n\nFerrous was successful in this race last year under same pilot Tom Marquand. That was off a 10lb lower mark however and he will need to be at his best if he is to follow up. An excellent fourth behind subsequent winner Diligent Harry in the Kachy Stakes showed he is in rude health though.\n\nThe best of the rest may be Kevin Philippart de Foy's Lakers. He finished an excellent third from a wide draw in a strong race at Southwell and must be respected if in similar mood.\n\n3.00 Newbury - Miami Magic headlines strong novices' chase\n\nMiami Magic tops a quality line-up for the OLBG 'Chasing Excellence' Novices' Chase at Newbury.\n\nStuart Edmunds' stable star impressed when getting off the mark at the third time of asking at Cheltenham on his penultimate run. He struggled to land a blow in the Scilly Isles Novices' Chase at Sandown but given he did not jump with the same fluency, he should appreciate the drop down in class and is taken to concede the penalty under Charlie Hammond.\n\nWyenot has been a consistent performer for the Henry Daly team and has undergone a wind operation having disappointed at Bangor. Providing that is a success, she could bounce back and rates next best.\n\nThat's Nice, Elysian Knight and Thank You Ma'am complete the quintet.\n\n2.12 Lingfield - In-form Henrythenate and Mr Juggles clash\n\nAn ultra-competitive renewal of the Betmgm Awc 3 Year Old Trial Handicap where in-form pair Henrythenate and Mr Juggles headline.\n\nHenrythenate made it two wins from two for new trainer Stuart Williams when comfortably winning over five furlongs at Wolverhampton 15 days ago and he looks the type to go in again as he steps up in trip to six furlongs.\n\nMick Appleby's Mr Juggles was well-backed when making a winning handicap debut at Southwell earlier this month and he warrants plenty of respect under a 7lb penalty.\n\nOthers with each-way chances are Star Of Albion and Saffron Dandy, while Horace Wallace makes appeal on his first handicap start.\n\nBest of the rest\n\n3.45 Lingfield - AW Marathon Trial - Last year's winner Roaring Legend involved. Enemy another to note.\n\n4.20 Lingfield - AW Middle Distance Trial - Duke's Command fancied for Marquand. Lord Melbourne too.\n\n4.53 Lingfield - AW Mile Trial - Superposition among 10 runners.\n\n2.42 Lingfield - AW Fillies & Mares Trial - Bridget's View tops a field of 11.\n\n3.35 Newbury - Taunton winner Talk To The Man catches the eye for Paul Nicholls.\n\n4.08 Newbury - Fair handicap chase where Carbon Man and Daytime Dreaming feature.\n\n2.30 Newbury - Lady Cecilia is a potential improver for Lucy Wadham.\n\n6.15 Wolverhampton - Charlie Appleby and Conor Planas team up with well-bred Starglow. He is related to Romantic Style.\n\n5.45 Wolverhampton - Benacre and Maximising have claims.\n\n12.25 Chantilly - Vatican will be popular.\n\n1.00 Chantilly - Keep an eye on Turbulante."

Share\n\n17m ago 08.42 EST Jamie Jackson With regard to Mikel Arteta’s bid to get Arsenal over the title-winning finishing line after three consecutive second-place finishes, Pep Guardiola was asked for his recollections of doing so with Barcelona in 2008-9, his first season as a head coach. The reply was pithy. “I don’t remember. I’m not here to give advice to Mikel,” said the Catalan. Share\n\n20m ago 08.38 EST David Moyes is giving James Garner plenty of love. The Everton manager reckons Thomas Tuchel should take note. “He’s predominantly a midfield player but can play several positions,” said Moyes. “We had to play him left-back at the start of the season in a couple of games when we didn’t have anybody available. We’ve had to put him at right-back at different times because we think he’s as good as anybody there. In midfield he’s been excellent. I actually believe he’s getting close to being the levels to play for his country. So hopefully he can keep that up and could possibly get selected.” Share\n\n29m ago 08.30 EST Ben Fisher Nottingham Forest need goals if they are to avoid relegation and who better to provide them than Chris Wood, who racked up 20 last season? Only Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak outscored Wood in the last Premier League campaign. Now there is increasing optimism that Wood could feature in Forest’s run-in, an April return mooted. Vitor Pereira, the Forest head coach, said of the striker: “Yes, I hope [he can] recover as soon as possible, because this is very important for us. The information that I have is [that he is] working hard to come as soon as possible.” The 34-year-old has not played since October and underwent knee surgery at the end of last year. The New Zealand captain is desperate to return to fitness before the summer’s World Cup. His last Forest goal came in a home defeat to Midtjylland, who Forest have been drawn against in the two-legged round of 16 next month.

McCowan asserted his belief after the Parkhead side’s 1-0 win over Stuttgart in Germany on Thursday night saw the reigning William Hill Premiership champions lose their Europa League play-off 4-2 on aggregate. Ahead of the Glasgow derby at Ibrox on Sunday and with 10 fixtures remaining, Rangers are four points behind leaders Hearts and two ahead of Celtic, who have a game in hand over the leading pair. “I think at the moment we are in the second position, they are behind us,” said Rohl, upon being asked for a reaction to McCowan’s comments. “They have at the moment seven or eight defeats. I think in general it makes no sense to speak too much about the other side, we have to focus on ourselves. “We want to win this game.

Defending champions Paris St Germain will face Chelsea in what will be a repeat of last year’s ill-tempered Club World Cup final where the Premier League side came out on top. Arsenal, who finished top in the league phase, play Bayer Leverkusen while Bayern Munich, who were second, play Atalanta. Newcastle United face Barcelona while Liverpool take on Galatasaray.

Manchester City will play Bayern Munich or Atalanta if they can get past Real Madrid. We will have a Chelsea v Liverpool quarter-final if they both qualify, while Newcastle and Tottenham Hotspur could meet in the last eight but both sides have an awful lot of work to do to make that happen. Finally, would anyone in their right mind confidently bet against Bodo/Glimt seeing off Sporting to set up a potential quarter-final against Leverkusen or Arsenal? While anyone who has seen Tottenham play this season might suggest nothing could be further from the truth, one of this season’s Champions League’s semi-finals could be a North London derby. Oof!

Share\n\n3h ago 05.42 EST Liverpool: Mo Salah is in his worst goalscoring drought of his Premier League career but head coach Arne Slot is confident it is something he will overcome. The Egypt international has won the Golden Boot four times since arriving at Anfield in 2017, the latest in last season’s title-winning campaign but has gone nine league matches without finding the net. It’s his worst run in the English top flight but Slot said while the criticism was to be expected because of the 33-year-old’s high standards it was not a cause for a concern as it was a problem afflicting all his forwards. “He set his own standards and those are so high and the moment he doesn’t score for a few games people are immediately surprised – that is the biggest compliment he can get,” said Slot. “With data you can use it to your advantage or disadvantage but not to use the FA Cup game – if we play a Premier League side - you could argue if that is fair. “Three games ago he had an assist and a goal against a very good Premier League team in Brighton so that is the reality and then you can change data and say he did not score in nine Premier League games. We are used to Mo scoring a lot of goals and at this moment in time that is maybe the biggest difference in his performance and game time. But we also know this has happened before, I don’t know if it happened nine games in a row but I’ve had these questions earlier if he didn’t score for three or five but I know in the end he always starts scoring again. He is not our only attacker at this moment in time that doesn’t score as much as we are used to.” [Press Association] Share\n\n4h ago 05.24 EST Football Association news: Kevin Thelwell has been appointed the FA’s Elite Coach Developer, tasked with supporting the progression of elite homegrown coaches.

The Newcastle head coach’s record against Pep Guardiola (P22 W2 D2 L18) is pretty dismal, even if his side did beat them at St James’ Park in the Premier League earlier this season. “Really special and really positive for us,” he says. “I think we are just grateful we can’t get Man City! We are looking forward to what the draw brings and we will look forward to that game when it comes around.” If Newcastle are paired with Chelsea, the sides will meet three times in a row across eight days – two legs of the Champions League tie either side of a Premier League encounter at Stamford Bridge. Share\n\n4h ago 05.07 EST Newcastle United: Eddie Howe’s side host Everton at St James’ Park tomorrow and ahead of the game, the Newcastle head coach has provided an injury update on Bruno Guimaraes. Like Arne Slot before him, he doesn’t seem sure when one of his team’s best midfielders will be available. “I have had some good contact with Bruno,” he told reporters. “He seems very positive with his injury and how he feels. He has done a lot of work. He is being well looked after as well. We hope that he can come back and give us a push at the back end of the season. We have to treat his injury carefully.” An ever-present when he is fit, the 28-year-old Brazilian has missed Bruno has missed Newcastle’s last four games with a hamstring injury and was ruled out for at least eight weeks just over a fortnight ago.

Share Updated at 05.52 EST\n\n4h ago 04.44 EST Liverpool: We’ll kick off with some bad news for Liverpool fans, ahead of their side’s match against West Ham tomorrow. Arne Slot has opened his pre-match presser by telling reporters that Florian Wirtz will not be fit for the game and there’s no confirmed time frame on the German’s return. Wirtz missed Liverpool’s somewhat fortuitous win against Nottingham Forest last weekend after being forced to pull out during the warm-up. “I don’t expect Florian to be available,” he says. “It’s a disappointment. Every time a player is not available is a disappointment, it’s something that I didn’t expect after last week. At this moment time, I don’t know [when he will return]. Usually when I say that, I do know and I don’t want to share. But this time, I honestly don’t know. “It’s a big accomplishment for Wirtz to stay fit for such a long time because he had to make a step up from where he played to the Premier League and Liverpool. It tells a lot about his mentality and work rate that he has stayed fit for so long. It is a disappointment for him and for us, because he has played really, really well lately” Slot also reveals that Jeremie Frimpong will be available for tomorrow’s match after being sidelined since the end of January.

            "content": "Liverpool had the highest wage bill in the Premier League when winning their 20th league title last season, the club’s latest set of accounts have revealed.\n\nLiverpool’s wage bill increased by £42m to £428m in the year ending 31 May 2025, when a Premier League title triumph in Arne Slot’s debut season as head coach and a return to the Champions League increased revenue to a record £703m. The club’s wages-to-revenue ratio stood at a healthy 61%. It was the biggest wage bill in the division, ahead of Manchester City on £408m, and included bonuses for the record-equalling title triumph.\n\nCommercial revenue increased by £15m to £323m and matchday revenue by £14m to £116m. The figures contributed to an increase of £89m in revenue for the highest-ranked Premier League club in the Deloitte Football Money League. But the rise in wages, which pushed administrative costs up by £57m to £657m, resulted in a relatively modest post-tax profit of £8m. Liverpool had a £57m loss in 2023-24 after failing to qualify for the Champions League.\n\n“We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it,” said Liverpool’s chief financial officer, Jenny Beacham. “The 2024-25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men’s team winning our 20th league title.\n\n“The club does face significant cost challenges, including rises in administrative, staffing and operational costs, alongside the need for us to compete at the highest level of the game, across our men and women’s teams.”\n\nLiverpool’s latest set of published accounts do not include last summer’s record spend of almost £450m on new players, including the British record signing of Alexander Isak for £125m from Newcastle. Slot said recently that failure to qualify for the Champions League would be unacceptable for Liverpool this season and the competition “does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run”.\n\nOn Friday Slot insisted it was not difficult to resist the clamour to start Rio Ngumoha because the level-headed teenager had not been carried away by the hype. The 17-year-old made a huge contribution to Liverpool’s late win at Nottingham Forest last weekend after his 77th-minute introduction, especially after switching wings to replace Mohamed Salah on the right. That has prompted calls for Ngumoha to start against West Ham on Saturday, when Florian Wirtz will again be absent through injury, but Slot will continue to develop the youngster carefully.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rio Ngumoha made a big impact for Liverpool from the bench against Nottingham Forest.

He is handling that situation really well, which is a big compliment to him but also to his parents, who raised him that he is down-to-earth, works really hard, keeps going and doesn’t lose his head because a few pundits have given positive feedback about his game. If you start believing how special you are after a few comments from pundits, that is probably not the way to become the player he wants to become.\n\n“We have to keep his special quality and that is beating players in one-v-one. That is not 10 out of 10 times working, and it doesn’t have to be, but he has to keep trying. There are not many players in modern football that can take on one-v-ones on a regular basis and beat their opponents a lot of times. That is a special quality and that is why we want to take such good care of him because we have a lot of belief in how special he is.”"

            "content": "Nottingham Forest have appointed a new director of performance, Tottenham’s former head of medicine and sports science Geoff Scott, amid concerns that injury problems have exacerbated their struggle to avoid relegation.\n\nScott spent 20 years at Tottenham until leaving two years ago after a clash with the then manager, Ange Postecoglou, who was in charge of Forest for eight matches this season.\n\nVítor Pereira was this month appointed Forest’s fourth manager of a turbulent campaign, and his side are two points above the bottom three before Sunday’s trip to Brighton.\n\nForest’s struggles have not been helped by injuries, with 19 players ruled out at some stage, one of the worst records in the Premier League. Only Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal have had more injuries, and those clubs have deeper squads.\n\nScott will take charge of an overhauled medical department, with the existing head of medical, Dr Prithish Narayan, understood to be leaving to return to work for the NHS.\n\nScott left Tottenham at the start of last season as part of a major restructure of Postecoglou’s backroom team, which led to the appointment of Adam Brett from Brighton as Spurs’ director of performance services. It was widely reported at the time that Scott had clashed with Postecoglou over the players’ workload and management of their recovery, with Tottenham declining to comment.\n\nTottenham’s squad has been devastated by injuries for the last two seasons under Postecoglou and Thomas Frank, with the club experiencing 41 injuries last season leading to 1,553 days out, the second-highest total in the Premier League after Brighton.\n\nForest have been drawn to face Midtjylland in the Europa League last 16. The Danish club won 3-2 at Forest in the league stage in October, when Postecoglou was in charge."

Amorim’s 14-month reign ended on 5 January after his public attack on United’s hierarchy, with his five coaches also leaving Old Trafford.\n\nA filing to the New York Stock Exchange revealed the potential payments to Amorim and his staff, a day after the club confirmed they had made a £32.6m profit in their second-quarter results to 31 December 2025.\n\nUnited listed it as an “event that occurred after the reporting period”, and said: “A charge of £6.3m for the write off of related intangible assets and a provision of £15.9m, representing the maximum potential amount of future settlement payments, will be recognised in the statement of profit or (loss) during the second half of the year ending 30 June 2026.”\n\nIt has been reported the maximum amount of £15.9m is dependent on certain factors, such as Amorim not getting a new job within a specific timeframe.\n\nThe accounts showed United have also paid Sporting £6.3m, which is what they owed the Portuguese club in compensation for hiring Amorim. United said in a November 2024 filing they were paying Sporting £10m to hire Amorim to replace Erik ten Hag, whose exit was costing £10.4m.\n\nThe combined changes around Amorim’s appointment could cost United £36.3m. Amorim won 25 of his 63 games, finishing 15th in the Premier League, United’s worst performance since being relegated from the top flight in 1973-74.\n\nUnited were sixth in the Premier League when Amorim was dismissed, having had a major falling out with the director of football, Jason Wilcox, days before his final game at Leeds.\n\nThey have boosted their hopes of Champions League football next season under Michael Carrick, climbing to fourth with five wins and a draw."

            "content": "1 Emery seeks to end Wolves duck\n\nUnai Emery has seen most things in this game but he has never won at Wolves. In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on direct rivals. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season. Will Unwin\n\nBournemouth v Sunderland, Saturday 12.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Back in business: Granit Xhaka looks set to give Sunderland a timely boost. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea, where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in matchday chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) as they sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL interpreters will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here. Andy Hunter\n\nLiverpool v West Ham, Saturday 3pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Liverpool fans sing You’ll Never Walk Alone before kick-off at Anfield. Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images\n\n5 Centre stage for Gordon against old club\n\nNewcastle may be in the last 16 of the Champions League but they are also 11th in the Premier League, two places and one point behind Saturday’s visitors to St James’ Park, Everton. “We’ve raised our game at times in the Champions League, there’s no denying that,” says Eddie Howe. “But we want to get into Europe every season and we’re desperate to get our Premier League form back on track. We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left-winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German, who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire on Saturday. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland. Louise Taylor\n\nLeeds v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Daniel Farke will be hoping for more celebration as Manchester City come to Elland Road.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track after a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croat’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and, considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance. WU\n\nFulham v Tottenham, Sunday 2pm\n\nView image in fullscreen João Palhinha (left) battles with Leandro Trossard during an uncomfortable afternoon in the north London derby. Photograph: Ian Walton/AP\n\n9 Amad to make way for Sesko?\n\nFor Michael Carrick to find a fall guy for Benjamin Sesko, who is seeking a first start under him, the interim manager need look no further than Amad Diallo. The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third goal in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes after the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "Two months ago, Aston Villa were just three points off top spot in the Premier League. They were on a run of 12 wins in 14 games that included victories against Manchester City and Arsenal. Their run of eight consecutive wins in the league was their best since they won 10 in a row in 1910. You wouldn’t have blamed Villa fans for daring to dream about lifting their first league title since 1981.\n\nBut success breeds expectation, and expectation carries its own cruel weight. Arsenal tore Villa apart in a 4-1 win in late December and victories have been hard to come by in the new year – they have only won three of their last nine league games. Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea are still below them in the table but the gap is narrowing. With games against United and Chelsea coming in March, the top-three spot Villa have occupied since they beat Wolves in late November suddenly looks in jeopardy. So does their place in the Champions League next season.\n\nThey salvaged a point against Leeds on Saturday courtesy of a scrambled 88th-minute finish from Tammy Abraham, but the 1-1 draw at Villa Park did little to disguise the deeper issues. Unai Emery’s side looked anxious and lacked inspiration for long periods of the game. A slow start left them chasing the game and, not for the first time this season, they relied on a set-piece goal to bail them out of trouble. “It’s a good point,” said a clearly relieved Emery. Daniel Farke’s reaction was telling. “It’s crazy that you can come here as a newly promoted side – to one of the title contenders, one of the best teams in this country and in Europe – and you are slightly disappointed with just one point.”\n\nThe tension from the fans in Villa Park mirrored the hesitancy on the pitch – a rarity in what has been one of Europe’s most difficult venues to visit in recent years. Villa lost just one home game in the league last season and were on a run of eight straight wins at Villa Park this season before their current slump. And yet they were just minutes away from their fourth defeat in their last six home games in all competitions. For a side that has thrived on controlled possession, high-quality chance creation and adaptability, they looked one-dimensional and mistake-prone.\n\nVilla are lacking a creative pulse and their strikers are suffering. They have scored just one goal from open play in their last five matches. Injuries have had a large part to play in this. Three of their first-choice midfielders – Boubacar Kamara, Youri Tielemans and John McGinn – are out injured.\n\nTielemans and McGinn have set up 50 chances for teammates this season (only Morgan Rogers has been more creative) so it’s no surprise to see Villa struggle for goals. Without the physicality and control of their absent midfielders, Villa’s buildup play has been fractured and mistakes have crept in. Their replacements, Douglas Luiz and Amadou Onana, were injured earlier in the season and lack the match fitness required to complete games.\n\nView image in fullscreen Aston Villa have missed John McGinn, their captain, during his injury layoff. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nThe good news for Villa fans is that they have battled back from similar setbacks in the recent past. They failed to score a goal or win a point from their first four league matches this season yet were fighting for the title by Christmas.\n\nAnd they had to show plenty of character the last time they qualified for the Champions League, in the 2023–24 season. They were challenging for the title at Christmas, having lost just two of their first 18 games. But they struggled in the second half of the campaign, lost seven matches and found them themselves grinding out results. That team held on and finished fourth, booking their place in Europe’s top competition for the first time since the 1982-83 season.\n\nVilla are showing similar grit this season. After Abraham’s last-gasp equaliser against Leeds, Villa have won 19 points from losing positions – more than any other side in the division. They also have the third best defensive record, having conceded just 28 goals in 27 games. And they have one of the most experienced and shrewdest managers in Europe.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering that the Premier League is unusually competitive this season. The longest current winning streak in the league is just three matches (Manchester City). All of the top teams – even leaders Arsenal – have gone through periods when they have dug in. Villa’s resilience could prove decisive. Their recent draws against Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Leeds might feel like missed opportunities, but those points may prove crucial come May.\n\nMarch will be a season-defining month for Villa. Their recent form is patchy and their performances have been far from eye-catching. Fluidity in possession has given way to forced passes, and dominance has often been replaced by moments of desperation. But there remains a steel to this side that cannot be ignored. And, crucially given their upcoming games against their fellow Champions League chasers, they have a nice habit of beating the top sides. They have already beaten Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea in the league this season. There are plenty of reasons to go into the run-in with optimism.\n\nThis is an article by WhoScored"

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final European fixture as a manager. He created such wonderful memories for Celtic’s support in this domain during his first tenure that departing with a smile felt appropriate. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts. “The evening is nothing to do with me,” said O’Neill with needless self-deprecation.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal inside 30 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered unexpected cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half – the hosts had 24 attempts at goal – but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that is worthy of huge credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have delivered a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite either set of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday at the start of a spell that will define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart had managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ragged and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe only goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. “I got carried away with myself,” O’Neill said later. “I thought ‘we are going to do this here’.”\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate.

The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm clash. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident been as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were only 25 minutes from that maiden win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly cancelled for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious as Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement albeit the officials had ushered him back on to the pitch. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "It is a peculiarity particular to Crystal Palace that a season of such upheaval and unrest could still end up with Oliver Glasner’s side winning another trophy. Having left the pitch after last week’s first leg with supporters calling for the Austrian manager to be sacked in the morning, Maxence Lacroix and Evann Guessand made it a much more harmonious evening for Glasner and his side.\n\nAfter being fortunate to escape from last week’s trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina with a 1-1 draw, it could have been very different if Zrinjski Mostar had equalised just before Guessand settled the tie late on. But having been demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League after winning the FA Cup last season, Palace’s first European campaign will continue against either the Cypriot side Larnaca – who they lost to during the group stages – or Mainz from Germany in the last 16.\n\n“There is so much noise, so sometimes we really don’t understand it, but maybe I gave some interviews that were not really helpful, I have to admit,” said Glasner in reference to his comments after the first leg when he told fans to “stay humble”.\n\n“I just had to express it otherwise I would have exploded. I can’t do it differently. If I feel something, I have to say it. Then I have to face the shitstorm. Everyone hopefully knows everything I say and do is for the best of Crystal Palace.”\n\nPalace rejected a request from the supporters’ group responsible for the banner directed against Glasner and the club’s board in their last match against Wolves to turn off the music so they could “back the team during the pre-match warm-up” on the grounds that Uefa’s regulations wouldn’t allow it.\n\nBut the presence of a large group of travelling supporters who took up position two hours before kick-off helped to create a decent atmosphere despite a large number of empty seats in the home sections. “40 quid? Palace fans fleeced = empty seats,” read the latest message that was displayed by the Holmesdale Fanatics during the first half.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate.

Thank you for your feedback.\n\nIt seemed like Zrinjski – managed by the former Derby defender Igor Stimac – could be in for a long evening when Jørgen Strand Larsen’s shot deflected wide in the fifth minute.\n\nBut they managed to keep Palace at arm’s length until almost half-time thanks to some brave defending. Guessand, who was starting for only the second time since his loan move from Aston Villa after scoring the decisive goal against Wolves, could not take advantage of a mix-up between the goalkeeper Goran Karacic and Igor Savic before the latter blocked Daichi Kamada’s goalbound shot.\n\nView image in fullscreen Crystal Palace fans display a banner protesting against ticket prices. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nThe Palace fans were starting to get on the Portuguese referee’s back after a series of decisions went against their side, with Jaydee Canvot and Strand Larsen both cautioned.\n\nBut in a season where defending set pieces has proved to be a major weakness, Glasner punched the air in delight when Adam Wharton’s pinpoint free-kick was headed in by Lacroix.\n\nThe England midfielder has been showing signs of fatigue in recent weeks but is still capable of providing real quality, as well as the occasional mistake. It was Wharton’s slip that allowed Leo Mikic a first sight of goal for Zrinjski just before half-time but his shot was jeered as it sailed wide.\n\nWharton was withdrawn not long after he had been shown a yellow card for a high boot, with Glasner revealing afterwards that the fourth official had warned he was close to a second booking. “Him and Will Hughes are rotating themselves by fouling too much,” he said.\n\nIsmaïla Sarr headed well over from Tyrick Mitchell’s cross in a rare sight of goal as another of Palace’s issues this season – struggling to break down teams employing a low block – returned. Their best chance of extending the lead was from another set piece and Chris Richards should have done better from close range on two occasions from a couple of Kamada free-kicks.\n\nView image in fullscreen Evann Guessand doubles Crystal Palace’s lead in stoppage time. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThere was a warning for Palace that the tie wasn’t over when Zrinjski had a goal correctly ruled out for offside with 25 minutes still to play. Yet it was the hosts who should have wrapped up the victory as the chances came thick and fast. Guessand had a golden opportunity to settle it but saw his shot saved by Karacic and Sarr was also guilty of missing two chances that looked easier to score.\n\nZrinjski’s big moment came in the second minute of injury time but the substitute Tomi Juric could only head over before Guessand finally made sure to send Palace into the next round."

            "content": "GEN Z-EN Two thirds of Gen Z office workers can’t work without headphones on, survey reveals\n\nNEW research has revealed two thirds of Gen Z office workers can’t work without headphones on.\n\nThe poll of 2,000 white collar staff found 64 per cent of 18 to 29-year-olds ‘need’ to be plugged in when doing their jobs – compared to just 27 per cent of Gen X.\n\n\n\nNot being able to concentrate amid the background noise (55 per cent) is the number one reason for depending on headphones.\n\n\n\nOne of the most significant background distractions is the sound of other people on calls (34 per cent).\n\nBut older generations are also contributing to the trend, with 69 per cent of employees across all age groups using headphones during the working day.\n\nPop (34 per cent), podcasts (22 per cent) and rock (19 per cent) top the nation’s workday soundtrack, followed closely by classical music (19 per cent).\n\nWhile nine per cent tune into ambient sounds, such as rainfall or crackling fires, and six per cent opt for the more abrasive tones of heavy metal.\n\nThe research was commissioned by Samsung Electronics to celebrate the launch of its noise cancelling Bach headphones.\n\nAnnika Bizon from the tech firm said: “Workplaces today are full of competing demands on our attention, whether that’s office chatter, back-to-back calls or the constant stream of notifications.\n\n“What this research shows is that many are actively creating their own focus zones, and headphones have become an essential tool for switching into a more productive mindset.”\n\nOverall, 35 per cent of office headphone users now struggle to work without them, while a fifth said they make fewer mistakes when listening to their favourite sounds on the job.\n\n\n\nNearly half (45 per cent) prefer noise cancelling tech, as 44 per cent said general background noise causes them to lose concentration, while 34 per cent bemoan the sound of others on calls.\n\nAnd 16 per cent added constant emails and message pings derail their train of thought.\n\nSix in 10 (61 per cent) believe they would work faster if there was less noise around them, with 37 per cent describing light music and background chatter as the optimum working environment.\n\nExploring listening habits further, the survey found 46 per cent typically listen to the same things every day.\n\n\n\nAnd 74 per cent believe there are clear generational differences when it comes to attitudes towards wearing headphones at work.\n\nAnnika Bizon from Samsung added: “When people are trying to concentrate, the quality of what they’re hearing – and what they’re able to block out – really matters.\n\n“Comfort is also chief among the elements that make a noticeable difference to concentration when working, as well as features like immersive sound and adaptive noise control.\n\n“Whichever devices people choose to get them through their day have the ability to help people stay engaged, reduce mistakes and feel more in control of their working environment.”"

Give them back those $10 million. Please.\n\n“I’ll give everything back to everyone we stole from, I’ll give everything back to everyone.”\n\nIn a separate unverified video, man claiming to be Igor allegedly admitted to running a bank account “scamming” business.\n\n\n\nLocal cops are trying to determine the authenticity of the clips.\n\nNow, mutilated human body parts have been found on the holiday hotspot island, which officials think may belong to Igor.\n\nPolice are working to identify the body parts and conducting DNA testing, including taking a sample from Igor’s mother.\n\nThe remains were reportedly in an advanced state of decomposition, with forensic specialists estimating the victim had been dead for more than three days.\n\nBali Police spokesperson Senior Commissioner Ariasandy said: “It could be [him] but again we cannot speculate, we can’t guess. We must rely on forensic results.”\n\n\n\n“We will then match [samples] with the DNA of families who feel their family members are missing, or who reported kidnapping or missing persons, including those we learned yesterday that a foreign national was reported kidnapped.”\n\nHe added: “Because it happened to be a kidnapping case, we are investigating all possible things, but we cannot speculate.”\n\n\n\nThe tourist was holidaying on island paradise Bali with his girlfriend, Yeva Mishalova, and his friend Yermak Petrovsky when the alleged kidnap took place.\n\nYeva is a lifestyle and food blogger with 146,000 followers.\n\nSome reports have claimed that the alleged captor located Igor by using social media posts.\n\nPolice have arrested six men as suspects in the alleged kidnap – the suspects were identified after officers arrested a foreign national attempting to flee.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nHe said: “Initially, we secured one foreign national with the initials CH, who rented vehicles using a false passport.\n\n\n\n“Following further investigation, we named six other foreign nationals as suspects — RM, BK, AS, VN, SM and DH. All are men.”"

            "content": "IT was the Green Party’s finest electoral hour, romping home in the Gorton and Denton by-election to upend British politics.\n\nYet, they stand accused of opening the Pandora’s Box of sectarianism to achieve the stunning result in what was one of the most toxic polls in recent times.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent observers claimed to have witnessed “extremely high” cases of illegal “family voting” in the south Manchester suburb with a high Muslim population.\n\nThis is the practice when family members enter a voting booth together and one tells the other how to vote.\n\nIt can involve a husband and wife and is a criminal offence.\n\nNigel Farage rounded on the Greens – who ran on a pro Palestine ticket – insisting theirs was a victory for “sectarian voting and cheating”.\n\n\n\nThe Reform UK leader said that family voting presented “serious questions” about the integrity of the ballot in “predominantly Muslim areas”.\n\nDemocracy Volunteers – the poll observer group accredited by the Electoral Commission – said they had seen “the highest levels of family voting at any election in our 10-year history of observing elections in the UK”.\n\nManchester City Council have insisted “no such issues have been reported”.\n\nReform’s Gorton candidate Matt Goodwin, who finished second to the Greens, said: “I am deeply concerned about the extent to which the Gorton and Denton by-election is a free, fair, and democratic election.”\n\n\n\nYet, the Green’s success in Gorton – their vote was up by a staggering 28 per cent from 2024 – suggests their style of campaigning may be here to stay.\n\nTheir success follows the election of four independent MPs on a pro-Gaza platform in the 2024 general election.\n\nThe Greens tailored their message to the more than a quarter of potential voters in the constituency who are Muslim, with almost a fifth of whom are believed to have roots in Pakistan.\n\nThey published electoral videos and leaflets in Urdu, the national language of Pakistan.\n\nCampaign leaflets featured a photo of their candidate Hannah Spencer wearing a red and black keffiyeh – a scarf worn by supporters of the Paletinian cause – while posing in front of a mosque.\n\n\n\nWritten in English, the material included the words: “Stop Islamophobia. Stop Reform.”\n\nAnd, in Urdu, the leaflet stated: “Labour must be punished for Gaza.”\n\nWhat are Green Party’s bonkers policies? From ‘disgusting’ plan to legalise heroin to letting in ALL illegal migrants THE Green Party has been blasted for “disgusting” plans following their bombshell victory last night. Fighting for his political life yesterday, Sir Keir Starmer made a last minute attack on the Greens in an attempt to sway voters. But it was unsuccessful, with Labour coming third – and the result provided an opening for Andy Burnham‘s allies to claim things could have been different if he had been allowed to stand. The Greater Manchester Mayor – a challenger to Starmer – tried to stand in the constituency but was blocked by Labour’s ruling executive committee. The Gorton and Denton result signals a serious cracking of Britain’s two-party politics, with Reform and the Greens gaining more power and validity. But it has cast a light on the policies of both parties – with the Greens coming under fire for plans on drugs and immigration. Yesterday, Sir Keir came out swinging and told PMQs: “The Green Party’s policy isn’t just irresponsible, it’s reprehensible, legalising cocaine, heroin, ketamine and the date rape drug, GHB, a drug which we know is used to spike drinks for women. “I have to say, as the father of a 17-and-a-half-year-old son, that the idea that the argument is being made by the Greens that when he turns 18, in just a few months, it would be lawful to provide him with heroin and crack cocaine is absolutely disgusting.” Green candidate Hannah Spencer has previously said she thought “decriminalising is a conversation that we need to have”. Last year, the leader of the Greens said that all drugs – including heroin and crack cocaine – should be legalised. The Mail has also reportedly seen documents drawn up by the Greens that suggest giving amnesty to illegal migrants. It reported that Zack Polanski plans to let illegal arrivals use the NHS from the moment they land in the UK as part of a “world without borders”. This would apply even if their asylum claim was rejected. Internal documents read that “migration is not a criminal offence under any circumstances”, the Mail reports. Detention centres for illegal migrants would also be abolished in the plans. The Greens would also give them a wage on the level of benefits – but without the usual requirement to be in work or actively seek work. Reform, Labour and the Tories all blasted the scheme as “financially reckless but also dangerous”. Other Green Party plans include Net Zero by 2040, dismantling nuclear weapons, and more tax rises for earners above £50,000.\n\nWhile leaked text messages from the Gorton and Denton Green campaign showed party activists planning to leaflet Muslims “outside mosques” during Ramadan.\n\n\n\nAnd a Green campaign video pictures Sir Keir Starmer clutching the hand of India’s Hindu Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a bitter foe of Muslim Pakistan.\n\nThe campaign tactics led to accusations that the Greens were sowing division and sectarianism.\n\nA senior cabinet minister said before the vote: “The Greens are whipping up hatred and deliberately raising the salience of Gaza.\n\n“They’re hammering us. They’re a totally different party to the one we thought they were.”\n\nBefore voting day I met Labour candidate Angeliki Stogia in ethnically-diverse Longisight.\n\n\n\nThe Network Rail worker told me: “Stoking anger outside the mosques here isn’t going to solve the problems in Gaza.\n\n“I‘m very disappointed to see how the Greens are campaigning in this area.”\n\nYet, plumber Hannah Spencer took the seat with 14,980 votes, with Matt Goodwin on 10,578 for Reform and Labout third with 9,364.\n\nWhen asked about accusations of secratianism during her campaign, Spencer said after her victory that they were “trying to unite people on shared common ground”.\n\nHer ground-breaking triumph has rathcheted up the pressure on Sir Keir Starmer’s faltering and beleaguered premiership.\n\n\n\nLabour MP Brian Leishman said: “Time he did the right thing for the country & the Labour Party, and go.”\n\nLurching from one calamity to another, Starmer increasingly resembles the Black Knight in Monty Python and the Holy Grail who insists “Tis but a scratch” after King Arthur hacks off his limbs in a sword fight.\n\nAfter Mandelsongate, 15 U-turns in 19 months and losing elections in Runcorn, Caerphilly and now Gorton, Starmer still refuses to recognise when he’s been beaten.\n\nMonty Python’s Arthur tells the Black Knight: “Look, you stupid b*d, you’ve got no arms left!”\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nMany Labour MPs – keen to retain their seats – will be thinking the same thing of Starmer’s Prime Ministership.\n\n\n\nAnd they may come with political swords of their own after the May local elections which are likely to be another Starmer bloodbath."

Throw her! Throw her!. … I got her, I got her!”\n\n\n\nThe three-year-old girl is dropped from the balcony and falls toward the pavement before landing in the officer’s arms.\n\nA second cop then rushes in to steady the catch as screams echo from above.\n\nMoments later, the family’s small white dog is tossed from the smoke-filled terrace and safely grabbed by officers.\n\nThe rescue unfolded around 3.10pm last Saturday after dispatchers received a frantic 911 call reporting a fire at an apartment building in Milpitas, near San Jose.\n\n\n\n“There’s a fire, and we can’t get out. It’s outside of our door but not inside our house,” the caller told dispatch.\n\nOfficers Ricardo Barragan and Trayvon Hartley arrived in less than two minutes to find the building “completely engulfed” in flames, according to the Milpitas Police Department.\n\nThe fire was burning next door, but smoke and flames blocked exits.\n\nHartley caught the toddler while Barragan helped stabilize her, Acting Assistant Chief Tyler Jamison said. Barragan then caught the dog.\n\nFirefighters from the Milpitas Fire Department arrived shortly after and safely evacuated the two adults still trapped on the balcony.\n\n\n\nNo injuries were reported, though several apartments were damaged.\n\nPolice said in a statement: “We are incredibly thankful for the calm and courage shown by the residents during such a terrifying moment, and for the seamless teamwork between our dispatchers, officers, and fire personnel.”\n\nJamison called it “a terrifying experience” for the family, saying: “Anyone who goes through that is definitely shocked and terrified after the incident.”\n\nHe praised the officers as “hometown kids” and said the department is “really proud of our officers and how they serve our community”.\n\n“Law enforcement in general is a very difficult job,” Jamison said.\n\n\n\n“They have to make split-second decisions every day.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“And I think this is one of many examples where they did a great job.\n\n“We’re very proud of the work that not only they do, but our entire department, just law enforcement as a community.”"

            "content": "SERVED dismal meal trays in his cell and carted to tearful visitations with his parents on a golf buggy for protection, Ian Huntley’s life behind bars has long been a exercise in survival.\n\nNow, as the monstrous murderer lies in a hospital bed fighting for his life following a vicious attack yesterday, one of his former guards has lifted the lid on the extraordinary measures prisons have been forced to take over the years to fend off bloodthirsty lags desperate for a ‘trophy kill’.\n\n\n\n\n\nJournalist David McGee, who found himself guarding Huntley in a Category A jail during a daring undercover operation, said every possible precaution was taken to keep him safe from other inmates who wanted him dead.\n\nBut with prison overcrowding and staff shortages reaching a critical crisis, standards have slipped, leading to a huge surge in violence.\n\nAs part of a shocking investigation into the lax security of Britain’s jails in 2003, McGee landed a guard job and within days was placed on a rota of officers monitoring Huntley as he languished in a cell awaiting his trial at the Old Bailey for the brutal murders of schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.\n\nEx school caretaker Huntley, then known behind bars as Prisoner JG5778 at Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes, was on suicide watch and needed to be closely monitored by guards around the clock.\n\nDavid recalled: “The police and prison management quite rightly feared Huntley would be killed from the very start of his stint in prison.\n\n“From day one they were terrified he would be subject to some sort of trophy attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n“They had good reason to think that – he was the most hated man in Britain at the time.\n\n“And he was surrounded by some of the country’s most depraved and dangerous criminals who knew they were never getting out of prison anyway.\n\n“Attacking Huntley would have been seen as a badge of honour.\n\n“Whoever pulled it off would have been rewarded not just with treats like tobacco from the other inmates, but more importantly, the prestige.”\n\nGuarding Huntley at Woodhill was a popular duty as warders would earn overtime, called Extra Gratuity Payments.\n\nBut it was gruelling work as the killer was locked in solitary confinement in his own individual cell block, far from any other lags.\n\nDavid explained: “None of the other inmates could get anywhere near Huntley at that time, we had to make sure everyone else was kept well away.\n\n“He was considered the very highest level of risk, the most vulnerable of all the prisoners.\n\n“Huntley was given a level of protection that was not even afforded to police officers or paedophiles, who are generally considered extremely vulnerable because they tend to be the people who are most despised by other prisoners.”\n\n\n\nPart of McGee’s job was escorting Huntley to and from his cell in a special golf buggy, because he would have been exposed for too long if he had walked.\n\nHe was given his own individual room for meetings – even though he did not get many visitors, apart from his parents and lawyers.\n\n“Huntley was certainly never allowed near the canteen – all his meals had to be delivered to him on a tray,” David added.\n\n“He was not allowed to mix and mingle at all.”\n\nSpeaking to The Sun’s Meeting The Monster series, David said the cocky killer’s mask slipped during one emotional visitation from his parents.\n\nHe explained: “I was in the room while he spoke with his parents, and although I was not close enough to hear what they were saying, it was clear his parents were very upset too.\n\n“By the time they left they were absolutely wrecked. I put my hand on Huntley’s shoulder to steer him back to the buggy.\n\n“It was only a distance of about 100 yards back to his cell but I was told he had to be driven both ways.\n\n\n\n“He was bawling his eyes out, the meeting had clearly been deeply traumatising for him.\n\n“Afterwards it took him quite a while to settle down. It was an astonishing day.”\n\nWith jails now operating at more than 99 per cent capacity, standards in prisons across the country have inevitably plummeted.\n\nMcGee tells us: “I’m not remotely surprised by this latest attack.\n\n“Complacency has set in and I know that staff have had no choice but to become more relaxed.\n\n“Huntley is one of the country’s most famous prisoners, it would still be considered a badge of honour to attack him – or worse.\n\n“Anyone who managed it would be hailed a hero by the other inmates.”\n\nI found him quite slimy and I’m sure he believed he would get away with his vile crimes\n\nOn Thursday it emerged that Huntley had been rushed to hospital after being found in a pool of blood following an attack allegedly by triple killer Anthony Russell, 43, at HMP Frankland in County Durham where he is serving a life sentence with a minimum of 40 years.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, a prisoner who slashed Huntley’s throat with a makeshift knife was jailed for life.\n\nDamien Fowkes was sentenced to a minimum of 20 years for the attempted murder of Huntley after inflicting a wound seven inches long on the Soham murderer’s neck. The court was told it was only “good fortune” that the weapon missed anything vital.\n\nHuntley had been convicted along with his girlfriend Maxine Carr, who knowingly provided him with an alibi during the search in August 2002.\n\nEfforts to locate the missing girls in the 13 days after they disappeared have been described as the most extensive in British history as 400 cops were assigned full time to the case.\n\nHuntley was arrested when cops discovered charred pieces of the red Manchester United football shirts both girls had been wearing when they disappeared."

The defendant was described as possessive angry and paranoid, and she wanted him to receive help.”\n\nDevenport went to Priory clinic and eventually quit drinking but in May 2025 fell off the wagon during the couple’s trip to Slovakia.\n\n\n\nAfter returning to the UK, Stephanie chillingly told a taxi driver: “He’ll batter me when we go in – if I go in there now, he’ll just punch me.”\n\nThe driver phoned police who arrested Devenport for assault but Stephanie asked that no action be taken against him.\n\nShe told officers: “He’s like full on serious like gunna murder me….but I mither him and I shouldn’t do that I am so sorry.”\n\nIn the days before her death, the couple booked into the Pied Bull Hotel in Chester for two nights in a bid to save their relationship but staff were called to a bust up and Devenport was thrown out in the early hours.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, Stephanie’s dad Phil went to the home after becoming concerned he had not seen her in ten days.\n\n\n\nRecalling the horror, he told police: ”I hammered on the door and Tony came to the door quite quickly.\n\n“He was in a right state, physically and mentally and he said, ‘I think she’s dead, I think she’s dead’.\n\n“I said, ‘What do you mean, you think she’s dead?’ but he was weeping and emotional and just psychotic.\n\n“He said, ‘She’s in there” and I go into the back bedroom, and it’s, it’s just a terrible, terrible sight. I knew straight away she was dead.\n\n“She had been a beautiful girl but when I saw her, she looked like a zombie. Tony was behind me and I said to him, ‘I know she’s dead, you’ve killed her’.\n\n\n\n”The apartment was covered in filth, beer cans everywhere. It was absolutely disgusting. I regret not breaking that door down earlier.”\n\nJurors heard Stephanie had 102 injuries to her body including to her brain, which contributed directly to her death and was consistent with blunt force trauma.\n\nShe had just been fed the vodka lollies and sugary treats, which left her emaciated at 48kg and in pain from alcohol abuse.\n\nDevenport claimed he “just slapped her about a few times the night before” and blamed her injuries on pushing her on a mattress.\n\nDomestic abuse - how to get help DOMESTIC abuse can affect anyone - including men - and does not always involve physical violence. Here are some signs that you could be in an abusive relationship: Emotional abuse – Including being belittled, blamed for the abuse – gaslighting – being isolated from family and friends, having no control over your finances, what you where and who you speak to\n\n– Including being belittled, blamed for the abuse – gaslighting – being isolated from family and friends, having no control over your finances, what you where and who you speak to Threats and intimidation – Some partners might threaten to kill or hurt you, destroy your belongings, stalk or harass you\n\n– Some partners might threaten to kill or hurt you, destroy your belongings, stalk or harass you Physical abuse – This can range from slapping or hitting to being shoved over, choked or bitten.\n\n– This can range from slapping or hitting to being shoved over, choked or bitten. Sexual abuse – Being touched in a way you do not want to be touched, hurt during sex, pressured into sex or forced to have sex when you do not consent. If any of the above apply to you or a friend, you can call these numbers: The Freephone National Domestic Abuse Helpline, run by Refuge on 0808 2000 247 for free at any time, day or night\n\n0808 2000 247 Men who are being abused can call Respect Men’s Advice Line on 0808 8010 327 or ManKind on 0182 3334 244\n\n0182 3334 244 Those who identify as LGBT+ can ring Galop on 0800 999 5428\n\n0800 999 5428 If you are in immediate danger or fear for your life, always ring 999 Remember, you are not alone. 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men will experience domestic abuse over the course of their lifetime. Every 30 seconds the police receive a call for help relating to domestic abuse.\n\nAndrew Madden, of the CPS, said it was “an extremely sad case and a tragic end for a young, talented woman who had a successful life ahead of her”.\n\n\n\nHe said: “At trial, Tony Devenport admitted he slapped Stephanie Blundell two or three times excessively but could provide no explanation for the 102 injuries found on her.\n\n“These included traumatic, recently inflicted brain injuries, fractures to both thyroid horns, often associated with strangulation or mechanical asphyxiation, and severe facial bruising.”\n\nHe said he repeatedly maintained Stephanie died “peacefully” due to her struggles with alcohol.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“The prosecution adduced photographs of her injuries to demonstrate to the jury his account was entirely fictitious,” he continued.\n\n“Despite Stephanie’s condition, he did nothing to obtain help and pretended that moments before her father arrived, he was attempting to resuscitate her, even though she was clearly dead.”"

And the Afghan Taliban have launched retaliations across the border with artillery attacks - both sides claiming casualties inflicted on the other.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPakistan is in an \"open war\" with Afghanistan, Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif said Friday, with fighting escalating into the most serious armed confrontation between the two uneasy neighbors since a Qatari-mediated ceasefire in October.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAn explosion of violence over the border between the two could lead to a major destabilising of the region amid Pakistani claims India may have supported Afghan-launched attacks . Anarchy across the continent encourages the growth of terror groups and the general threat to the west.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Hours earlier the Afghan rulers the Taliban said they had launched a ‘large scale offensive operations’ against Pakistan’s troops. The Afghani attacks were along the Durand Line which separates the two countries, created in 1983 by UK diplomat Sir Mortimer Durand.\n\nIts intention was to create a separation between the British Indian Empire and Afghanistan in intense rivalry with the Russian Empire. Effectively it put a buffer between the interests of the UK and Russia, which never owned Afghanistan, despite attempts to do so.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Smoke billows after Pakistani strikes on border (Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThis frontier has always been argued against by Afghanistan and its aim was then to create a border between the country and what was then India. One of the reasons the 1,640 miles boundary between Afghanistan, and what in 1947 became Pakistan, is so sensitive is that it split two major ethnic groups, the Pashtun and the Balochs.\n\nPakistani Taliban, the Tehrik-e-Taliban, and Baloch rebels have launched terror attacks repeatedly inside Pakistan, further adding to the tension. This border has over many years been one of the world ’s most politically explosive divisions and means the predominantly Pashtun Taliban have people on both sides, their tribe effectively split.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Taliban have never accepted the border but in 2017 the tension escalated further when Pakistan started its project of building huge razor -wire fences and watchtowers. It put a solid and armed border between the land the Taliban believe is theirs. This led to bloody clashes and the frequent emergency closure of crossing points at Torkham and Chaman.\n\nView 5 Images Pakistan soldier guards border bunker (Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nPutin blasts Ukraine with 500-bomb attack in defiance of US calls for war to end READ MORE :\n\nOPINION Chris Hughes Why Pakistan-Afghan war is most dangerous in decades and should be dreaded by all\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhy now?\n\nWhen the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021 the situation worsened.\n\nSince then there have been an estimated 75 major flare-ups , armed clashes between the two sides and Pakistan was growing impatient with the violence. In October 2025, Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey after a week of bloodshed on the border.\n\nThis latest flare-up has led to a crisis which will be difficult for both sides to climb down from since the Kabul government is run by the Afghan Taliban. Though previously more distinct from their Pakistani counterpart, which had greater al-Qaeda and world terror links, the Afghan Taliban are unlikely to clamp down on the armed fighters.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Police checks in Peshawar Pakistan (Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nThis is because whilst all of this has been going on in recent years Islamic State in the Khorasan, a regional franchise of ISIS has been poaching Taliban fighters. And sources say the Afghan Taliban are unlikely to punish the TTP, not just because of their links, but also because they do not want to drive them into the arms of ISIS in the Khorasan. And there have been many inter-jihadi clashes between the Afghan Taliban and ISIS over who dominates the region.\n\nAfghanistan launched an extensive cross-border attack into Pakistan along six provinces on Thursday night, in what it said was retaliation for Pakistani airstrikes on Afghanistan on Sunday. Pakistan had said those airstrikes had targeted and killed dozens of militants in Afghanistan, but Kabul said only civilians, including women and children, had been killed.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn response, Pakistan carried out airstrikes in the early hours of Friday on the Afghan capital and two other areas, Kandahar and Paktia. The border fighting, which had ceased by then, restarted and was continuing Friday.\n\nView 5 Images Taliban troops and artillery gun (Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCould international powers play a part?\n\nThe fighting has alarmed the international community, particularly as the area is one where other militant groups, including al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, still have a presence and have been trying to resurface. In October, Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia had facilitated talks between the sides. At the time, U.S. President Donald Trump had also weighed in, saying he intended to resolve the conflict \"very quickly.\" Whether he will do so again remains to be seen.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan spoke with his Pakistani, Afghan, Qatari and Saudi counterparts, a Turkish official said Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government policy.\n\nRussia has called for an immediate halt to the fighting and for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict, while Iran said it was ready to assist in facilitating dialogue.\n\nBecatoros contributed from Athens, Greece and Castillo from Beijing, China."

Make sure you understand the symptoms, learn who is most at risk, get fuel-burning appliances checked and get a CO alarm.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe alert comes as temperatures drop. When this happens, windows tend to be shut and the heating switched on leaving a potential unseen threat to seep into homes. It again stresses that while you cannot see, smell, or taste it, it can be deadly.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nA stark statistic reveals that in England and Wales, around 20 people die each year from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. And many more are admitted to the hospital as a result.\n\nIn England, 68% of carbon monoxide deaths happen in autumn and winter due to the cold and use of heating. This mix of more fuel-burning appliances in use and less fresh air can allow carbon monoxide to build to dangerous levels.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhat are the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning?\n\nBecause carbon monoxide is invisible and has no smell, recognising the symptoms is crucial. Watch out for:\n\nheadache\n\ndizziness\n\nfeeling or being sick\n\nfeeling weak\n\nconfusion\n\nchest and muscle pain\n\nshortness of breath\n\nIt warns: \"An important warning sign is symptoms coming and going, especially if they get worse when you're in a particular room or building and improve when you leave or go outside. If you notice this pattern, it could indicate a CO problem.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhere does carbon monoxide come from?\n\nView 3 Images Two key signs are a headache and feeling dizzy (Image: Getty)\n\nCommon household appliances can produce carbon monoxide if they're not installed properly, are faulty, or are poorly maintained.\n\nThese include:\n\n‌\n\n\n\ngas boilers\n\nstoves burning wood, kerosene, natural gas, or propane\n\nheaters using wood, oil, or natural gas\n\nThe experts stress that using portable generators, barbecues, or camping stoves indoors such as in homes, caravans, or tents, can cause carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. CO can even drift into tents from a smouldering barbecue outside, so always take a CO alarm when camping.\n\nGood ventilation is essential. If you run vehicles, generators, or engines in a garage or shed, keep a window or door open. While cooking, use an extractor fan or open a window to prevent CO from building up.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHow to stay safe\n\nThere are several straightforward steps you can take to protect yourself and your family.\n\nIt suggests that you read up on and remember the following:\n\nInstall CO alarms – the most important step to protect your home. Only 46% of homes in England had a CO alarm in 2020, leaving millions at risk.\n\nUse BS EN 50291-1 compliant alarms in every room with a fuel-burning appliance (gas boiler, coal fire, wood stove). This also applies to temporary homes like caravans and boats.\n\nTest alarms regularly and replace batteries when needed.\n\nLandlords must legally install CO alarms in any living space with a combustion appliance.\n\nUse ventilation wisely – proper airflow helps keep CO levels low.\n\nExtractor fans in kitchens significantly reduce carbon monoxide.\n\nAlways ensure good ventilation when cooking, using open fireplaces, wood stoves, or other fuel-burning appliances.\n\nVentilate enclosed spaces when running a generator or vehicle in a garage or shed.\n\nService your appliances annually. Have all gas appliances serviced every year by a Gas Safe registered engineer and get your chimney swept annually. Don't wait until something goes wrong.\n\nWatch for warning signs. 'Floppy' yellow or orange flames on gas appliances instead of crisp blue ones, soot marks around appliances, or increased condensation inside windows can all indicate a problem.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if I suspect CO poisoning?\n\nView 3 Images In England, 68% of carbon monoxide deaths happen in autumn and winter (Image: Getty)\n\nIf you think you might have carbon monoxide poisoning:\n\nStop using any appliances you think might be producing CO Open windows and doors to let fresh air in Go outside immediately Get medical advice as soon as possible Do not go back into the affected building until you've received professional advice\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIf you think a gas appliance is leaking carbon monoxide, call the free National Gas Helpline immediately on 0800 111 999. The service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nThe UKHSA concludes by stressing: \"Every carbon monoxide death is preventable. As we head into the colder months when risk is highest, take time this week to check your CO alarms.\"\n\nIt adds: \"Book appliance services if they're due, and make sure everyone in your household knows the symptoms to watch for. These simple actions could save your life or the life of someone you love.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

That’s why early identification and strong safeguards matter.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“At Nationwide, we know gambling can be a very emotionally charged activity, which is why we’ve deliberately built in a 72-hour cooling-off period for our gambling block – which offers an additional layer of protection and helps people to stay in control. No one should feel they have to face gambling harm alone – help is available, without judgment, whenever they need it.”\n\n'Hidden issue'\n\nRaminta Diliso, senior partnerships manager for the GamCare charity, said: “Gambling harm is often a very hidden issue, but the problems it can cause people can be significant.

Whilst this common condition is not usually a cause for concern, it may warrant a visit to your dentist or GP.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nKnown as Temporomandibular disorder, or TMD, the NHS explains that this condition affects jaw movement. It's typically not serious and generally resolves on its own.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhile it may improve with time, there are certain symptoms worth monitoring. Should these develop, you may need to consult your dentist if teeth grinding could be a factor, or speak to a GP.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhat are the symptoms of temporomandibular disorder?\n\nView 3 Images TMD can be very painful for some (Image: Getty)\n\nSymptoms of TMD include:\n\nPain around your jaw, ear and temple\n\nClicking, popping or grinding noises when you move your jaw\n\nA headache around your temples\n\nDifficulty opening your mouth fully\n\nYour jaw locking when you open your mouth\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe discomfort can worsen when chewing or during periods of stress.

Teeth grinding doesn't always have an obvious trigger, but it's most frequently associated with stress and anxiety.\n\nIf you grind your teeth whilst sleeping, you might not realise it, and this could be the underlying cause of your TMD. Teeth grinding can also be linked to sleep issues (such as snoring and sleep apnoea), certain medications including SSRIs, and lifestyle factors like smoking, high alcohol or caffeine consumption, and recreational drug use.\n\nIt's common in children and teenagers, particularly during sleep, and often resolves once they reach adulthood and their adult teeth come through.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTeeth grinding can happen while you're awake or asleep. As well as grinding your teeth and clenching your jaw, other symptoms can include:\n\nface, neck and shoulder pain\n\na painful jaw, which can lead to a condition called temporomandibular disorder (TMD)\n\nworn-down or broken teeth, which can cause increased sensitivity and loss of teeth and fillings\n\nheadaches\n\nearache\n\ndisturbed sleep\n\nHow to treat TMD at home\n\nView 3 Images You may need to see your dentist (Image: Getty)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTemporomandibular disorder (TMD) usually gets better without treatment.

You can call 111 or get help from 111 online.\"\n\nHow can a dentist or GP treat TMD?\n\nThe GP may suggest you take stronger painkillers. They may also advise you on relaxation techniques to reduce stress and ways to improve your sleep.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThey may also suggest you see a dentist if teeth grinding might be an issue. Other people they may suggest is a psychologist, if stress and anxiety are making your pain worse or a physiotherapist, for advice about jaw exercises and massage.\n\nShould a dentist be deemed the most appropriate option, they will likely advise a mouth guard or mouth splint.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on a whirlwind two-day trip of the Middle Eastern country after being invited by the director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWith the former Fab Four out on engagements at the same time, body language expert Judi James has decoded their simultaneous outings, revealing how the Prince and Princess of Wales seem in their element, making for an \"immersive and regal\" outing, while the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have leaned into the \"distinctly non-royal\" style.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 6 Images Judi James believes Harry and Meghan's visit to Jordan seems \"distinctly non-royal\" (Image: PA)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJudi told the Mirror : \"Kate and William are clearly aware of their royal brief despite a desire to show their immersive side and lower their own status signals in a desire to make the children they meet feel comfortable but not overwhelmed. Kate's outfit is stunning in a similar way that the late Queen's outfits were always chosen to make her stand out but without looking too fussy.\n\n\"Royal visits need to create memories for the people they meet, especially the children. They'll remember a magical experience for the rest of their lives, which means a requirement for the couple to look special. For Kate there is a signature blend of providing enough breath-taking memories with body language that defines that immersive, natural and unintimidating profile to go with her show-stopping styling.\n\nJudi continued: \"The pair ooze effortless elegance and status, which makes them appear to put effort into the kind of body lowering and status-diminishing rituals that will allow they people they meet to feel like the centre of attention. They appear focused on joining in play and other routines in a bid to show intense interest and to lift the mood with smiles and touches.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 6 Images Kate chatted to young children outside the Hanging Gardens today (Image: PA)\n\nWhen it comes to Harry and Meghan, however, Judi James believes that the couple seem more comfortable with the more laid-back approach to their trip, while presenting themselves more as philanthropists than as royal members.\n\n\"For Harry and Meghan there appears to be a concerted effort to use distinctly non-royal styling here,\" Judi explained. \"Their outfits are casual, creased, functional and overall unremarkable. This is not a visually memorable look that might suggest someone special had been visiting, but their body language looks honed to signal empathy, sympathy and a more campaigning attitude.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Meghan's facial expressions with her eyes widened to register pain and concern look like an appeal to highlight the distress and suffering she is seeing and hearing about. Harry is even more dramatic, placing a hand on his heart as his knees seem to almost buckle at what he is hearing and being shown. \"\n\nWilliam and Kate were in Powys on Thursday to celebrate the Welsh community ahead of St David’s Day. Their first stop was The Hanging Gardens, which is focused on resilience and creativity, in Llanidloes.\n\n6 View 6 Images William and Kate wore daffodils, the national flower of Wales (Image: PA) 6 View 6 Images The Prince and Princess of Wales were celebrate the lead up to St David's Day (Image: PA)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe royal couple met with volunteers who run the centre and participate in some of the workshops and activities on offer, including preparations for St David’s Day on Sunday. Following the visit, William and Kate travelled to Oriel Davies, a public contemporary art gallery based in Newtown.\n\nWilliam and Kate then met a Welsh language learners group, before heading to Hafan yr Afon – a hub for culture, community and heritage in Newtown, where William and Kate attended a celebration of volunteer groups and community champions in the county.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales’ engagements come after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made an unexpected trip to Jordan for a whirlwind two-day visit. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex started their visit by joining a roundtable discussion hosted by the World Health Organisation with individuals from major leading bodies like the United Nations.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 6 Images Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have wrapped up their two-day trip to Jordan (Image: PA)\n\nPhilip Hall, British Ambassador to Jordan, thanked the Sussexes for travelling to the Middle East, saying: “So I would simply say thank you very much indeed for coming. Your visit, your support, your appreciation of the efforts that the United Nations, including of course, the World Health Organisation, the government of Jordan and others, are making here is enormously appreciated. So thank you for coming.”\n\nThe couple travelled to Jordan at the invitation of the WHO’s director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. On the first day of their visit, the Duke and Duchess watched a music class at the QuestScope youth centre at Za'atari refugee camp near Mafraq, and took part in a football kickabout where Meghan accepted a gift from a young girl. The Duchess of Sussex was left with bragging rights when she scored a penalty and her husband’s shot was saved when they joined Syrian children at a refugee camp.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOn day two of their visit to the Middle East, the couple visited the headquarters of the World Central Kitchen where it co-ordinates and deploys a million hot meals across Gaza every day. World Central Kitchen was the first philanthropic partnership established by Harry and Meghan through Archewell, and they remain active supporters of the organisation.\n\nView 6 Images The Sussexes undertook several engagements on the trip to various charities (Image: PA)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAfterwards, the Sussexes stopped off for an emotional visit to a centre that helps addicts. They spoke to patients at the National Centre for Rehabilitation of Addicts, with Harry urging a group of recovered addicts to go back to their communities and help others, telling them: “There’s no shame in having an addiction.”\n\nDuring the visit the couple were invited to write messages of support, with Harry’s message on a sticky-note, left on a wall with others, saying: “It’s ok to not be ok. Trust each other. Congratulations on your recovery. Now share your courage and experience.” Meghan wrote in italic script: “Congratulations on your dedication to your care. Wishing you continued healing and happiness.”"

Canada, we own you little bro.\"\n\nTkachuk is captain of the Ottawa Senators and after playing in the Canadian team's first NHL game since the Olympics, he said: \"Well, it's clearly fake, because it's not my voice, not my lips moving.\n\n\"I'm not in control of any of those accounts,\" he added. \"I know that those words would never come out of my mouth, so I can't do anything about it.\n\n\"It's not what I was saying. I would never say that. It's not who I am. So I guess I don't like that video.\"\n\nSeveral of Tkachuk's team-mates have also apologised for laughing during a congratulatory call from Donald Trump, when the US president said he \"probably would be impeached\" if he did not invite the gold-winning women's team as well as the men to his State of the Union address .\n\nWhile the women's captain Hilary Knight said Trump's joke was \"distasteful\", she added that \"the guys were in a tough spot\" and there was a \"genuine level of support and respect\" between the two US teams.\n\nTkachuk's brother Matthew Tkachuk, who plays for the Florida Panthers, said the teams were \"so close\" at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\n\"We watched other events together, we went and supported,\" he said. \"We love the women's team and the women's team loved us, and we're so proud that we had a clean sweep of gold medals.\"\n\nUS team-mate Jake Sanderson said the laughter had been \"a bit of a mistake\" that \"got blown out of proportion a little bit\", while reserve goaltender Jeremy Swayman said \"we should've reacted differently\" and Charlie McAvoy added it was \"not reflective of how we feel\"."

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980. The bout was competitive, but Arguello scored the 11th-round knockout to retain his WBC super featherweight title.\n\nCastillo would lose his next bout, too, dropping a unanimous decision to Mexican legend Salvador Sanchez after leading the first six rounds.\n\nCastillo later lost to Julio Cesar Chavez in 1985 as the iconic boxer scored a sixth-round knockout at the Forum in Los Angeles.\n\nRuben Castillo (L) throws a punch against Julio Cesar Chavez during the fight at the LA Forum\n\nBoxer Ruben 'the Conquistador' Castillo has passed away at 68, according to the World Boxing Council.

'Definitely world championship material in a different era.

'Great stuff.'\n\nHe also had a reputation as a positive influence on many young fighters and fans.\n\n'A great man,' his nephew wrote on Facebook. 'Both him and his family were a great part of my childhood. He always gave great advice, would be there when ya needed him. Going to parties at his place, doing golf charity events. He def was the neighborhood Uncle for alot of us.\n\nCastillo later served as an announcer on many WBC fights from the Forum in Los Angeles\n\n'A Family man, Boxer, Charity planner, we lost. Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God. May his wife Cindy, family and friends find comfort with the support of the so many who loved Ruben. Rest in eternal peace.'"

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\n\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "Back in May when Mikel Arteta was nursing the pain of mishandling another title race, losing out to Liverpool, and wondering if his side are forever destined to be a bridesmaid and not a bride, he would scarcely have believed the situation he and Arsenal find themselves in now.\n\nThey are top of the Premier League with 10 games to go with destiny in their hands and the UEFA Champions League draw has presented what can only be described as a golden opportunity to go ahead and land an historic league-Europe double.\n\nThis is as close to a dream scenario as Arteta could have hoped for.\n\nBy the time it came to drawing the final tie they had a 50-50 chance of ending up in the silver half of the bracket which already contained reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain, Club World Cup winners Chelsea, defending Premier League champions Liverpool, Spanish heavyweights Real Madrid, familiar foe Manchester City, as well as dangerous outside bets in Galatasaray and Atalanta.\n\nInstead they know now their route to the final is Bayer Leverkusen in the last-16, the winner of Bodo/Glimt, who are at this stage for the very first time, and Sporting Lisbon in the quarter-finals, before a semi-final against one of Newcastle United, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, or Tottenham. It won't be Tottenham.\n\nArsenal could be lifting the Champions League at the end of the season after their dream draw\n\nBodo/Glimt have beaten Manchester City on their own patch and knocked out last season's finalists Inter Milan over two legs. But excitement should be through the roof in London Colney this morning.\n\nThe snap reaction to the draw made for fascinating viewing across the continent.\n\nThere was a sense of devilment in France after PSG drew Chelsea, who they lost to in the Club World Cup final over the summer, with daily sports newspaper L'Equipe running the headline: 'The time for revenge'.\n\nAcross in Spain, with three teams all drawn against English opposition, the reaction was markedly mixed.\n\nFrustration in one half of Madrid as Real Madrid, for the 10th and 11th time in five seasons, take on Manchester City in a 'scalding' draw. On the other side of the City, Atletico Madrid supporters rejoiced at getting a visit from 'Dr Tottenham'.\n\nFor Barcelona, who drew Newcastle United, it was little more than a shrug of the shoulders for what they see as the 'least tough' draw.\n\nIvan Rakitic pulls out Arsenal's name on the ideal side of the draw for Mikel Arteta's men\n\nWhat this draw did do was pave a path for the Ballon d'Or contenders and in a season where Champions League and the World Cup will hold the most weight - domestic records never seem to interest voters in these cycles - the stars are aligning for the likes of Declan Rice and Harry Kane.\n\nFor Kane, he has the difficult path, needing to go through Atalanta, then either Real Madrid or Manchester City, just to book a semi-final with potentially defending champions PSG.\n\nFor Rice, this may be his greatest ever opportunity with a Premier League title, Champions League title, and a World Cup all still in his sights.\n\nFor both to meet in the final in Budapest, with all the marbles pushed to the middle of the table as they both chase their first ever Champions League title, may have seemed a somewhat remote prospect. Not any more. The stars have aligned.\n\nNATHAN'S UCL PREDICTION\n\nLast-16:\n\nPSG v Chelsea - PSG win\n\nGalatasaray v Liverpool - Liverpool win\n\nReal Madrid v Man City - Man City win\n\nAtalanta v Bayern Munich - Bayern Munich win\n\nNewcastle Utd v Barcelona - Barcelona win\n\nAtletico Madrid v Tottenham Hotspur - Atletico Madrid win\n\nBodo/Glimt v Sporting Lisbon - Bodo/Glimt win\n\nBayer Leverkusen v Arsenal - Arsenal win\n\nQuarter-finals:\n\nPSG v Liverpool - PSG win\n\nMan City v Bayern Munich - Bayern Munich win\n\nBarcelona v Atletico Madrid - Atletico Madrid win\n\nBodo/Glimt v Arsenal - Arsenal win\n\nSemi-finals:\n\nPSG v Bayern Munich - Bayern Munich win\n\nAtletico Madrid v Arsenal - Arsenal win\n\nFinal:\n\nBayern Munich v Arsenal - Bayern Munich win"

            "content": "As they climbed the metal staircase behind the Main Stand at Kenilworth Road, a Luton supporter’s spectacles slipped from the top of her head and clanged against the steel.\n\n‘Excuse me, you dropped your glasses,’ said the gentleman behind her, who stooped to collect and return them. ‘Could have done you a favour,’ he added with a grin. ‘You don’t want to watch this, clearly.’\n\nI shuffled up the steps beside them to join 3,500 Luton fans for their EFL Trophy quarter-final against Plymouth on Tuesday to get a feeling for the fan frustration that, just three days earlier, led to manager Jack Wilshere being restrained by his own players amid a furious confrontation with a supporter.\n\nOn Saturday, two years to the day since Luton led at Anfield in the Premier League, they conceded a stoppage-time equaliser to struggling Burton Albion that left the Hatters six points adrift of the League One play-offs and a toxic divide between the club and its fans reached boiling point.\n\nAs the team made their way towards the tunnel, with boos and foul language ringing in their ears, Wilshere first held back his own captain Kal Naismith before turning towards a fan at the front of the stand. Videos later plastered over social media showed Wilshere appearing to say ‘shut your f***ing mouth’ before being led away down the tunnel.\n\nMultiple witnesses have told Daily Mail Sport that the fan directed personal abuse at Wilshere. One source described it as ‘unrepeatable, vicious and obscene’ while another called it ‘something you would never say in the street’. At least one member of club staff took it upon themselves to call Wilshere early the next morning to check in on him.\n\nLuton Town manager Jack Wilshere had to be restrained by his own players amid a furious confrontation with a supporter\n\nMultiple witnesses have told Daily Mail Sport that the fan directed personal abuse at Wilshere. One source described it as ‘unrepeatable, vicious and obscene’\n\nYou know things have gone wrong somewhere when a fan is throwing abuse at a young coach who started his playing career at Luton aged eight, grew up a few miles down the road, and returned to train with the club before hanging up his boots.\n\nSo, why such anger? Luton are unbeaten in 11 home league games and, if they win their game in hand on Huddersfield, would be three points off the play-offs. Their victory over Plymouth, having been reinstated into the competition after Swindon Town fielded two ineligible players against them, has them a home win against Northampton Town next week from Wembley.\n\nFor a start, supporters are struggling to embrace Wilshere’s style of play. The Arsene Wenger disciple wants his team to get it down and pass it, as his Arsenal Under 18s did to great effect, but this is a club that reached its heights on fast-paced blood and thunder under Rob Edwards.\n\nJust 97 seconds had passed against Burton when midfielder George Saville passed back to centre half Mads Andersen and the first boos sounded. And on Tuesday as Luton fumbled at the back under pressure from Plymouth’s front line, a furious cry of ‘Get it out! It’s tippy-tappy AGAIN!’ echoed from the back of the Main Stand.\n\nWilshere has talked about forging an identity, and a desire not to 'pass the ball around the back just to pass it around the back’, but six away defeats on the spin and unsuccessfully sitting on their narrow lead against Burton pushed them to tipping point.\n\n‘My message to them is point their anger towards me,’ said Wilshere after a loss to Wigan in the previous game. ‘I'm their manager, I make the decisions.’ So, they did.\n\nClub sources insist Saturday’s incident was a one-off. Wilshere has been happy to speak with fans after games about their frustrations, as he did after a draw at Leyton Orient, but on this occasion felt he had no choice but to react to personal abuse.\n\nLuton’s issues lie much deeper than Wilshere. He’s the third manager in less than a year for a club that has suffered back-to-back relegations, the second of which came on the final day of last season when they shipped five to West Brom and went down on goal difference.\n\nLuton’s issues lie much deeper than Wilshere. He’s the third manager in less than a year for a club that has suffered back-to-back relegations\n\nLuton are unbeaten in 11 home league games and, if they win their game in hand, would be three points off the play-offs\n\nLEAGUE ONE PLAY-OFF RACE Team Pl W D L GD Pts 1 Cardiff 33 21 6 6 28 69 2 Lincoln 33 20 8 5 28 68 3 Bolton 34 15 13 6 12 58 4 Bradford 33 17 7 9 6 58 5 Stockport 33 16 8 9 5 56 6 Huddersfield 34 15 7 12 10 52 7 Reading 33 12 12 9 5 48 8 Stevenage 32 13 9 10 1 48 9 Wycombe 33 12 11 10 10 47 10 LUTON 33 13 7 13 2 46\n\n‘In many ways, Jack is just caught in the crossfire of it all,’ Kevin Harper of the Luton Supporters' Trust tells Daily Mail Sport.\n\n‘Some of his decision-making has been questionable and some of the football we’ve played has been hard to watch. But Jack isn’t the root of the problem.\n\n‘We’ve gone from the Premier League to 10th in League One in 18 months and there is an awful lack of communication from those above as to why this happened.\n\n'We don’t get relegated twice without making errors, certainly not with the financial windfalls from the Premier League. The fans just feel like they’re being taken a little for granted.’\n\nChief executive Gary Sweet insisted in September after a poor start under Matt Bloomfield that reaching the play-offs was the ‘absolute minimum’ and automatic promotion still the target... yet hired a young, inexperienced coach a month later in Wilshere.\n\nThey considered Leyton Orient boss Richie Wellens, a more experienced manager, but plumped for Wilshere after being impressed with his ‘energy’, ‘ambition’ and ‘passion’ across four interviews.\n\nSo, while Wilshere’s project clearly needs time, the club is telling fans to demand instant results in another breath. And when you’re at a club that has gone from non-League to the very top and back down again so quickly, it can be hard to readjust your expectations when faced with the reality.\n\nClub insiders talk of a much-needed culture change. One source described Luton as an ‘oil tanker’ that needs turning around. There’s been a huge overhaul of players, so much so that five of the 12 players on the club’s 2026 calendar are now out on loan, but too many of the arrivals failed to hit the ground running.\n\nLuton considered more experienced managers but plumped for Wilshere after being impressed with his ‘energy’, ‘ambition’ and ‘passion’ across four interviews\n\nWhile Wilshere’s project clearly needs time, the club is telling fans to demand instant results in another breath\n\nAnother source remarked that the squad was previously full of players who thought they were ‘too good for the Championship after a half-decent Premier League season’.\n\nLuton are set to move into a new 25,000 stadium at Power Court for the 2028-29 season yet there’s feeling among the fans that the club have prioritised that much-needed development over the football (despite having the biggest budget in League One).\n\nBehind the scenes, Wilshere has made a start on turning the tanker around. Insiders say the atmosphere at the training ground has improved greatly since his arrival, with players sticking around to play pool and darts after sessions when in recent years they couldn’t wait to get out the door.\n\nWhen staff called Wilshere the morning after his confrontation, he was already at the training ground. He slept some nights on a bed in his office. His players’ phones ping late into the night with his WhatsApp messages. Staff have asked Wilshere, half-jokingly, if he was seeing his family enough.\n\nHe's ordered striker Elijah Adebayo, out with a long-term knee injury, to report to his office once a week as Wilshere knows only too well the importance of being kept involved when you’re on the sidelines. The night after the Plymouth game, he gave a lecture at the University of Bedfordshire.\n\nAll of this means little to fans, of course, if that work ethic still leads to performances like Burton.\n\n‘Luton see the football team very much as part of the town,’ adds Harper. ‘We’re a hard-working town and all we expect on a Saturday afternoon is that our team works really hard. In the last three league games, that wasn’t the case.’\n\nWilshere’s tenure has already shown how quickly things can change. He lost his first game to Mansfield Town but then won four on the spin, including a victory at then-leaders Stockport County when the fans sang his name.\n\nThere’s feeling among the fans that the club have prioritised the new 25,000-seat stadium project at Power Court over the football\n\nWilshere lost his first game to Mansfield Town but then won four on the spin, including victory at leaders Stockport County when the fans sang his name\n\nThey cheered the team off after a brilliant home win against Bradford this month, their best performance of the season, before their recent ugly run.\n\nBy the end of Tuesday night, the mood had lifted a touch again. A more dominant, attacking performance over Plymouth, albeit one requiring a late Jordan Clark penalty to win it after a calamitous error while, you guessed it, playing out from the back gifted the visitors an equaliser.\n\nThe last 18 months have hurt the bond between club and fanbase and now, at the heart of it, is a young coach trying to stitch it back together his way.\n\nWilshere once asked Mikel Arteta when he knew he was ready to take his first job in management. Arteta replied: ‘You just have to jump in and swim as hard as you can.’"

            "content": "The release of the latest season of Netflix's Drive to Survive has revealed the poignant moment former Red Bull team principal Christian Horner broke the news of his sacking to his Spice Girl wife Geri Halliwell.\n\nThe long-serving team boss was deposed midway through the 2025 season amid a suspected power struggle at the Thai-Austrian constructor, one year on from his sex texting scandal which set the Formula One world alight.\n\nHorner eventually left the team in July after receiving an £80million package, but while his departure sent shockwaves through the motorsport community, behind-the-scenes insight has revealed that Halliwell had an ominous inkling that her husband's Red Bull days were numbered.\n\nFootage in the docu-series' Red Bull-centric episode showed Horner opening up to his wife at the table in their kitchen's conservatory, with the 52-year-old starting the conversation with a downbeat 'hey darling'.\n\n'All... all done and dusted,' Horner confirmed as he kissed Halliwell on the forehead, before sitting down at the table and accepting a waiting latte.\n\nHalliwell looked visibly emotional as Horner gave her the scant details of his meeting, before asking: 'How do you feel?'\n\nChristian Horner was consoled by his wife Geri Halliwell after his shock Red Bull sacking\n\nThe former Spice Girl looked visibly emotional as her husband recounted how the team swung the axe after 20 years\n\n'How do I feel?' Horner wondered aloud. 'Um... I never imagined to be in this position.\n\n'Of course your immediate reaction when you get delivered a s*** sandwich like that is, like, f*** them. I've had something taken away from me that wasn't my choice, that was very precious to me.\n\n'But you thought it was going to happen. We came back from that Austria race and I remember you sat on the bed one night and went \"Something really bad's gonna happen\".'\n\nHalliwell confirmed that she had said that they were going to 'fire' her husband.\n\nScenes from the episode later showed Halliwell and Horner watching a race on television - a hitherto unusual way of experiencing raceday for the former team principal, who had held his role since 2005.\n\n'You haven't got any of the data here really!' Horner complained. 'Well, normally I would have a whole bunch of noise in my ears. So it's like you're blind.'\n\nHalliwell admitted that she now felt 'a bit sad watching this' as her eyes filled with tears.\n\nHalliwell, 53, was a semi-regular fixture on race weekend alongside her husband, often appearing in the paddock at the start and end of the season as well as at proximate races such as the British Grand Prix.\n\nLater in the episode the couple took the unusual decision to watch a race from their home\n\nThe moment was captured at Horner's luxurious mansion in Oxfordshire by Netflix's cameras\n\nHalliwell and Horner were frequent fixtures in the paddock throughout their relationship\n\nWhen in February 2024, the paddock was stunned by a leaked cache of suggestive messages purporting to be from Horner, Halliwell flew to Bahrain to take her husband's side.\n\nHorner was later accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour by a female member of staff, with an internal investigation led by KCs twice clearing him of wrongdoing. Halliwell supported him throughout.\n\nBack at their Cotswolds home, Halliwell tried to lift the mood by suggesting that Horner might be trying to 'eat his feelings'.\n\nIn improved spirits, the pair later horsed around by their swimming pool, with Horner pretending to be on the brink of throwing Halliwell in, before she admonished him, saying: 'You're such a t**t.'\n\nThe episode also saw Horner explain who he believes is responsible for his sacking, after speculation at the time suggested that star driver Max Verstappen and his father Jos may have played their roles.\n\n'His father has never been my biggest fan,' Horner admitted when asked if it had been the Verstappens who wielded the axe. 'He's been outspoken about me.\n\n'But I don't believe the Verstappens were responsible in any way. I think this was a decision that was made by Oliver Mintzlaff with Helmut (Marko) advising from the sideline.\n\n'Ultimately things changed within the business, the group, the founder died and after Dietrich [Mateschitz's] death I was probably deemed to have too much control.'\n\nIn the months since his sacking, Horner has eyed a return to the sport, sharing last week that he felt he had 'unfinished business in the sport' amid swirling links to rival constructors including Aston Martin.\n\n'But I am not going to come back for just anything,' Horner clarified at the European Motorshow in Dublin. 'I am only going to come back for something that can win.\n\n\n\n'I don't want to go back in the paddock unless I have something to do. I miss the sport, I miss the people, I miss the team that I built.'"

            "content": "Tom Brady mocked for 'embarrassing' fawning over Gianni Infantino as sycophantic sports stars line up to praise FIFA president\n\nFootball legends have been mocked for their 'sycophantic' praise of FIFA president Gianni Infantino 10 years on from his election.\n\nThrough their social media channels, FIFA posted fawning tributes to the controversial figurehead from some big names, including Tom Brady.\n\nThe Birmingham City co-owner and NFL icon said: 'I think Gianni is a man of the people and he's always out there celebrating the great parts of the sport. I think he's made great contributions to the world of football.'\n\nBrady's 'man of the people' line riled up a number of supporters, particularly in light of the exorbitant ticket prices at this year's World Cup.\n\nTickets to group games in next year's tournament hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico are three times more expensive than in the previous World Cup.\n\nThe cheapest seats at the final will cost £3,129 and there has been a huge backlash from fans - with Infantino insisting the prices simply reflect 'absolutely crazy' public demand.\n\nFIFA shared a number of tributes to Gianni Infantino, including one from NFL legend, Tom Brady\n\nBrady's praise led to one fan writing: 'That you had to make this montage of sycophancy then publicly post it, says more about Mr Infantino and the world's view of him than you appear to realise.'\n\nAnother posted: 'Tom Brady will literally shill for anyone at this point. Fanatics. Saudi flag football. FIFA. Doesn't matter.\n\n'Now he's calling Gianni Infantino a \"man of the people\" while World Cup tickets cost a mortgage payment and FIFA is wrapped in controversy.'\n\nThat was a sentiment also echoed by the comment: 'His \"man of the people\" Infantino has overseen a ticket price increase so drastic that most Americans won't be able to afford attending a World Cup in their own back yard. Literally would have been cheaper to go to the Euros, flights included.'\n\nOthers labelled the praise 'embarrassing' and a few claimed the FIFA president is worse than his disgraced predecessor, Sepp Blatter.\n\nThe love-in was not just limited to Brady. Francesco Totti was included in the compilation of praise, writing: 'He's an amazing person, a hard worker, someone who always wants to do his best for football. We're talking about a genuine competitive, well-rounded person, someone who is always available, always there for everyone.'\n\nLegendary Spanish defender Carlos Puyol added: 'I think he's doing a great job. He's trying to get football to grow.'\n\nAnd German World Cup winner Lothar Matthäus said: 'You can tell that he's very, very close to football, not only in his head but above all his heart. He's emotionally involved and it's wonderful, of course, that the president of a world association carries this sport in his heart like that.'\n\nInfantino, pictured this week during a trip to Colombia in a personalised hat, has been at the helm for a decade and FIFA's X account posted praise of their leader\n\nInfantino rarely misses an opportunity for self-promotion and the praise of his leadership was posted out to FIFA's 14.9 million followers on X.\n\nIt wasn't just former players gushing over the FIFA president. PSG head honcho Nasser Al-Khelaïfi wrote: 'Our FIFA Club World Cup, that's a huge success for me. Around $2billion in revenue in less than one year, so it was a big success for the clubs and for FIFA.'\n\nInfantino has been a divisive character during his decade in charge. He has been repeatedly criticised for his cozy relationship with US president Donald Trump, especially during the Club World Cup and World Cup draw, during which he awarded him a peace prize.\n\nThis week, Infantino batted down questions around Mexico's ability to co-host the World Cup this summer with cartel violence ripping through the country.\n\nChaos has engulfed Mexico in recent days after the army killed one of the world's most notorious drug lords, Nemesio 'El Mencho' Oseguera Cervantes.\n\nThat sparked a wave of retaliation across the country and forced the country's football federation to postpone a number of games over recent days.\n\nMexico is slated to host 13 games across three cities - Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey - including the curtain raiser in Mexico City on June 11.\n\nFrancesco Totti was another 'FIFA legend' to share a tribute, calling him an 'amazing person'\n\nBut amid fears for fans' safety, Infantino insisted this week that FIFA is 'convinced everything will turn out for the best.'\n\n'I want to say from the outset that we have complete confidence in Mexico, in president [Claudia] Sheinbaum, in the authorities, and we are convinced that everything will turn out for the best.\n\n'From my side and from FIFA's side, I have absolute confidence in Sheinbaum.\n\n\n\n'We are in regular contact with the authorities, and we are, in any case, monitoring the situation. The World Cup is going to be an incredible celebration.'"

'To Tottenham, just like at one time I was linked to Espanyol, or to other clubs.\n\n'In the end, especially because of my past at those clubs, when things aren't going well, people tend to fall back on emotions and say, \"Well, with Mauricio we played good football,\" or whatever it may be.\n\nMauricio Pochettino has not entirely stamped out speculation that he could one day return to Tottenham as head coach\n\n'But no. We're focused on the World Cup, on the United States. My contract runs until after the World Cup, so after that we'll see what might happen.\n\n'Open to everything, right?'\n\nPochettino was invariably one of the names that sprung to mind following Frank's departure at the start of the month, despite his ongoing preparations with the US national team.\n\nBut while an immediate appointment would have been impossible, the manager is out of contract after the tournament, and believed to be interested in a return to club football in the future.\n\nPochettino also remains based in England, which could further factor into his decision when he plots his next move.\n\nHe has made no secret of his ongoing connection to Tottenham too, where he oversaw a run to the Champions League final in 2018, and a second-place finish in the Premier League one season earlier.\n\nBut Daily Mail Sport revealed earlier this week that as of yet, no formal nor informal contact has taken place between the two parties about a summer appointment.\n\n\n\nSince leaving the club nearly seven years ago, Pochettino has managed Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, before joining up with the US team in September 2024."

            "content": "AARON WAN-BISSAKA INTERVIEW: I was at my lowest point at Manchester United - I was lonely, homesick and went back to London almost every day. Then Erik ten Hag's mixed messages left me totally confused\n\nUnlock more of the best of our journalism with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight and the writers you love every day\n\nInside a private cinema room on the ground floor of a modern apartment block in Canary Wharf, Aaron Wan-Bissaka is enjoying something rarely afforded to professional footballers: a moment of peace and quiet.\n\nIt is his day off. Dressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, he sinks into a plush seat with the same composed demeanour that has defined his game. Afterwards, he says with a smile, the plan is simple: take a nap.\n\nThat understated presence has long shaped Wan-Bissaka’s identity, a player more comfortable letting performances speak for themselves than seeking attention. Now with West Ham after a formative spell at Manchester United, he is in reflective mood, revisiting a journey that has carried him from London estates to Old Trafford and back again.\n\nAs the conversation unfolds, the story is as much about family and sacrifice as it is about football. Long before the bright lights of the Premier League, Wan-Bissaka’s football education began on the patch of grass outside his childhood home.\n\n'I was probably age five when I first fell in love with football,' he says. 'It was just me and my brother in the estate playing around with a ball. We would go out to the green opposite our house to play. We'd call it our Wembley.\n\n'It didn’t really click until around 16, when I realised there was a genuine chance of becoming a professional. That’s when I saw the opportunity to put my foot down and properly chase the dream.'\n\nDressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, Aaron Wan-Bissaka is in reflective mood when he meets Daily Mail Sport\n\nThough Wan-Bissaka grew up idolising Thierry Henry, he has grown into a highly dependable, no-nonsense full back\n\nLike many London kids of his generation, his first football idol was Thierry Henry. 'I always wanted to be him,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'Honestly, I used to have this vision on me being him, and growing up to be that sort of player. He was my idol. I think it was because of his composure. He scored lots of goals but he also carried the team. He was a leader. My whole family were Arsenal fans when I was growing up, too.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s boyhood dream contrasts with his reputation as a no-nonsense defender, and the 28-year-old’s career was ultimately forged through family resilience and a demanding relationship with his father.\n\n'I didn't realise how much my parents were sacrificing for my dream to begin with,' he says. 'When I got into secondary school, which is the age when you start to want things like trainers and boots, I was quite demanding. But they would brush it aside and be like, \"You have to wait a couple of months\". That's when I realised that it wasn't easy for my parents to give me the things I was asking for.\n\n'They worked cleaning jobs to afford my boots and my dad would get in trouble for leaving work early to bring me to training.'\n\nHis father Ambrose’s influence came through discipline rather than praise. 'It was difficult because there was a language barrier between us. His English wasn't great and my French wasn't great so there were only a few words exchanged at times,' recalls Wan-Bissaka, who has now played nine times for the country of his father's birth, DR Congo. They will face either New Caledonia or Jamaica next month in FIFA's inter-confederation play-offs in Zapopan, Mexico, for a place at this summer's World Cup.\n\n'We mainly spoke about football. But he was always critiquing me or telling me what I could do better. It was never praise. I have to say, I found it confusing at the time. I always wondered why he wouldn't praise me. I used to question myself: \"Am I not doing enough?\"'\n\n'Even after I scored, I would come off the pitch and he wouldn't be pleased. I used to just think to myself, \"Is one goal not enough?\" But then as I got older I started to understand it. He just wanted me to test myself and become the best version of myself.'\n\nAfter taking to Premier League life with ease at Crystal Palace, where he won player of the year in his first full season in senior football, a £50million move to United soon followed. It was the biggest step of Wan-Bissaka's career - and one of the most challenging periods of his life.\n\nWan-Bissaka felt extremely homesick after making a big-money move to Manchester United. 'Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep,' he admits\n\nThe defender's positive relationship with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a source of reassurance. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well,' says Wan-Bissaka of his former boss\n\n'When I moved to United, I really missed home, my family and friends especially,' he reveals. 'After training, I used to take the train back to London almost every day. It’s only about two hours, but it’s still a big commitment, and eventually it became exhausting, so I knew I had to stop.\n\n'It was something I wasn’t used to at all. I’d always been comfortable at home in London, surrounded by familiar people and places, so for everything to change overnight was difficult to adapt to. Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep. I struggled. It was probably the lowest I’d felt.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s big-money arrival from Palace in 2019 - which coincided with a first England call-up, though he was never capped due to injury - came with a mountain of expectation. But he quickly became a fixture in the United XI, starting more matches than any player across Europe’s top-five leagues in 2020-21.\n\nHis early relationship with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer offered reassurance amid his struggles off the pitch.\n\n'My relationship with Ole was good from the start,' he recalls. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well, and I think the rest of the players felt the same about him. He’s the kind of manager who backs you straight away. Once he gives you a job to do, it’s up to you to trust yourself and go out and deliver it.'\n\nManagerial turnover would later test that security, particularly under Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag.\n\n'Obviously, it’s football, every manager has their preferences,' he says. 'They might like you or they might not, and that’s just part of the game. When he (Rangnick) came in, it wasn’t the best period for me and there was a lot of criticism around…\n\n'It was difficult when Erik ten Hag arrived - as soon as he did, he told me I wasn’t in his plans. But when I tried to leave, he said he didn’t want me to go. I couldn't understand it. That was tough mentally, because it left me wondering what I was supposed to do next.\n\nWan-Bissaka initially struggled to gel as effectively with Solskjaer's successors, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag\n\nHis relationship with Ten Hag ultimately improved, and the pair lifted the Carabao Cup with United in 2023\n\n'I just kept my head down and told myself to keep training, keep improving, and play my game. Staying motivated was hard though, especially when you’re training without the clear goal of playing.\n\n'But the people around me guided me in the right way and encouraged me to keep going. Eventually things turned around and started to improve. You could say I changed or developed tactically under him, because that was something he wanted.'\n\nClarity, he says, is invaluable. And something the right back received from Michael Carrick. He speaks highly of United's recently-appointed interim boss, praising the simplicity of his messaging during his previous caretaker spell in 2021.\n\nNo wonder, then, that he backs Carrick to be given the permanent job after such an impressive start second time around.\n\n'He's someone you can trust,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'He will also trust you back if you buy into him and what he's looking to do. If you trust him, he will trust you.\n\n'He was quite simple in what he wanted from you. The boys were happy with him and the games he had when he was the manager. With him back at the club now, they are in a good place as a team. I think he should be given the full-time role. I think he deserves it.'\n\nIf Manchester represented pressure and growth, West Ham has provided renewal. The move back to London offered proximity to family and a fresh football environment.\n\nHis impressive form in his debut season saw him named 'Hammer of the Year' in May, beating out fan favourite Jarrod Bowen to the award.\n\nWan-Bissaka opens up to Daily Mail Sport's Charlotte Daly about his career - both the highs and the lows\n\n'At West Ham, I’ve been really happy with how things have been going,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'You can probably tell from the smile on my face'\n\nThough the club have struggled this season - sitting in the relegation zone with 11 games to go, despite an upturn in form under Nuno Espirito Santo - he has no regrets about making the move.\n\n'I was in two minds (about moving initially), to be honest,' he says. 'I had a year left on my contract, but I felt I needed to get back on my feet and start playing regularly - not just every couple of games.\n\n'Looking back on my time at Manchester United, I’m grateful for it. Those experiences made me who I am today and helped me both on and off the pitch, especially mentally.\n\n\n\n'With all the noise and scrutiny at a club like United, a change of environment can make a big difference. At West Ham, it’s not as intense… I’ve been really happy with how things have been going. You can probably tell from the smile on my face every day. I am playing with a smile too.'"

But he won the British cruiserweight title last year and will attempt to add the European belt in April when he faces Mateusz Masternak on the undercard of Derek Chisora's fight with Deontay Wilder.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGarcia also has a significant online following having been friends with KSI's bitter rival Jake Paul. And while Viddal recognised Garcia's own pedigree, he argued the American is one of a kind. \"You can call Ryan Garcia the first YouTuber boxing world champion because he's someone who had again an extensive amateur background and ended up making videos,\" he said.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR FIGHTING FB PAGE! Latest boxing and MMA news, analysis and much more via our dedicated Facebook page\n\nFrank Warren takes brutal dig at Conor Benn after Eddie Hearn split READ MORE :\n\nDenzel Bentley calls for Janibek Alimkhanuly to be stripped of world title READ MORE :\n\n\"He has a crazy amount of followers, wasn't taken seriously and now he's a WBC world champion. So I think it's fair to say that Ryan Garcia is the first streamer/YouTuber boxing world champion and I think in due time I'll probably be the second because I always feel like it's me and Ryan that do similar things.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRiley used to shun his social media background but has learned to embrace it and last year became the face of Misfits Pro, the professional arm of the social media boxing company formed by KSI.\n\n\"I felt like I was trying to prove a point,\" added Riley. \"I couldn't shake the fact I spent time with KSI and Jake Paul and Logan Paul and it's like people just wouldn't let it go. It was just like a stain like you couldn't get rid of and instead of trying to always squeeze into a room where you don't feel like you're fitting in, a room was created for me.\n\n\"I always take my own room over trying to squeeze in somewhere I don't fit, but it was a hard decision. The first thing when MF Pro came to me, I said no I'm not doing it. Do you know how hard I've worked to not be looked at in this way? I'm not doing it, but now it feels like the perfect place for me.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"It's so hard to explain but I guess from having the amateur career that I had and then somehow ending up in the YouTube world with KSI, with all these names right, still wanting to be a traditional boxer, still follow my lifelong goal and then for basically based on the success of that period where I merged in with them, we now can have a company like MF Pro has created. It's like the perfect synergy. There is no better place for me and my journey than MF Pro.\""

(0:18)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Charlotte's Kon Knueppel reached yet another milestone in a remarkable rookie season for the No. 4 pick out of Duke.\n\nThe Hornets swingman broke Keegan Murray's NBA rookie record for 3-pointers, making his 207th on Thursday night against the Indiana Pacers. Knueppel connected on five 3s in the first half and then broke the record in the third quarter off an assist from Sion James, his former college teammate with the Blue Devils.\n\nHe finished with 28 points in the 133-109 win, with his 8 3s (on 12 attempts) tying his career high and landing just one shy of tying the NBA rookie record. He leads the NBA with 209 3s.\n\n\"It's really just about making the right basketball play,\" Knueppel said after the win. \"My teammates are setting good screens and setting me up in good spots. The coaches as well. I'm just out there looking to make the right play for my team.\"\n\nIt took Murray 80 games in 2022-23 to establish the record -- and Knueppel just 59 to surpass it. He said he did not realize the magnitude of the shot that set the mark.\n\n\"Honestly, I thought I needed seven,\" Knueppel said.\n\nGolden State's Stephen Curry holds the single-season NBA record with 402 3s.\n\nKnueppel is shooting 44.2% from beyond the arc, making him a contender for NBA Rookie of the Year along with his former college teammate and roommate Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 pick of the Dallas Mavericks. He has also helped propel the long-suffering Hornets into playoff contention; Charlotte has not made the playoffs since the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"It's what elevates our whole culture when you have a guy that's that good, but that humble, no ego -- it becomes contagious throughout your whole organization,\" Hornets coach Charles Lee told CGTN Sports Scene after Knueppel eclipsed 200 3s on Tuesday night.\n\nKnueppel has been a perfect fit in second-year coach Lee's offense alongside playmaker LaMelo Ball by finding open spots on the court -- a skill he attributes to playing in his father's men's league against taller competition beginning as an eighth grader growing up in Milwaukee.\n\nKnueppel has thrived as a catch-and-shoot player with 93% of his 3s this season coming off assists entering Thursday night, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nHe has turned heads across the league with his high shooting percentage.\n\nCurry, the NBA's career leader in 3s, made 166 on 380 attempts as a rookie with the Warriors in 80 games in 2009-10. Knueppel has now attempted 473 3s.\n\n\"He can obviously shoot the ball at a high level,\" Curry said after a recent game against the Hornets. \"You can't really leave him open at all as he has such a quick release and shoots with confidence. And his playmaking is very underrated. His game just suits the NBA style, whether it's fast-paced or a slowed-down possession game.\"\n\nKnueppel surpassed Donovan Mitchell, who is third on the list of 3s made by a rookie, in a loss to the Cavaliers on Feb. 20.\n\nMitchell joked that he heard about it after the game from Cavs teammate Tyrese Proctor, who played with Knueppel at Duke.\n\n\"He's talented,\" Mitchell said of Knueppel. \"For him to be a rookie and be able to go out there and make it look effortless. ... We know he can shoot the ball, right? But I think him getting to the midrange and play-develop in the small pick-and-roll that is something I think is really unique about his game is being able to do that and create advantages for himself.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting with him and Coop for rookie of the year.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

His Buckeyes teammate Arvell Reese, the No. 3 player on Kiper's big board, also ran a 4.46 in the 40, tying them for the best times among all players who ran Thursday night.\n\nTo put Styles' vertical jump into context, it was better than Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who at 6-5, 239 pounds, had a 42½-inch vertical jump at the 2007 combine. Styles' jump was also better than current Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori, whose 43-inch jump was the best at the 2025 combine.\n\nStyles' broad jump was also best among all players who took part Thursday, and he was the only player among the defensive linemen and linebackers to top 11 feet.\n\nReese did not do any of the jumps in the workout, but did do position drills.\n\nStyles, who played almost exclusively at middle linebacker for the Buckeyes this past season, said earlier this week that he felt ready to show the league's personnel evaluators what he could do on the field.\n\n\"I think I would say that -- the great defenses you look at, there's at least two or three guys who can play a multitude of roles,'' Styles said. \"Like for example, this year for the Seahawks, Nick Emmanwori was a versatile player, and when you have guys like that on your defense, you're able to do a lot of different things as a coordinator.''"

(2:09)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nNeymar broke his 2026 goal drought in spectacular fashion Thursday, leading Santos to a 2-1 victory over Vasco da Gama in the fourth round of the Brasileirão.\n\nAfter the match, the former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain star addressed his critics and the mounting pressure regarding a potential return for Brazil at the upcoming men's World Cup.\n\n\"Last week they said I was the worst player in the world. Today I scored two goals, and that's what matters,\" Neymar told SporTV. \"That's football. One day you're no good or you're 'retired'; the next, people say you have to go to the World Cup.\n\n\"I'm dedicating myself and working to get in the best possible shape. This was my third game of the year and only my second full 90 minutes. I felt some cramping at the end, but that's just part of the process.\"\n\nNeymar underwent surgery at the beginning of 2026 and only recently returned to the field for Santos. Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti has said repeatedly that Neymar would be considered for selection for the World Cup if he was fit.\n\nAfter scoring the opening goal in the 25th minute, the Santos No. 10 celebrated by heading to the corner flag to perform the same dance Vinícius Júnior did after scoring in both legs of the Real Madrid's Champions League playoff matchup against Benfica.\n\n\"The little dance [I did] was for Vinicius Jr.,\" Neymar said.\n\n\"I told him, when he scored his first goal in Portugal, they insulted him, were racist towards him and everything else, I told him 'you score a goal and do the same celebration, if I score a goal, I'll do the same'. Vini, it's for you.\"\n\nVasco drew level before halftime, but Neymar scored again in the second half to put the game away for Santos.\n\nThe festive atmosphere for Neymar and Santos fans was briefly interrupted following a heated altercation with Vasco midfielder Thiago Mendes. The friction between Neymar and Mendes dates back to 2020 when a challenge from Mendes resulted in a serious injury for Neymar during a PSG match against Lyon.\n\nNeymar didn't hold back when discussing the confrontation.\n\n\"He always wants to cause trouble and act tough. He already broke me once at PSG, and he threatened me again today. It's always the same with him,\" Neymar said.\n\nThis brace marks Neymar's first goals since December 2025, when he closed out the previous year with a two-goal performance against Juventude."

            "content": "Mario Cristobal speaks on Xavier Lucas having to sit out of the first half of the national championship game due to his targeting call in Miami's semifinal win vs. Ole Miss. (0:35)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Division I football rules makers have proposed a one-year trial rule allowing a player disqualified for targeting for the first time to play in his team's next game regardless of which half the penalty was assessed, the NCAA announced Thursday.\n\nCurrently, players disqualified for targeting must sit out the rest of the game and, if the penalty occurs in the second half, sit out the first half of the next game.\n\nUnder the Division I Football Rules Subcommittee's proposal, a player disqualified for targeting a second time during the season would sit out the first half of the next game. A third targeting ejection in the same season would cause the offending player to sit out the entire next game.\n\nTargeting is forcible contact with an opponent's head or neck area in which the offending player often uses the crown of his helmet to make contact or launches his body into the opposing player above the shoulders.\n\nOversight committees for the Bowl Subdivision and Championship Subdivision must approve proposals before they become official. Those committees meet next month.\n\n\"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said A.J. Edds, rules subcommittee chair and vice president of football administration for the Big Ten. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n\nDress code:\n\nThe rules subcommittee proposed that players wear leg coverings from the top of their shoes to the bottom of their pants. Players would have to wear the same covering style and colors for that particular game.\n\nPlayers out of compliance with the rule would have to leave the game for at least one down and correct the issue. A team would receive a warning for the first offense.\n\nIf a team has a second offense under this proposal, the offending team would be given a 5-yard penalty. Any subsequent violations of the rule would result in a 15-yard penalty.\n\n\"The current look of the uniform is clearly not meeting the expectations of the college football community,\" Edds said. \"This will take a collective effort by administrators, coaches and officials to communicate expectations to players and equipment managers. This proposal, we believe, is definitive and gives us a chance for consistent enforcement across Division I football.\"\n\nTexas head coach Steve Sarkisian was amused by the proposal, saying, \"I'm just trying to figure out how we're going to police socks to pants.\"\n\n\"The NFL has that rule and they fine the players when they don't meet their uniform requirements,\" he said. \"Are we hiring uniform police that the NFL does, and they come and they assess every player and they dock them pay and they fine them for when they're suited properly? I would assume instead of worrying about socks to pants, are we going to tuck in our shirts? We've got T-shirts hanging out down to our knees now. There's a lot of things, but for that to come up as being an issue seems kind of odd.\"\n\nFair catch kicks:\n\nUnder a proposal, a team could choose to attempt a fair catch kick after a completed or awarded fair catch. The kick would be a field goal place kick with a holder or a drop kick from the spot where the returner caught the ball. The defense would be at least 10 yards from the spot of the kick.\n\nIf the ensuing kick goes through the uprights, it would be worth three points.\n\nSubcommittee members believe adding the rule would align Division I rules with those in the NFL and high school football. The rarely used play came up in 2024 in the NFL when the Los Angeles Chargers' Cameron Dicker converted from 57 yards against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "content": "Stephen A. Smith says Steelers GM Omar Khan needs to find a quarterback rather than waiting on Aaron Rodgers. (2:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Miami Dolphins ranked first in the NFL Players Association annual report cards, according to survey results obtained by ESPN. The Minnesota Vikings finished second, followed by the Washington Commanders in third.\n\n\"Players consistently describe the organization as 'the best in the NFL,'\" the NFLPA survey wrote about the Dolphins.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished last for the first time in the four-year history of the union's survey. Last year, the Steelers ranked 28th. The Arizona Cardinals finished 31st in the 2026 survey, after a last-place finish in 2025, and the Cleveland Browns finished in 30th, the same as in 2025.\n\nThe NFLPA is not making the report cards public this year after a grievance filed by the NFL, which said the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. Earlier this month, an arbitrator agreed with the league, saying the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses for report cards even if it can't publish them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment.\n\nAn NFL spokesperson also declined to comment, saying that, as in previous years, the league had no knowledge of the survey. The league sent a memo to all teams later Thursday, saying that, as the arbitration hearing showed, the survey results are \"neither reliable nor scientifically valid.\"\n\n\"... We continue to recommend that clubs prioritize feedback and information provided directly by their own players rather than relying on the NFLPA's agenda-driven exercise,\" the league said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by ESPN. \"We further recommend that Clubs refrain from commenting or engaging publicly on the alleged survey and Report Card results.\"\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A-plus to F-minus on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and it was conducted from Nov. 2 to Dec. 11.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" according to the survey.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest-rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" according to the survey. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers' locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers' training room lacks updated recovery technology and \"modalities.\" Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, though the training staff ranked first.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium, \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A-plus to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the survey. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be, according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives, and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Samira Abdul-Azeez\n\nSince financial readiness is the missing link when it comes to developing Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), we need to figure out who needs to act and how. It is not just the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise owners who need to act; stakeholders such as government institutions, financial service providers, business support agencies and the private sector need to work together to equip MSMEs with the needed financial capacity for their growth.\n\nFor some time now, financial trainings have been treated as an option, even though entrepreneurs are expected to pursue it as a necessity. Many MSMEs only learn about money management when they are in trouble or when they want to borrow money. However, in order to help these businesses, financial capacity ought to be embedded at every stage of business support.\n\nWhen businesses access loans, grants, or receive help from incubation programmes, there is a need to assist in how to handle these monies. Simple financial readiness programs should focus on things like digital bookkeeping tools, pricing models, record-keeping and planning for the long term. Financial training is crucial for MSME growth and should be a core component of the support they receive.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports higher survival rates among businesses with basic bookkeeping and budgeting practices. A 2020 OECD study across Europe showed that small businesses with regular financial records recorded stronger revenue stability within three years of startup.\n\nSingapore integrates compulsory financial management models into government-funded SME programs. As a result, participants show lower loan default rates and stronger repayment histories according to Enterprise Singapore program reviews. Similarly, in Kenya, research from Kajiado County shows that SMEs with sound bookkeeping skills saw a 41% increase in financial performance.\n\nFinancial institutions also have a role to play. When MSMEs do not have records and struggle with cash flow, they often get turned down for credit. This is, however, a chance for banks and microfinance institutions to step in and, together with business support institutions and companies,s work at ensuring adequate technology is provided for financial training. This can help businesses before and after they access loans.\n\nInclusion is really important for this effort. Women-led businesses and rural entrepreneurs are often the ones affected by financial capacity gaps, not because of a lack of potential but because support systems rarely reflect their realities. For example, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), based on research conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa, found that women-owned small and medium-sized businesses got smaller loans and had to pay them back faster. Some countries, such as Canada, are addressing this challenge by providing women with financial education and access to credit.\n\nDigital payment systems and bookkeeping apps make it easier for businesses to track income, manage expenses, and build financial histories. However, technology alone is not enough. Entrepreneurs must be supported to understand and consistently use these tools through guidance, follow-up and integration into broader enterprise support programs. When MSMEs become financially and digitally visible, they gain credibility and unlock new opportunities for growth.\n\nAt its core, financial readiness is about sustainability. Businesses that understand their finances are better equipped to survive economic shocks, reinvest profits and create jobs. As Ghana continues to promote entrepreneurship as a driver of development, success should not be measured by how much funding is disbursed, but by how many businesses are still standing and growing years after. Access to finance may open doors, but financial readiness determines what happens after those doors are opened. By prioritising financial capacity alongside capital, Ghana can build an entrepreneurial ecosystem that does more than support businesses, but rather strengthens them, and that is how finance is transformed into lasting impact.\n\n-\n\nThe author, Samira Abdul-Azeez, is a lawyer and Deputy CEO of the Ghana Enterprises Agency.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

This is very welcoming and motivates sustained corporate involvement,” he stated.\n\nThe donation aims to strengthen the Fund’s efforts to assist Ghanaians battling chronic non-communicable diseases such as dialysis and cancer care, which often place severe financial strain on families.\n\nThe Administrator of the Fund, Adjoa Obuobia Darko-Opoku, expressed deep appreciation for the contribution, noting that the operations of the Fund are highly capital-intensive and rely on corporate participation to remain sustainable.\n\nShe highlighted that government policy, such as the tax deduction, is crucial for encouraging broad private sector engagement.\n\n“All activities of the Trust Fund require significant resources. Support from corporate Ghana, beyond funds earmarked by the state, is what will make this initiative truly successful,” she explained.\n\nBy setting the example with a substantial initial donation and a commitment to monthly contributions, Safebond Africa has challenged other corporate entities to follow suit.\n\nThe message is clear: when structured incentives align with corporate social responsibility, private sector action can save lives at scale.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "President John Dramani Mahama\n\nPresident John Dramani Mahama has announced that the Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) has resumed processing crude oil into petroleum products for the first time since 2018.\n\nDelivering his State of the Nation Address, the President told Parliament that the refinery’s new management has successfully completed extensive turnaround maintenance, paving the way for the facility’s operational comeback.\n\n“Mr. Speaker, I’m also pleased to announce to you that Tema Oil Refinery is back, For the first time since 2018, the refinery has commenced processing of crude oil into petroleum products again,” he said.\n\nThe President described the development as a key milestone in ongoing efforts to revitalize Ghana’s energy sector and ensure energy security. He assured the House that reforms within the sector remain firmly on track.\n\nThe Tema Oil Refinery had been inactive for several years, with major shutdowns due to maintenance challenges and financial constraints that left it unable to refine crude domestically.\n\nHowever, the refinery successfully resumed crude oil refining in December 2025 after extensive turnaround maintenance on its Crude Distillation Unit.\n\nPresident Mahama also emphasized his administration’s commitment to restoring stability and efficiency across the energy value chain.\n\n“I remain fully committed to turning around the sector, strengthening its foundations, and ensuring reliable, affordable and sustainable energy security for our nation,” he stated.\n\nThe resumption of operations at Tema Oil Refinery is expected to boost local refining capacity and support government’s broader energy security agenda while boosting revenue generated from the sector.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nTags:\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "President John Mahama has described Ghana as resilient and on a path of renewal, calling on citizens to actively shape the country’s future.\n\nDelivering the 2026 State of the Nation Address in Parliament on Friday, 27 February, the President acknowledged that nations are tested, but resilience comes from refusing to surrender.\n\n“Nations endure not because they are spared trial, but because their people refuse to surrender to trial. Ghana has been tested before. We did not surrender. We will not surrender now,” he said.\n\n“The state of our nation is resilient. The state of our nation is renewing, and our nation is firmly in the hands of its people. Our nation is on the brink of takeoff, and so, ladies and gentlemen, to my passengers, fasten your seat belts,” President Mahama added.\n\nDrawing on an African proverb, he said the country is emerging from past difficulties.\n\n“However long the night is, the dawn will break. Mr Speaker, the dawn is breaking for Ghana. The moment we are in requires not only endurance, but also action. Renewal belongs to those who prepare for the morning, while others still speak off and look back at the darkness,” he said.\n\nPresident Mahama emphasised that the Republic belongs to all citizens—farmers, traders, teachers, nurses, artisans, entrepreneurs, parliamentarians, young people, and retired personnel.\n\n“Each of these people has a stake in our nation, and each one has a duty. Each has a claim on the future we’re shaping together,” he said.\n\nHe added that the country’s renewal depends on institutions, the economy, and the values passed to future generations.\n\n“For Ghana today, that dawn is not a promise we must recite. It is a reality we must build into our institutions, into our economy, and in the ethics of responsibility we pass on to the next generation,” President Mahama said.\n\nHe called on all Ghanaians to contribute actively to nation-building.\n\n“I will continue to carry the weight of final accountability. And I ask an equal measure that our citizens bring their full measure of energy, skills, and patriotism to the common task of advancing our country. That is how nations are built. That is how economies grow. No policy can substitute for civic duty,” he said.\n\nThe President reminded Parliament that Ghana is defined not by its challenges, but by how citizens respond.\n\n“We are sometimes tempted to judge our nation only by our failures and our difficulties. But the country is not defined solely by its difficulties. It is defined by the choices its people make in response to those difficulties,” he said.\n\nHighlighting the enduring spirit of Ghanaians throughout history, he added:\n\n“Repeatedly through our history, Ghanaians have chosen steadiness over despair, cooperation over division, and purpose over cynicism. That is the deeper strength on which our future rests.”\n\nHe recalled past testing moments, from economic strain to periods of political transition, urging citizens to continue building on Ghana’s resilience.\n\n“We have faced testing moments before, and we have overcome them. We’ve gone through periods of economic strain, transitions that have demanded much from our citizens and our public servants alike,” he concluded.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

We are currently putting together a revitalisation plan to leverage their valuable assets and re-inject life into their operations.”\n\nHe confirmed that the Media Development Fund is being reconsidered to support the sustainability and growth of the Ghanaian media landscape.\n\nReflecting on his recent visit to Zambia, President Mahama recalled how Ghana successfully managed a cultural mislabeling issue on social media, turning potential ridicule into an opportunity for diplomacy and national pride.\n\n“We corrected the record with speed and confidence. We turned confusion into connection, and a fleeting social media frenzy into a handshake of friendship with our Zambian brothers and sisters,” he said.\n\nThe President emphasised that unity in cultural moments must translate into unity for national development.\n\n“Our pursuit of national development demands that same unity of purpose. We must act as one people with one purpose,” he concluded.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "Pakistan has accused Afghanistan of becoming ‘a colony of India’ but India’s relations with Kabul predate the Taliban.\n\nPakistan has accused Afghanistan’s Taliban of serving as a “proxy” for India, amid escalating hostilities between Islamabad and Kabul.\n\nJust hours after Pakistan bombed locations in Kabul early on Friday, Pakistan’s Minister of Defence Khawaja Asif wrote on X that after NATO forces withdrew from Afghanistan in July 2021, “it was expected that peace would prevail in Afghanistan and that the Taliban would focus on the interests of the Afghan people and regional stability”.\n\n“However, the Taliban turned Afghanistan into a colony of India,” he wrote and accused the Taliban of “exporting terrorism”.\n\n“Pakistan made every effort, both directly and through friendly countries, to keep the situation stable. It carried out extensive diplomacy. However, the Taliban became a proxy of India,” he alleged as he declared an “open war” with Afghanistan.\n\nThis is not the first time that Asif has brought India into tensions with Afghanistan.\n\nLast October, he alleged: “India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul.”\n\nSo far, Asif has presented no evidence to back his claims and the Taliban has rejected accusations that it is being influenced by India.\n\nBut India has condemned the Pakistani military’s recent actions in Afghanistan, adding to Islamabad’s growing discernment that its nuclear rival and the Taliban are edging closer.\n\nEarlier this week, after the Pakistani military carried out air raids inside Afghanistan on Sunday, India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement that New Delhi “strongly condemns Pakistan’s airstrikes on Afghan territory that have resulted in civilian casualties, including women and children, during the holy month of Ramadan”.\n\n\n\nAfter Friday morning’s flare-up between Pakistan and Afghanistan, India’s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal again said New Delhi “strongly” condemned Pakistan’s air strikes and also noted that they took place on a Friday during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\n“It is another attempt by Pakistan to externalise its internal failures,” Jaiswal said in a statement on X.\n\nHas India’s influence in Afghanistan grown under the Taliban and what is India’s endgame with Afghanistan?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nHow have relations between India and the Taliban evolved?\n\nWhen the Taliban first rose to power in Afghanistan in 1996, India adopted a hostile policy towards the group and did not recognise its assumption of power. India also shunned all diplomatic relations with the Taliban.\n\nAt the time, New Delhi viewed the Taliban as a proxy for Pakistan’s intelligence agencies. Pakistan, together with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, were the only three countries to have also recognised the Taliban administration at that point.\n\nThen, in 2001, India supported the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, which toppled the Taliban administration. India then reopened its embassy in Kabul and embraced the new government led by Hamid Karzai. The Taliban, in response, attacked Indian embassies and consulates in Afghanistan. In 2008, at least 58 people were killed when the Taliban bombed India’s embassy in Kabul.\n\nIn 2021, after the Taliban returned to power, India closed its embassy in Afghanistan once again and also did not officially recognise the Taliban as the government of the country.\n\nBut a year later, as relations between Pakistan and the Taliban deteriorated over armed groups which Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of harbouring, India began engaging with the Taliban.\n\nIn 2022, India sent a team of “technical experts” to run its mission in Kabul and officially reopened its embassy in the Afghan capital last October. New Delhi also allowed the Taliban to operate Afghanistan consulates in the Indian cities of Mumbai and Hyderabad.\n\nOver the past two years, officials from New Delhi and Afghanistan have also held meetings abroad, in Kabul and in New Delhi.\n\nIn January last year, the Taliban administration’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi met India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThen, in October 2025, he visited New Delhi and met Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.\n\nAfter this meeting, Muttaqi told journalists that Kabul “has always sought good relations with India” and, in a joint statement, Afghanistan and India pledged to have “close communication and continue regular engagement”.\n\nBesides beefing up diplomatic ties, India has also offered humanitarian support to Afghanistan under the Taliban’s rule.\n\n\n\nAfter a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck northern Afghanistan in November last year, India shipped food, medicine and vaccines, and Jaishankar was also among the first foreign ministers to call Muttaqi and offer his support. Since last December, India has also approved and implemented several healthcare infrastructure projects in Afghanistan, according to a December 2025 report by the country’s press information bureau.\n\nPraveen Donthi, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera that the costs of avoiding engagement with the Taliban in the past have compelled the Indian government to adopt strategic pragmatism towards the Afghan leadership this time.\n\n“New Delhi does not want to disregard this relationship on ideological grounds or create strategic space for India’s main strategic rivals, Pakistan and China, in its neighbourhood,” he said.\n\nRaghav Sharma, professor and director at the Centre for Afghanistan Studies at the OP Jindal Global University in India, added that the current engagement also stems from New Delhi’s pragmatic realisation that the Taliban is now in charge in Afghanistan and that there is no meaningful opposition.\n\n“States engage in order to protect and further their interests. While there is little by way of ideological convergence, there are areas of strategic convergence, which is what has pushed India to engage with the Taliban, some of their unpalatable policies notwithstanding,” he said.\n\nIs this a new stance towards Afghanistan?\n\nNo. India’s growing influence and engagement with Afghanistan began well before the Taliban returned to power in August 2021.\n\nBetween December 2001 and September 2014, during the US presence in Afghanistan, New Delhi was a strong supporter of the Karzai government, and then of his successor, Ashraf Ghani’s government, which was in power from September 2014 until August 2021, when the US withdrew from the country.\n\nIn October 2011, under Karzai, India and Afghanistan renewed ties by signing an agreement to form a strategic partnership. New Delhi also pledged to support Afghanistan in the face of foreign troops in the nation as a part of this agreement.\n\nUnder both Karzai and his successor, Ghani, India invested more than $3bn in humanitarian aid and reconstruction work in Afghanistan. This included reconstruction projects like schools and hospitals, and also a new National Assembly building in Kabul, which was inaugurated in December 2015 when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Afghanistan for the first time.\n\nIndia’s Border Road Organisation (BRO) also assisted Afghanistan in the development of infrastructure projects like the 218km Zaranj-Delaram highway in 2009 under Karzai’s government.\n\nUnder Ghani, New Delhi undertook building the Salma Dam project to help with irrigating Afghanistan. In June 2016, when Modi visited Afghanistan once again, he inaugurated this $290m dam project. In May 2016, Iran, India and Afghanistan also signed a trilateral trade and transit agreement on the Chabahar port.\n\nDuring this period – 2001-2021 – Pakistan’s unease with New Delhi and Kabul’s new partnership grew.\n\n\n\nIn October 2011, after signing a strategic agreement with India, Karzai had assured Islamabad that while “India is a great friend, Pakistan is a twin brother”.\n\nBut Karzai was critical of Pakistan’s support for the Taliban. In his last speech as president of Afghanistan in Kabul in September 2014, he stated that he believed most of the Taliban leadership lived in Pakistan.\n\nIn a 2011 report by a Washington, DC-based think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Amer Latif, former director for South Asian affairs in the US Ofﬁce of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, noted that Karzai was walking a “fine line between criticising Pakistan’s activities while also referring to Pakistan as Afghanistan’s ‘twin brother’.”\n\n“It is in this context that Karzai appears to be looking to solidify long-term partnerships with countries that will aid his stabilisation efforts,” he said, referring to Karzai’s visit to India and his efforts to improve relations with the subcontinent.\n\nWhen Ghani rose to power in September 2014, he tried to reset ties with Pakistan and also visited the country in November that year. But his efforts did not result in improved ties due to border disputes with Pakistan continuing until his administration was overthrown by the Taliban in August 2021.\n\nSo why has India maintained ties with Afghanistan under the Taliban?\n\nInitially, when the Taliban returned to power in 2021 following the withdrawal of the US, political analysts largely expected Pakistan to lead the way in recognising the Taliban administration as the official government of Afghanistan, improving bilateral relations which had turned icy under Karzai and Ghani.\n\nBut relations turned hostile, with Pakistan repeatedly accusing the Taliban of allowing anti-Pakistan armed groups like the Pakistan Taliban (TTP) to operate from Afghan soil. The Taliban denies this.\n\nThen, the deportation of tens of thousands of Afghan refugees by Pakistan in recent years further strained ties between the two neighbours.\n\nIndia has ultimately taken a pragmatic approach to the Taliban in order to maintain the good relations it built with Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021, and has somewhat leveraged poor relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan to cement these.\n\n“With Pakistan’s increasingly strained relations with Afghanistan, the logic of ‘enemy’s enemy’ is acting as a glue between Kabul and New Delhi,” International Crisis Group’s Donthi said.\n\nHe added that despite the fact that India’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government opposes Islamist organisations, “the strategic necessity to counter Pakistan has led it to engage with the Taliban proactively”.\n\nIndia and Pakistan are nuclear-armed rivals which engaged in a four-day conflict in May 2025 after armed rebels killed Indian tourists in Pahalgam, a popular tourist spot in Indian-administered Kashmir, last April. New Delhi accused Pakistan of supporting rebel fighters, a charge Pakistan strongly denied.\n\nFor its part, Afghanistan took the opportunity to strongly condemn the Pahalgam attack and the Indian Ministry of External Affairs expressed “deep appreciation” to the Taliban for its “strong condemnation of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam … as well as for the sincere condolences”.\n\nIndia has also condemned Pakistani military action in Afghanistan and has provided aid to thousands of Afghan refugees displaced from Pakistan.\n\nSo what is India’s endgame in Afghanistan?\n\nSharma, the OP Jindal Global University professor, said India wants to ensure that Pakistan and China, whose influence has grown in South Asia in recent years, “do not have a free run”, as “there is a divergence of interest on Afghanistan” with both Pakistan and its ally, China.\n\n\n\n“There are security interests New Delhi is keen to further and protect for which engagement [with the Taliban] is the only option,” he added.\n\nAnil Trigunayat, a former Indian diplomat, noted that while Afghanistan and Pakistan relations have their own dynamic, currently the Taliban leadership, even if not a monolith, refuses to play to the tunes of the Pakistan military and its intelligence agency.\n\n“Hence they [Pakistan] accuse Indian complicity in Taliban actions in Pakistan,” he said.\n\nBut the Taliban, he said, “understands and appreciates India’s intent, policies and [humanitarian] contributions”, making its leaders keen to continue collaboration with New Delhi."

            "content": "Analysts warn escalation may embolden armed groups and destabilise both Afghanistan and Pakistan. What happens next?\n\nIslamabad, Pakistan – Pakistan launched air strikes on Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, as well as on Kandahar and Paktia, early on Friday. The attacks targeted Taliban military installations as Islamabad declared “open war” on the group’s government, in the most serious military confrontation between the two neighbours in years.\n\nThe strikes came hours after Afghan forces launched coordinated cross-border attacks on Pakistani military positions in six border provinces late on Thursday. Kabul claimed 55 Pakistani soldiers were killed and 19 outposts captured.\n\nPakistan acknowledged two soldiers had been killed but dismissed the other claims as propaganda. It said Pakistan had eliminated at least 133 Afghan fighters in retaliation, while destroying at least 27 Afghan outposts.\n\nDefence Minister Khawaja Asif declared Pakistan’s patience exhausted. “Our cup of patience has overflowed. Now it is open war between us and you,” he wrote on social media, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif warned there would be “no leniency” in defending Pakistan’s homeland.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed the strikes on Kabul, Kandahar and Paktia but claimed there had been no casualties. He announced retaliatory operations had begun from Kandahar and Helmand.\n\nThe exchanges have shattered a ceasefire brokered by Turkiye and Qatar, which was reached after 10 days of deadly border fighting in October killed more than 70 people on both sides. Subsequent negotiations in Doha and Istanbul failed to produce a formal agreement.\n\n\n\nWhat is unfolding now, analysts say, is categorically more dangerous, with no framework in place to contain it.\n\nWhy has Pakistan escalated now?\n\nPakistan’s rationale for Friday’s heavy attacks lies in a renewed wave of violence at home.\n\nOn February 6, a suicide bomber killed at least 36 people at a Shia mosque in Islamabad. This was followed, days later, by another incident in which an explosives-laden vehicle rammed a security post in Bajaur in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 11 soldiers and a child.\n\nPakistani authorities said the attacker was an Afghan national and issued a demarche to the Afghan deputy head of mission in Islamabad.\n\nOn February 21, another suicide bomber struck a security convoy in Bannu, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing two soldiers.\n\nThose attacks prompted Pakistan’s first round of strikes last weekend inside Afghanistan, targeting what it said were hideouts linked to armed groups, particularly the Pakistan Taliban, known by the acronym TTP.\n\nThe TTP, formed in 2007, fought alongside the Afghan Taliban against United States-led forces in Afghanistan and hosted Afghan fighters in Pakistan. It is organisationally distinct from the Afghan Taliban but shares deep ideological, social and linguistic ties. Pakistan accuses Kabul of providing sanctuary to the TTP, a charge the Taliban denies.\n\nThe TTP has been waging a rebellion against the state of Pakistan for more than a decade. The group demands the imposition of hardline Islamic law, release of key members arrested by the government and a reversal of the merger of Pakistan’s tribal areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, among other demands.\n\nAnother major armed group, which Pakistan alleges benefits from sanctuary in Afghanistan, is the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), an organisation officially designated “terrorist” by several countries and international bodies. The group has been fighting its own war against the Pakistani state, seeking independence for the Balochistan province, which is a natural mineral-rich province in southwest Pakistan, and also shares a border with Afghanistan.\n\nKabul said at least 18 people were killed in Pakistani strikes last Sunday and pledged retaliation, which culminated in Thursday night’s cross-border fire.\n\nFor analysts tracking Pakistan’s escalatory ladder over the past year, Friday’s strikes were not surprising, though their scope was unprecedented.\n\nTariq Khan, a retired three-star general who has served extensively in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and led operations against the TTP, said this is only the beginning.\n\n\n\n“We have not seen the peak, and there will be more to come,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Pakistan asked the Taliban to control TTP, held several talks along with Turkiye and Qatar, but it was not going to work because the Taliban refused to take responsibility,” he said.\n\nTameem Bahiss, a Kabul-based security analyst, said the crisis revolves around a single unresolved dispute.\n\n“Tensions have been largely driven by Pakistan’s repeated accusations that Afghan authorities are allowing the TTP to operate from Afghan soil, which Kabul has denied,” he said.\n\n“As long as this core issue remains unresolved, attacks will continue. From Islamabad’s perspective, these operations are framed as counterterrorism measures. From Kabul’s perspective, they are violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Bahiss told Al Jazeera.\n\nStriking military installations in Kabul and Kandahar marks a shift from peripheral border zones to the Taliban’s administrative and ideological centres. Yet dismantling decentralised and mobile TTP networks embedded along both sides of the porous frontier remains far from guaranteed.\n\nAbdul Basit, a security researcher at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, questioned the strategic payoff.\n\n“Whatever has happened represents a dangerous escalation. While I understand the compulsion for Pakistan to retaliate, I do not understand the logic of how it will help address terrorism,” he said.\n\n“It will lead to instability, and instability is precisely what terrorist networks crave, including TTP and other armed groups which have sought sanctuary in Afghanistan, and have all grown stronger as a result,” Basit told Al Jazeera. “The message is: We will not absorb hits. This is the new normal.”\n\nThe Taliban’s asymmetric options\n\nThe Taliban has no air force, and comparing the two militaries conventionally misses the point, Khan said.\n\n“The Afghan system conducts kinetic operations through proxies, guerrilla warfare, and a war of attrition,” he said. “But if you get drawn into a war of attrition, you are on the losing side, no matter what nuclear capability or air power you possess, because you are fighting on their turf.”\n\nBahiss pointed to the most immediate lever available to Kabul: Pakistan’s thousands of fixed security posts along the long and porous border.\n\n“The Taliban have repeatedly demonstrated that in moments of escalation, their preferred response is to target Pakistani military posts along the long and porous border,” he said.\n\nBasit, though, warned of broader “unconventional options”.\n\n“They have suicide bombers and the poor man’s air force, kamikaze drones. I think they will use both these options in large numbers, and it appears that Pakistani urban centres will see violence for the foreseeable future,” he said.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed drone attacks in three Pakistani cities, blaming the Taliban government. He said “small drones in Abbotabad, Swabi and Nowshera” were brought down. “No damage to life,” he added in his message on social media platform X.\n\n\n\nAnother variable is the TTP itself. Kabul’s most potent asymmetric card may be its capacity to restrain or loosen tolerance for TTP operations inside Pakistan.\n\n“So far, there has been no publicly verified evidence that Kabul is providing extensive, overt military support to the TTP in response to Pakistani strikes,” Bahiss said.\n\nIftikhar Firdous, a security analyst and cofounder of The Khorasan Diary, a journalism platform, argued that proxy leverage lies at the heart of this confrontation.\n\n“Even a cursory sentiment analysis of Afghan social media linked to the Taliban clearly shows the alignment in agenda and, at times, a clear call for action by proxy groups. And while they don’t have an air force, the drone warfare is an indication of what the future of conflict looks like,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nIs there an off-ramp?\n\nNeither side appears to have an obvious exit from all this.\n\nPakistan’s operation received backing from the president, prime minister and across the political spectrum, with the government pledging to respond to any attack emanating from Afghan soil.\n\nFor the Taliban, absorbing strikes on Kabul and stepping back risks projecting weakness to fighters and the public it governs.\n\nBasit said the threshold has already shifted.\n\n“This has been a step-by-step escalation; not one step has been reversed, we have only moved forward. Tensions may come down temporarily, but in my calculation, there is no going back. Summer has arrived early in the Af-Pak region, and we are bracing for a bloody summer in both countries,” he said.\n\nBahiss said the trajectory will depend on two factors: Violence inside Pakistan and external diplomatic pressure.\n\n“If attacks inside Pakistan continue and there is no meaningful diplomatic intervention, further rounds of escalation remain a real possibility. At this stage, there is little indication that either side is stepping back strategically,” he said.\n\nKhan, the former general, outlined de-escalation only on Pakistan’s terms.\n\n“One likely outcome is that the Afghan government concludes it has had enough, signals to its proxies that it is over, and eventually comes to the table. They agree to share intelligence and curtail all proxies, including TTP and others. The second option is that they do not agree and continue as they are, in which case Pakistan’s response will continue as well.”\n\nCan diplomacy still work?\n\nThe international community reacted swiftly on Friday in the wake of these tit-for-tat attacks.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged both countries to adhere to international humanitarian law and resolve differences through diplomacy.\n\nIran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi invoked the holy month of Ramadan, writing on X that Tehran stood “ready to provide any assistance necessary to facilitate dialogue”.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud held urgent discussions with his Pakistani counterpart, Ishaq Dar, who is in Riyadh on an official visit. Dar, also deputy prime minister, spoke by telephone with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.\n\nBut Bahiss said durable de-escalation requires more than just statements.\n\n“A credible de-escalation process would likely involve Pakistan sharing actionable intelligence regarding alleged TTP presence inside Afghanistan, followed by verifiable steps taken by Kabul against any confirmed elements,” he said.\n\n\n\n“The fundamental obstacle is denial and mistrust. Kabul rejects the claim that TTP operates from its territory, while Islamabad insists that it does. As long as one side frames the issue as external aggression and the other as counterterrorism necessity, bridging that gap becomes extremely difficult.”\n\nFormer military official Khan argued Pakistan’s diplomatic approach must widen beyond the Taliban to include Pashtun communities and anti-Taliban political forces.\n\n“Islamabad should be simultaneously talking to Pashtun communities and anti-Taliban political forces and empowering the locals who stand against the Taliban,” he said.\n\nFirdous, however, said any sustained de-escalation would require the same external mediators who previously facilitated talks.\n\n“This, however, will not be possible without the intervention of the same friendly actors involved in the process, all of whom have already been in touch with both countries,” he said."

            "content": "The new year is less than two months in, but already more than 560 people have gone missing in the Mediterranean Sea while trying to reach Europe, making it on course to be one of the deadliest years on record. At least 500 of those were lost crossing from Libya, Tunisia and Algeria to a Europe that continues to attempt to force them back.\n\nThe stories of those lost at sea, many of them travelling on boats that offer little protection from the waves, reveal the extent of their suffering.\n\nEarlier in February, 53 people, two of them babies, were reported to be dead or missing after their boat capsized off the coast of the Libyan town of Zuwara. Only two women, both Nigerian, were rescued.\n\nA few weeks earlier, as a freak cyclone tore across the Mediterranean Sea, hundreds, possibly up to a thousand people, desperately trying to reach Europe, were believed to have lost their lives.\n\nQualified risk\n\nThe risks of travelling to and through Libya are well known among migrants and refugees. Nevertheless, they come.\n\nAccording to the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration (IOM), between August and October 2025, at least 928,000 migrants were identified in Libya, hoping to either stay in the North African country or, in the case of many, attempt to cross to Europe and the promise of a better life.\n\nBut, as they wait for the funds to pay for their passage, or the right opportunity to travel, they find themselves prey to the militias that have controlled much of Libya since a civil war robbed the country of a stable and unified government.\n\n\n\nA report, issued by the UN Human Rights Office in February, painted a bleak picture of life for refugees and irregular migrants in Libya. In it, researchers described an environment where traffickers and armed groups could conduct widespread and systematic abuse against migrants with impunity. These “grave violations and abuses have evolved into deliberate, profit-driven practices that together form a ruthless and violent business model”.\n\nOla, a 25-year-old from Freetown in Sierra Leone, is one of the thousands to have fallen victim to Libya’s militias. Speaking from Libya’s capital Tripoli, Ola described being beaten and held prisoner by one of the militias in Zuwara, which is in western Libya.\n\nOla said that his hand had still not recovered after he was hit with an iron bar before he was detained in the summer of 2024. Ola remained in detention, enduring forced labour and regular beatings, for three months: the time it took his parents to borrow the $700 his captors demanded to free him.\n\n“Conditions were very bad,” he said of his time in detention, as he rubbed his injured hand. “There was a lot of suffering. We would have bread to eat, and sometimes we had to drink the water they gave us to wash in. It was very bad; it had salt in it.”\n\n“I did not have a [reputation for taking risks] in my country,” Ola said.\n\n“I did not associate with bad people. I never did anything illegal,” he continued. “I know this is dangerous, but it’s better than where I come from”.\n\nMubarak, a 31-year-old from Sudan, is no different. He fled fighting around his village near Nyala in Darfur in 2023, crossing into Libya overland through Chad. Like Ola, Mubarak described being held prisoner, being beaten and forced to work by one of Libya’s militias, before being released.\n\nMubarak also knows the risks of continuing to Europe and is ready to accept them. He laughed bitterly, “I know the crossing [to Europe] is dangerous. [But] It’s just the money that’s stopping me. I know in my soul that Libya is just as dangerous as Sudan, but where will I go?”\n\nNo deterrence for the desperate\n\nFor those willing to stake their lives on surviving what the IOM says is the world’s most dangerous migration route, European deterrence means little.\n\nNevertheless, the European states most exposed to departures from Tunisia and Libya, principally Italy, have adopted increasingly punitive measures. Under a new Italian bill approved earlier this month, the country can indefinitely prohibit boats from entering its waters “in cases of grave threats to public order or national security”.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the bill allows Italy to stop boats and send passengers to third-party countries it has outsourcing deals with, such as Albania, with no indication that authorities would check for protection needs, vulnerabilities, or physical or mental health concerns. The European Parliament has also signed off on changes to EU asylum rules that let member states transfer asylum seekers to “safe third countries”.\n\nHow effective all of that is at reducing migrant numbers remains to be seen. Despite an Italian government elected partly on the back of its anti-migrant platform in 2022, arrival numbers remain stubbornly high, with more than 63,000 people braving the odds in 2025, almost the identical number as those from the previous year.\n\n“Why people take these extreme risks is one of the big questions,” said Ahlam Chemlali, a migration expert at Aalborg University in Denmark, who has conducted extensive field research among irregular migrants along Tunisia’s border with Libya,\n\nChemlali described speaking to the women in the border region, who knew and, in many cases, had experienced the danger inherent to migration firsthand.\n\n“They told me they were already dead there [on the border], and they’re right. It’s a social death, where people have no future,” she said, “Everything is denied to them, so taking these risks is one way they can regain some control over their lives. They understand what they’re doing. The EU has poured millions into information campaigns, but the prospect of being stuck in limbo with no future feels worse. This is especially true for women with children. The presence of children can be a huge motivator, but of course, it also increases the risks.”\n\nIn Ola’s case, the drive to reach Europe is unwavering. He craves the rule of law – anything that would lead to consequences for those committing acts of violence against him.\n\n“Life in Europe would be amazing,” he said, the tone of his voice lightening, “I would be safe. There is no violence there. If there is violence, it is punished by the law.\n\n“I will educate myself and then get a job.”"

By contrast, before the Hamas-led attack in southern Israel in October 2023 and the ensuing genocidal war waged by Israel in Gaza, 54 percent of Americans sympathised more with Israel and 31 percent with Palestine.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the report’s main findings:\n\nDemocrats ’ sympathies haven’t changed significantly over the past year, having already flipped strongly towards the Palestinians in 2025 after first tilting that way in 2023. Currently, 65 percent of Democrats say their sympathies lie more with the Palestinians, while 17 percent say they sympathise more with the Israelis.\n\n’ sympathies haven’t changed significantly over the past year, having already flipped strongly towards the Palestinians in 2025 after first tilting that way in 2023. Currently, 65 percent of Democrats say their sympathies lie more with the Palestinians, while 17 percent say they sympathise more with the Israelis. Driving the shift this year, the report says, is the substantial movement among independents who have now joined Democrats in supporting Palestinians. By 41 percent to 30 percent, independents say they sympathise more with the Palestinians than the Israelis, whereas in all prior years, they were more sympathetic towards the Israelis, including by 42 percent to 34 percent last year.\n\nwho have now joined Democrats in supporting Palestinians. Seven in 10 Republicans say they sympathise more with the Israelis, while 13 percent go with the Palestinians. Still, the Republican support for Israel has declined by a 10-point record since 2024, to its lowest level since 2004. Support for Israel has become deeply contentious in the conservative party, including driving a wedge within the far-right conservative MAGA movement. Some of its representatives, such as former Fox news host-turned popular podcaster Tucker Carlson, have become critical of what they say is Israel’s excessive influence over US politics.\n\nsay they sympathise more with the Israelis, while 13 percent go with the Palestinians.

Some of its representatives, such as former Fox news host-turned popular podcaster Tucker Carlson, have become critical of what they say is Israel’s excessive influence over US politics. Age gap : For the first time in Gallup’s surveys since 2001, a majority of US citizens aged between 18 and 34 are more sympathetic to the Palestinian people. Meanwhile, 23 percent of young adults say they sympathise more with the Israelis, a record low for the age group. Sympathy for Israel has dropped from 45 percent last year to 28 percent. Among adults older than 55, 49 percent sympathise more with the Israelis and 31% with the Palestinians, the first time since 2005 that less than half of older Americans have said they sympathise more with the Israelis.\n\n: For the first time in Gallup’s surveys since 2001, a majority of US citizens aged between 18 and 34 are more sympathetic to the Palestinian people.

Gallup also measured US sentiment over the establishment of a Palestinian state. There are no significant changes compared to recent years, as 6 in 10 adults favour the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza – an almost consistent figure since 2020.\n\n\n\nPerceptions’ shifts followed what has been widely regarded as Israel’s disproportionate response to the October 7 attack, where about 1,200 people were killed in Israel and more than 250 were taken captive.\n\nIsrael has killed more than 72,000 people in Gaza, the majority of them women and children, and reduced almost the entire enclave into rubble.\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for crimes against humanity and war crimes; and prompted South Africa to file a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which has been joined by several other nations.\n\nStill, while support fell at a faster rate following the war, the trend had started going downwards since 2019 due to the “cumulative effect of gradual changes in US attitudes since then”, read the report."

            "content": "is a senior reviewer covering TVs and audio. He has over 20 years experience in AV, and has previously been on staff at Digital Trends and Reviewed.\n\nSince I saw the TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV at a pre-CES event in December, I’ve been eager to get a close look at it in my living room. At first glance, the TV impressed me enough that I named it the best TV of CES 2026.\n\nFrom the moment I completed Google TV setup and started watching the TCL X11L I was amazed. I could immediately tell it’s the brightest TV I’ve had in my home, but it was the color vibrancy that I found most impressive. The colors we’re all most familiar with — skin tones, the sky, green grass and trees — all look as close to realistic as I’ve seen on a TV. And with the color vibrancy it looks staggeringly good.\n\nIt’s a flagship TV unlike any other that TCL has made, with vibrant colors and incredible blooming control. It competes with flagships from all the major TV manufacturers — including the Sony Bravia 9, LG G5, and Samsung S95F — and it gets brighter than any of them. But it’s also expensive, with the 75-inch model I tested going for $7,000, and the 85- and 98-inch versions for $8,000 and $10,000, respectively. And with a bunch of RGB LED TVs on the way this year, for likely comparable prices, you might want to wait before committing to the X11L.\n\nWhile the TV industry leans into RGB LED — and TCL is too, on other TVs — TCL’s flagship instead uses an evolution of mini-LED technology. The X11L uses blue LEDs for its backlight with super quantum dots (hence the SQD) and an upgraded color filter that together provide the widest gamut coverage we’ve ever seen from a mini-LED TV. Both technologies should have similar light output and color performance, although the individual red, green, and blue LED backlights of RGB LEDs could deliver more accurate colors — or they could have visible color crosstalk issues. We won’t know until RGB LED TVs are more readily available. What we do know is that mini-LED is a proven technology, and that TCL has made significant improvements to its performance with the X11L.\n\nIt also has a higher-end design than previous TCL TVs, with a solid metal frame and uniform thickness across the chassis that’s just about an inch deep. It uses a B&O audio system, including front-firing speakers along the bottom of the TV that deliver clear dialogue and, with the built-in subwoofers, surprisingly deep and booming bass. (The system can also be expanded with TCL’s Z100 FlexConnect speakers, which I’ll be testing soon.)\n\nTCL X11L specs Display type: Mini LED with super quantum dots Backlight: Blue LEDs HDR formats: Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10, HLG OS: Google TV HDMI inputs: 4 x HDMI 2.1 (one with eARC/ARC) Audio support: Dolby Atmos, DTS Virtual X Gaming features: 4K/144Hz, VRR (up to 288Hz), ALLM, FreeSync Premium Pro Sizes available (inches): 75, 85, 98\n\nFilmmaker mode is, as usual, the most accurate according to my testing. Grayscale performance is the best I’ve seen from TCL, with the only perceptible issue being that it crushes black a bit. With default settings, the TCL tracks a little under the EOTF curve (meaning as the gray approaches white, it isn’t quite as bright as it should be). When I increased the brightness from the default 50 to 70, it tracked the EOTF almost perfectly and still tracked grayscale very well, apart from the small near black issue, which was still a little too dim. It’s not quite as accurate as the LG G5 OLED, but it’s comparable to the Sony Bravia 9. And even in Filmmaker, the TCL can get significantly brighter than either.\n\nDefault Filmmaker mode isn’t the brightest of the modes available, with a 10 percent window peaking at 2,789 nits, but the X11L can easily get brighter. With my Konica Minolta LS-100 luminance meter (which is more reliable over 6,000 nits than either my colorimeter and spectrophotometer) I measured just over 8,800 nits from a 5 percent window in Filmmaker with brightness at 100, local contrast at high, and peak brightness set to boost. By comparison, the mini-LED TCL QM9K hit 5,844 nits, and the brightest OLED of last year, the LG G5, topped out at 2,340 nits, both also in Filmmaker mode.\n\nWhile it’s great that the TV can hit that, especially in its most accurate color mode, for the vast majority of people and their living rooms it isn’t necessary. For most of my viewing I set the brightness at 70, local contrast at medium, and peak brightness at high. If I had the light off, I sometimes turned the brightness down further because the extra brightness wasn’t necessary for the situation.\n\nChanging the brightness is quicker than on any other TV because TCL added brightness buttons (and a picture mode button) to the side of the remote. It’s something probably most appreciated by reviewers and display nerds like myself, but I can’t overstate my joy when I first saw the buttons. Otherwise it’s just like last year’s TCL TV remote, including an input select button, a mic for voice commands, and a settings button, and it’s backlit.\n\nThe backlit remote is similar to last year’s, with useful buttons including input select, and… …new brightness and picture mode select buttons on the side of the remote are the best addition since remote backlighting.\n\nI know a lot of TV reviewers, and some of them told me Movie mode is more accurate than Filmmaker on their samples, so I went back and did some more testing. And while Movie mode is brighter at its default settings, it wasn’t as accurate in my testing. But while comparing the two modes, I did notice that as the day went on, the red channel of the grayscale became slightly less accurate.\n\nI re-ran my normal barrage of tests first thing in the morning, and they were close to the very accurate measurements when I first set up the TV. I then left the TV on the Olympics for four hours before re-measuring with the same tests, and sure enough, the red channel measurements in the grayscale test were lower than they were in the morning. Now, while the change shows up in testing, the difference is minor and happens over the course of hours. It’s not something I noticed during my time watching the TV. Still, if you’re considering a $7,000 TV, this feels like something you might want to know about.\n\nHow I test TVs I set up each TV in my living room on my home theater credenza. I stream movies and shows through the TV’s apps, play discs on a Magnetar UDP900 MkII 4K Blu-Ray player (including the Spears & Munsil Ultra HD Benchmark disc) and movies from a Kaleidescape Strato V player, and play games on my Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. This is done at different times of the day and under different lighting conditions, with curtains open, with lamps and overhead lights on, or with blackout curtains up to keep the room dark. While I am a certified ISF Level 3 calibrator, I do not calibrate the TVs before measurement, as the overwhelming majority of TV owners don’t bother. So it’s important to know how well the TVs perform out of the box, with minor tweaks in the menu anyone can do. For measurement, I use Portrait Displays’ Calman color calibration software, a Murideo 8K Seven pattern generator, an X-rite i1 Pro 3 spectrophotometer, Portrait Displays’ C6 HDR5000 colorimeter, a Konica Minolta LS-100 luminance meter, and Leo Bodnar 4K lag tester.\n\nOn the contrary, everything I watched on the X11L during my time with it was spectacular. The fire and explosions during the desert chase in Mad Max: Fury Road look dazzling. The lush green trees of Rivendell are inviting and realistic. And the blooming control is by far the best I’ve seen from a mini LED, even better than last year’s TCL flagship, the QM9K. There’s a sharp separation between bright elements that are right next to black. It’s still not at the level that OLED can achieve with its pixel-level control, but its performance is closer than it’s ever been.\n\nThe X11L arrived at my home the Friday before the Super Bowl, and I used it to watch a bunch of events during the Winter Olympics. Through all of it, the TV has handled the fast motion extremely well. Sports picture mode adds motion compensation and some clarity settings — noise reduction, super resolution, and sharpness — but is far too blue for my tastes. Instead, I left it in Filmmaker mode and turned on some of those settings while watching sports, which is easy to do in the Picture Settings menu. Motion compensation at low was enough to make a football pass or triple lutz smooth without looking artificial, although bumping it up to medium was too much. The noise reduction and super resolution settings improved 1080p broadcast TV signals by upscaling the image and cleaning up unwanted artifacts. I wouldn’t put the processing at the same level as Sony, but it’s definitely better than I’ve seen from TCL before.\n\nGoogle OS on the X11L also runs smoothly. The apps I used regularly — HBO Max, Prime Video, Peacock, and Netflix — all booted up quickly, and navigation was snappy. The X11L is also an excellent gaming TV, handling motion well and supporting high frame rates from consoles and PC. I spent time on the road in Forza Horizon 5 and F1 24 on both my Xbox Series X and my PC and never experienced screen tearing or smearing. I also never had any issue with input lag.\n\nWith the highest peak brightness I’ve ever measured, the X11L certainly does light the lights. The X11L uses Google TV as its operating system, which runs quickly and smoothly. The X11L has front-facing B&O speakers behind a grille that runs the length of the TV. Colors on the TCL are absolutely stunning, and images look incredibly realistic.\n\nWith every TV manufacturer hyping RGB LED TVs this year — and TCL itself releasing an RGB LED TV this year — it may seem like a gamble to stick with mini LED for its flagship, even if it does push the technology forward. We won’t know for sure until the bevy of RGB LED TVs is released if the claims of their color accuracy and brightness will prove true with actual content, not just carefully curated demo screens.\n\nBut maybe the fact that TCL’s choice of mini-LED for the X11L is a hint that RGB LED isn’t quite ready to overtake mini LED — if it ever does. We also don’t know how the X11L will compare to the pricing of 2026 RGB LED TVs. Last year’s 100-inch Hisense UX is currently available for $13,000 (down from $20,000), which is still considerably higher than the $10,000 TCL is asking for the 98-inch X11L.\n\nBased on my experience with it over the past couple weeks, though, the TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV is poised to be the best TV of the year. At the very least, what TCL has been able to achieve by pushing mini-LED technology forward is incredibly impressive.\n\nEven though it’s an incredible TV to watch, it’s hard to recommend someone go out and buy the X11L right now, especially since we don’t yet know how it will stack up to RGB LED. Historically, TCL TV prices come down quite a bit as the year goes on. The 85-inch X11K from last year, which started at $10,000, can now be found for $3,500, so there’s a good chance we’ll see the same with the X11L. If it manages to get within $1,000 of the Bravia 9 or LG G5, the X11L is worth it.\n\nPhotography by John Higgins / The Verge"

            "content": "It’s that time of year: a whole bunch of Pokémon news is incoming. February 27th is the date the franchise first debuted, and The Pokémon Company uses it as a chance to outline its plans in a Pokémon Presents showcase. Last year’s event included the announcement of Pokémon Champions, and the 2026 edition should be particularly big, as this year represents the franchise’s 30th anniversary.\n\nTCPi says simply that it will feature “the latest news and updates from the world of Pokémon,” without getting into any specifics. But there’s a good chance we’ll hear about the next mainline entry in the series given that Scarlet and Violet launched back in 2022. Personally I’m hoping for an unexpected spinoff along the lines of Pokémon Sleep.\n\nOne thing we do know is that after the show ends, both Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen are getting a re-release on the Switch."

            "content": "The tranche of Jeffrey Epstein emails and files released on January 30th tie the infamous pedophile, sex trafficker, and influence peddler to elite figures across the tech industry. The world of cryptocurrency is no exception. Epstein’s connections are intriguing, disturbing — and worth mapping closely.\n\nWith his interest first piqued as early as 2011, Epstein was ahead of the game on crypto. The financier understood it as a tool for clandestine payments and shady international finance, and found prominent community members more than willing to welcome him. Bitcoin wasn’t even invented until 2009, which means all of Epstein’s crypto connections formed after his 2008 guilty plea for solicitation of a minor.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2019, Epstein invested in major crypto exchanges and software development firms. He grew close with one of the most influential yet troubling figures in the field, Tether cofounder Brock Pierce. Epstein even forged ties with Bitcoin’s core development team and mused about changing the technology of Bitcoin itself.\n\nBut while Epstein courted established crypto players, less reputable branches of his network — notably those tied to Vladimir Putin’s Russia — promoted sketchy investments and likely contributed to massive investor losses during the 2018–2019 height of speculative crypto-mania. Most stunningly, it now appears that one of Epstein’s most eager recruiters worked in crypto marketing and PR, repping both major fintech firms and fly-by-night crypto schemes… while also allegedly scouting women for him to victimize.\n\nEpstein’s interest in Bitcoin also aligned with his support for far-right politics. Bitcoin grew from the anarcho-libertarian “cypherpunk” movement, which dreamed of money free of the elite corruption that Epstein has come to represent. But most of the players Epstein supported, including the now publicly traded Coinbase, aligned instead with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel’s authoritarian and bigoted “tech right” — seemingly in part thanks to Epstein’s influence.\n\nThere’s no evidence Epstein succeeded in shaping crypto’s underlying technology, but his backing for its most extreme political tendencies has had major long-term impacts. That includes strengthening firms that have since become massive channels for funding to Donald Trump — himself, of course, extensively tied back to Epstein.\n\nBrock Pierce: “I had a Great Time With the Girls”\n\nThe most ominous and significant of Epstein’s crypto connections was also likely his first: Brock Pierce.\n\nPierce is a cofounder of Tether, a so-called “stablecoin” that uses blockchain tokens to track US dollars. Epstein met him at the Mindshift Conference held on Epstein’s private island, Little St. James in 2011. A representative for Pierce told the The Hollywood Reporter that Pierce did not know who Epstein was at the time. Mindshift was organized by a literal illusionist named Al Seckel, and emails uncovered by Protos seem to show that Epstein viewed the event as a disaster. He found Pierce one of the event’s few bright spots.\n\nBased on the emails, Pierce and Epstein grew closer over the course of 2011 and 2012, and by March of 2012 Pierce was apparently aware of Epstein’s real passion. “I had a great time with the girls,” Pierce appeared to email Epstein. Just two months later, Epstein offered to arrange a meeting between Pierce and “my new Russian” in Los Angeles. Pierce also appears to have met with Epstein and former Harvard president Larry Summers at Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse to discuss crypto at some point between 2008 and 2015.\n\nBefore meeting Epstein, Pierce had already faced allegations of involvement with the abuse of minors and possession of child sexual abuse material as a young executive at Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), an internet startup, in the early 2000s. In a 2014 letter about the incident, Pierce wrote that one accuser, Michael Egan, had used allegations against Pierce and director Bryan Singer “to extort money.” Pierce was never charged, and Egan later dropped allegations against other Hollywood figures. But Egan’s claims against Singer, who was closely associated with DEN, stood — and were later joined by other accusations.\n\nEven Epstein’s ties to Steve Bannon may have begun with crypto\n\nIncredibly, it may have been Pierce who connected Jeffrey Epstein to Steve Bannon, with whom Pierce had a business relationship dating back to 2005. While the origins of the Epstein-Bannon relationship are still murky, Pierce and Epstein appeared to discuss Bannon in December 2016 emails, in which Epstein refers to Bannon as a “pretty smart puppet master.” That’s well before what was previously understood to be the first link between Bannon and Epstein, a dinner arranged by author Michael Wolff in October of 2017.\n\nEpstein’s interest in cryptocurrency was seemingly fueled by his continuing relationship with Pierce. In May of 2013, Pierce emailed Epstein about his efforts to buy the Japan-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. The same year, Epstein enrolled in a general “Introduction to Cryptography” course offered online by Stanford. The course included “methods that ensure both confidentiality and integrity” in encrypted messaging and specifically covered public-key cryptography, a fundamental building block of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlso in May of 2013, Epstein emailed a third party about a possible new cryptocurrency in connection with Pierce, which Epstein describes as “Bit coin without the seediness.” This may have been a reference to what would become Tether. Pierce has said he had no operational role at Tether after 2015, but the firm has faced considerable criticism since then for misrepresenting the holdings backing Tether, and was fined $41 million in 2021 by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nTether has grown into the world’s largest dollar stablecoin, and much or all of the $185 billion in conventional dollar reserves backing its tokens are custodied by Cantor Fitzgerald — owned by another Epstein contact, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, until the recent transfer of control to Lutnick’s sons.\n\nPierce did not reply to requests for comment sent by The Verge.\n\nMaking Bitcoin “More Private”\n\nThe latest Epstein dump has also revealed his 2014 investment in Blockstream, a cryptocurrency development firm headed by one of the field’s pioneers, Adam Back. Back has since described the investment as coming through a fund run by Joichi Ito, in which Epstein was a limited partner.\n\nBlockstream cofounder Austin Hill can be seen in the emails tentatively arranging a visit to Epstein’s Little St. James island, appearing to write in an April 2014 message that “Fri/Saturday on the island are still possible.“ On April 19th, 2014, Epstein told another crypto developer, Amir Taaki, that he’d had “Andy Back [sic]… on my island this weekend.” Blockstream, Back and Hill have not confirmed or denied these visits took place. Blockstream did not reply to a request for comment on Back’s relationship with Epstein.\n\nBack was one of the early “cypherpunks” who laid the groundwork for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Back’s “Hashcash” paper is cited in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, and Back is among the pioneers sometimes suspected of being Satoshi Nakamoto, the still-pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Blockstream and Back have played significant roles in shaping the development of Bitcoin over the past 15 years.\n\nIt has been known since 2019 that Epstein also donated at least $525,000 to the MIT Media Lab, which used some of those funds to support developers working on the Bitcoin protocol. In a 2015 email, disgraced former MIT Media Lab head Joichi Ito describes using Epstein’s gift funding to move quickly to bring several of those core developers in-house at the Media Lab. Ito refers to this as “taking control” of the developers.\n\nThe Media Lab’s funding of Bitcoin developers is particularly eyebrow-raising because of Brock Pierce’s indirect role in that takeover. The independent nonprofit Bitcoin Foundation had funded Bitcoin core developers until Pierce was elected director of the foundation in May of 2014. Members of the foundation soon began resigning because of the existing abuse allegations against Pierce, and within a year, the foundation had collapsed, laying off 90% of staff and announcing that it was “effectively bankrupt.”\n\nThis collapse, triggered by an Epstein friend, enabled the Media Lab, using Epstein’s funds, to “take control” of Bitcoin core developers.\n\nUnilaterally imposing changes on Bitcoin would have been difficult\n\nThese events have led to loose speculation that Epstein was trying to influence Bitcoin development. But Bitcoin’s 2018 “block size war,” a fierce debate over the amount of data that Bitcoin should be able to process, highlights how challenging this would have been. Bitcoin is an open-source protocol similar to email, not a single software package sold by a company, so changes can’t be unilaterally imposed by any single entity — even the “core” development team. When the “big block” side of the block size conflict ultimately lost, they simply split from Bitcoin and started their own cryptocurrencies. The threat of these “forks” makes major, unilateral changes very difficult.\n\nThe new emails show Epstein did have substantial discussions about the direction of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency development with Vincenzo Iozzo, who is believed to have been the “personal hacker” described as working for Epstein by an FBI informant. One of Epstein’s hobby horses was the creation of “Sharia compliant” digital currencies for use in the Middle East. Iozzo did not reply to a request for comment by The Verge by press time.\n\nBut Iozzo’s conversations with Epstein include inaccuracies — most significantly, the idea that Bitcoin is “anonymous.”\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin is pseudonymous: while real names aren’t attached, the network keeps a public record of all accounts and transactions, making it fairly easy for professional analysts — including those at major US government contractors like Chainalysis — to triangulate the real-world identities of active users. Amazingly, Epstein’s conversations with Iozzo circa 2014 partly revolve around the desire to “remove anonymity” from Bitcoin.\n\nThis raises the question of whether Epstein, mistakenly believing Bitcoin was protecting him, might have used the cryptocurrency in any of his activities.\n\nEpstein’s “Madam”\n\nWhile Epstein himself moved at the higher end of the crypto world, he appears to have put at least two of “his Russians” to work in the trenches: former pro-Putin activist Masha Drokova (aka Masha Bucher) and Russian Olympic snowboarder Maria Prusakova (aka Masha Prusso). Epstein’s emails appear to show both women helping place deceptive media coverage to repair Epstein’s reputation, while using the same tactics and personnel to pump sketchy cryptocurrency investments.\n\nDrokova and Prusakova were just one node in an apparently vast network producing and placing puff pieces about Epstein: one of Prusakova’s collaborators, Sarah Austin, has stated Epstein had “thousands of publicists.” Drokova reportedly joined Epstein’s reputation laundering operation in 2017, and soon incorporated the firm M&A PR Studio. Drokova and Prusakova appear to have placed dozens of articles with loosely supervised “contributor networks,” including Forbes, The Next Web, and Arianna Huffington’s Huffington Post and Thrive Global.\n\nThese networks were built to publish independent journalistic contributions with minimal editorial oversight, but they have been widely abused by fraudsters and low-rent marketers to disguise advertising as reporting. In addition to evidence of direct payments to their network of contributors, pieces placed by writers tied to Prusakova and Drokova show clear signs of promoting specific clients. In one particularly blatant case, a since-deleted writeup about Davos, bylined by Sarah Austin, included links to rental apartments that sources say were managed by Prusakova.\n\nEpstein’s emails indicate that another infamous blurb in The Next Web may have been engineered by Drokova. The piece approvingly shared Epstein’s views on Bitcoin… without mentioning his 2008 conviction. Dylan Love, author of that piece, appeared to email Epstein one month before its publication, saying that “Masha [Drokova] has made it clear that she wants me to write something about you.” In another email surfaced by Forbes, Epstein orders a $25,000 payment to Drokova and says she should “feel free to give some to Dylan.”\n\nIn 2017, Epstein forwarded himself a copy of a similar piece published at The Huffington Post and praising Epstein’s science funding while omitting mention of his crimes — and authored by a writer who also published a puff piece about Drokova herself at Thrive Global.\n\nSince Epstein’s death, Drokova has continued to build a profile in Silicon Valley as head of the firm Day One VC, including being named to Forbes “30 under 30” list in 2019.\n\nDay One’s investments include Sam Altman’s creepy eyeball-scanning cryptocurrency Worldcoin (Now simply “World”). On February 9, Drokova posted an apology to X for her two-year association with Epstein, admitting only to making a few introductions, work she claims was “unpaid.” Drokova wrote that she “was naive; I didn’t dig deep enough early on.” Drokova also claimed that Epstein “made me think I could be safe from the regime” after leaving Putin’s youth movement and moving to the US.\n\nBut many have questioned whether Drokova really turned her back on Putin — and indeed, the recent emails appear to show her asking Epstein for introductions to “adequate Russian oligarchs” to invest in her venture fund.\n\nIn addition to doing crypto PR, Prusakova was allegedly discussing helping Epstein recruit women\n\nMasha Prusakova is a much darker Epstein-crypto nexus. Prusakova competed for Russia in snowboarding in the 2006 Winter Olympics, and Olympic news site The Inquisitor found that her Olympic accreditation documents appear in the latest Epstein email release. Prusakova later studied law with Epstein’s apparent financial support, and also appears to have personally met Norwegian diplomat Terje Rød-Larsen in Paris on Epstein’s order.\n\nBy no later than 2013, Prusakova was allegedly discussing helping Epstein recruit women. In a 2013 email, Prusakova appears to write that she has “three cute and smart friends whom I can bring to your house” and that “Sometimes I think that I am your Paris based Ghislaine Maxwell.” In the same email, Prusakova discusses her prospects for admission to study law at Cornell. This is one of a few documents in which Prusakova’s name appears to have been redacted by the DOJ after the initial release, but the attribution has been preserved by archives including Jmail.\n\nEpstein appears to have later paid for some of Prusakova’s law studies at UC Berkeley from 2016–2019: In 2019 messages cited by The Inquisitor, Prusakova refers to “willingly and knowingly, indirectly, putting girls in danger” while recruiting “assistants” for Epstein as “the price to pay for Berkeley.” She continued to ask Epstein for work as a lawyer.\n\nBy 2018, though, Prusakova had also cofounded Crypto PR Lab, a firm that pitched crypto stories to myself and other reporters between 2018 and roughly 2020. These were largely sketchy crypto projects capitalizing on that era’s boom in so-called “Initial Coin Offerings.” In a text exchange from April of 2019, Prusakova appears to share a link to an article under her own byline at Thrive Global, while updating Epstein on third-party interest in acquiring Crypto PR Lab.\n\nWhether that sale was completed is unclear, but Prusakova soon transitioned to staff roles at crypto firms. For a period from 2021–2022, she was head of events at Polygon — a blue-chip project by crypto standards.\n\nDrokova did not respond to questions about her relationship with Epstein. Prusakova has scrubbed her online presence, and her most recent known employer, AethirCloud, did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe money at the end of the world\n\nWhatever Epstein’s agenda, he would have found directly manipulating Bitcoin’s code difficult. But funding the worldview behind it appears to have continued furthering Epstein’s geopolitical goals of mass unrest and elite impunity, even after his death.\n\nMt. Gox collapsed before Pierce and Epstein could invest in that exchange, but in 2014, Pierce facilitated a $3 million early investment by Epstein into Coinbase, now the largest crypto exchange in the United States.\n\nAs detailed by Decrypt, emails between Pierce and Epstein show that Fred Ehrsam, who cofounded the crypto exchange with CEO Brian Armstrong, sought a face-to-face meeting with Epstein before accepting the investment in 2014, when the firm was valued at $400 million. At its current value of $51 billion, Epstein’s $3 million Coinbase stake would be worth more than $380 million. Ehrsam has not commented publicly on the disclosures, and Coinbase and Ehrsam did not reply to requests for comment from The Verge by press time.\n\nCoinbase has since imposed its own strain of Epstein’s “anti-woke” agenda on its employees, hired spyware makers who helped target journalists, and become a nexus of right-wing political funding in the US. The firm implemented a corporate gag order on the discussion of politics at work in 2020. This was widely believed by employees to be intended to quash discussion of the Black Lives Matter movement and the killing of George Floyd, paralleling Epstein’s efforts to delegitimize #MeToo and other “woke” resistance to elite abuses.\n\nBitcoin is intended to thrive when states begin to fail\n\nHacking Team was named a “Corporate Enemy of the Internet” by Reporters Without Borders in 2013, and a 2015 hack of the firm showed CEO David Vincenzetti habitually ending emails with the Italian fascist slogan “boia chi molla” — “death to those who surrender.” Members of the Hacking team at the time claimed the contents of the hack were “not true,” but the Italian government soon revoked their international trade license.\n\nAfter the hiring of former Hacking Team members became public knowledge, Coinbase removed them, with CEO Brian Armstrong citing “a gap in our diligence process” for their hiring. Notably, Epstein is also linked to international spyware via Ghislaine Maxwell’s father Robert, who has been suspected of distributing compromised spyware called PROMIS.\n\nMost substantively, Coinbase spearheaded the formation of the Stand With Crypto activist front and the Fairshake political action committee. According to Follow the Crypto, Fairshake and two other closely linked cryptocurrency PACs spent a reported $131.5 million in 2024 races, with $85.1 million going to support Republicans and just $48.3 million going to Democrats.\n\nBitcoin is intended, among other features, to thrive when states — and with them, democracy — begin to fail. Its reputation as “digital gold” is rooted in right-wing ideas including Austrian economics and hard-money “goldbug” beliefs.\n\nThis dark worldview may have appealed to Epstein and his compatriots as much as any technological innovation. “Brexit, just the beginning,” he emailed Peter Thiel in 2016. “Return to tribalism,” he wrote of his predictions for the future. “Counter to globalization. Amazing new alliances … Finding things on their way to collapse was much easier than finding the next bargain.”\n\nBut Epstein wasn’t just making predictions — he was setting goals and working to foster instability he thought he could profit from. In 2018 and 2019, for instance, Epstein strategized with Steve Bannon about supporting far-right European politicians including Marine Le Pen.\n\nThis has all too much in common with the paranoid narratives of decline that suffuse Bitcoin culture — and the accompanying anti-democratic politics, fraud, and deception that seem designed to make those grim visions a reality."

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nUltrahuman is expanding its health monitoring ecosystem with the launch of a new flagship smart ring and a “biointelligence AI” platform upgrade. The Ring Pro is Ultrahuman’s third-generation smart ring, and promises up to 15 days of battery life before needing to recharge, alongside 250 days of on-device health history storage.\n\nThose are some significant improvements compared to its predecessor, the 2023 Ring Air, which provides 4-6 days of battery life and several days of offline data storage, according to user estimates. Ultrahuman has also made other upgrades to the Ring Pro, including a redesigned heart-rate sensor that improves signal during sleep and recovery, a faster dual-core processor, and safety improvements that allow the ring to be cut off fingers more easily in an emergency.\n\nThe Ultrahuman Ring Pro will ship with a new Pro Charging case that provides an additional 45 days of battery life and stores up to one year of ring data. The case features an integrated speaker and proximity tracker that allow users to find the device via the Ultrahuman app, wireless charging, and an LED indicator that displays battery level status.\n\nThe Ring Pro Charging Case includes a light bar that indicates how much battery life it has remaining. Image: Ultrahuman\n\nThe Ring Pro comes in gold, silver, black, and titanium color options, and is available in sizes 5-14. Preorders are launching today for $479 with global availability — except in the United States, where Ultrahuman is clashing with patents from rival smart ring provider Oura. Shipments start in March.\n\nThe rollout of Jade, Ultrahuman’s new AI platform upgrade, doesn’t exclude the US, and will be available to all global Ultrahuman users. Ultrahuman says that Jade is “the world’s first real-time biointelligence AI,” capable of pulling health data insights and actioning breathwork and atrial fibrillation (AFib) detection tasks. Future updates will allow Jade to do “much more,” according to Ultrahuman, including proactively flagging health concerns before they occur, controlling smart home functions like adjusting room temperature, and even ordering food.\n\nThe Jade AI-platform upgrade will be available to all Ultrahuman users globally. Image: Ultrahuman\n\nUltrahuman says the goal is to have Jade serve as an “autonomous health agent working 24x7 to improve your life,“ but it hasn’t specified when these additional features will be available."

Use the close button or Escape to return to the comic.\n\nIf you want to get a letter out of a Burmese prison, do not give it to the guards.\n\nPerhaps this is obvious, but when they told me I could write two a month — one to my embassy and one to Juliana — I was naive enough to try.\n\n\"All night,\" I wrote to Juliana.\n\n“A fluorescent flood light illuminates the clouds of mosquitoes feasting on me, which makes it hard to sleep, and when the mosquitoes retreat, the ants crawl in — in pulsing veins along the cell wall and floor, over every inch of skin all day.”\n\nI filled every centimeter of the official letter form they gave me.\n\n“But it’s all fine. I’ve already gotten used to it by now. I just want to see you.”\n\nThree days later…\n\n“Write bigger. And don’t say there are ants here.”\n\nSo I tried again.\n\n“Ju- I love and miss you so much. I am doing well physically and feeling more or less healthy — but mentally things are obviously rough…”\n\n“No.”\n\nAnd again.\n\n“Sorry.”\n\nI first landed in Myanmar in early May 2019, just in time for World Press Freedom Day.\n\nA decade earlier the country's military leaders had begun a partial democratization process that notably included the end of pre-publication press censorship.\n\nAfter elections in 2015, in which the military government had been trounced by the now-fallen democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi, they'd began handing over chunks of government to her quasi-civilian administration.\n\nThough representative, Suu Kyi's administration proved nearly as intolerant of its critics as the military had been, even if it still maintained wide public support.\n\nWhen I arrived, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had been sitting in the city's Insein Prison for two years.\n\nThe year they were arrested, in 2017, I was earning $12 an hour reporting for a rural Louisiana newspaper…\n\n...while our newly elected president channeled fury toward press pools at the back of his convention halls.\n\nAmerican journalism was facing its gravest threats, pundits were saying, and it wasn't even paying a living wage.\n\nI came to Myanmar because, if our worst fears were coming to pass, I thought its journalists might have something to teach me.\n\nIf I had come to Myanmar looking for lessons, Juliana had come hoping to simply grin and bear a consular posting that was not her first choice.\n\nWe met on the apps.\n\n“Hi Peidão*” (*person who farts a lot)\n\nOn our first date, over a shared bottle of beer, we lamented the rise of a global far right, and pined for the lost optimism of our youth.\n\nShe quoted Gramsci and Marx, and I pretended to have read them. I rushed the bill as soon as the beer finished, nervous about showing my ignorance.\n\nOn our next date, we both confessed we'd wanted to order another bottle that night.\n\nJuliana lived alone in an airy, three-bedroom apartment paid for by her country's foreign service.\n\nI lived downtown with a 6’3\" Brit who taught English three days a week and spent the other four ranking his all-time favorite black metal albums in YouTube videos.\n\nWe stayed mostly at hers.\n\nDespite the deteriorating press situation, it seemed like a time of great hope.\n\nOn May 6th, 2019, after 511 days in the country's infamous Insein Prison, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were released.\n\n“I can't wait to go to my newsroom now. I am a journalist. I am going to continue.”\n\nAnd in 2020, nationwide elections were deemed fair and credible by foreign and domestic observers.\n\nIt felt like a tide was shifting, in Myanmar and the US.\n\nJuliana's lease was coming to an end, and despite the pool and the sleek appliances at her compound, the thrill of downtown still pulled at me.\n\nWe found a secret palace hidden amid the shambles of the historic Muslim quarter...\n\n...where sunsets poured bronze light through the kitchen window and the muezzin call would metronome our days.\n\nWe were giddy...\n\n...and in love.\n\n“Baby there’s room in here… just enough for two in here. Baby there’s…”\n\nBreaking News: Myanmar leader is detained amid coup. Military declares state of emergency.\"\n\nOn February 1st, we were inundated with links. The coup had been unintentionally livestreamed and went viral.\n\n“Have you seen this?” “Wait… what?”\n\n“She was just filming a workout video.” “STOP.” “And there’s THE COUP right behind her!”\n\nTogether we watched the dozens of videos — from all corners of the internet — superimposing the infamous Myanmar Coup Dancer over history.\n\nAfter the coup, at precisely 8pm each night, seemingly everyone in Yangon stepped outside and slammed together pots or pans — any blunt objects close at hand — an ancient means of warding off evil, now a sign of resistance to military rule.\n\nThe protests were joyful at first.\n\nSigns: “My ex is bad but Myanmar military is worse.” “Ah shit here we go again.”\n\nUntil…\n\n\"Weeks of relatively peaceful protests turned deadly on Feb. 20th when two unarmed protesters were killed by security forces in the city of…”\n\nThe military began raiding newsrooms.\n\nIncluding my former employer, the investigative news site Myanmar Now, among the country's most staunchly anti-militarist outlets.\n\nOur Western friends were leaving.\n\n“Can we help Lorcan give away his books?”\n\nWe considered doing the same.\n\n“We can fly to Detroit, stay with my parents for a bit, and then road trip out to California.” “I get to meet the family Peidões?”\n\nOne night in April, just after 8pm.\n\nAn eerie hush settled over our street.\n\n“Danny! Get back!”\n\nA soldier's flashlight flooded our apartment.\n\nI booked a ticket to Detroit.\n\nText to Consular Official: “Hi, my name is Danny Fenster. I'm an American journalist working for Frontier Myanmar. I'm sure I don't have anything to worry about, but I did use to work at Myanmar Now, and I'm going to be flying out of Yangon on May 24th. I just wanted to let you know in case there was any cause for concern.”\n\n“Hi Danny, thanks for letting us know. We don't have any indication that there's reason to worry, You've given them ten days' notice so you should be fine.”\n\nText to Juliana from the airport: “lol these covid outfits got a pic w the ipad will send later can’t send pics with the burner phone”\n\nTexts from Juliana: “can’t wait to see it miss you”\n\n“Ahem… Could DANIEL JACOB FENSTER please report to the…”\n\n“Daniel Jacob? We have a few questions for you, related to…\n\n…an ongoing criminal investigation.”\n\nText to Juliana: “babe not joking call the embassy.”\n\nPEN America Demands Myanmar Release US Journalist Danny Fenster “Managing editor of one of the few independent news outlets was detained while attempting to board a flight out of the country Some 4,000 other people have been detained by the authorities in recent months…”\n\nThe Washington Post Democracy Dies in Darkness Asia & Pacific “American journalist is detained by Myanmar regime while trying to leave country Fenster, 37, is the fourth foreign journalist detained in Myanmar since the military seized power in a coup in February. The military government routinely publishes lists of \"wanted\" journalists, accusing them of affecting \"state stability,\" and has detained more than 70 journalists in total, according to media watchdogs.”\n\nCommittee to Protect Journalists “Myanmar arrests US editor Danny Fenster at Yangon airport Myanmar authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Frontier Myanmar managing editor Danny Fenster and allow him to travel freely outside the” [text is cut off]\n\nThe Guardian “US journalist detained in Myanmar while boarding flight home Family of Danny Fenster voice concern for his welfare after he was held by authorities in Yangon international airport”\n\nThey’d taken my electronics and my books.\n\n“Noon. Quiet Hour.” <click, lock>\n\nYet somehow, they'd missed the sepia notebook I'd been keeping since January.\n\nThe hardest thing in those initial days was the boredom. I had no news of the outside world to distract me. Nothing to fix my attention on.\n\nSo l scribbled to myself.\n\n“FRIDAY, 1pm Afternoons are the worst. Right now it's 1pm and I'm locked in my cell for ‘nap time.’ Every day from noon to 1:30pm it's quiet hour. We have to go lie down in bed and be quiet, which is actually quite fine by me. I try not to sleep so l'll be more tired at night. It's hard enough to fall asleep: they make us sleep with the light on, on top of a wooden pallet with a couple of blankets for padding. And then there are the mosquitoes biting and the ants…”\n\nI noted the endless rain…\n\n“Sheets of rain pouring down outside these bars, out into the yard, the pool that was a garden yesterday — filling the stone basin and my drinking water jar”\n\n…and my insect companions,\n\n“Drifting always to the corner, its legs splayed akimbo, forming an X with its limp antennae, legs dangling, at ease, any tensions having fled, it looks like underneath, on its insect face, it must be smiling at its oblivion, although of course it may have died in a drowning suffocating panic, but now it's free.”\n\n…my small victories,\n\n“‘Tidied' after interrogations today. Dirty laundry bag, hung shirts, turned clean clothes into a sweatpant-leg pillow.”\n\n…and my mounting dread.\n\n“2 sachets of coffee left, no toothpaste. Gotta wash some clothes soon.”\n\nAnd then one day…\n\nJuliana's package was my first indication that anyone knew where I was. It had taken several days to pass inspection.\n\nI'd heard there were books too, but the prison translator had to first certify that they contained no political content.\n\nJournal entry: “Just reflecting on how brilliant my wife is. She near telepathically included just about every essential item I’d been wanting. And she included a (new?) air-tight tupperware container, to keep the bugs out. Most of this she must have intuited. I also imagine her asking coworkers etc., ‘What to pack into a prisoners parcel.’”\n\nThe days passed…\n\npunctuated by the same routines,\n\nand occasional gifts.\n\n(And then one day:)\n\nLetter from Juliana: “Yangon, June 2nd, 2021. Danny, babe. You have no idea how much I miss you. I want you to know that everything is fine. Rose and Bud are well and healthy. Bryan is being a true warrior and is doing everything he can from the States. I am also doing the best I can in here. I spent the last nights alone at our apartment, looking around. It hasn't been long that we have moved in, but I feel like we have lived here for years. I LOVE this place. I love the beams on the ceiling, the open kitchen. I absolutely love the office — I have sat there a few times to talk to your family, with the fan on my face, and I understand why you like that spot so much. There was a power cut the other day — 4 hours in the heat — I think this is one of those things about living the full Myanmar experience. I saw a gecko two nights ago in our bedroom. I am 99% sure there is a rat in the kitchen (I know I have said that before, but now the noise is more constant. I have to record it for you). I am also observing the pigeons for you. I think there are less birds on our windowsill though — they might've heard that you were travelling on holidays. I don't go to the balcony in the mornings so often anymore, but I always go there in the afternoon. I have this image of you coming back home in the beginning of the evenings, so I go there every now and then and wait. I see the men going to the mosque for the afternoon prayers, the sandals — dozens of them! — aligned by the entrance. Everything and everyone so alive. Life passing busy as usual while we wait for good news, while I wait for you. Every single thing at this apartment reminds me of you, of this chapter of our lives. I love you so much. Please promise me that you'll be strong. I'm trying my best on my side, and I'm doing alright, I promise. A tiny bit of craziness, but I think it will add to my charm. Love you, peidão! I love you more. Ju.” After the guards rejected my third attempt at official correspondence with Juliana, rumor spread of a pending deal: two members of an armed ethnic insurgency in my ward would soon be released.\n\nI abandoned my written detente with the prison censors and scribbled out a long rambling note to Juliana.\n\n“Also what's going on in int'l news? In the US? Any big stories?\n\nP.S. plz send me some pictures of you! Things: fucking cashews! P.S. — Some additional books, if you can find them! \"What Is History\" and \"Homo Deus.\" The first is at Dom's & the second is either also at Dom's or at your place. Also, \"This Thing of Darkness,\" or something like that, is a book Lorcan gave me before he left. I think it's in that suitcase he gave me. These would be good ones. Do you think the US embassy has \"Grapes of Wrath\"? Being able to listen to podcasts and my own music would make all of this infinitely more bareable too — podcasts especially. Alas, I'm pretty sure headphones & electronics are banned. [frowny face] I love you so much. See you soon. Xoxo, Danny” The insurgent spoke no English. I willed him to understand me.\n\n“Please, take this to my wife.”\n\nIt felt like casting a bottled letter into the ocean.\n\n—\n\nIt wasn't long before the guards found my notebooks. Paper and ink were declared contraband in my ward.\n\n<click, lock>\n\nIf I couldn't record the experience, what did any of it matter?\n\nI was being forced — possibly for the first time since the advent of the iPhone — to sit, for hour after unending hour, from one interminable minute to another, with nothing to occupy my mind.\n\nof all the terror and discomfort l endured in prison, it was this —\n\nboredom\n\n— that nearly broke me.\n\nThere was a TV in our ward, but programming was limited, and all of it in Burmese anyway.\n\nA Buddhist monk, one of the only English speakers there, told me they used to watch BBC and Discovery Channel. But on the morning of the coup, the TV signal was cut completely.\n\nWhen it came back on, only state broadcasts remained.\n\n“That's how we knew the military had taken back control.”\n\nOne day, I noticed a prisoner fiddling with something.\n\nThe monk explained that for just a few thousand kyat or a handful of betel nuts, guards brought prisoners USB sticks full of Chinese action movies and Bollywood musicals, or TikTok reels of people being kicked in the nuts. Some even had small MP3 players they listened to illegal music on.\n\nl began scheming immediately.\n\nWhen I'd packed for Detroit, I'd left on my desk a Zoom H1n recorder with a microSD card inside.\n\nI scavenged the prison ward for paper, and, using a contraband pen, I wrote a note to Juliana describing the recorder's exact location. I made lists of all the podcasts I wanted to hear.\n\nWhen another detainee was paroled, I forced the notes on him with another map of the city.\n\nAnd then I waited.\n\n…\n\n“Monk?”\n\n“Sit.\n\nFocus your attention on the tip of your nose….\n\n…the sensation going in and out of your nostrils.”\n\nFor fifteen minutes, the monk watched me struggle.\n\nIt felt impossible.\n\n“Do this upon waking each morning, and for five minutes at the start of each hour, at least for the first few hours of the day…\n\nThen, when this becomes easy, up these hourly intervals to ten minutes, then fifteen.”\n\nSlowly…\n\n…a tolerance for boredom pervaded my waking moments.\n\nI could watch my thoughts\n\nmove\n\nfrom one to the next.\n\nI thought about the circumstances that had brought me to Myanmar. I'd wanted to learn from journalists standing up to unimaginable repression.\n\nBut I was also questioning the point of journalism altogether. Our problems did not stem from a scarcity of reliable reporting or facts.\n\nMoving abroad was my last-ditch effort to salvage some meaning from the work, so l might stay at it.\n\nBut when I arrived, I mostly felt overwhelmed by Myanmar's politics, home to more than 20 ethnic armies and several times as many militias even before the coup, each plagued by their own internecine power struggles. I’d felt inexpert and ill-placed.\n\nWho was to be telling the story of this place?\n\nSo l'd fallen into the role of editor, helping local writers and reporters tell their own stories to the English-speaking world.\n\nBut on my worst days, I still wondered if any of it mattered.\n\nMeanwhile..\n\nPost: “@amykurzweil\n\nOn Monday 5/24, my cousin Danny Fenster was imprisoned by the military in Myanmar for the \"crime\" of being a journalist. None of us have been able to communicate with him since. Here's how you can help:\n\n1) Spread the word! Spread the image! Share mine, or draw your own portrait of Danny! Post with the hashtag #BringDannyHome.\n\n2) Sign the petition linked in my profile. We're calling on the highest levels of office to…”\n\nI'd become a Myanmar story.\n\n[A collage of social media posts featuring art of Danny’s face and the hashtag #BringDannyHome] One day, in a makeshift military court inside the prison, a sympathetic translator surreptitiously flashed me a screenshot.\n\n“@RELIABLESOURCES CNN PARENTS OF DETAINED AMERICAN JOURNALIST SPEAK OUT”\n\nFacebook post: “Bryan Fenster is with Cara Quinn and 2 others Day 66. An overdue update, and one I wish were more positive. Yesterday morning we learned that Danny had a hearing on Monday, that neither the U.S. Embassy Rangoon, our family, nor his lawyer knew about. He was remanded once again to the prison, and there are still no official charges.”\n\n“Bryan Fenster is with Buddy Fenster and 2 others Day 92. Another hearing has come and gone, and again we wait. Danny remains in prison..”\n\n“Bryan Fenster is with Ethan Kurzweil and 4 others. Day 100. Today we hit a painful milestone, it marks the 100th day since my little brother, Danny Fenster, was wrongly detained in Myanmar, apparently, simply for being a journalist. Today, like every day, we are calling on the military in Myanmar to release Danny on humanitarian grounds and allow him to come home to us.”\n\n[A series of comments from social media]\n\n“Dominic Horner Sending lots of love to you and your family”\n\n“Jane Gleeson Sending continued prayers and love!”\n\n“Julie Muszynski I’m so sorry for all of you…”\n\n“Kim Maher Praying [praying hands emojis]”\n\n“Linda Finkelburg Stay strong. Your efforts will prevail.”\n\n“Lisa Harris [praying hands emojis]\n\n“Nathan Maung\n\n[A larger collage of dozens of social media posts featuring art of Danny’s face and the hashtag #BringDannyHome]\n\nOn days when the rain let up, I would spend the evening looking out toward what I guessed was my and Juliana's apartment.\n\nI imagined what she might be doing just then.\n\nIf I concentrated hard enough, I thought I could actually communicate with her.\n\n…\n\n“Delivery.”\n\n[A faceless guard hands Danny a care package from Juliana. He opens a bag of coffee to find a hidden note inside one of the packets.]\n\nNote: “Granola bar. TAL. Love you.”\n\n[Danny takes out the box of granola bars, opens it, and dumps the wrapped bars out. He examines and touches each bar, clearly looking for something hidden. He looks dismayed, and then peers inside the empty box to discover a small microSD card taped inside.]\n\nIt took several days of begging and bribing before another prisoner was able to help me set the terms of an hourly lease on an MP3 player from one of the other detainees.\n\nI walked as casually as I could back to my cell.\n\n<slide> [Danny inserts the microSD card into the MP3 player and turns up the volume.] <click> <tap tap tap>\n\n“Baby there’s room in here… Just enough for two in here…”\n\nIt was Juliana’s voice.\n\n“Ain’t nobody but you and me in here…”\n\nI replayed it again. And again.\n\n“...yea, what can we do in here…”\n\n“I love you babe. I miss you so so so much.”\n\nDrawing on paper: “I had no luck with the pictures so I will try again with Amy’s drawing. I love you babe. So so much. Stay strong, for me, for us! LOVE YOU, Ju”\n\nSomehow, Juliana had also downloaded the entire thirty-year archive of my favorite podcast and stuffed it all on that mircoSD card. As soon as I stopped replaying her singing, I heard another familiar voice...\n\n“From WBEZ Chicago… It’s THIS AMERICAN LIFE. I’m Ira Glass… stay with us…”\n\nFor whatever reason (which Juliana would later claim was not intentional), the first episode to play was from 2011, Episode 448: \"Adventure!”\n\nIn Act One, an expat Minnesotan named \"Luke\" gets pulled into a minor street brawl in Shenzhen, China, then flees. A few days later the police come asking questions, and then they lock him up.\n\n“It was, like, a Tuesday I think. I went in, and they're like, ‘We'll be back on Friday to let you know what's going on.’ And honestly, at that time I thought I was going to be released on Friday…\n\n“... I was thinking, OK, three nights, four nights, this is no problem. I'm kind of an adventurous soul. At this point, I'm still fairly calm. Like, well, I'm in a Chinese jail, this is crazy, but what a story.”\n\n“And in the end, how long did you end up staying in this detention center?”\n\n“Eight months…\n\nEight months.”\n\n“The cell was a rectangle, 10 by 15 feet… During storms, you couldn't hide from the rain blowing in, so everyone would get drenched… …up at 7, then breakfast… …thin rice water broth… … nap from 11:30 to 1:30… …The days became all the same — boredom punctuated by the occasional spasm of extreme emotion.” “In classic adventure stories, like The Odyssey, there isn't much fun. There's pain, fear, and death, and occasionally, if you're lucky… …small transformations.”\n\nOn a Friday afternoon that November, in a military court within the prison compound, I was found guilty of a slew of arcane crimes, including causing offense to the military, and sentenced to eleven years with hard labor.\n\nI was marched to the prison office, stripped of my street clothes and dressed in prison blues.\n\nBy the time I made it back to my cell, the others had been locked in for the night. I spent that evening desolate and crying, trying to comprehend the weight of eleven years.\n\nThat proved impossible, and so by the morning I'd convinced myself that, actually, I had to be convicted in order to be pardoned.\n\n“Why else would they give you a Covid test?”\n\nSure enough, on Monday morning, I was awoken earlier than everyone else.\n\n<unlock> “Pack up.”\n\nI never got to say goodbye.\n\nBy that evening, Burmese police were handing me over to a scrum of men, including the late Bill Richardson, former New Mexico governor, who'd made a second career negotiating the release of Americans detained abroad. They said they had a chartered jet taxing outside for me.\n\nIt had been six months.\n\nForeigners not deported directly from prison had to book tickets ten days before their departure so the government could monitor comings and goings.\n\nDanny on phone: “Hey babe... Oh, nothing much… What's new with you?”\n\nNovember 15th, 2021: Juliana booked her ticket that night.\n\nI thought I'd gone to Myanmar to learn how to defeat dictators, but Burmese journalists knew all along that such defeats are never final.\n\n“The New York Times U.S. Journalist Danny Fenster Is Freed From Myanmar Prison The release was a rare positive development in the country, which has been torn by violence since a February coup.”\n\n“The Detroit Jewish News Home Free: After Six Months in a Myanmar Prison, Journalist is with His Family in Huntington Woods”\n\n“Deadline Detroit With Hugs And A Haircut, Danny Fenster Readjusts In A Familiar Home Near Detroit - His Family's”\n\n“MICHIGAN Fenster after being freed from Myanmar: ‘I'm really happy to be on my way home' Detroit News staff and wire reports”\n\n“BBC Danny Fenster: US journalist freed from Myanmar jail”\n\nThe lesson is to keep reporting anyway..\n\n“Bryan Fenster is with Amy Kurzweil and 4 others. November 17, 2021 Day 178. Home Sweet Home. #BringDannyHome”\n\nto record for tomorrow…\n\n…the stories that today's victors would prefer we forget.\n\n“Hey Dan? Can you baste the turkey? I'm going to spin class.” “OK.” “And the Rubins are downstairs – they want to say hi. The Detroit Jewish News will stop by at 4. They just want a picture, then they'll leave us alone.” “OK, Ma—” “What time does she land?” “Soon.”\n\nBecause to suffer sucks, so you simply tell…\n\n“Danny!” “I can’t believe you’re home!” “You lost the man bun!” “You made it!” “We’re so happy you’re here.” “Mmmmwah! So handsome!” “Phew!”\n\n“Hey Dan… Dad’s waiting for ya in the car.”\n\nAnd sometimes, if you’re lucky…\n\n…you, find, in the telling…\n\n…that suffering transformed.\n\n[Danny and Juliana are reunited at the airport, embracing.]"

            "content": "With rare exceptions, phones are pretty boring these days. The good news is, a boatload of those rare exceptions are about to show up at once, courtesy of Mobile World Congress.\n\nThe tech industry’s biggest mobile show may not quite have the clout it once did, when the likes of Samsung, Sony, LG, and HTC showcased new flagships there each year, but it still attracts more phone launches than CES does two months earlier. It’s especially popular with the Chinese manufacturers who are still fighting for space in the global market, along with niche manufacturers who turn up with extra-durable “rugged” devices, or battery beasts that are more power bank than phone.\n\nThis year’s biggest event is expected to be Xiaomi’s launch on Saturday. Ever eclectic, it’s teased tablets, super-slim power banks, earbuds, and smart trackers among its MWC lineup, but all eyes will be on the Leitzphone. This collaboration between Xiaomi and Leica takes the former’s Xiaomi 17 Ultra — follow-up to one of the absolute best cameras in any phone last year — and slaps a rotating camera ring on the back, allowing you to physically scroll through the continuous optical zoom the phone’s telephoto provides. It’s a double whammy of novel camera hardware that may sit right on the edge of “gimmick” territory, but is at least a variation from the same old stuff.\n\nXiaomi should reveal an updated global version of its collaboration with Leica. Image: Xiaomi\n\nHonor will be up next, with its event set for Sunday. The company has already revealed the MagicPad 4 — apparently the thinnest fully fledged tablet around — and teased its next-generation foldable phone, also expected to be the world’s thinnest. But much more exciting than either is what the company promises will be a proper look at its so-called Robot Phone, first teased late last year in a concept video and shown in static prototype form at CES last month.\n\nFrom what we’ve seen, it’s certainly more phone than robot, but the gimbal-stabilized camera arm that unfolds out of the phone’s back is undeniably novel. It’s like a cross between a smartphone and a DJI Osmo Pocket, with teasers hinting at AI features and a cheery, WALL-E-esque sense of character. With Honor also teasing the reveal of its first foray into full humanoid robotics, expect it to lean hard on its robot credentials.\n\nI have my doubts about how realistic Tecno’s magnetic modular concept phone is, but it does look pretty slick. Image: Tecno\n\nAnd those are just the big two. Expect to see more from Nothing, which is launching its Phone 4A series and a new pair of over-ear headphones at its own event on March 5th, but is almost certain to tease more details on both over the next few days. Tecno has promised a modular, magnetic concept smartphone with attachable lenses and action camera; Vivo has announced some sort of reveal of its camera-centric X300 Ultra flagship; and Lenovo, which simply loves to bring a weird and wacky concept device to the show, is teasing its own announcements.\n\nWill anything be as silly as last year’s Realme concept, which strapped a DSLR telephoto onto the back of a smartphone? Image: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nWhen you’re competing with Apple for attention, playing it safe won’t get you very far\n\nAnd you can’t blame them, not least when Apple has waded in to promise its own week of announcements starting… Monday, the same day that MWC officially kicks off. In true Apple fashion, we don’t know for sure what’s coming, but affordable MacBooks and the midrange iPhone 17E have both been heavily tipped. When you’re competing with Apple for attention, playing it safe won’t get you very far.\n\nI’m at least half a cynic when it comes to these outlandish hardware announcements. The ones that you can actually buy are often little more than gimmicks, and the ones you can’t usually feel like no more than marketing stunts. But in the past 10 days, we’ve had the Pixel 10A and Galaxy S26 in quick succession, both minimal upgrades that lean on fractional spec bumps and AI additions to justify their existence. I wouldn’t hold my breath for next week’s iPhone 17E to revolutionize much either. As Allison Johnson put it in her S26 Ultra preview this week, “hardware thrills are hard to get these days.” MWC has them in spades."

Last year featured camera phone concepts with detachable lenses, a Lenovo laptop with a folding screen, and an Infinix handset with a solar panel in its back.

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nLess than 24 hours before the deadline in an ultimatum issued by the Pentagon, Anthropic has refused the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted access to its AI.\n\nIt’s the culmination of a dramatic exchange of public statements, social media posts, and behind-the-scenes negotiations, coming down to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s desire to renegotiate all AI labs’ current contracts with the military. But Anthropic, so far, has refused to back down from its two current red lines: no mass surveillance of Americans, and no lethal autonomous weapons (or weapons with license to kill targets with no human oversight whatsoever). OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to the new terms, while Anthropic’s refusal had led to CEO Dario Amodei being summoned to the White House this week for a meeting with Hegseth himself, in which the Secretary reportedly issued an ultimatum to the CEO to back down by the end of business day on Friday or else.\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, Amodei wrote, “I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community.”\n\nHe added that the company has “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner” but that in a “narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values” — going on to specifically mention mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons. (Amodei mentioned that “partial autonomous weapons … are vital to the defense of democracy” and that fully autonomous weapons may eventually “prove critical for our national defense,” but that “today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons.” He did not rule out Anthropic acquiescing to the military’s use of fully autonomous weapons in the future but mentioned that they were not ready now.)\n\nThe Pentagon had already reportedly asked major defense contractors to assess their dependence on Anthropic’s Claude, which could be seen as the first step to designating the company a “supply chain risk” — a public threat that the Pentagon had made recently (and a classification usually reserved for threats to national security). The Pentagon was also reportedly considering invoking the Defense Production Act to make Anthropic comply.\n\nAmodei wrote in his statement that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” He also wrote that “should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.”"

            "content": "After years of appeals, Google has finally received conditional approval to export high-precision geographic information out of South Korea, a move that opens the door to let the company provide proper Google Maps services in the country, such as walking and real-time driving directions.\n\nThe move reverses a long-standing policy on data restrictions that had essentially made Google Maps and Apple Maps non-functional in the country. Google has so far provided maps services in South Korea using high-resolution, 1:5,000 scale map data, but without the ability to export that data to its servers, the company couldn’t offer features like turn-by-turn navigation or detailed listings for businesses.\n\nSouth Korea has resisted Google’s appeals since 2011, arguing that the company’s precise satellite maps could endanger national security by exposing sensitive military sites when combined with commercial imagery and online data. Given that South Korea remains technically at war with North Korea, the government is cautious about exposing such locations, and had until now demanded Google set up a data center in the country and obscure sensitive locations.\n\nThe green light comes with strict rules designed to protect sensitive military and infrastructure sites. The South Korean government will verify compliance before any data leaves the country; any images of South Korean territory used in Google Maps and Google Earth must comply with national security regulations; and historical imagery in Google Earth and Street View must obscure sensitive military sites. Google is also required to either remove or limit coordinate data for South Korean locations, and only essential data for navigation and routing can be exported.\n\nThe government also requires all data processing to be done on servers operated by Google’s local partners. Sensitive topographic and military data remain off-limits, and any updates to military or security sites must be carried out promptly on domestic servers at the government’s request.\n\nGoogle did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe move will no doubt send ripples through Korea’s domestic maps market, which has seen local navigation apps such as Naver Map, T Map, and Kakao Map thrive in the relative absence of providers like Google or Apple.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The government is urging Google to help grow South Korea’s geospatial industry so that exporting the data benefits not just the tech giant, but also domestic innovation and economic growth.\n\nGoogle has not yet said if it would set up a data center in South Korea. The company operates an array of data centers in Asia, including in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and Malaysia.\n\nThe government also outlined new measures to handle potential security incidents related to the export of high-resolution maps. The ministry said it would work with Google to set up a “security incident prevention and response framework” to manage potential risks before any data leaves the country. For situations involving imminent threats to national security, a technical “red button” mechanism will be implemented, allowing for rapid emergency response.\n\nIn addition, South Korea will require a local officer to be stationed in-country to maintain constant communication with the government and ensure smooth handling of any security incidents."

            "content": "Ultrahuman on Friday unveiled a new smart ring with longer battery life and a redesigned form factor, as the Bengaluru-based wearable maker seeks to revive its U.S. business that was disrupted last year by a patent dispute with rival Oura.\n\nThe Ring Pro, Ultrahuman’s third-generation smart ring, offers up to 15 days of battery life — compared with four to six days on the Ring Air — and is priced at $479. It will be available for pre-orders globally, excluding the U.S., with shipments beginning in March.\n\nUltrahuman’s U.S. business was disrupted in October 2025 after the U.S. International Trade Commission — a federal agency that handles trade disputes — ruled in Oura’s favor in a patent dispute. The ruling prevented the startup from importing new ring inventory into the country, although existing retail stock continued to be sold. The blow was significant. The U.S. accounted for about 45% of Ultrahuman’s roughly 700,000 daily active users worldwide, according to co-founder and CEO Mohit Kumar.\n\nIn August 2025, Ultrahuman also filed a separate patent infringement case against Oura in the Delhi High Court, where the matter remains pending.\n\nMeanwhile, to work around Oura’s patent, Ultrahuman developed the Ring Pro with a new design, Kumar told TechCrunch, adding that the device has been submitted to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance. U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance to confirm it can legally be imported into the country.\n\nDespite the U.S. disruption, Ultrahuman is currently operating at an annualized revenue run rate of about $150 million, Kumar said. It reported $64 million in operating revenue in the financial year ended March 2025. The startup remains profitable after tax, although margins are expected to narrow due to litigation costs, tariffs, and the redesign effort, he added.\n\nAlongside the new ring, Ultrahuman introduced Jade, a real-time “biointelligence” system that analyzes user health data across its devices and services to generate personalized insights and recommendations.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The device can store up to 250 days of health data and weighs about 5% to 6% more than the Ring Air, launched in July 2023 at $349.\n\nUltrahuman has also introduced a Pro Charger with up to 45 days of battery life to support on-the-go charging and enable faster updates and diagnostics through direct case connectivity. The charger also supports wireless charging via Qi, the same standard used by most modern smartphones.\n\nUltrahuman’s Pro Charger Image Credits:Ultrahuman\n\nWomen account for about 68% of Ultrahuman’s user base, up from roughly 65% a year earlier, Kumar said, reflecting strong adoption of the startup’s women’s health features.\n\nUltrahuman also offers subscription-based services across its broader health platform, including a coaching and recovery program called PowerPlugs, the Blood Vision metabolic panel, Ultrahuman Home, and a continuous glucose monitoring offering. Subscriptions contribute about 16% of Ultrahuman’s revenue, while Blood Vision accounts for roughly 5% to 6% of the business, Kumar said.\n\nUltrahuman’s key growth markets include the UK, Canada, Australia, and India, Kumar told TechCrunch, with the latter contributing about 8% to 9% of overall revenue after recent investments in local customer support.\n\nGlobal smart ring shipments grew nearly 80% year-over-year in 2025, driven by demand for compact wearables with advanced sleep tracking and longer battery life, said Anshika Jain, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. Oura continues to lead with more than two-thirds of the market, while Ultrahuman holds the second position.\n\nJain added that future leaders in the category will be defined by sensor accuracy, AI-driven insights, and seamless ecosystem integration.\n\nSeparate IDC data showed global smart ring shipments rising about 30% year over year in Q3 2025 to nearly 1 million units, driven in part by demand for screenless fitness trackers, said Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India. Ultrahuman captured roughly 25% of the market during the period, per IDC.\n\nFounded in 2019, Ultrahuman has raised about $55 million to date and counts Alpha Wave Incubation, Blume Ventures, Steadview Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners among its investors.\n\nUltrahuman, Kumar said, is building additional production capacity to support demand for the Ring Pro over the coming months."

Discovery.\n\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for the legacy studio, and would walk away from the deal.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\n\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\n\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration shelved or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\n\nNetflix had announced its intent to acquire WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks.

            "content": "Jack Dorsey has long been an open admirer of Elon Musk. Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey announced that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly half its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.\n\nIt isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\n\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\n\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\n\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”\n\nThe two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop. The Pentagon believes it should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.\n\nAmodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday 5:01 p.m. deadline Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. An Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch Amodei’s statement does not mean the firm is walking away from negotiations and is continuing to engage in good faith with the Department going forward.\n\n“The contract language we received overnight from the Department of War made virtually no progress on preventing Claude’s use for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons,” an Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch. “New language framed as compromise was paired with legalese that would allow those safeguards to be disregarded at will. Despite DOW’s recent public statements, these narrow safeguards have been the crux of our negotiations for months.”\n\nThe Department of Defense has attempted to force Amodei’s hand by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding. The DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense.\n\nAmodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

There’s no need to be nasty about it.”\n\nThis article has been updated with a statement from an Anthropic spokesperson."

It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.\n\nThe startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.\n\nWith a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round. Form has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook. The company plans to go public next year."

(Sorry, I couldn’t in good conscience write “ebike” in that sentence a third time.)\n\nThe Soltera 3 is a class 1 electric bike, meaning it has a top speed of 20 miles per hour. (Motor-assisted, of course. Your legs combined with a downhill can get this thing going a whole lot faster.) It also lacks any sort of throttle control. However, the bike's pedal assist is super responsive and offers immediate aid with the slightest bit of rider input.\n\nIt has a claimed range of up to 70 miles—though, given how hilly my area is and how much assistance I typically use on an ebike, I got closer to 50 on a full charge—and takes less than two hours to charge its integrated battery from flat to full.\n\nCarbon Belt\n\nPhotograph: Michael Venutolo-Mantovani\n\nOK, now that all of the spec sheet info is out of the way, we can talk about the coolest part of the Soltera 3: It has a carbon belt in place of a chain."

            "content": "The new wave of AI-powered technologies have almost entirely taken over the apps and digital services we use every day, from photo editors to fitness trackers. There's even a notable AI app available for podcasts too. It’s called Huxe.\n\nAt the core of Huxe is a daily brief, a sort of personal productivity podcast tailored to your tastes and requirements, generated from the sources you pick. Connect up your calendar and email account, and every morning you get a quick audio summary to get you set for the day. The idea is that a 15-minute audio podcast can replace the much longer amount of time you'd otherwise spend trying to figure out what's happening with your inbox and your schedule.\n\nThe audio emphasis of Huxe is no surprise, as the team behind the app previously worked on Google NotebookLM, a research tool that has its own podcast-style Audio Overviews feature. Huxe is similar, but it draws information from your emails and calendar entries.\n\nThere's more to Huxe as well, including audio deep dives on any topic of your choice, as well as news summaries. The app is completely free to use right now, and you can sign up through the apps for Android or iOS.\n\nGetting Started\n\n***01-interests.jpg\n\nRegistering interests with Huxe.\n\n(David Nield)\n\nTo start taking advantage of Huxe’s personalized audio production powers, you need to tell it a little bit about yourself. As you work through the setup process, which includes supplying an email address and your name, you'll be prompted to connect your email and calendar accounts. (Google and Outlook accounts are both supported.)\n\nYou'll also be asked to choose a few topics that you're interested in from a list, generated by what's in your inbox and on your schedule—click Edit to make changes, and Add to add interests that Huxe hasn't picked up on yet. You can specify pretty much any topic you like, and Huxe will understand what you mean.\n\nWhen you get into the app proper, you are introduced to what are called livecasts, which are like radio stations for AI-generated speech content: For me, these livecasts have titles such as Big Tech Roundup, Today in AI, and Product Drops, which gives you some idea of what to expect. You can also get audio summaries about specific companies, such as Apple and Meta in my case.\n\n***02-deepcast.jpg\n\nDeepCasts can be created with a single text prompt.\n\n(David Nield)\n\nUsing the menu button in the top right corner, you can change your account settings and edit your interests, as well as change the voices used for the hosts of your daily brief. Via the + (plus) button in the lower right corner, you're able to generate a DeepCast (a deep dive) on the topic of your choosing, as well as your own live stations.\n\nI tried to get the app to give me a DeepCast on the history of the band R.E.M., and it produced a relatively insightful and perfectly accurate (if a little generic) 15-minute clip in just a few seconds. As with the Audio Overviews in NotebookLM, you get two AI characters talking to each other about the subject at hand, podcast-style.\n\nAs always with any app that connects to your email and calendar, you're trusting the developer to handle your data responsibly. The full Huxe privacy policy is here, and while there's obviously a lot of data recorded—which is what makes the daily briefing and the other features work—the company says it won't use any personally identifiable email or calendar data to train its AI models. According to the privacy policy, there’s still a possibility some of your data is being shared with third-party LLM and voice synthesis partners—each of which have their privacy policies—that help Huxe make your podcasts. So take a hard look at what sorts of sensitive things are in your email inbox and your calendar before handing over permissions.\n\nYour Daily Briefing\n\n***03-brief.jpg\n\nThe daily brief combines emails, news, and appointments.\n\n(David Nield)\n\nYou can wait for Huxe to deliver a briefing every morning (you'll get a notification when it's ready), or you can generate one right away by tapping the play button in the center of the app's home screen. These briefings typically include a summary of what's in your inbox, the latest news relevant to your interests, and the next events on your calendar."

            "content": "Blood pressure is simultaneously the least exciting yet one of the most important vital signs that a fitness tracker can measure. Unlike a pedometer or sports watch, it’s not going to incentivize you to get active. Unlike a continuous glucose monitor, it’s not going to help you lose weight. A gigantic blood pressure cuff isn’t exactly a gorgeous or enticing accessory to wear. In fact, getting your arm squeezed so tight can be downright claustrophobic.\n\nBut there’s a reason why blood pressure is one of the first tests you get at the doctor’s office. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is one of the top killers in the United States. It can result in conditions like heart attacks or strokes. There are usually no symptoms; hypertension is called “the silent killer” for a reason. Nearly one in three people worldwide has it. And unlike diseases like cancer, we already have simple, readily available tools to treat it, like exercise and reducing the amount of salt that you eat.\n\nLast year, a few fitness trackers debuted hypertension notifications in their suite of features—most notably, the Apple Watch. Unlike the Apple Watch, the Aktiia Hilo band does not merely notify you when you have signs of hypertension. It monitors your blood pressure up to 25 times a day, 24 hours a day. Aktiia reached out to me for testing when it launched; WIRED is the first in the United States to test it. This device could change many lives for the better when it goes on sale in the US later this year. (It's available now in some countries.)\n\nLight and Sound\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nThe Aktiia Hilo comes in two parts—the slim, cuffless band you wear every day and a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuff you use to calibrate the device every month or so. Both have to be connected to the Hilo app (iOS, Android). Once both are connected, the app will remind you to abstain from alcohol, caffeine, and exercise for at least 30 minutes beforehand and to sit and relax with your back supported for at least five minutes."

Who can forget Jessica allowing her dog to sip wine or an insulted Carlton throwing his fiancee's engagement ring into a pool? Meanwhile Lauren and Cameron's unvarnished conversations highlighted the awkwardness that sometimes accompanies interracial dating.\n\nIt was a reality show, but it seemed like a format that could actually allow people to fall in love without getting bogged down in superficial distractions and expectations. Maybe.\n\nNow in its 10th season, Love Is Blind is a cornerstone of Netflix’s reality TV cinematic universe. But while each cycle brings us standout women who earnestly buy into the show’s original conceit, it’s getting tougher to find any men to root for.\n\nWith the latest US season featuring Chris Fusco, who voluntarily compares himself to Andrew Tate and derides a fellow male cast member for being “submissive,” and Alex Henderson, a Trump-loving crypto bro with an ever-shifting backstory, increasingly the men of Love Is Blind seem to have been plucked straight from the manosphere.\n\nSeason after season, the women on the show (and viewers at home) are subjected to men who make shallow, body-shaming comments, struggle with anger and emotional regulation, and sometimes appear uncomfortable with their partner’s success."

            "content": "In late December, the 21st to be exact, my friends Amos and Clara called me 17 times. On December 22 it was eight times. The calls were short—sometimes only 30 to 45 seconds, and they usually arrived when I was doing something important: working, grocery shopping, napping. “Hi Anna,” one or both of them would say. “Hi!” I’d respond. Sometimes I worried that I sounded too eager, or like I was just sitting around waiting for their call. Sometimes I felt a little pathetic.\n\nIf anyone else called me that often I’d block their number. But Amos is 6 years old, and Clara is 9, and what happened is that on December 20, for Hanukkah, the siblings got the gift of a newly released, extremely old-school kids’ phone. And for the next week or so, the two of them couldn’t stop calling. And I, for one, couldn’t stop picking up.\n\nCalled the Tin Can, the phone came out last April and has since sold more than 100,000 units without much paid advertising. It’s basically a “dumb phone” that makes and receives calls over a Wi-Fi network—a landline without the line. It has no screen, not even a tiny one to show who’s calling; its surface has only buttons, a receiver, and a speaker. The product is marketed to parents who want to encourage their children to communicate without giving them access to web browsers and social media. (One user on X suggested, jokingly, that children start writing chain letters next.)\n\nThe standard Tin Can, which comes in four colorways and costs $100, looks like a candy-colored soup can. A “retro” model called The Flashback appears nearly identical to an old-school cradle phone and also retails at $100. Calls between Tin Cans are free, but the company charges $10 a month for users to call outside the Tin Can network. Parents get to set the rules—they add numbers to an approved caller list, and only calls to and from those numbers go through, and only in preset time frames, say, between 8 am and 8 pm. Parents can also monitor call logs. Call it spying with the implied consent of the spied upon; an electronic surveillance state in miniature.\n\nSome parents have tried to solve the problem of intrusive screens by buying their kids smartwatches; others opt for typical dumb phones. But these products are more about letting adults keep tabs on where their kids are at any given moment. The Tin Can is more about getting kids to focus on using their voices to communicate.\n\nAnd that’s about it. Tin Cans don’t show you missed calls or support text messaging. In an era in which most everyone is being nudged toward addictive, screen-based, endless-scroll engagement, giving kids the opportunity to get lost in conversation can seem incredibly appealing to parents."

You start noticing a bit more scalp in harsh bathroom lighting; a tiny bald spot when you tie your hair up in a ponytail. The shower drain is more clogged than usual. Not long ago, hair loss treatments meant topical remedies, supplements, or a flight to Turkey. Luckily, red light therapy brings the potential for hair regrowth into your home—no clinical appointment required.\n\nBeyond skin rejuvenation, research suggests red light therapy can help energize hair follicles, increase blood circulation in the scalp, reduce inflammation, and lower dihydrotestosterone levels—a hormone that causes hair loss and thinning. Red light therapy also supports adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, which helps provide oxygen and blood flow to the scalp and triggers follicles to remain in the hair growth phase.\n\nTo determine the best red light therapy for hair growth, I tapped three WIRED tech reviewers who've dealt with hair loss themselves. We assessed red light therapy caps, hands-free helmets with full scalp coverage, and low-level laser therapy or photobiomodulation devices for 16 weeks. Along the way, we reviewed the research, spoke with dermatologists, and tracked ease of use. These are the favorites that produced meaningful results and earned our trust.\n\nBe sure to check out our other hair care guides, including Best Dry Shampoos, Best Heat Protectant Sprays, and Best Hair Dryers.\n\nBest Red Light Helmet\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet $860 CurrentBody WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Simple device with only one button and a charging port\n\nBluetooth-enabled so you can listen to your own tunes during treatment\n\nComes with a stand for easy storage\n\nObserved new hair on scalp after 12-ish weeks TIRED Need to use daily for at least four months to achieve results, and use regularly (nearly every day) for maintenance\n\nEven the smallest helmet size is large\n\nBuffer cups can snag and pull hair during helmet removal\n\nEar cups can be somewhat difficult to adjust while worn\n\nCurrentBody's LED Hair Growth Helmet is a wearable, cord-free, Bluetooth-enabled device aimed at improving hair’s density, thickness, and overall condition. Each panel on the helmet has 12 red lights (120 total), which are on a spectrum of 620 to 660 nanometers (nm). The 620-nm red light helps improve scalp health by promoting circulation, and the 660-nm red light penetrates deeper, reaching through the epidermis and dermis to the hypodermis, where it stimulates growth and repair at the follicle root. According to CurrentBody, you only need to use the device for 10 minutes a day, and you’ll see results within 12 weeks.\n\nMy hair grows famously slow. I got a pixie cut in the spring of 2011, and my hair did not touch my shoulders until the end of 2013. My hair is also super fine. It tangles easily and often breaks off (my ends are chronically dry and split). After 12 weeks, I didn’t notice a huge difference in length (and I got a haircut halfway through testing), but I did notice that my hair seemed to be sprouting new follicles along my scalp and sideburn area in particular. I started to see small baby hairs along my hairline that I had never seen before. My stylist commented that my hair felt thicker, and I noticed less breakage and hair caught in bristles when brushing. My balding roommate also tested it (although not daily like me) and said that his hair felt thicker and that there was new growth around the scalp.\n\nThe helmet comes in two sizes: medium for a skull circumference of 21.3 to 23.2 inches, or large, for 23.3 to 25 inches. (I opted for medium, and it was too large for my head size.) The device sits on a base and is charged via a USB-C cord. It takes about three hours to fully charge, and it stays on a single charge for about a week. The device is powered on by the press of the single button located under the charging port. The circular earmuffs protect sensitive ears with a cushy, removable faux leather cloth, and they can be adjusted several inches up or down to ensure a comfortable fit. The screen on the right earmuff indicates the time left in the treatment session, and the helmet automatically turns off when the 10 minutes are up. You can also connect the device to Bluetooth and play any type of music or video while wearing it, because God forbid I be left alone with my thoughts for 10 minutes a day. Just make sure your hair is clean and dry before use.\n\nMy only complaints are that the ear covers aren’t the easiest to adjust while wearing and would oftentimes pull out my hair while I removed or adjusted the helmet. Nevertheless, this is the best red light therapy for hair growth. Just you wait, I’ll look like Fabio on the cover of a romance novel by next year. See full review here. —Molly Higgins"

            "content": "Congressional Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee say they’ve identified more than $20.9 billion in consumer losses tied to identity theft connected to four major breaches involving data broker firms. The estimate was released Friday in a minority report stemming from a months-long inquiry into data broker practices launched by United States senator Maggie Hassan.\n\nHassan, a New Hampshire Democrat and the JEC’s ranking member, sent investigative requests to five major data brokers—Comscore, Findem, IQVIA Digital, Telesign, and 6Sense Insights—in August after an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, copublished by WIRED, found some data brokers were hiding opt-out tools from Google and other search engines using “no index” instructions that tell web crawlers not to list the page.\n\nScammers are shown to use the kind of sensitive data that companies like these hold—including identifiers like dates of birth, addresses, and even Social Security numbers—to target victims with personalized fraud.\n\nFour of the companies took steps after Hassan’s outreach to improve access to opt-out options, including by removing the “no index” code, adding more prominent links, and posting guidance on exercising privacy rights.\n\nFindem, however, did not respond to Hassan or to committee staff follow-up, and staff said the company has not removed the “no index” code from its page. WIRED’s calls to Findem on Thursday went unanswered.\n\nThe report says Findem’s “failure to respond” to the lawmakers’ inquiries raises “serious, broad questions about its responsiveness to opt-out requests and commitment to data privacy,” adding that its own mandatory disclosures from 2024 show the company “did not process 80 percent of privacy requests from consumers and other parties,” citing “insufficient data.”\n\nIQVIA, 6sense, and Comscore did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Telesign routes press inquiries through an online form that requires reporters to consent to receiving marketing communications, which was not used for that reason; instead, a company email address that appeared in previously leaked breach data was tried.\n\nThe Markup/CalMatters investigation found that dozens of California-registered data brokers were using the “no index” code and other so-called dark patterns that make opt-out and deletion pages harder to find. “In doing so,” the JEC minority report says, “the companies made it more difficult for people to protect their information from scammers.”\n\nComscore told the committee it reviewed its website after receiving Hassan’s request and found that its “Data Subject Rights” page—which directs users to separate forms for submitting opt-out requests—contained a “no index” code. The company said it traced the code, which it removed, back to an earlier version of the page created in 2003. The report says the company could not determine why it was added, but suggested it was “not intended to prevent consumer access.”\n\nTelesign confirmed that its opt-out form, hosted on a “Privacy Request” page, was not appearing in search results at the time of the Markup/CalMatters reporting; it attributed the issue to a third-party SEO tool that restricts visibility by default, and says it has now enabled indexing and added a footer link to the form.\n\nJEC staff say Telesign’s approach still forces consumers to look beyond its main site and, even where links exist, they’re often buried on pages users wouldn’t reasonably think to check—including privacy notice pages exceeding 9,000 words.\n\n6sense disputed that its main “Privacy Center” was hidden, but acknowledged that its “Privacy Policy” page—which links to opt-out tools—previously carried “no index” code, adding that it removed the code after the Markup/CalMatters report. 6sense was the only company to report using third-party audits to assess both the visibility of opt-out options and whether the requests are being successfully processed, the report says."

            "content": "The line between iPad and MacBook may get a little more blurred this year. Bloomberg reports that Apple is working on a touchscreen MacBook Pro with OLED screen to be released by the end of 2026.\n\nIt's a product I never expected to see anytime soon. For the past 15 years, Apple executives have publicly dismissed the idea of putting touchscreens on a MacBook, saying it would be uncomfortable to operate. Steve Jobs told a crowd at an Apple event that the company did \"tons of user testing\" on putting touchscreens on MacBooks and decided against it because, he said, \"It doesn't work. It's ergonomically terrible.\"\n\nWatch this: New Touchscreen MacBook Details Emerge, Plus What to Expect at Apple's Big Event 05:19\n\nWhile previewing Mac OS X Lion in 2010, Jobs explained the main issue was comfort, saying, \"After a short period of time you start to fatigue, and after an extended period of time your arm wants to fall off.\"\n\nSo if Bloomberg's reporting is correct, certainly someone at Apple believes differently now. But before we cry out how this isn't what Steve Jobs wanted, let's not forget that Jobs did say Apple did \"tons\" of user testing. It was something the company has been curious about. Maybe in the past 15 years, something changed.\n\nIn this week's episode of One More Thing, embedded above, I go over the details from the Bloomberg report on how it might function. MacOS reportedly would only reveal touch menus when a finger hits the screen, helping it just complement the typical point-and-click interface. Certainly this could avoid criticism Microsoft faced by overhauling its OS in the Windows 8 launch when it moved to a hybrid interface, alienating longtime users.\n\nThis rumored device is for the end of the year, but Apple may have plenty of other gadgets to play with in the next week. Tim Cook teased that the company will be announcing new products starting on Monday. The company is expected to release a new iPhone 17e, along with updated models of the iPad and Mac lineup -- maybe as many as five different products.\n\nApple is holding an invitation-only experience on Wednesday March 4 in New York City, and I'll be there to cover whatever happens and will give my first impressions and full report for what one more thing (or many things) will have folks buzzing.\n\nFor more One More Thing, subscribe to our YouTube page to catch Bridget Carey breaking down the latest Apple news and issues every Friday."

The Pokemon Day event has just begun and it promises to be chock full of free goodies and exciting game reveals for creature-collecting fans across the world. Considering the juggernaut franchise is celebrating its 30th anniversary, it's safe to assume there will be juicy information included in this Pokemon Presents stream.\n\nThere was plenty of excitement leading up to the main event. Pokemon TCG Pocket released the Paldean Wonders card set expansion, and The Pokemon Company revealed that FireRed and LeafGreen are getting Switch ports with Pokemon Home compatibility. Now the stage is set for The Pokemon Company to reveal new mainline Pokemon games for the Switch and Switch 2.\n\nHere's when The Pokemon Company goes live with its first Pokemon Presents stream of the year, setting audience expectations for what we can expect to see from the world of pocket monsters in 2026.\n\nWhat time is the Pokemon Presents stream on Pokemon Day?\n\nThe first Pokemon Presents livestream of the year is happening now. The show began bright and early for American audiences, so I hope you didn't sleep in.\n\nHere's when Friday's Pokemon Day livestream began in your time zone:\n\nET: 9 a.m.\n\nCT: 8 a.m.\n\nMT: 7 a.m.\n\nPT: 6 a.m.\n\nHow to watch the February Pokemon Presents livestream\n\nThe Pokemon Company is responsible for the Pokemon Presents livestreams, which means you can view the announcement through any of its social media channels.\n\nWhile I recommend watching the stream on The Pokemon Company's YouTube or Twitch channels, you can also keep up with the announcements on TikTok. Regular updates will also be posted to the company's Instagram account throughout the event.\n\nWhat will be announced on Pokemon Day 2026?\n\nIt's safe to assume that the February Pokemon Presents livestream will feature some long-anticipated reveals, since 2026 is a big year for the Pokemon brand.\n\nThe livestream marks the 30th anniversary of Pokemon Red and Pokemon Green (the original Pokemon games for the Game Boy) releasing in Japan. We know the stream will be roughly 25 minutes long, making one of the longest Pokemon Presents showcases ever.\n\nI suspect the livestream will serve as a victory lap celebrating Pokemon's cultural impact before pivoting to the future and showing fans what's coming next.\n\nAnd what treats are in store for tomorrow's event? I expect to see updates and freebies for Pokemon mobile games first, since these are some of the big moneymakers. If this Pokemon Day presentation mirrors the one from last year, we'll be treated to some goodies in Pokemon Go, Pokemon Masters EX, Pokemon Cafe ReMix and Pokemon TCG Pocket. We might also see an announcement for a special Pokemon Scarlet and Violet raid event and Pokemon Legends: Z-A Mega stone distributions.\n\nMega stone distributions are likely to be freebies on Pokemon Day. Nintendo/Screenshot by CNET\n\nAfter celebrating the currently released games, it's likely that the presentation will pivot to what's coming next. We'll almost certainly get a reminder that Nintendo Switch ports of Pokemon FireRed and Pokemon LeafGreen are available starting on Pokemon Day. I expect the biggest news will be a concrete release date for Pokemon's big new competitive game, Pokemon Champions, which is slated to come out in time for the Pokemon World Championships 2026.\n\nIf we're really lucky, we might even hear about the 10th generation of mainline Pokemon games. While Game Freak has unmoored itself from a consistent release schedule, we're certainly due to see the rumored Pokemon Wind and Wave. While the infamous Teraleak hints toward what the development studio might show off next, it's high time we get a glimpse of what the next big Pokemon games are really all about."

            "content": "Finding an inexpensive, quality inkjet printer isn't a challenge. But getting affordable replacement ink is another matter entirely.\n\nYou might be shocked to learn that replacement ink cartridges can cost as much as the printer itself, if not more. It's because printers are often sold at a loss, with the company expecting to make its profit on the ink.\n\nThis strategy, also known as the \"razor-and-blades model,\" is common in consumer goods, including printers, coffee makers (the ones that use disposable pods) and its namesake, shaving razors.\n\nPrinter manufacturers, however, claim there are several reasons why ink costs so much, beyond revenue. Here are the main reasons why printer ink is so expensive.\n\nThe razor blade business\n\nThe razor-and-blade business model provides a continued revenue stream for printer-makers after a customer buys the hardware. It also locks that customer into an ecosystem. Just as some razor handles are compatible with only a specific blade, printers support only certain inkjet or toner cartridges.\n\nManufacturers typically offer different printer models, but they likely use different cartridges that aren't interchangeable. The cartridges also aren't refillable by design. While it may seem manipulative, this business model is legal and common practice. It also keeps prices high due to a lack of competition.\n\nIt's all proprietary (aka intellectual property)\n\nThanasi/Getty\n\nAnother way consumers are locked into a closed ecosystem is that many ink and toner cartridges contain chipsets that communicate with the printer, such as the amount of ink or toner left, so the printer can estimate how many pages it can print. They also verify whether the cartridge is authentic (i.e., from the printer manufacturer) or has been refilled. In either case, the printer could reject the cartridge.\n\nWhile some third-party suppliers have found ways around this, printer cartridges are proprietary, the intellectual property of the original manufacturer. Customers are usually limited in replacement options other than buying from their printer's original equipment manufacturer.\n\nThis isn't about the cost of research and manufacturing, or at least, not just about that. Printer-makers claim that their technology ensures consumers get the best print quality from their ink or toner, as well as proper performance and accurate color or monochrome prints.\n\nFor example, inkjet printer ink is formulated to flow smoothly through the tiny printhead nozzles, while laser printer toner powder must be heated and applied evenly. That ink or toner also has to dry quickly on paper without smudging, which is another key reason. The official cartridges also include security features that manufacturers claim protect against malware.\n\nSo, although cartridges look simple on the outside, their embedded technology adds to manufacturing costs. Companies say this helps ensure high print quality, but consumer advocacy groups say it is designed to keep out competition while shifting the cost to users.\n\nIf you print often, expect to spend more on consumables\n\nGettyimages/Photoplus magazine\n\nObviously, the more ink or toner used, the sooner replenishment is needed. This is especially the case with inkjet printers, as cartridges often contain a low yield of ink (between 150 to 300 pages). And, if the printer uses multiple cartridges, those costs add up quickly. If you run out of one color, you might not even be able to print black-and-white documents.\n\nWorse, new inkjet printers include \"starter ink cartridges\" that offer even lower yields. Laser printer toner cartridges also require replacing, but they tend to have higher yields than their inkjet counterparts.\n\nAlso, if you don't print often, the ink in the cartridges can dry out, requiring replacement before you can print anything.\n\nHow to reduce printer ink costs\n\nEpson/CNET\n\nThere's no way around it: Inkjet printers need ink, which will eventually run out. But there are a few ways to save some money.\n\nHigh-yield cartridges\n\nSome printers support high-yield ink or toner cartridges, which double the output of standard options. They cost a bit more, but you may be able to reduce the frequency of ink replacements. They also might be cheaper per page printed.\n\nRefillable ink\n\nRefillable inkjet printers, also known as supertank printers, have gained popularity. As the name suggests, a user pours ink into tanks built into the printer, much like refilling a soap bottle. Refillable inks are cheaper than ink cartridges and offer a much higher yield. (They also produce less waste in general.) However, the printers themselves are more expensive to purchase upfront.\n\nHP\n\nSubscription programs\n\nHP offers its Instant Ink program, which automatically ships you a replacement when ink runs low (the printer sends this info to HP when connected to Wi-Fi). Starting at $1.79 a month, HP sends new high-yield cartridges only when needed and recycles your old cartridges to reduce e-waste. HP says Instant Ink offers a savings of up to 50% when compared to buying off the shelf, and most Wi-Fi-enabled HP printers support the program.\n\nEpson launched a new service called ReadyPrint, where, for a monthly fee (starting at $15), you get a printer and unlimited refillable ink. ReadyPrint is available only on select models.\n\nPrint in draft mode and limit color\n\nOftentimes, lower-quality draft mode is more than sufficient for most print jobs. This can help increase page yields. Nearly all inkjet printers can output in color, but that doesn't mean you should. Make sure you disable color in your print settings and enable it only when needed.\n\nConsider a laser printer\n\nLaser toner cartridge. Getty Images/Smith Collection\n\nEvaluate the amount and type of printing you plan to do. If it's mostly black-and-white documents, it may be more economical to invest in a laser printer, since toner offers higher yields and doesn't dry out between infrequent uses.\n\nThen, if you need to occasionally print color or photos, print them professionally at FedEx, pharmacies like CVS and any number of local or online photo print shops. In the long run, this might be cheaper than owning your own color printer if you don't print regularly.\n\nThird-party supplies\n\nThird-party ink supplies can offer significant savings, but printer manufacturers have strongly fought against this option. They've even implemented measures to prevent their use. However, it's not illegal for consumers to use third-party inks. Before you choose this option, know that the savings may come at the cost of print quality, and some third-party inks could damage the hardware.\n\nWhile using third-party ink won't void the warranty, the printer manufacturer may not cover repairs or replacements if third-party supplies are found to be the source of damage. It's best to choose a reputable retailer or service known for high-quality third-party inks, and that will stand behind them."

It took me 40 years to stumble upon this information, and it explains the unsightly scratches dotting my stovetop and fridge.\n\nThis guide is to help you avoid a similar fate.\n\nSponges are color-coded for reason.

Mr. Scrub\n\nYellow sponges are right in the middle -- not too rough, not too soft but often overlooked. They represent a step down in abrasiveness from green. They are suitable for cleaning more delicate surfaces, such as glassware, countertops and kitchen sinks, which require careful treatment to avoid scratches but still develop significant stains and buildup.\n\nBlue\n\nIntended use: A softy for glass and stainless steel\n\nA blue sponge will coddle your most delicate wares. Lavex\n\nWhen you're dealing with delicate surfaces, reach for a blue sponge. It's the least abrasive option and is ideal for very delicate surfaces such as glass or stainless steel, where a scratch-free shine is the goal. Blue is basically the spa day of sponges -- gentle, calming and leaves everything looking refreshed.\n\nRed and pink\n\nIntended use: High-risk areas and bacterial messes\n\nReserve red sponges for bacterial mess. The Home Depot\n\nThese colors are typically reserved for the danger zones, such as cleaning tougher, baked-on food or areas that pose a higher bacterial risk, like the sink where you just rinsed raw chicken (you know, your kitchen's version of a crime scene).\n\nTheir color is less an indication of their coarseness than a visual reminder to never, ever use them on clean tableware, unless you enjoy living dangerously.\n\nAnd because they're often employed in hazardous jobs, you may want to stock up on a bundle and simply toss them more often than their counterparts in alternative colors.\n\nBlack:\n\nIntended use: Heavy-duty scrubbing\n\nJetz Scrubz\n\nThese highly abrasive, heavy-duty sponges are for serious scrubbing of stubborn, baked-on stains on tough surfaces. You might not go through them as often as the others, but for certain gnarly cleaning jobs, only the bristly black sponge will suffice.\n\nHow color-coding sponges reduces the risk of contamination\n\nUsing sponges strategically will reduce wear on kitchen surfaces. SimpleImages/Getty\n\nA systematic approach to kitchen hygiene often involves color-coding cleaning tools to ensure proper organization and cleanliness. This simple, visual system ensures a sponge used only for heavily soiled areas (or biohazard jobs) is never mistakenly used on clean glassware, silverware or plates. Because trust us, your guests will notice.\n\nBy establishing and following this clear color-coded system, you can reduce the spread of germs, keep your kitchen safer and ensure that your most delicate items are treated with the gentlest care. Plus, you'll finally have a legitimate reason to own a rainbow of colorful sponges.\n\nFor more cleaning tips, see a former custodian's tips for cleaning the bathroom like a pro and discover which all-purpose cleaner fared the best in our testing."

If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nOne of the most significant improvements to TV picture quality has been the introduction of OLED technology. An OLED TV can create perfect black levels with infinite contrast, as well as excellent color and great motion control. It's a technology that lends itself well to sports, gaming on consoles or watching HDR TV shows and movies. I have tested the latest OLED TVs side-by-side in the CNET TV lab, including brands such as LG, Sony, Samsung and Panasonic. These are the models I recommend.\n\n\n\nThe best OLED TV\n\nThe best OLED TV for most users is the Samsung S90F TV as it's got both picture quality and affordability in equal measure, especially now that prices have come down. That said, the LG C5 is also an excellent TV at a similar price, and as a result you should buy whichever of the two models is cheapest at the time.\n\nIf you can spend more and want the best possible picture quality that you can get, then it's a choice between the LG G5 and the Samsung S95F. The LG TV is the most color accurate TV I tested in 2025 and the winner of a CNET Labs Award, while the Samsung is excellent in both the dark and in bright rooms.\n\nTy Pendlebury/CNET Photo Gallery 1/1 Ty Pendlebury/CNET Best OLED TV value of 2026 Samsung S90F 8.6 /10 SCORE It's a close call between the Samsung S90F and LG C5, as always at this level, but given the Samsung S90F is slightly better and around the same money it's the one to choose. The Samsung has similar picture quality to its more-expensive S95F sibling and that's the best reason to buy it. The Samsung also has most of the features you need including 4K/120Hz gaming support, HDR 10+ and onboard streaming. While the TV doesn't have Dolby Vision, the differences between HDR10+ and Dolby's HDR format are subtle at best. ... Show more Get it now $1,098 at Amazon Learn more Samsung S90F review\n\nTy Pendlebury/CNET Photo Gallery 1/1 Ty Pendlebury/CNET Best overall OLED performance Samsung S95F 8.9 /10 SCORE Unless you live in a hermetically-sealed container, you are likely to have a bunch of different light sources competing with your TV in your living space. Overhead lights and windows can wreak havoc on your picture, and it's not always feasible to close the curtains or turn the lights off. The Samsung S95F is the best TV I've seen to effectively ban reflections, and the fact that it gives excellent picture quality as well makes it the ultimate TV for the movies or gaming fan who likes to watch during the day. ... Show more Get it now $2,497 at Amazon Learn more Samsung S95F review\n\nTy Pendlebury/CNET Photo Gallery 1/1 Ty Pendlebury/CNET Brightest, best color accuracy of 2026 LG G5 LG G5 Buy Now 8.8 /10 SCORE LG's G series has shown appreciable improvements in picture quality every year, and the 2025 G5 is brighter than ever before. It's neck-and-neck with the S95F for picture quality in terms of contrast and color, though the LG is demonstrably more accurate, with the best color accuracy score of the past year. Plus, the G5 is a blast to game on. I still like the S95F a little better, and that's mainly because of Samsung's reflection deterrence. ... Show more Get it now $1,877 at Amazon Learn more LG G5 review\n\nRecent updates Feb. 26, 2025: Added CNET Labs Award to LG G5 and updated pricing. Dec. 11, 2025: Added the Samsung S90F as the best value pick, and removed the 2024 LG C4. Oct. 2, 2025: Updated the list with new TVs including the Samsung S95F and the LG G5, plus added more information on my testing process.\n\nI also tested Panasonic Z95A: It boasts excellent picture quality, thanks to OLED, and it also includes a dedicated speaker system. It's being replaced by the Z95B but it's still available in some stores. Read my hands-on of the Panasonic Z95B. LG C5: While the LG G5 is a huge leap from the model that came before it, the C5 is more incremental. That said, it is still an improvement and if it's the same price as the C4 then get this instead. See my full review of the LG C5.\n\nFactors to consider when choosing an OLED TV Carly Marsh/CNET Screen size: OLEDs are available in sizes from 42 inches to 97 inches, and there are probably even bigger TVs coming in the future. One of the best pieces of advice I can give is, if you can afford it, always buy a TV one size bigger than you think you need. While 65 inches is the norm right now, TVs will keep getting bigger year after year, and you might consider buying a 77-inch to prevent an upgrade in the near future. However, if you're buying for a bedroom or a game room, then you could look at TVs 55 inches or less. Consider older models: At the affordable end of OLED, the yearly model updates aren't as dramatic when compared with the flagships. For TVs like the LG B5 or even C5, for instance, it makes sense to compare prices on last year's model and get whichever is cheapest. In the meantime, as we progress into the new year you're going to see the prices of 2025 models continue to drop. HDR formats: While it's not completely necessary, compatibility with Dolby Vision is a plus. Of course, Samsung doesn't support the Dolby format and instead offers its own version it calls HDR10 plus, and this is gaining in popularity. In the end, though, almost every 4K TV supports HDR 10, and this will work just fine. Gaming: If you're a gamer then having gaming-enhancing features is a bonus, and these includes a dedicated gaming mode (for turning off processing and reducing lag), 120Hz or higher support and even gaming apps such as Xbox Game Pass, Amazon Luna and Steam Link. Operating system: With the introduction of the Philips Roku TV, you have a choice of all of the best smart TV interfaces on OLED televisions. Whether it's Google TV, Fire TV or one of the manufacturer-specific systems, opting for a popular smart TV interface gives you the most choice with apps and on-demand content."

Words like HURTS might seem like a regular word, but it's also the last name of at least one pro athlete."

That helps you hear the words in the context of a phrase. The Connections editors love to group words together that are used in similar phrasing, like ____ Up.\n\n#2: Don't go for the obvious grouping. These editors are smart. Once, they offered SPONGE, BOB, SQUARE and PANTS in the same puzzle. None of those words were in the same category. If you like, hit the \"shuffle\" button to give yourself a different perspective on the words.\n\n#3: Break down any compound words and look for similarities. \"Rushmore\" was once in a puzzle where the connection was that each word started with the name of a rock band."
