Carrick has steered the side into genuine top-four contention after securing five victories and one draw from his opening six fixtures in charge.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere around Carrington is understandably buoyant as the players believe they may have reached a turning point after a torrid few years. Part of that optimism stems from Carrick restoring the so-called 'United DNA', which involves playing thrilling and attacking football.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnother element is reliance on emerging talent from the academy, something embedded in the club since before the Class of '92, and one Carrick seems eager to maintain. Recent results and his footballing philosophy suggest a promising future at Old Trafford, where talented youth team graduates can combine with current first team stars and new signings to take United back to the very top.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMirror Football now examines what the Red Devils' starting line-up could theoretically look like in five years' time if they continue on their present course, with an emphasis on their academy prospects.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

So far, Lammens looks to be an outstanding signing and United supporters will be hoping he can continue to go from strength to strength in the seasons ahead.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRB - Michael Kayode\n\nBrentford's Kayode is the ideal right-back to succeed Diogo Dalot further down the line. The Italian, still only 21, possesses explosive athleticism, relentless overlapping runs, outstanding one vs one defending and a secret weapon in the form of a gigantic throw-in.\n\nRCB - Leny Yoro\n\nView 5 Images Yoro is a talented defender (Image: 2025 James Gill - Danehouse)\n\nYoro, 20, is still learning what it takes to be a top-class Premier League centre-back, but the Frenchman still has plenty of time on his side. Signed for £52.2m in 2024, Yoro is undoubtedly regarded as the long-term defensive cornerstone at United.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLCB - Cristian Romero\n\nTottenham captain Romero is reportedly keen to leave the north London club, and United would be wise to bring him in this summer. The Argentine World Cup winner boasts a wealth of experience despite being just 27 years old, making him the ideal candidate to bring stability to a young and promising defensive unit. A fee of around £50m should be sufficient to sign Romero.\n\nLB - Harry Amass\n\nAmass stands out as one of the most gifted United academy prospects and could be the man to finally replace Luke Shaw. The 18-year-old is technically secure and progressive in possession. Should his loan spell at Norwich City prove successful, there is every reason to believe Amass can make the left-back berth his own at United.\n\nCM - Kobbie Mainoo\n\nView 5 Images Kobbie Mainoo is a future United captain (Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn five years' time, Mainoo will still be only 26. The England international already boasts considerable experience in high-profile matches and has returned to prominence under Carrick, who is impressed by Mainoo's press resistance and ability to glide through traffic. United's entire midfield identity could be built around the former academy starlet, and he is the most likely long-term captain in this side.\n\nCM - Adam Wharton\n\nWhile Mainoo would be the more adventurous of the midfield axis, long-term target Wharton, 22, could be signed as the chief orchestrator from deep, dictating the tempo much like Carrick himself did during his prime. With Crystal Palace enduring a thoroughly miserable campaign, the Englishman is valued at around £65m, making this the prime moment to bring him to Old Trafford.\n\nCAM - Shea Lacey\n\nView 5 Images Shea Lacey could be United's future talisman (Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLacey, 18, is the jewel in United’s academy crown at the moment. The left-footer, who made his first-team debut in December, is highly versatile, being able to play off the wing, though his creativity makes him the perfect long-term successor to Bruno Fernandes.\n\nRW - Kai Rooney\n\nThe son of United hero Wayne Rooney, Kai is destined to reach the first-team squad, having joined United's youth system at 11. At 16, he still needs more physical development to secure his place in the first-team XI, but he is already catching the eye with his clever off-the-ball movement from the right flank, cutting inside and displaying composed finishing.\n\nLW - JJ Gabriel\n\nView 5 Images JJ Gabriel is destined for the first team (Image: Getty)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJJ Gabriel is among the most talented youngsters currently playing in the academy. The 15-year-old is raw and electrifying, delivering that same fearlessness on the wing that a certain Cristiano Ronaldo showed over two decades ago.\n\nST - Benjamin Sesko\n\nSummer signing Sesko has appeared increasingly like the player United fought hard to sign last summer as the season has progressed. Still 22, the Slovenian's physicality and ball-striking could make his £66.2m transfer fee seem like a bargain in five years’ time."

He appeared in good spirits as he interacted with photographers, with the day's news not affecting his outward mood.\n\nGesture to Carrick\n\nMore than six weeks after leaving Old Trafford, Amorim hasn't discussed his exit from the United job. This is seemingly no coincidence, with reports indicating he has made the choice deliberately as a gesture of goodwill towards successor Michael Carrick.\n\nAccording to The Mail, the former Sporting boss will wait until the summer before breaking his silence.

Final whistle, as a real sportsperson... close the book and he didn't do that and that is what I don't like, honestly.\"\n\nHis comments didn't go down well with Lampard's uncle and fellow Premier League icon Redknapp. \"Frank has been around professional football since he was a toddler,\" Redknapp told The Sun.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Lampard told Liverpool not to get \"too arrogant\" after winning the Premier League (Image: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images)\n\n\"He doesn't need advice from anyone, although I've lots of respect for Klopp. Frank is very calm usually, he doesn't tend to get involved in things like this. For him to react like that, it must have been something to really wind him up.\"\n\nSoon after the heated exchange, Lampard expressed his regret over the clash and specifically the explicit language he used.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSky Sports later released a clip which had audio of the incident. During it, Lampard says: \"That’s not a f*****g foul. I’m not asking you, I’m asking him to shut up!\"\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nHe then turns to Klopp and adds: \"Shut up. F*** off you as well. Tell them to show some respect. Sit down.\" The then-Liverpool boss then gestures to his staff to sit down, which he repeated following the goal.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Chelsea legend did go on to make clear what it was that sparked his fury, adding: \"I could have handled it differently but some of the reports were I was upset with the celebrations. Far from it. They can celebrate like every goal.\n\nView 3 Images Lampard insisted he had no lasting issue with Klopp after the final whistle (Image: Phil Noble/Pool via Getty Images)\n\n\"I'd have had a beer with Jurgen Klopp after the game but there were things on the bench, not from Klopp, that I felt crossed a line. I regret the language but we'll move on.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMonths later, Lampard admitted he was \"embarrassed\" about the whole debacle, telling the High Performance Podcast: \"Yeah, I did regret that.\n\n\"And when that broke [audio of the clash] the next day – I clearly felt it as I was doing it – but when it broke the next day and a friend of mine sent it to me in the morning, I was a bit embarrassed by it.\"\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE!

Like Usyk in boxing, Verhoeven is the dominant heavyweight in his sport.\n\nThe Dutchman has the longest winning streak ever in the Glory promotion. He has previously competed in MMA and professional boxing, winning his only fight in each sport by knockout.\n\nVerhoeven defended his heavyweight title last June and after that victory vacated his championship, leaving kickboxing with an outstanding record of 66 wins in 76 fights.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Speaking on the Toe2Toe podcast, trainer Gary Logan, Matty Harris and Julius Francis debate whether we can really compare eras of heavyweight fighters\n\nBut he will be hard pushed to defeat Oleksandr Usyk. The Ukrainian was a World and Olympic gold medallist as an amateur. He's never lost a professional bout. At cruiserweight he won the World Boxing Super Series while becoming the undisputed world champion at 200lbs.\n\nIn his heavyweight career he's beaten Anthony Joshua twice, Tyson Fury twice and Daniel Dubois twice, becoming the undisputed champion twice in that division too.\n\nLiam Harrison is a British legend from the world of kickboxing.

He's the best heavyweight on this planet and he's the best heavyweight of this era. If guys like Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua can't put a dent in him, no one's going to be able to put a dent in him I'm afraid.\n\n\"Rico's going to have to throw a few leg kicks if he wants to get one over on him in there!\"\n\nBut he understands why the event is taking place. \"Again Rico's a legend in kickboxing. Guys like that who paved the way in kickboxing have been the GOATs [greatest of all time] in their generation, they deserve to get these sort of paydays and these sort of chances to showcase what they can do and get some big money,\" he said. \"It'll be nice to see.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player A look back at some of Liam Harrison's big hits during his ONE career\n\nBoxing promoter Frank Warren represents both Fabio Wardley, who was Usyk's previous mandatory challenger, and Agit Kabayel, who will be Usyk's mandatory for the WBC belt.\n\nHe was, however, expecting Usyk to take a 'crossover' bout like this fight with Verhoeven. \"All he's doing now he's looking at fights, what is the value for him of a fight. That's why he wants this,\" Warren told Sky Sports.\n\n\"He's probably looked at what AJ's done, what Tyson did when he fought [Francis] Ngannou and thinking he'll have some of that and they look at it sometimes as being an easier job. Whether it is or it's not, we will see.\n\n\"Usyk just wants the paydays now. He's stamped his mark in boxing. He's the heavyweight of the 21st century and that's where he's at.\""

The eight-year-old racked up a third success over fences and the extra couple of furlongs to 3m 2f ought to suit this strong stayer.\n\nStablemates Broomfields Cave and Lord Accord complete the shortlist.\n\n2.35 Lingfield - Red-hot Ten Carat Harry faces Richie's Rocket\n\nLingfield stages a trappy-looking Listed BetMGM Spring Cup Stakes where in-form Ten Carat Harry faces seven rivals.\n\nA perfect six wins from six starts on the all-weather, Jamie Osborne's charge has been progressing through the grades this winter and deserves a crack at this better race. The manner of his latest Newcastle victory was impressive and the step up to seven furlongs should not inconvenience him.\n\nRichie's Rocket, third on debut at Newmarket in October, made a sparkling all-weather debut when clearing away to win by nine lengths over this trip and track the following month.

I like the consistency and continuity and we know that coaches don't last long working with Emma.\n\n\"An aggressive game style is how you have to play. You have got to be aggressive because if you don't your opponent will be and for me. I want to see her build her physicality: to get stronger, more resilient, to hit the ball harder.\n\n\"And I think if she does that, that'll mean that she has less interruptions and less little setbacks physically.

I think her tennis game is outstanding but when you think of the physicality of Sabalenka, Swiatek, Rybakina, Gauff, she's not in the same league.\n\n\"The physicality is the biggest challenge.\"\n\nPetchey helped inspire the most productive period of Raducanu's season as she reached the quarter-finals at Queen's before running Sabalenka close in the third round of Wimbledon.\n\nEmma Raducanu's NINE coaches\n\nNigel Sears\n\n\n\nBest known for coaching former top five players Amanda Coetzer, Daniela Hantuchova, Anett Kontaveit and Ana Ivanovic, Sears joined her team in April 2021 and oversaw her incredible breakthrough run to the Wimbledon fourth round.\n\n\n\nAndrew Richardson\n\n\n\nGuided Raducanu to her historic Grand Slam title at the US Open as a qualifier.

They've been on and off for a fair few years now and it's someone she knows. They have the same ideas. They agree on so much that she needs to bring out there, so why not?\n\n\"As long as you've got someone who's taking care of the boring stuff like the logistics of booking practice, finding someone to practice with, racket re-strings - all of that. As long as that's taken care of, then you can just focus on trying to play.\n\n\"They have the same identity of how both of them feel she should be as a player.\"\n\nRaducanu is hoping to hoping to revert to a more aggressive style in order to compete with the top players and Robson says she has shown in the past she is capable of playing against the elite on the WTA Tour.\n\n\"For sure. We've seen how close her matches against Sabalenka have been,\" said former British No 1 Robson.\n\n\"It feels like everyone is adding different elements to their game all the time, so at the moment it feels like she wants to add that aggression back into her game and once you've got that you can start thinking about adding more variety again so you've got more strings to your bow.\n\n\"But you want to have a clear identity as a player before you go out onto any match court - so long as that's defined in your mind then that's half the job done.\"\n\nOverend on Raducanu finding the right balance\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Jonathan Overend believes that if Raducanu can find the right balance with the correct coach, she will be set up for a great year of tennis\n\nSpeaking earlier this month, Sky Sports commentator Jonathan Overend said Raducanu will only be able to find the right balance in her setup once she answers a key question.\n\n\"I think she has spent a lot of her young career re-evaluating,\" he said. \"In one regard, it explains why she has been through so many coaches and why she has been criticised for it.\n\n\"It's typical of Raducanu that she wants to keep re-evaluating and finding out what is best for her on and around a tennis court.\n\n\"That challenge continues, and to some extent it is a struggle, because finding the right balance is so hard, but I think she is slowly getting [it], not in terms of her Grand Slam results but in terms of that re-evaluation process.\n\n\"What is it she really wants for herself on a tennis court and in tournaments?\"\n\nWatch the ATP and WTA Tours, live on Sky Sports or stream with NOW and the Sky Sports app, giving Sky Sports customers access to over 50 per cent more live sport this year at no extra cost.

            "content": "There’s a good advert right now on the rolling TV sports news channels. It starts with a rush of beeps and plinks and flashing symbols, generating instantly the flat, glazed, hungry quality of the online casino. A well-groomed middle-aged woman is shown sitting in an armchair in a suburban living room. It’s a jarring tonal shift, but we’re still in that same space, betting graphics dancing around her head.\n\nThe middle-aged woman turns to the camera and says: “The games are all different … It never gets boring,” eyes gleaming strangely, hands gripping the struts of her chair. Here is a person who is not just pleased, but uncontrollably energised by the prospect of WowBet.com’s 10bn mildly divergent AI-generated gambling patterns. At this point the words “Sandra Frottwangle, funeral director” appear on the screen.\n\nBy now it’s just an overload of feelings. The first thought is about transgression. Sandra Frottwangle’s job is to curate death. She spends her days managing the nobility of human flesh. She stands at the far edge of existence creating ritual and comfort, a timeless figure, the eternal footman, the director of last things. But she also gets bored easily and prefers stuff with flashing lights.\n\nIs this OK? Would you want Sandra Frottwangle to direct your funeral? Death is repetitive. Mortality is tedious. What if she decides this is all really dull and needs more beeping noises, less weeping and organ music? The ferryman is at the door. He’s unsheathing his scythe. He’s also got 400 free online spins at GambleDick.com.\n\nThe second thought is a rush of tenderness. Yes, Sandra Frottwangle’s life is spent in that liminal space. She stares into the void. She sees the weakness of the flesh, fish-grey monkey-brown. But even here she is still hungry for life, still craving that wild human energy. Eyes gleaming like opals, casino chips circling her head, she looks like one of those renaissance friezes expressing the glory and brevity of human life, the globe, the skull, the bowl of rotting fruit.\n\nOnly now we’re strapped into a velour armchair, drooling down our necks, being force-fed endless brain-shredding content and just wanting to feel something. I … love her. I love Sandra Frottwangle (funeral director). And she’s right. All the games are the same. But we still want the games.\n\nEither all of that stuff, or the people who make daytime TV adverts are bored twentysomething creatives who just thought it would be funny to put the words “funeral director” over shots of an actor pretending to be really into gambling websites. Probably it’s one or the other.\n\nAnd yes, this is supposed to be about the Scottish Premiership title race, which enters its spring ignition phase this weekend, and which is now arguably the most interesting title race in Europe.\n\nEither way Sunday’s Old Firm derby at Ibrox is a genuinely rare thing. For once this is not a title decider. It could be a title eliminator. It could be a step towards neither of Celtic or Rangers winning the league for the first time in 41 years. A draw in Glasgow could leave Hearts six points clear at the top. But by now it is a startling transformation whatever the outcome.\n\nHearts finished 40 points behind Celtic last year. The great clanking hand of Tony Bloom and his big data hive-brain robots has been on site for only eight months. The word “disruption” is usually shorthand for tech bro types in $4,000 Japanese trainers working out new ways to fire people. This is actual, good disruption. A three-way title race isn’t just deeply un-Scotland, it’s deeply un-anywhere these days.\n\nIn the major European leagues only Greece, Denmark and Poland have something this close. The trend is towards stratification, dead air after Christmas, a single basking giant or a two-way chase energetically spun by the broadcasters. Money has made this happen. The Premier League in particular has harvested talent, turning previously robust leagues into clearing houses, exit lounges to the life-altering four-year deal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Hearts have sustained a title challenge and it has provided a welcome alternative to the traditional dominance of Celtic and Rangers. Photograph: Steve Welsh/PA\n\nThis is perhaps partly the case in Scotland. But there is also a sense of useful incompetence in play, accidental competitiveness. The Glasgow clubs have spent decades trying to sustain a place in the roided-up Euro elite, taking it in turns to fall over their feet. Now we have this, a perfect storm of super-smart newcomer and a pair of sleepwalking giants.\n\nThere are other places for proper chapter and verse on whether Hearts can sustain this. The key aspect at this stage is that this title race has taken on a sense of outside life. My own kids follow every Hearts game with a rare sense of urgency, despite being fully TikTok-brained, zombified by reel culture.\n\nIt is, of course, only one season. It could all fall away quite rapidly. But there is also a lesson here, perhaps even a control experiment. Because big football is often boring now. The direction of travel is fewer meaningful matches, a cartel of mega-clubs resting on the ropes, a Champions League group stage that feels like an autumn exhibition tour.\n\nThe idea is out there that younger people will be happy with this, will feast instead on clips, screengrabs, parasocial celebrity worship; that young people are essentially industrialised idiots who have for the first time in all human existence lost the craving for actual narrative.\n\nThe reality is this culture creates a yearning for something else. Marketing people will assume hate clicks, or boredom clicks, or any kind of clicks represent actual value and desire. But young people also like real things.\n\nFinding interest in a competitive football league is a bit like getting into vinyl, or books made from paper, or the revelation, usually via an American man on YouTube who looks as if he keeps a collection of children’s dolls in a shed, that food can actually be made from ingredients.\n\nPerhaps Scottish football has fallen into a less globalist version of how to thrive. Tend to the soil. Build it and they will come. The league has plenty that can be weaponised: deep history, heritage value, the same authenticity that made it so moreish back in the days when Old Firm games were basically catharsis, insanity, people at the edge of their own emotions colliding for 90 minutes.\n\nWhy do sporting leagues roll over so willingly? Why do they turn themselves inside out, shred the basis of their own value – English cricket: we see you – in order to chase those precarious streams of macro-money? What if you just stopped trying to expand outward in every direction? What if the guiding principle is: what will make the thing we have right here in front of us better? Why not go hyper-local?\n\nThere is an argument that Hearts winning would be better for Rangers and Celtic. It energises the league, supercharges the brand, speaks to the desire for sporting tension among those bored by the drift of big football.\n\nWe have replaced a great deal that was valuable with generalised digital noise. In a sense we are all strapped into our armchairs now, craving a place where the games are different, anything with heart and life to distract us from the grey, out there staring into the void with Sandra Frottwangle eyes."

            "content": "Arsenal had to expect the jibes from Tottenham and they were not disappointed. Just before kick-off in last Sunday’s north London derby, the Spurs support in the South Stand of their stadium spelled out a giant message in mosaic form. “North Ldn since 1882,” it read.\n\nA clear dig, then, at Arsenal’s south of the river history from the Woolwich days and, as mentioned, very much a part of a rivalry where goading and baiting go hand in hand with the loathing. Arsenal had been similarly provocative before the derby against Spurs at the Emirates Stadium last November, lighting the pre-match scene with a tifo featuring images of various club greats. The most prominent at the top of it? Sol Campbell, of course.\n\nWhat was more surprising – and certainly led to raised eyebrows at Arsenal – was Wolves’ now infamous TikTok post on the Thursday before last. The 80-second clip, uploaded after the 2-2 draw between the clubs the previous night, was a savage take on Arsenal’s “game management”. Or, to put it another way, and as Wolves surely intended, their dark arts and shithousery.\n\nThe social media team at Wolves showed how Gabriel Martinelli taunted the home crowd by flashing up the scoreline on his fingers as Arsenal led 2-1. They highlighted the delay in Arsenal taking a corner as they continued to lead. They mocked Gabriel Magalhães for going down after an apparent head clash before he got back up and carried on.\n\nThere was indignation from the in-house commentators when Leandro Trossard also went to ground after an aerial clash in the 90th minute. In the background, it was easy to make out the chant from the Wolves fans: “Same old Arsenal, always cheating.” There was laughter and the corresponding emojis on the clip when Wolves equalised at the bitter end.\n\nThere was more from elsewhere later in the day. At tea time, Manchester City’s X account piped up with a three-year-old clip of their team playing keep-ball by the corner flag in the dying minutes of a 2-0 home victory over Newcastle. “Seeing out the win,” read the text with a tick emoji above footage of Erling Haaland and Jack Grealish, well, managing the game to a successful conclusion. It was a mickey-take with an obvious target.\n\nThis is where Arsenal find themselves as they prepare for Sunday’s home game against Chelsea – the latest staging post in their draining push for the Premier League title. Their rivals, big and small, are lining up the pot shots, eager to have fun at their expense, to prey on their sensitivities. To drive a particular narrative and make Arsenal prisoners of it.\n\nThe Wolves TikTok clip overlooked a major detail when it came to Trossard. On as a 73rd-minute substitute, the winger was cleaned out by a shoulder barge from Santiago Bueno, who was on a yellow card. Trossard had eyes only for the high ball; the Wolves defender looked directly at him and left a calling card on his opponent’s jaw. A dazed Trossard was forced off after treatment, Arsenal relieved that he avoided injury, and how do you think the club’s doctors felt about essentially being accused of complicity in a plot to run down the clock?\n\nNobody thought about that. They were too busy enjoying the clip, which went viral for the reason that these things always do. It struck a chord. It fed a perception with which opposing fans are seemingly on board. Arsenal as the roughhouse guys – and not only when they are loading men into the six-yard box on corners. The ones that will do whatever it takes to win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Leandro Trossard’s injury at Wolves seemed to invoke opprobrium from the home side. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nArsenal were much better than Spurs. They deserved to beat them, which they did; to clear their heads after the trauma of Wolves. As an aside, it was only this Spurs team. Chelsea ought to be a tougher prospect. Yet Arsenal did get away with one in the 53rd minute as they led 2-1. Would it have been different if Randal Kolo Muani had not been penalised for the slightest of pushes into Gabriel’s back before he shot past David Raya? At the very least, Arsenal would have felt their anxiety levels rise.\n\nGabriel drew the contact to the referee’s attention in theatrical fashion, as he had done at Newcastle last September in a similar situation against Nick Woltemade. That day, the referee said no foul and Woltemade scored. This time, Gabriel got the decision.\n\nWhat did Gabriel do after the game? Did he a) keep his head down and quietly count his blessings? Or b) post a picture to social media of him holding a hand of cards with the four of hearts visible, signifying his team’s four goals? He went for the latter, even tagging the Spurs forward Richarlison. Cue a host of diving memes in the responses. Was goading really the right option given the climate around the club? On the other hand, you have to admire Gabriel’s chutzpah.\n\nMikel Arteta’s response to what we are obliged to call the “outside noise” has been to narrow the focus; to dial up the intensity while also talking up his players and their mindset. The manager has his eyes on the prize and there are a number of points that need to be made, beginning with the feeling towards him and his side in coaching circles.\n\nTowards the end of January, Pep Guardiola described Arsenal as the “best team in the world” and it did not sound like just mind games from the City manager. The Wolves head coach, Rob Edwards, messaged Arteta after last week’s game to say that Arsenal were the best side in the league and there have been others in their positions who have privately expressed the highest admiration for what Arteta is doing. Namely, how Arsenal press, massing men around the ball, cutting off the passing lanes, forcing turnovers. How they dominate in possession, playing on the front foot, creating overloads, moving it quickly. The watchwords are remorselessness and control.\n\nAccording to Opta, Arsenal have had seven yellow cards for time-wasting in the league this season – the same number as Chelsea and behind only Bournemouth and Fulham, who each have eight. They are the seventh-worst offenders for the average time of delays for restarts, taking in set pieces and goal-kicks. They sit behind Sunderland, Brentford, Crystal Palace, Newcastle, Leeds and Burnley on the list in that order.\n\nArteta and his players remain at the centre of a storm, buffeted by ill winds, Chelsea ready to bring the latest of them. If Arsenal hold their nerve, they will have done it the hard way."

The talented 17-year-old defender comes across as grounded, intelligent, hard-working and humble, but her edge is a steely belief in her football.\n\nSarwie is speaking to the Guardian shortly before signing her first professional contract, four months after her debut in the 1-1 draw with Twente in the Champions League and three months after her first call-up to the England Under-23s.\n\nSarwie is back with the under‑23s for next month’s games against France and the Netherlands, one of two 17-year-olds considered good enough to compete alongside those vying for a chance in the senior side (the other is Erica Meg Parkinson, who plays her club football in Portugal). Last summer, at 16, she was in the squad that competed at the Under-19 Euros in Poland. “I was taken aback and I didn’t really have any expectations so it was incredible,” she says.\n\n“It’s honestly a really intense environment and every training session everyone just wants to one-up each other. It gets really competitive and just being around that wanting-to-win group was incredible.”\n\nHer Chelsea debut in October, when still 16, came as a surprise. “As soon as I got the nod from Sonia [Bompastor] that I’d be coming on for Sandy [Baltimore] and making my debut, I was just down on the sideline, shocked but pumped and ready to get on the pitch,” says Sarwie, who entered the fray against Twente in the 73rd minute.\n\nShe impressed instantly, playing with an admirable fearlessness. “Honestly, when I stepped on that pitch, I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know how to play, but I was just trying to play my part for the team, fit in and see what I could do. Towards the end of the game, I was being myself a bit more and the more playing time I’m getting, the more I’m able to express myself, but my full self hasn’t come out yet.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Chloe Sarwie (right) made her Chelsea debut in the Champions League draw with Twente last October. Photograph: Chris Lee/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\nChelsea are well equipped at right-back, with two of the world’s best in Lucy Bronze and Ellie Carpenter at their disposal, but at left-back there is a hole. With Baltimore performing well in the position but naturally a more attacking player and Niamh Charles out with an ankle injury, there have been some opportunities for Sarwie, against Crystal Palace in the FA Cup and West Ham and Tottenham in the Women’s Super League.\n\nShould her development continue at its accelerated pace there is also the chance to stake a claim in the senior England squad that has had question marks at left‑back under Sarina Wiegman. London City Lionesses’ Poppy Pattinson is the latest to receive a call-up with an eye on finding a solution to the conundrum.\n\nSarwie was introduced to the Chelsea senior side in pre-season. It was “quite exciting but also quite nerve-racking”, though training and playing with the first team has been hugely beneficial. “It’s a great challenge and I love being challenged and going up against these players, seeing how their level compares to mine and how I can get to that level,” says Sarwie.\n\n“Obviously, Lucy’s at England as well and being able to have that connection is great, even though I’m in one of the lower age groups because, ultimately, I’m learning how I can then progress to that next step and be part of the senior squad. That’s where she can give me tips and show what it takes.”\n\nSarwie began playing football in the park on her own, light on her feet thanks to ballet from the ages of two until eight. “I used to turn up to ballet with muddy tights after playing football and rolling around in the mud for a good hour or two. But ballet had a big impact on my journey as a football player as my dribbling playing style kind of links back to it. Ballet made me light on my feet. I also had to adapt from a ballet mindset, from a solo stage, to a football mindset and a team performance stage.”\n\nIt was in the park where coaches would approach her and tell her she should be playing for a club and eventually she thought: “Why not?” After a season at Millwall, she had trials at Arsenal and Chelsea and had offers from both. “I had to pick Chelsea because it was closer,” she says. “I let my family down on that one because they’re all Arsenal supporters, but oh well.”\n\nShe juggles playing and training with studying for her BTec in engineering and her mum, Joan, who is a teacher at her school, is the force that has enabled her to pursue football. She takes her laptop everywhere, to catch up with coursework, with one day a week spent in the classroom.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie takes a selfie with fans after featuring in the FA Cup against Crystal Palace. Photograph: Sport Press Photo/Alamy\n\nSarwie is having to contend with an influx of information. “It’s mad trying to switch the brain from studying engineering to football and back,” she says. “I’m still taking in everything in relation to the first team. I have all that information coming at me and then I have to go home, switch off and then do my work and it’s all a bit chaotic.”\n\nOn the pitch, there is also a balance to be struck between what is being asked of her and instinct. “Sometimes on the pitch I can be quite hesitant because I’m trying to think about what I should do at that moment instead of what I want to do, because that’s sometimes two different things. The coach wants me to do something but I want to do something else in the moment and it’s about quickly processing which one I should do.\n\n“Every day I’m getting new information coming in and I’m just trying to soak that up but trying to show myself on the pitch and putting those words into actions on the pitch can be quite difficult and it’s going to be like that for a while because of my age.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie practised ballet until the age of eight. ‘It made me light on my feet,’ she says. Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\n“Once I’m on the pitch I just want to be my most relaxed self. Breathing techniques on the pitch really help me stay calm and I’ve been told I look arrogant doing this, but chewing gum on the pitch makes me relax as well.\n\n“I want to be that person that looks in place and calm with the rest of the team, that calms that team down. I don’t want to be nervous when I get the ball, or for them to be nervous when I get the ball, I want to get the ball and to express myself as much as possible with it.”"

            "content": "As Wolves applied the seal to only their second Premier League victory of the season, Rodrigo Gomes doubling their lead over Aston Villa deep into second-half stoppage time, Rob Edwards hared down the touchline, yelling into the stands as his players started a celebratory pile-on a few yards behind him. It was a moment of catharsis for Edwards, who beat his chest and wellied an advertising hoarding, but for Unai Emery it was a different kind of cue.\n\nAs those in old gold savoured a win over near neighbours that takes them to 13 points, ending any fears that they may not eclipse Derby’s record-low tally of 11 in 2007-08, Emery marched straight down the tunnel before the post-match handshakes.\n\nWolves’s other Premier League win came against West Ham at the start of last month and no wonder the supporters savoured every second. “The two games we’ve won in the league this year, both managers have disappeared from the touchline,” Edwards said with a smile. “I think everyone expects just to turn up and win, which is understandable given how this season has gone.”\n\nAt the end of the season, how costly might this untimely slip prove for Villa? Judging by the way Emery fumed, this defeat will hurt for a while yet and, significantly, it could have major implications for their hopes of returning to the Champions League. They are on a poor run of form having taken only one win in their past six matches in all competitions and 12 points from their past nine league games. Emery called for perspective.\n\n“Maybe you can say: ‘We are losing the chance to the win the Premier League,’” Emery said animatedly. “Some supporters maybe were dreaming. Now we are not with the possibility to fight for the Premier League, some can feel frustrated, even myself because I have my dreams. In September I was worried and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. One month ago I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League.”\n\nView image in fullscreen A sodden Unai Emery tries to spur on his Aston Villa team as they struggled against Wolves. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters\n\nVilla were unpicked by a team almost certainly heading for the Championship but, as they did when rousing to a draw against the leaders, Arsenal, Wolves showed they will go down fighting.\n\nJoão Gomes fired in his first goal in a year just after the hour, starting the move himself after nutmegging the Villa substitute Ross Barkley, and then Rodrigo Gomes put the game beyond doubt on the counterattack, after Yerson Mosquera and José Sá combined to deny Amadou Onana. Morgan Rogers’s attempt to recycle a corner ended with Wolves attacking three v two. Rogers had his face in the turf as Rodrigo Gomes swivelled near the penalty spot and buried the ball past Emiliano Martínez.\n\nIt was never going to be an evening for the purists and driving rain did little to enhance this soggy Midlands derby as a spectacle. It was a contest bogged down by misplaced passes, clunky touches and the ball slowing unpredictably on a saturated surface. Ezri Konsa can vouch for that, the Villa centre-back nudging the ball back to Martínez with his big toe, just as Adam Armstrong sought to prey on Douglas Luiz’s loose pass. It was a night for the poncho-clad Wolves supporters in the uncovered Graham Hughes stand in a corner of this stadium. Hugo Bueno looked battle-hardened, the reverse of the Wolves full-back’s old gold shirt caked in mud.\n\nEmery grew increasingly agitated as the game went on. He exploded as Jadon Sancho declined to take a shot first time at the back post and there was a restlessness within the home support too. Edwards gestured for calm as the locals aired their frustration at Jackson Tchatchoua looking inside for the perceived easy pass. Wolves struggled to hold on to the ball and when they did have it surrendered possession cheaply, João Gomes among those guilty. Sá, wearing the captain’s armband, shanked a goal-kick straight out of play to the disbelief of those in the stands.\n\nWolves, certainly not lacking in spirit, defended admirably. Tchatchoua did well to halt Ian Maatsen, one of those thrown on by Emery as Villa chased the game. Toti Gomes halted an advancing Leon Bailey, another second-half substitute. Bueno blocked off all avenues for Cash and turned to celebrate with the home fans. Then, at the final whistle, having doubled their lead, Wolves let loose."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says his Tottenham players are not fit enough and has questioned their desire to put in the hard yards without the ball.\n\nThe interim head coach has a clearer idea of the problems he faces after two weeks – and there are many of them, including low levels of confidence and the capacity of the younger players to handle the pressure of a relegation battle.\n\nTudor knows there are reasons for the physical issues with the squad stretched by an injury crisis amid a punishing schedule. Although Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso are in contention to return for Sunday’s trip to Fulham, Tottenham will be without eight injured players plus the suspended Cristian Romero.\n\nTudor believes there is only one way out of the situation – an on-the-hoof fitness reboot in training, particularly as the club had no midweek fixture last week or this. The Croat surprised the players by working them extremely hard throughout last week and not tapering off before last Sunday’s home game against Arsenal, which they lost 4-1. As Tudor made plain, it is not a time to pander to player sensibilities.\n\n“Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,” Tudor said. “They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and it made the physical condition of the team drop down. So we need to use this period where we don’t play the games to put some petrol in the engine so the engine starts to work better.\n\n“They are fatigued. To do the pressing high you need to be fit. But [it is] all of them because if someone is not in the right shape there is a problem because someone is coming late [to the press].\n\n“The second thing is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back. If you run up and don’t run back it’s a problem. For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it’s a big question what we can do and what we cannot do.”\n\nTudor was asked about his full-throttle approach from the first training session. “Yes, that’s the only way – running,” he said. “The pitch is 100 yards, it’s long. So you need to run.\n\n“Maybe you have habits to, I don’t know … work a bit less. I put some runs without the ball [into the sessions]. Never players like runs without the ball so we put some runs without balls. But it’s a moment when there is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn’t like. And the best thing is that they understand this. They gave me their availability to do these things.”\n\nTudor is under no illusions about the size of the challenge. It was put to him that the striker, Randal Kolo Muani, had played well against Arsenal. “That’s good, one good thing,” he replied.\n\nWhat Tudor wants to see at Fulham and beyond is players such as Kolo Muani stepping up, accepting the responsibility. “Some players are still young,” he said. “They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to resolve the problems.\n\nView image in fullscreen Randal Kolo Muani scores against Arsenal – Igor Tudor wants him to keep raising his game for Spurs. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\n“If you have too many of these players because of the amount of injuries, who are playing together in the squad, it does create some problems. But it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man. To say: ‘Come on, I’m the guy, give me the ball, I will score.’ Instead of just: ‘What can I do? I’m just here, you know.’\n\n“It’s always how you see the situation. It’s not: ‘I’m just here. We had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play.’ How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy and positive, there is opportunity.”\n\nTudor has not dwelt for long on the derby with Arsenal. “No, no, forget that,” he said. It was never likely to be a game that would define the club’s survival hopes. The same is not true of Fulham – or the home fixture against Crystal Palace next Thursday.\n\n“After the first game, I said if you play against the best team in the world at this moment, it’s not a realistic game to show [whether] we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,” Tudor said. “That’s the truth. They show they can be in some parts of the game. But for long periods we had problems, in defence especially. It’s not easy against them. Let’s see in the next games.”"

Title run-in all about ‘little details’ Pep Guardiola has told his Manchester City players their pursuit of honours in the final three months of the season will depend on their “brains and minds”. City, who remain in contention for four trophies, meet title rivals Arsenal in the Carabao Cup final and Newcastle in the fifth-round of the FA Cup next month, as well as Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League. In the Premier League, they are five points behind Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal with a game in hand. City have had no midweek games for two weeks and – after the visit to Leeds on Saturday – Guardiola has given his players Sunday to Tuesday off as he believes the challenge in the defining part of the campaign is more mental than technical. Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more “There are still things that we should train and practise more, but I prioritised rest,” Guardiola said. “With three months left, there are many things that the team have improved in and still some things that the team has to improve, but now it is the little details. “Now it is how it is in your brains and your minds that will make the difference. Maybe for the new players it is new, but we have talked a lot in many meetings for many years that, when you arrive in the last three months, competing in all competitions, everything is here [points to his head].” Jamie Jackson\n\nEddie Howe has urged Anthony Gordon not to be distracted by reports linking him with a summer move to Arsenal amid speculation that the 25-year-old winger will be a target for the title-chasing Gunners. Howe, who is still dealing with the fallout from Alexander Isak’s defection to Liverpool last summer, could do without a repeat of that saga, but the Newcastle manager admits there is little he can do to prevent it. Newcastle face Gordon’s former cub Everton in the Premier League on Saturday and Howe said: “I’m not sure there’s a lot I can do about that. I’ve not seen the story, so it’s news to me. But we’re mid-season, we’re in the middle of some of the biggest games of his career and who knows what’s going to happen internationally with him in the summer as well? “He’s got no time to look left or right, he’s got to be fully focused on straight ahead and the next game and trying to be as good as he can be.” View image in fullscreen Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon is reported to be on Arsenal’s wishlist. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA Gordon, who earlier this month dismissed rumours he was on the way out of the club where he signed a new contract in October 2024, will hope to continue his good run of form to secure a place in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for this summer’s World Cup finals and Howe is hopeful he will not be unsettled by talk over his future. “It comes with the territory of being a top player and playing at this level, that there’s going to be speculation,” said Howe. “You’ve just got to put it out of your brain and you’ve got to focus on the football because as we know with our schedule, there’s so many games, there’s no time for distractions. We have to be fully focused on each match.” PA Media\n\n3. Moyes blames referees for corner ‘dark arts’ David Moyes has claimed corner-kick routines are turning into wrestling contests because referees have ignored “the dark arts” for too long. Moyes’s Everton team were criticised for crowding the Manchester United goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, at several corners during their 1-0 defeat at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Monday. Ahead of Saturday’s game at Newcastle, the Everton manager insisted that went against his gameplan but he, and other managers, would seek any advantage that the laws of the game offer. However, he also believes referees should take a harder line to try to eradicate jostling at set-pieces. “Truthfully, it wasn’t the plan for our corner kicks to end up like that. But I think there’s a bigger issue with it,” Moyes said. “It has been allowed to let go, whether it be blocking of goalkeepers or blocking of defenders, and you get the feeling now that referees really don’t want to get involved in any of it. It is nearly wrestling to an extent, which it shouldn’t be. It should never have got to this situation, but I think it’s been really poor that they’ve not tried to deal with it well enough and stop it. “You are now allowed lots of blocking, for example. In my day, if you blocked someone it would have been a free-kick. But blocking has become a big part of it. Let’s be fair, the best at it – but with style – would be Arsenal: good delivery, good style, but ultimately there’s a lot of dark arts in it such as blocking the goalkeeper from the back or the front, blocking defenders and making it difficult for them to be your key headers of the ball. “It is a big thing in football, but I do think the level of refereeing has let that part of the game drop. And managers, if we see somebody else doing it and not getting punished for it, then we are all on it.” View image in fullscreen More wrestling match than football as Manchester United and Everton players indulge in some dark arts from a corner. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images Ironically, Moyes felt Everton’s approach in the closing stages against United worked against his team. He wanted more variety from Everton’s corners but claimed: “It was very difficult to get the message on.” Moyes admitted: “The plan was not to deliver the corners in the fashion we did the other night. They shouldn’t have been delivered as close to the goalkeeper. They should have been delivered into different areas at different times according to what we had worked on. It became a bit of a wrestling match and I didn’t think it showed enough quality or enough thought.” Andy Hunter\n\n4. Glasner wary of United’s Carrick bounce Oliver Glasner credits Michael Carrick for imbuing Manchester United with a “great spirit” and “clear structure” since his appointment last month. No team has picked up more Premier League points in 2026 than United, with Carrick winning five of his six games in charge since replacing Ruben Amorim. Palace have been a thorn in United’s side in recent years, winning three of their five last encounters, but Glasner expects Carrick’s side to be in fine form on Sunday when the Eagles head to Old Trafford. View image in fullscreen The Crystal Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, steered his team into the last 16 of the Uefa Conference league on Thursday. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA “Of course, when Man United plays at home against Crystal Palace, everybody there is expecting now a win,” said Glasner. “They are a very good team now. They gave a very good balance between, it’s a very experienced team, with really, very experienced Premier League players, and very young players with huge talent. “It’s a good mix they have now, but I think the most important thing for them is they are consistently playing with their team and have a clear structure in the way they are playing. This is what I could see against Everton. They have a great spirit right now. It was really impressive seeing Matheus Cunha celebrating winning a duel in their own box. This, I think, is what Michael Carrick brought into this team.” PA Media"

            "content": "Paris Saint-German v Chelsea\n\nThe Club World Cup final victory over Paris Saint-Germain last summer was probably Enzo Maresca’s finest hour as Chelsea manager. He devised a gameplan, pinging balls over Nuno Mendes for Cole Palmer to chase, backed up by Malo Gusto, that tore the European champions apart in the first half. Liam Rosenior may try to exploit the same vulnerability, but this is a Chelsea that look weary, their exertions in the US perhaps having left them fatigued.\n\nPSG’s recent form has been indifferent, as proved by the fact they were forced into the playoff round by a defeat by Sporting and a draw against Newcastle in their final two league-phase games, before limping to a 5-4 aggregate win over Monaco. But then they looked unimpressive until this stage last season as well.\n\nVerdict Narrow PSG win.\n\nGalatasaray v Liverpool\n\nLiverpool have won only one of five previous meetings with Galatasaray, their league-phase defeat in Istanbul in September part of their miserable autumn. But four of those games were more than 20 years ago and Liverpool, while still nowhere near the level of last season, are a more solid team now than they were five months ago, while Florian Wirtz had begun to find his feet before his injury.\n\nGalatasaray showed both sides of their character against Juventus in the playoff round. They were exceptional in the second half of the first leg at home and Victor Osimhen may have a physical edge over the heart of Liverpool’s defence. But in the second leg, even against 10 men, they wobbled badly, losing discipline and self-belief.\n\nVerdict Comfortable Liverpool win.\n\nReal Madrid v Manchester City\n\nThe players change, the managers change, the format changes, and somehow Manchester City always end up playing Real Madrid. The sides had never met in a competitive game until 2012; these two legs will bring their meetings since to 17, including in the league phase in December, when City withstood early pressure to win 2-1 at the Bernabéu.\n\nThis will be the fifth straight season in which City and Madrid have met in the knockouts, with Madrid having prevailed on three occasions. Although City are beginning to click into form, having won seven of their last eight in all competitions, they are not the all-conquering side of old, but Madrid, having sacked Xabi Alonso, are also flawed, a gaggle of great individuals having not quite coalesced into a coherent whole.\n\nVerdict Narrow City win.\n\nAtalanta v Bayern Munich\n\nBayern Munich are perhaps the side most likely to prevent a Premier League success. They have lost just once all season in the Bundesliga and are averaging more than 3.5 goals per game in a system that gets the best out of Harry Kane. He has scored 43 goals in all competitions this season and his habit of dropping deep is complemented by Michael Olise, Serge Gnabry and Luis Díaz running beyond him.\n\nBayern finished the league phase second behind Arsenal, their only dropped points coming at the Emirates Stadium, where they were outclassed and lost 3-1. Atalanta’s comeback to overhaul a 2-0 first-leg deficit against Borussia Dortmund in the playoff round was stirring but they are not the side they were when they won the Europa League in 2024 and lie seventh in Serie A.\n\nVerdict Comfortable Bayern win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Harry Kane has scored 43 goals in all competitions for Bayern Munich this season and is key to their hopes of a first Champions League title since 2020. Photograph: Maryam Majd/Reuters\n\nNewcastle v Barcelona\n\nFor Newcastle fans, any mention of Barcelona will always conjure images of Faustino Asprilla’s hat-trick in their 3-2 win in the Champions League in 1997. They’ve lost all four meetings since, though, including in the league phase in September. That 2-1 defeat at St James’ Park, though, should give Newcastle hope: they were far from outclassed and showed a clear physical edge.\n\nA combination of set plays and pace in behind Barcelona’s remarkably high line could be a path to the quarter-final. That high line places huge stress on Barça’s press; any slip-up and Hansi Flick’s side are wide open, which in the end was what cost them in last season’s semi-final. They are top of La Liga, though, and only Arsenal scored more goals in the league phase.\n\nVerdict Narrow Barcelona win.\n\nAtlético Madrid v Tottenham\n\nTottenham have met Atlético Madrid only once, but it was one of the most famous nights in the history of the club as Bill Nicholson’s side romped to a 5-1 win in the 1963 Cup Winners’ Cup final in Rotterdam, making them the first British club to lift a European trophy. For Spurs this season, the priority has to be avoiding relegation, and it remains to be seen what impact Igor Tudor will have.\n\nUnder Thomas Frank, Europe brought a sense of relief. Only Arsenal let in fewer goals, and five of the seven they did concede came in their only defeat, at PSG. Atlético have had a mixed season and lie a frustrating fourth in La Liga. They lost to Liverpool and Arsenal in the league phase.\n\nVerdict Narrow Atlético win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Xavi Simons celebrates scoring for Tottenham in the Champions League. The tournament has offered much-needed respite to the beleaguered London club. Photograph: John Walton/PA\n\nBodø/Glimt v Sporting\n\nHaving been one of only two non-English sides, along with Juventus, not to have played a Premier League side in the league phase, Sporting’s luck held as they were drawn against by far the least-fancied side in the last 16.\n\nBodø/Glimt didn’t win a game in the league phase before Christmas but then beat Manchester City and Atlético to qualify for the playoff round, where they were highly impressive in beating Inter over two legs, despite having to play a very different style of football to the possession-heavy approach they take domestically. Momentum and their artificial pitch north of the Arctic Circle give them a chance.\n\nVerdict Narrow Sporting win.\n\nBayer Leverkusen v Arsenal\n\nArsenal won every game in the league phase. They scored the most goals and they conceded the fewest. Last season, Liverpool gained no advantage from finishing top, but Arsenal have. It’s not just that they face Leverkusen, sixth in the Bundesliga, in the last 16, it’s that if they win they will face Bodø/Glimt or Sporting in the quarter-final.\n\nThe clubs have met only once, in 2002, when Arsenal drew 1-1 away and won 4-1 at home in the second group stage, and there’s every chance of something similar here. Although Leverkusen did beat Manchester City at the Etihad in the league phase, that was one of only three victories, and in their only other game against Premier League opposition they needed a late equaliser to force a home draw with Newcastle.\n\nVerdict Comfortable Arsenal win."

            "content": "Premier League clubs are unhappy with Uefa’s decision to reveal details of their financial results before some have been published and without warning.\n\nChelsea’s record pre-tax loss of £355m last season formed a key part of Uefa’s European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report, which was presented by its executive director, Andrea Traverso, at the Financial Times’s Business of Football Summit on Thursday, with the losses incurred by Tottenham and Aston Villa also featuring prominently.\n\nThe issue is understood to have been discussed by Premier League representatives at Friday’s Champions League draw in Nyon, where there was agreement that Uefa had failed to keep them informed.\n\nNone of the clubs were briefed about Uefa’s plans, leaving Chelsea in particular frustrated at being given no time to prepare for questions on their results. The club are not planning to publish their 2024-25 accounts until the end of March.\n\nChelsea, while not contesting the £355m loss, which is based on information they provided to Uefa, insist the headline figure does not reflect the economic reality.\n\nClub sources have disclosed that the record loss reflects non-cash accounting adjustments required by Uefa’s financial sustainability regulations, specifically one-off transactions related to player contract and asset write-offs, and that they are profitable on an operational basis.\n\nChelsea were fined £27m by Uefa last summer for breaching its spending restrictions and ordered to submit to a business plan, but are confident of avoiding another sanction. As part of that settlement agreement Chelsea were permitted to continue running at a substantial loss, as long as it remained in line with “the projected deficit submitted in the business plan”."

It’s completely abhorrent.\n\n“Churchill was a great Briton. This Government will always stand up for our values and the perpetrator must be held to account. We’re glad the police have made an arrest.”\n\nThe statue has been targeted by left wing demonstrators several times before.\n\nIn 2020, Black Lives Matter activists crossed out Churchill’s name and wrote “was a racist” on the base.\n\n\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters followed suit later that year and scrawled the same graffiti on the plinth.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nTrans rights demonstrators climbed on top of the sculpture in protest of the Supreme Court’s ruling on the definition of being a woman last year.\n\nIt is now a criminal offence for protesters to climb on the memorial following legislation passed last year."

            "content": "ISRAEL and the US have launched an attack on Iran – with strikes hitting close to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s office.\n\nDonald Trump confirmed he had pulled the trigger on “major combat operations” – warning Tehran’s “menacing activities directly endanger the US and our allies”.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an eight-minute address, Trump said: “For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted ‘Death to America’ and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed.\n\n“It’s been mass terror, and we’re not going to take it any longer.”\n\nIt comes after the US president spent weeks building up a formidable military presence in the Middle East.\n\n\n\nTrump warned the twisted Ayatollah he would be forced to blitz his regime if a nuclear deal put forward by Washington wasn’t signed off.\n\nIsrael this morning launched a “pre-emptive” daylight attack on Iran’s capital – with plumes of smoke seen rising from Tehran.\n\nStrikes against the rogue nation are being launched by the US by air and sea, one official told Reuters.\n\nThe first apparent strike happened near Khamenei’s office in an attack Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, said was to “remove threats”.\n\n\n\nKhamenei, 86, hasn’t been seen publicly in days as tensions with the US have grown – and it is unclear whether he was in his offices at the time.\n\nBut the attack comes as the US has assembled a vast fleet of fighter jets and warships in the region to try to pressure Iran into a deal over its nuclear program.\n\nAnd yesterday, the UK evacuated embassy staff out of Iran – with China and Canada urging their citizens to leave immediately on Friday.\n\nWhite House officials were briefed about the possibility Trump could drop bombs last weekend after a surging build-up of US warships and attack jets within striking distance of Tehran.\n\nOn Friday morning, Canada and China urged its citizens to evacuate Iran “as soon as possible”. And the US Embassy in Jerusalem told all non-emergency government personnel to leave Israel.\n\n\n\nTrump has vowed to hit Iran as hard as possible if it continues to refuse to end its nuclear enrichment programs.\n\nHis staggering military deployment near to the mullahs’ regime sparked fears he would strike imminently.\n\nAround one third of the US Navy amassed within striking distance of Tehran marking the biggest military build-up in the Middle East since the US invaded Iraq in 2003.\n\nTrump is expected to have liaised with Israel over the strike plans.\n\nNegotiations over ending Iran’s nuclear programmes have been ongoing for weeks now but it appears Trump’s patience has finally worn thin.\n\n\n\nThe US are adamant that Iran has accelerated its efforts to build a nuclear bomb and was working on ballistic missiles which could strike America.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance accused Khamenei’s regime of rebuilding secret atom plants smashed by US stealth bomber strikes last June.\n\nTrump echoed the same claims in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, where he claimed Iran would soon be able to strike the US mainland.\n\nWashington warned they would launch a broad campaign against Iran’s nuclear facilities and heads of state if a deal wasn’t made, the WSJ reported.\n\nThe blitz comes as a relative shock after Trump declared at a Board of Peace ceremony on Thursday that he was giving Iran ten more days to sign off on the nuclear deal.\n\n\n\nIn recent weeks, the US had been building up a huge armada in the Middle East as they looked poised to strike on Trump’s command.\n\nThe mighty USS Gerald R. Ford joined up with the USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike group already in the region – putting two full carrier battle groups within reach of Tehran.\n\nA dozen other warships and hundreds of fighter jets equipped with advanced air-defence systems have also been stationed near Iran.\n\n\n\nAnd Trump’s first kamikaze drone squad, dubbed “Task Force Scorpion”, has been authorised for deployment.\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei is yet to respond to the strikes – with him suspected of cowering away in his notorious bunker.\n\nHe had warned last week that he would sink US warships lurking in the Persian Gulf if they showed any sign of preparing for a fight.\n\nKhamenei said the US that “the strongest army in the world might sometimes receive such a slap that it cannot get back on its feet”.\n\nWith a full-scale conflict looming, civilians in Iran are continuing to mourn the lives of those killed during nationwide protests which started in December.\n\n\n\nOfficial figures put the death toll from the horror attack on protesters at around 3,117.\n\nWhile US-based human rights news agency Hrana fears the number is likely above 6,500.\n\nToday’s attack is the second time Trump has directly launched strikes on Iran in the past eight months.\n\n\n\nBack in June 2025, Trump deployed bunker buster bombs on Iranian nuke sites in strikes named Operation Midnight Hammer.\n\nThe US claimed they wiped out the majority of Iran’s nuclear capabilities but Tehran vowed they were still able to enrich uranium from the sites.\n\nIt remains unclear how Iran – as well as the rest of the Middle East – will react to Trump’s brazen attacks.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIranian officials have warned in the past they will immediately reply with missiles of their own directed at US bases in the region.\n\nThis would destabilise the Middle East with Trump’s forces spread across multiple nations such as Turkey, Jordan and Bahrain."

It didn’t crash. It was a runway excursion,” he incredulously claimed.\n\nSeveral drivers were left injured as the aircraft performed an emergency braking manoeuvre.\n\nThe total number of casualties is still unknown and a probe has been launched into the cause of the crash.\n\nReports indicate that the stricken plane was transporting valuables from the Central Bank of Bolivia.\n\nHundreds of banknotes were scattered in the wreckage.\n\n\n\nA fire truck also sprayed the aircraft with the airport’s water tanks in case of a blaze, although the plane did not explode.\n\nThe injured have been rushed to a nearby hospital to receive specialist care.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 300 officers are still guarding the crash site as an estimated 15,000 hopefuls gather outside.\n\n\n\nSome have reportedly tried to knock down a metal fence in a bid to get to the money.\n\nIt comes as another 15 people including a congressman were killed in a horror crash in Colombia last month.\n\nJust 12 minutes after take-off, authorities lost all communication with Satena Airlines Flight HK4709, which had two crew and 13 passengers on board.\n\nTragically, there were no survivors, Colombia’s civil aviation authority said.\n\nThe government-owned airline did not say what caused the crash and said the plane’s emergency beacon had not been activated.\n\n\n\nDiógenes Quintero, a member of Colombia’s House of Representatives, and congressional candidate Carlos Salcedo Salaza were both on board the flight, according to a passenger list released by the airline.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe crash site was found near Colombia’s border with Venezuela in Curasica, Playa de Belén, Norte de Santander.\n\nPolitical party Union for the People claimed members of its officials’ teams were also on board the flight."

This was a large SUV type vehicle and was inevitably going to cause serious injury.\n\n“Had the car passed over someone’s head that person would have almost inevitably been killed.\n\n“The reality is that having lost your temper you were intent on causing mayhem and injury to those on the road.”\n\n\n\nProsecutor Daniel Oscroft said the car “reversed and circled back and round and drove at pedestrians knocking people over”.\n\nMr Calistus heard the “cracking” of his bones as the Mercedes rolled over him and later said he thought he was going to die.\n\nHe spent three weeks in hospital undergoing major surgery.\n\n\n\nIn a victim statement, the DJ said: “I was the victim of a serious incident which changed my life.\n\n“I am still undergoing treatment. I am left in constant pain, I have reduced mobility, have visible scars and psychological trauma.\n\n“It was not just my job it was my dream my purpose.”\n\nAfter the carnage, Suffi tried to dispose of the Mercedes and fled to Dubai before being brought to justice.\n\nHe was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent after a trial in December, having already admitted dangerous driving.\n\n\n\nSuffi, of Aston, Birmingham, was jailed for 11 years and six months and banned from driving for 10 years and seven months.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThree pals — Daanyal Hussain, 21, of Yardley; Mustafa Gohari, 21, of Acocks Green; and Armaan Abid, 23, of Handsworth — had earlier admitted affray.\n\nThey were each handed 11-month jail sentences, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to complete 180 hours of unpaid work."

And in extraordinary scenes, the Office for Budget Responsibility accidentally published the key measures before Ms Reeves stood up.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as your Preferred Source in your Google search settings.\n\nSo the aim for this year's Spring Statement is to make it low-key affair. But it will also be a big moment for the Government after its devastating defeat in the Gorton and Denton by-election on Friday.\n\nA Treasury source told the Mirror: \"The economic plan is the right one. The numbers back that up.\" The insider said: \"You can see that the numbers are starting to improve. I think it will be a moment of defiance. We know what we are doing and we are doing the right things.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA Downing Street source said rather than being packed with policies, the statement would show that the Chancellor has the right plan to fix the economy. The source added: \"The number one issue for voters is the cost of living. Because of the action we've taken, inflation is coming down, interest rates are coming down.\n\n\"The PM started the year saying the cost of living was the number one priority. People calling for us to drastically change course need to know this hasn't changed.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about the Spring Statement.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nStudent loans hope after Martin Lewis slams 'horrible' decision for graduates READ MORE :\n\nView 2 Images Rachel Reeves will seek to show the Government's plan is on track after Keir Starmer suffered a nightmare by-election loss (Image: Simon Dawson / No 10 Downing Street)\n\nWhen is the Spring Statement?\n\nRachel Reeves will deliver the statement to Parliament at around 12.30pm on Tuesday, March 3. It could be as short as 20 minutes, as she offers her update on the state of the economy. Sadly there will be no red box moment outside Downing Street, as that only happens at the Budget.\n\nWhat will be in it?\n\nMs Reeves will update on the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) economic and fiscal forecasts - essentially a temperature check on the economy. Estimates on growth, inflation, unemployment, government spending and tax income over the next few years will be published alongside the statement.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpring statements are usually light on actual policy, however there are exceptions. Last year Ms Reeves tacked on highly controversial benefit cuts to the statement in a bid to balance the books. The plans to slash £4.8billion from health-related benefits by 2029 triggered a political storm and was later abandoned by Keir Starmer, leaving Ms Reeves with a black hole to fill.\n\nThe Treasury appears to have learned its lesson and this year Ms Reeves is not expected to make any big announcements.\n\nWill taxes go up?\n\nThere is no need to panic about higher taxes. Tax and spending decisions are only taken at what is known as a fiscal event - the Budget.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Chancellor has deliberately decided to only hold one fiscal event a year, to offer greater stability to businesses so they don't have to worry about plans constantly chopping and changing.\n\nSo why does it matter?\n\nThe latest estimates will give us a sense of how the Government is getting on. Ms Reeves gave herself £21.7billion in headroom at the Budget so she wouldn’t have to come back for more tax rises.\n\nIf this cushion has been reduced, speculation will ramp up again on whether she needs to hike taxes in the autumn. If it gets much bigger, MPs may start pressing her to spend some of this cash.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nParticular areas of vulnerability include defence spending, where military chiefs have been pressing the Treasury to speed up budget hikes. Student loans are also shooting up the political agenda amid concerns young people are being ripped off with interest rates and changes to repayment terms."

She reveals what happened on that historic day\n\nView 7 Images Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Jeffrey Epstein\n\nThe British journalist behind the infamous photograph of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein together in New York is calling on Royal Protection officers who were with the former prince to speak out. Recalling the moment that exposed their relationship, back in December 2010, Annette Witheridge tells The Mirror: “I was there. I saw them leave Epstein’s New York home together and walk together to Central Park, where the picture was taken.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“If we hadn't got that picture, there would have been no Epstein/Andrew connection, because Andrew would have carried on denying it and we couldn’t have proved it. Now it is literally THE picture. History was made. It was the start of a whole house of cards [coming down] that led to where we are now with Andrew. But I must admit when we snapped the pair, I didn’t know the magnitude at the time.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAndrew fury over home move with unbearable challenge and unanswered question READ MORE :\n\nNow Annette, who covered a host of massive stories for The Mirror and The Sunday Mirror during her 24 years in New York, is now calling on the police who were protecting Andrew to speak out. She says: “Those officers… they should be talking now. I often wonder why they’re not saying anything. Why have they never spoken to the authorities? I hope that they do now. They could fill in lots and lots of gaps.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 7 Images Annette Witheridge tells The Mirror: “I was there. I saw them leave Epstein’s New York home together and walk together to Central Park, where the picture was taken.\" (Image: Tamworth Herald)\n\nAnnette was working with photographer Jae Donnelly - whose picture sparked a series of events that led to Andrew’s disastrous Newsnight interview - and, following a tip off that he was in New York, had tracked the former prince down to Epstein’s home near Central Park. She says: “I thought, ‘He [Andrew] wouldn’t be stupid enough to stay at Epstein’s, but on his road was an undercover NYPD van. Then, as soon as I heard British accents speaking into walkie talkies, I knew I’d got him.\n\n“At 11.20am, Woody Allen and his wife went into the house. I thought it was an old person and his carer at first. Now we know they’d been in for bagels. By 1pm, I was sitting right outside the house, we couldn’t hide, we were in plain sight. I’d got the window open slightly and heard the guys with British accents, the Royal Protection Squad. They said, ‘what happens if he goes walkabout?’ The answer was lost on the wind.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“But a minute or two later, the front door opened and whoosh, there was Andrew and Epstein. Andrew was much greyer than I thought he would be.” As Annette and Jae pursued them in the car, she recalls saying: “Oh my god, it’s him.” She continues: “We got to the corner of 5th Avenue. They went right, which was against the heavy Christmas traffic. Jae ran out and got ahead of them into Central Park and got the snap. They returned to Epstein’s home 20 minutes later. Little did I know how important that picture was going to be.”\n\nView 7 Images Then-Prince Andrew, Virginia Giuffre, and Ghislaine Maxwell posing for a photo. (Image: US District Court - Southern Dis)\n\nIn July 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested and charged with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. He was found unresponsive in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City while awaiting trial. The New York City medical examiner officially ruled his death a suicide by hanging. His close associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, 64, is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for sex trafficking of a minor and conspiracy, following her conviction in 2021 for her role in procuring and grooming teenage girls for Epstein.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAs a result of growing concern over his association with Epstein, and allegations of sexual assault made by the late Virginia Giuffre, Andrew was stripped of his royal title and evicted from his Royal Lodge home in Windsor. Earlier this month, in an unprecedented move, Andrew was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.\n\nView 7 Images Melania Trump, Prince Andrew, Gwendolyn Beck and Jeffrey Epstein at a party at the Mar-a-Lago club, Palm Beach, Florida, February 12, 2000 (Image: Getty Images)\n\nNow Annette is urging the officers she saw outside Epstein’s house to speak out. She says: “Andrew’s people knew we were out there, so did Epstein’s. I understand the Royal Protection Squad and why they didn't say anything to Andrew. These guys, these seasoned police officers, you think they’ve seen it all. But there were so many girls who were of a grey area when it comes to age going in and out of the house.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Perhaps the officers had daughters of the same age, and were absolutely disgusted by what they had seen. They were staying there as well, you couldn’t avoid seeing those girls going in and out. It was every hour, every two hours, they weren't wearing any makeup, big puffer jackets and hoods and hats. We looked at them and thought why are they here and what are they doing? And those officers must have thought the same. At the time I assumed they were told to keep quiet.”\n\n7 View 7 Images Part of the Jeffrey Epstein files, this image shows British former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling over a woman lying on the floor (Image: US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE/AFP via) 7 View 7 Images Jeffrey Epstein (Image: Corbis via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, THAT picture continues to shape history. Annette says: “The picture prompted Virginia Roberts [later Giuffre], to talk. And so the whole thing began to unravel. Watching it in real time is really like, this is history in the making here.” Ms Guiffre alleged she was trafficked by Epstein to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor when she was 17, which he has always strenuously denied. She died by suicide in April 2025.\n\nBut the scandal continues to haunt the former royal, especially since the release of millions of documents from the Epstein files in January - including, images, videos, and emails detailing the activities of the disgraced American financier. Annette, who now lives in Islington, north London, is even mentioned in them. She says: “I was laughing to myself because a lot of it is basically me doing my job, going round to the girls, all the women that he had facilitated, and dropping notes through their doors when they weren't in.\n\nView 7 Images Virginia Roberts Giuffre, with a photo of herself as a teen, when she says she was abused by Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew, among others (Image: TNS)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“There were a load of emails and one said, ‘if that Annette Witheridge person knocks on my door one more time…’ After Virgina Roberts spoke out, I sent a legal letter to Ghislaine Maxwell’s people, saying they had a day to comment. It was forwarded to Ghislaine’s person, then to Ghislaine, then to Epstein, and ultimately to Andrew. He said, ‘I can’t take any more of this’. And to think, that was only the beginning.”\n\nAnnette met Ghislaine once many years ago, while working for The Mirror on its pop column. She says: “Robert Maxwell, her father, owned The Mirror then, and Ghislaine used to swan into our office. She didn't speak to me because I was too lowly, but she would demand that pop columnist John Blake got her really hard to get hold of concert tickets. She demanded a meeting with Mick Jagger, which he managed to arrange.\n\n“She was a horrible human being even then. She went out to the New York office and did the same out there, demanding tickets to Broadway shows. Then her father died and she somewhat had her tail between her legs. But then she met Epstein, who was able to give her what she wanted. But what price did she pay? There are some times, and this sounds terrible, but I feel sorry for her. She is the only person that has taken the wrap.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n“But then I think ‘you know what, she was an older woman, she picked on young girls. They trusted her, she was like a big sister to them and she abused them.” Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested and released under investigation. He has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein."

Pulling in 13 million viewers at its peak, the show chronicled the lives of Aidensfield residents in North Yorkshire during the 1960s.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe beloved drama attracted audiences exceeding 13 million during its prime Sunday evening broadcast and proved the ideal vehicle for former EastEnders star Nick Berry. Throughout nearly two decades, the cast evolved but the gentle storylines and comforting atmosphere it generated remained constant.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe show launched the careers of performers including Niamh Cusack, Joe McFadden, Jason Burr and Nikki Sanderson, however, in 2010 Heartbeat was cancelled due to declining viewing figures, devastating both its loyal fanbase and the village where filming took place, as an entire tourism industry had flourished around the shooting locations.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeculation emerged that Sky might rescue the Sunday night drama, but unfortunately this never materialised and the final episode broadcast in 2010.\n\nBut since the cameras stopped rolling on the North Yorkshire moors in 2010, the cast has traded the sleepy village for a reality filled with health battles, secret engagements and miracle babies. We've taken a look at what became of the cast who found fame through Heartbeat.\n\nView 13 Images The popular show was axed in 2010 due to declining audience numbers\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNick Berry\n\nView 13 Images Nick Berry played the role of PC Nick Rowan (Image: Colin Davey/Getty Images)\n\nHeartbeat was developed specifically for the former EastEnders heartthrob, who portrayed PC Nick Rowan from 1992 until 1998. Only recently, fans have found out he was also the voice behind the iconic theme tune to the show.\n\nFollowing five years on the BBC soap and achieving a number one single, the actor, now 62, became a viewer favourite on the ITV programme before starring as harbour master Mike Nicholls in Harbour Lights and as a police officer in the drama In Deep.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, he then abandoned the spotlight to become a stay-at-home father, aged 39. Discussing his choice to prioritise his family, he revealed to Mail Online in a 2011 interview: \"I chose to be a stay-at-home dad and have loved it. I always said that when the boys were teenagers I could go back, but the longer you don't do something the harder it is to do it, and I haven't really missed it.\"\n\nHowever, he did return to EastEnders in 2012 for a one-off special following the death of his on-screen mother, Pat Evans. Nick, who married his wife Rachel Robertson, a former Levi's model in 1994, and lives with her and their two sons in Epping, Essex.\n\nNick now appears completely transformed from his Heartbeat days when he was recently photographed picking up a coffee from his local bakery. The father-of-two looked relaxed in a black NYC t-shirt, jeans, trainers and sunglasses.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHis last television appearance came in 2012 when he turned up on EastEnders for Pat Butcher's funeral, though fans will be pleased to hear the star hasn't completely dismissed a return to Walford. Confessing he'd \"never say never\", it seems the possibility remains open for Wicksy to make a comeback.\n\nNiamh Cusack\n\nView 13 Images Niamh played Nick's wife Kate Rowan in the show\n\nNiamh portrayed Nick's wife Kate Rowan on the programme, a role which catapulted her to fame. She chose to depart the series after falling pregnant, but subsequently enjoyed a distinguished theatre career alongside appearances in numerous prime-time television shows.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNiamh has an impressive list of credits to her name, including The Tower, Brassic and Death in Paradise. She is married to actor Finbar Lynch, with whom she shares son Callum. Now 66, has continued to act since leaving Heartbeat in 1995, and has appeared in Always and Everyone, New Tricks, Silent Witness and The Virtues.\n\nWith a longstanding relationship with the Royal Shakespeare Company, Niamh played Desdemona in Othello and Juliet in Romeo and Juliet in the '80s, before returning to the company in 2018 to play Lady Macbeth alongside Christopher Eccleston in Macbeth. She has recently appeared in the 2024 hit We Live in Time alongside Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield, as well as the dark comedy series Big Mood.\n\nMark Jordon\n\nView 13 Images Mark is now engaged to fellow soap star Laura Norton (Image: Instagram/@laura_norts)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMark portrayed PC Phil Bellamy from Heartbeat's inception and became a cornerstone of the Aidensfield community. His on-off romance with barmaid Gina Ward captivated audiences and there wasn't a dry eye in the house when the pair finally tied the knot after she popped the question whilst he was hospitalised.\n\nTragically, however, they were denied the fairy-tale ending they deserved when PC Bellamy lost his life in the line of duty. He became embroiled in a confrontation with an armed criminal wielding a shotgun, who was attempting to abduct his son from his former wife.\n\nAs the village constable attempted to disarm him he was fatally shot. Following Mark's departure from the Yorkshire beat he secured roles in Coronation Street, Hollyoaks and Casualty. Mark also bagged the part of Daz Spencer in Emmerdale until 2019, and has directed the short film, To The Sea Again.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe was previously married to Happy Valley star Siobhan Finneran with whom he has two children and is now in a relationship with fellow ex-Emmerdale star Laura Norton.\n\nNow 61, Mark and Laura have teased \"maybe this year\" is when they will get married after their long engagement. Speaking of wedding bells, outside of the soap Laura met Mark on the set of Emmerdale back in 2015, with the couple starting to date shortly after. They share two children together, their son Jesse and daughter Ronnie. The couple have spent years advocating to find a cure for Usher Syndrome, a condition that both their children were born with.\n\nTricia Penrose\n\nView 13 Images Tricia played barmaid Gina in Heartbeat as a tearaway teenager (Image: Photo by Martin Black/TV Times/Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTricia was a beloved barmaid at the Aidensfield Arms and was renowned for her no-nonsense, Scouse wisdom. She had been a teenage tearaway and was dispatched to the quiet village to work for her uncle, George Ward, in his pub.\n\nGina swiftly settled into village life but following a string of unsuccessful romances it appeared she was concentrating on her career when she inherited the pub from her uncle after his death. The barmaid and PC Bellamy had always shared a close bond and she eventually wed him in series 16 but was left heartbroken when he was killed.\n\nShe contemplated departing the village following his death but after discovering she was expecting Bellamy's baby decided to remain. Their son Philip Oscar Bellamy was born in the series 17th finale. Following Heartbeat's cancellation, actress Tricia discovered a new audience through reality television, featuring on Celebrity Big Brother, Big Star's Little Star and Celebrity Pointless.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAn experienced singer, Tricia pursued music alongside acting in Heartbeat, even reaching the final of the UK's former Eurovision selection contest A Song for Europe in 2002.\n\nNow a dedicated mother, Tricia resides in Cheshire with her family and hosts a radio programme on Radio Wirral. Tricia recently got engaged to her partner, writing on X: \"My lovely Chris has proposed on our 7 year anniversary! Off to Tenerife now with my lovely fiancé to celebrate\".\n\nBill Maynard\n\nView 13 Images Bill (middle) played Claude Jeremiah Greengrass (Image: ITV/Yorkshire Television)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA seasoned performer, Bill had accumulated four decades of experience in entertainment before joining Heartbeat's cast, beginning with Carry On films and numerous television programmes.\n\nHe portrayed Claude Jeremiah Greengrass from 1992 to 2000 and was recognised by his surname. Greengrass served as the village's wheeler dealer and a charming scoundrel who consistently found himself in troublesome predicaments.\n\nTragically, Bill was forced to depart Heartbeat due to deteriorating health, with his character's exit explained as joining his sister on a Caribbean cruise. Bill’s final television appearance was in an episode of Celebrity Pointless in 2018, before he unfortunately passed away that same year from injuries sustained after falling from his mobility scooter on Good Friday in 2018. He was 89. Bill is remembered as one of the most iconic and recognisable characters of the Heartbeat series.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDavid Lonsdale\n\nView 13 Images David played David Stockwell and was known for his comedic lines\n\nDavid Stockwell delivered the comic moments in the village and resided with his mother. Before long, Greengrass recognised he could be easily manipulated and he became his assistant, earning his keep by completing odd jobs for Aidensfield's residents and working at the garage.\n\nDavid was touched when Gina invited him to be godfather to her son. Since Heartbeat concluded, David has appeared in Coronation Street, Casualty and the film adaptation of Downton Abbey. He also featured in The Real Full Monty.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPeter Benson Bernie Scripps served as Aidensfield's funeral director whilst also running the village garage. He remained a central figure in Heartbeat for 15 years, departing in 2010 when the series concluded.\n\nFollowing the popular show's cancellation, he made two appearances in Casualty and secured parts in A Touch of Frost, The Bill and Coronation Street. Peter passed away in September 2018 aged 75.\n\nNikki Sanderson\n\nView 13 Images Nikki played Dawn in heartbeat, and has now revealed she is expecting a baby (Image: Rowan Griffiths / Daily Mirror)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHaving risen to prominence as Candice in Coronation Street, Nikki traded the cobbles for the North Yorkshire Moors as Dawn Bellamy. She arrived to stay with her aunt, Gina, soon after her uncle Phillip's death in her attempt to escape the crowd she had become involved with in Manchester.\n\nDawn swiftly became a hit with both the villagers and viewers but departed Heartbeat in 2009. Nikki is now recognised for portraying Maxine Minnver in Hollyoaks, where she has held a principal role since 2012. She also featured on the gruelling survival programme Celebrity SAS Who Dares Wins.\n\nNow 41, she has revealed she and her former Hollyoaks and Emmerdale beau Anthony Quinlan had a lengthy journey to get pregnant, but are now expecting their first child. Nikki is due in the spring and quit her role as Hollyoaks' Maxine Minniver last April, in order to focus on parenthood.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking about the pressures she faced, Nikki told the Daily Mirror: \"I'm worried about the pressure of people being like, 'Has she had the baby yet?'\", but admitted they'll be a \"lovely little spring baby.\"\n\nDerek Fowlds\n\nView 13 Images David played Sgt Oscar Blaketon and featured from the start to the end of the show (Image: YTV)\n\nDerek was amongst the handful of actors who featured in Heartbeat from its inaugural episode through to its finale. He portrayed Sgt Oscar Blaketon and served as the reliable presence guiding the village police officers.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe was compelled to retire from the force after suffering a heart attack and purchased the Aidensfield Arms. Derek enjoyed a lengthy and diverse acting career, featuring as Bernard Woolley in Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister. Even before Heartbeat, Derek had starred in shows like Yes Minister (1980–1984) and The Basil Brush Show (1969–1973). His last recorded acting role was a cameo in Run for Your Wife (2012). Tragically, he died aged 82 in January 2020 due to heart complications and sepsis.\n\nJason Durr\n\nView 13 Images Jason Durr as PC Mike Bradley (Image: PA)\n\nAfter PC Rowan's exit, Aidensfield required a fresh constable on patrol, and ex-Metropolitan Police officer PC Mike Bradley fitted the bill perfectly.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe residents of Aidensfield were initially sceptical about their new policeman, but he gradually earned their trust and appeared to have found his place in the community. Mike wed local solicitor Jackie Lambert, though their union crumbled when she had an affair with a client.\n\nHe subsequently began a relationship with the village GP, Dr Tricia Summerbee, and was devastated when she lost her life in a horse riding incident. He ultimately left the village after securing a position in CID.\n\nPortrayed by Jason Durr, the actor went on to play nurse David Hide in the long-running BBC drama Casualty, though in 2019, he revealed he was departing after six years. Now 58 and a father-of-three, Jason and his wife Kate live in Malmesbury, while his most recent acting role was starring in the stage production of Murder at Midnight in 2024 and 2025.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWilliam Simons\n\nView 13 Images William Simons played PC Alf Ventress in the show and was another that starred for the entire run (Image: ITV)\n\nAs the enduring Aidensfield PC Alf Ventress, he featured in Heartbeat throughout its entire run. Following Heartbeat's cancellation, Welsh actor William appeared in Casualty, The Bill, The Royal, Coronation Street and Emmerdale. He had also previously featured in Lovejoy. Tragically, William passed away in 2019, aged 78.\n\nJoe McFadden\n\nView 13 Images Former Holby City star Joe McFadden has revealed he's engaged to his partner, Rob Smales\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe third major recruit to Aidensfield's police force, Joe portrayed Joe Mason in Heartbeat between 2007 and 2010. Overconfident, he initially failed to impress some locals but proved himself capable at his work and quickly won over the community.\n\nFollowing the show's conclusion, Joe starred in Holby City until his character met his demise in 2017. That same year he featured among the celebrities competing in Strictly Come Dancing and ultimately claimed the Glitterball trophy alongside Katya Jones. Joe has also appeared in The Crow Road and Sex, Chips and Rock and Roll.\n\nNow 50, Joe is currently starring as Andy Dufresne in the UK stage tour of The Shawshank Redemption and came out as gay in 2024, announcing his engagement to artist Rob Smales, and continues to be active in theatre and television.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFor those who'd like to relive the memories, you'll be glad to know that episodes of Heartbeat are still available to view on ITVX.

Her lips are closed and pulled down at the corners in an unusually serious look from a woman who is known for her wide-eyed smiles.\n\n\"It's her eyes that appear to have taken on a more haunted, wary expression here and although she tries to chat to suggest a normal, relaxed outing with friends, her tense facial muscles suggest she's far from comfortable here.\n\n\"She even tries to walk quickly and drink from her coffee cup at the same time, which wouldn't be a normal manoeuver, suggesting she might be keen to use the cup as a barrier to partially hide her face.\"\n\nJudi observed that, when one of Beatrice's friends used \"expansive hand gestures\" during a conversation, Beatrice looked down \"with her body slightly hunched over her hot drink\" in a reticent pose.\n\n\"When she does look up she performs a nose-wrinkled expression that hints at a grimace of dislike or disgust, perhaps at the camera attention\", she added.\n\nHer younger sister Eugenie has also been spotted in the capital - but mystery surrounds the current whereabouts of mum Sarah Ferguson, who it was claimed this week had spent time at a wellness retreat in Donegal, Ireland.\n\nAccording to royal expert Ingrid Seward, Fergie may well have fled the country to seek solace at one of the homes of her many wealthy friends around the world.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"Nobody knows where she is at this moment, I mean she could be anywhere, she could be in Dummer with her stepmother, or she could be abroad,\" she told the Mirror.\n\n\"She's got some rich and powerful friends who probably will stick by her, because we know rich and powerful people like drama, and this is a great drama, isn't it?\"."

            "content": "Six reasons you may cancel your £174.50 TV Licence payments\n\nWhile TV Licences currently cost £174.50 per year, this will increase to £180 from April 2026\n\nView 3 Images The TV Licence fee is typically mandatory for people who watch live TV or BBC iPlayer content (Image: Halfpoint Images via Getty Images)\n\nBuying a TV Licence is typically a legal obligation for anyone watching live television or BBC iPlayer, with the fee currently costing £174.50. However, there are six specific situations in which you can cancel it entirely and avoid future payments.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMost evidently, this covers people who don't watch or record live television on any channel or device, along with those who have stopped viewing programmes on BBC iPlayer. Anyone moving to a property already covered by a TV Licence may also want to end their payments.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFurthermore, official TV Licensing guidance identifies several other scenarios that could require cancellation. The six situations listed on its website include:\n\n‌\n\n\n\nYou don’t watch or record live TV on any channel or device, and you don’t download or watch BBC programmes on BBC iPlayer any more You are moving to an address that already has a TV Licence You are moving into a care home You are moving abroad The licence holder has died You have two licences for the same address\n\nView 3 Images There are six specific situations in which you can cancel a TV Licence entirely (Image: Alrphoto via Getty Images)\n\nThe site further advises: \"You may be able to get a refund on your TV Licence if you are not going to need it again before it runs out, and there is at least one whole month left on it. If you pay for your licence with a TV Licensing payment card (cash plan), call 0300 555 0286. If you pay for your licence by Direct Debit, call 0300 790 0368.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt's important to note that some Brits may also qualify for a free or discounted TV Licence, provided they meet the criteria set by the UK Government. This includes people living in residential or sheltered accommodation who might be eligible for a £7.50 licence if they meet either one of two conditions.\n\nAccording to the UK Government, this includes:\n\nBeing retired and over 60\n\nHaving a disability\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"You can get a TV Licence for £7.50 if you live in an eligible residential care home, supported housing or sheltered accommodation,\" official GOV.UK advice explains. \"Your housing manager can check if you can get it and will apply for you.\"\n\nMoreover, people aged 75 or over who claim Pension Credit might be entitled to a free TV Licence. The same arrangement exists if you share a home with a partner who claims Pension Credit, as the licence covers everyone at a particular address.\n\nPension Credit is separate from the State Pension. It refers to a means-tested benefit for people past State Pension age on a low income, topping up weekly earnings to £227.10 for single people or £346.60 for couples.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Some people are also eligible for free or discounted TV Licences (Image: alvaro gonzalez via Getty Images)\n\nThose claiming Pension Credit can apply for a free TV Licence upon turning 74, although they must keep paying until the end of the month before their 75th birthday. After this point, they become entitled to the free licence.\n\nLastly, anyone registered as blind or residing with someone who is can secure a 50% discount on their TV Licence. This brings down the price of a colour licence to £87.25.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOfficial Government guidance explains: \"The licence must be in the blind person’s name - if it’s not, you can make a new application to transfer it into their name. You’ll need to provide your existing TV Licence number when you apply.\"\n\nStandard-coloured TV Licences usually cost £174.50 per year, while black-and-white licences cost £58.50 per year. However, from April 1, 2026, the annual cost of a TV licence will rise to £180.\n\nThe increase follows the methodology of calculating the licence fee in line with the consumer price index (CPI) until the end of the BBC Charter Period. This means the cost of an annual colour TV licence will rise by £5.50, or the equivalent of an extra 46p a month.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFor more information, head to GOV.UK or the official TV Licensing website.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

No finder's fee, no compensation,’ Rueda allegedly wrote in an email to his publicists at the time.\n\nManny Pacquiao is suing a law firm and their client for allegedly fabricating a case against him\n\nThe message never came to light despite a judge ordering Rueda’s messages be turned over in 2018, and was only uncovered from a forensic analysis by Pacquiao’s team in 2023.\n\nPacquiao’s lawyers say they traced the gruesome texts of body parts back to a mass-distributed cartel scam.\n\nRecords cited by his new lawsuit allegedly show identical threats were sent to more than 100 other people unconnected to the case.\n\nAfter losing the case, Withers Bergman tried to withdraw as Rueda’s lawyers, and his attorney Amman Khan’s profile was removed from the firm’s website.\n\nOver a decade on from their first encounter, Pacquiao is set for a stunning rematch with Mayweather in Las Vegas later this year.\n\nA Hollywood waiter sued Pacquiao in 2016 after claiming he was owed an $8million fee for helping to arrange his blockbuster May 2015 fight against Floyd Mayweather (pictured)\n\nThe fight icons will meet again in September in the first ever boxing match at 'The Sphere' off the strip in Sin City, it was announced earlier this week.\n\nThe bout is set to be globally broadcast on Netflix as part of the streamer's growing investment into live sports.\n\nMayweather, 49, first has to take on Mike Tyson, 59, in an exhibition bout this spring.

            "content": "Frank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980.

'Definitely world championship material in a different era. R.I.P.'\n\nCastillo ultimately served as an announcer alongside legendary play-by-play man, Chick Hearn.\n\n'Ruben and Chick Hearn were gold on Fights From The Fabulous Forum broadcasts,' one fan wrote online. 'Great stuff.'\n\nHe also had a reputation as a positive influence on many young fighters and fans.\n\n'A great man,' his nephew wrote on Facebook. 'Both him and his family were a great part of my childhood. He always gave great advice, would be there when ya needed him. Going to parties at his place, doing golf charity events. He def was the neighborhood Uncle for alot of us.\n\nCastillo later served as an announcer on many WBC fights from the Forum in Los Angeles\n\n'A Family man, Boxer, Charity planner, we lost. Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God. May his wife Cindy, family and friends find comfort with the support of the so many who loved Ruben. Rest in eternal peace.'"

            "content": "Tyson Fury's comeback opponent, Arslanbek Makhmudov, has sensationally been filmed wrestling a bear ahead of their April bout.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on April 11.\n\nAnd 36-year-old Makhmudov, who has a 21-2 record and a knockout ratio of over 90 per cent, has been seen going to extreme measures to train himself up ahead of their meeting, including wrestling a 'three-metre tall and 400kg' brown bear.\n\nIn the video, Makhmudov can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm. The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

Ben Youngs, Freddie Steward and Jack van Poortvliet all grew up in East Anglia yet the area has no professional club representation.\n\nSeason ticket renewals for Norwich City are among the highest in England because it is a remote part of the country which has little other professional sport on offer.\n\nThe RFU and Prem Rugby should be banging down the door of Sir James Dyson, the British inventor who grew up in the area but currently pumps his millions into the jersey sponsorship of Bath.\n\nBirmingham, Yorkshire, Liverpool and the south coast are other areas that rugby should be trying to tap into as part of the long-term plan to grow the sport.\n\nScrapping promotion and relegation is a tough pill to swallow, although the gulf between the first and second division has become virtually unbridgeable.\n\nEnglish rugby's overhaul should be used as a springboard for expansion in untapped counties\n\nWorcester Warriors and London Irish are primed to apply for one of the 12 top-flight franchises and return to the PREM, having been expelled over financial difficulties in 2022 and 2023\n\n28 CLUBS HAVE PLAYED IN THE PREMIERSHIP - WHO'S NEXT? Team Seasons Bath 36 (7 titles) Gloucester 36 Leicester Tigers 36 (11 titles) Harlequins 35 (2 titles) Wasps 35 (6 titles) Northampton Saints 31 (2 titles) Saracens 31 (6 titles) Sale Sharks 30 (1 title) London Irish 28 Bristol Bears 25 Newcastle Red Bulls 24 (1 title) Worcester Warriors 16 Exeter Chiefs 13 (2 titles) Orrell 10 Leeds Tykes 8 Nottingham, West Hartlepool 5 Birmingham Moseley, Rosslyn Park 4 Bedford Blues 3 Liverpool St Helens, London Scottish, London Welsh, Richmond, Rotherham Titans, Rugby Lions, Waterloo 2 Coventry 1\n\nThe model is broken and ring-fencing with the option for expansion offers a happy medium. A pathway for ambitious clubs remains (at least in theory), while new investors can be confident they are not throwing money into a black hole.\n\nAfter the RFU council approved the changes yesterday, Exeter Chiefs owner Tony Rowe told Daily Mail Sport that investor confidence immediately spiked.\n\nNow 77, Rowe is speaking to new investors and negotiations can now advance with financiers in America. ‘We’re talking to a couple of investors and one of them wanted to wait to hear what happened this week,’ he said.\n\n‘English rugby is desperate for money but it’s difficult to find investment because of the worry of relegation. Red Bull didn’t just come along and say, “we don’t mind if we get relegated”. They were banking on this decision.\n\n‘I’m certain we’ll see more big names invest in English rugby now. Money dictates where sport goes and if somebody wants to pay handsomely to change the name of Exeter I have no doubt that might happen.\n\n‘We’re in the market for a partner investor. It’s going to cost you somewhere between £50m and £100millon to get a Prem side together with a stadium. I’m sure there are people out there interested in doing it.\n\n‘There are talks about rugby at the new stadium in Birmingham. Yorkshire has more rugby clubs than any other county but none of them perform at the top level so it would be nice to see another club there. Maybe someone in the North West. We want people to come into the Prem and first we want to get back to 12 clubs.’\n\nThe likes of Ollie Chessum, Freddie Steward and Fraser Dingwall have all played in the second division and the competition must not be set up to fail. It is key the chances of promotion remain genuine if teams meet the relevant criteria.\n\nSeason ticket renewals for Norwich City are among the highest in the country because it is a remote part of the country which has little other professional sport on offer\n\nYorkshire has not had a Premiership team since 2011, when Leeds Carnegie went down - a year later, they sold their P shares in the competition to Exeter Chiefs\n\nThe perfect scenario is more big hitters enter the market and rugby’s ecosystem grows. We could see more investment into playing squads, stronger academies and a trickle-down effect on the Champ.\n\n\n\nWe have seen London Irish, Wasps and Worcester fold under the financial pressures of professional sport but, after years of turmoil, there is an opportunity for new shoots to appear off the beaten path."

            "content": "Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall always thought he would play for David Moyes, ever since the Everton manager tried to sign him for West Ham.\n\n‘It felt like I needed to work with him at some point,’ he says. But then close relationships with managers don’t always take you where you think they will.\n\nTwo summers ago, Dewsbury-Hall followed Enzo Maresca from Leicester to Chelsea only to find himself on the fringes. Two Premier League starts in a season was not what he thought Chelsea had paid £30million for.\n\n‘There were times when it felt very dark,’ Dewsbury-Hall admits. ‘If I am not playing, I can feel useless. I am very emotional.’\n\nNow, three-quarters of the way through a debut season at Everton, Dewsbury-Hall can talk about a career revived and some ambitions of winning a first cap for his country that have not been discouraged by England manager Thomas Tuchel.\n\n‘I've spoken to him once or twice,’ he tells Daily Mail Sport. ‘He was at Old Trafford when I scored. He was at Fulham when I scored. So I wouldn't mind him coming to more games! He's been complimentary and told me to stick at it. I feel like I am ready now. I feel like I am moving forwards again.’\n\nIn his debut season at Everton, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall can talk about a career revived and some ambitions of winning a first cap for his country\n\n'I feel like I am ready (to play for England) now. I feel like I am moving forwards again.’\n\nDuring a season of change – most of it positive – at Everton, Dewsbury-Hall stands out. Jack Grealish was the big-name signing but injury has ended his season. Young Tyler Dibling has struggled. Dewsbury-Hall, now 27, has assumed the role of senior player quite naturally.\n\n‘When I broke through at Leicester I just went on to the pitch trying to do the right thing,’ he says. ‘Now I've got a different mentality. I want to stand out.\n\n‘The manager and myself have history. He's known me for a while. He was interested when he was at West Ham. So it felt like the right time now to come to him. I just genuinely thought it would click here and it has. I know if I had the opportunity at Chelsea, it would have been the same.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall was a late developer and a thinker. It’s not always a great combination. As a teenager he interpreted his slow physical progress as a weakness. But now that he’s through all that, a clear intellect radiates and it’s to his benefit.\n\nFew footballers are as engaging or as curious. Two years into a degree in sports management, he has concerns about the direction football is taking on and off the field. He is also obsessed with West End musicals – 'my guilty pleasure' – and is convinced he will stand on a different kind of stage one day. Meanwhile he is an accomplished snooker and pool player.\n\n‘I do like to learn,’ the Nottingham-born midfielder says in his broad East Midlands accent. ‘I don't just like sitting on my backside doing nothing.’\n\nIn three weeks, fatherhood beckons. A little girl. That learning process is about to be accelerated and maybe it’s fitting, then, that Everton chose him to visit Much Woolton Primary School, 10 miles from Hill Dickinson Stadium, to read to a class of 25 children ahead of World Book Day next week.\n\nThe kids are blindfolded and have to guess the identity of their ‘secret reader’ as Dewsbury-Hall makes his way slowly through a page of a Harry Potter book he has chosen. When his identity is revealed, there is classroom bedlam. An enthusiastic signing session follows, as Dewsbury-Hall makes his way from table to table talking about books, reading and a fair bit of football.\n\nThe kids at Much Woolton Primary School are blindfolded and have to guess the identity of their ‘secret reader’ as Dewsbury-Hall reads a page of a Harry Potter book he has chosen\n\nWhen his identity is revealed, there is classroom bedlam. Dewsbury-Hall makes his way from table to table talking about books, reading and a fair bit of football\n\n‘You know, I was really nervous before going in there,’ he smiles as he sits down to talk in the headteacher’s office. ‘I haven't read out loud for a while. Football's not easy but I'm used to that, aren’t I? I thought, \"God, if I start making mistakes here, I'll make myself look like a right sausage\". But no, it was good in the end.’\n\nChildren can be blunt. At one stage, Dewsbury-Hall is asked by an eight-year-old why Everton can’t win at home. It’s a theme we return to. Ahead of today’s visit to Newcastle, Everton sit ninth despite having won only twice at their new Hill Dickinson Stadium in the Premier League since the start of November, and none of the last six.\n\n‘I do think there's maybe a little mental block there at the moment,’ he admits. ‘That does happen in football. I truly believe it. Something will happen in a game and it will just knock us for six or it will change the way we play. Whereas away, we know what we're doing.\n\n‘We do talk about it. I'm not gonna lie to you. We're humans. We ask ourselves why it goes wrong. We have tried training on the pitch and stuff and will probably do it again.’\n\nReflection is common in football and Dewsbury-Hall is prone to it. His home library comprises largely of autobiographies and motivational business books but not much of it prepared him for what happened at Chelsea.\n\nFollowing Maresca to Stamford Bridge in 2024 felt like the next step. Instead, Dewsbury-Hall found himself buried beneath a mountain of midfield bodies. He was the only player to feature in all 15 games of the club’s Conference League triumph and had some minutes at the Club World Cup. But every weekend brought Premier League disappointment.\n\n‘I had a lot of options but signed for Chelsea genuinely thinking I was gonna play,’ he says. ‘I believed I could. I know I could. And then football is football. Things happen.\n\n‘Obviously the competition was high. Rival midfielders were £100m players (Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez). It was a strange dynamic at times. It was quite fortunate for the club that the manager could field two very strong teams.\n\nHe was the only player to feature in all 15 games of the club’s Conference League triumph and had some minutes at the Club World Cup\n\nHis home library comprises largely of autobiographies and motivational business books but not much of it prepared him for being overlooked by Enzo Maresca at Chelsea\n\n‘But it was weird - it almost felt like no matter how well I played in midweek, I would not play at the weekend and that was the only thing that didn't sit well with me. In football it's important, if you're playing well, that you get the chance to play. I'm a very emotional guy. If I'm not playing, I feel useless, basically. I feel like I haven't got a purpose because that's my life.\n\n‘So yeah, there were dark times where I thought, “I don't care about money or anything else. I just wanna play football, so why aren’t I?”.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall’s relationship with Maresca meant there were regular conversations but not reassurances. ‘He was as honest as maybe he could be,’ the player adds. ‘He said some things that I wanted to hear and maybe some things that I didn't want to hear. He told me I had to be patient and said I wasn’t as big a fish in a pond as I was at Leicester.\n\n‘I am not gonna cry over it. I know if I did play more I would have been able to show people what I could do. In my head, that's a fact. But the strategy worked for the club, didn’t it? They won trophies and they got in the top four.\n\n‘I could easily have stayed at Chelsea for much longer but I wanted to go to a club with a project and be a main player. Everton felt perfect. Seamus Coleman has been here 17 years and tells me to imagine what winning a trophy would be like.\n\n‘If you can do that here, you'll go down in history books. This fanbase deserves good times and it gave me that extra motivation to come. Now I'm in such a better place. People look at me in a different light I hope.’\n\nRelationships with coaches and managers are always key to a player’s development. Dewsbury-Hall has had his bumps in the road and sometimes they have been impossible to see coming.\n\nAt Leicester, the club he joined aged eight, Brendan Rodgers gave him his senior debut at the age of 21 but he soon learned that managers have egos too.\n\nAt Leicester, the club he joined aged eight, Brendan Rodgers (right) gave him his senior debut at the age of 21 but he soon learned that managers have egos too\n\nScoring the winning goal at Old Trafford in November as David Moyes' side pulled off a famous win with 10 men\n\n‘He organised a pool tournament and everyone had to join in,’ recalls Dewsbury-Hall, a friend of four-time world snooker champion Mark Selby, the 'Jester from Leicester'. ‘I was playing for a pub team when I was 10 years old. I mean, I can play.\n\n‘I was young at the time – wasn’t a first-team player – but was drawn to play him (Rodgers) in the first round. I said to the lads: “Do I try my hardest?” Because he was having himself. He was going, “I'm really good at pool” and all the lads thought he fancied himself to win the whole thing.\n\n‘Quite a few people were watching and I beat him 3-0 and you could tell he was raging. I've just gone, “Yeah, sorry gaffer” and a week later got sent out on loan to Blackpool. So yeah, I mean, that was a fun week of my life.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall’s talents as a snooker player are not in doubt. As an actor, there is not yet any proof but he does yearn to find out. His love of the West End runs deep. He has watched endless shows in London and on New York's Broadway, and has contacts and friends in the business. A few years ago he was due to have a brief role through a BBC project in The Lion King but an injury got in the way.\n\nHe has tried and failed to encourage interest in various team-mates. ‘They just look at me like I am alien,’ he says. 'But one day I genuinely believe I'll do something in the West End.\n\n‘I resonate with what they do every night, giving their best to a completely new set of eyes. That's hard to do, so I respect them so much.’\n\nIn terms of the football, Dewsbury-Hall looks at where the game is going and, along with many others inside and outside of dressing rooms, has concerns about the influence of money, endless VAR checks, 100-minute matches and social media.\n\nAsked if the game is losing a bit of its innocence, he says: ‘Yeah, a little bit. And look, I'm old school. I'm an old head. That's why I hang around with people like Seamus.\n\nDewsbury-Hall looks at where football is going and has concerns about the influence of money, endless VAR checks, 100-minute matches and social media\n\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel was at Craven Cottage earlier this month to see Dewsbury-Hall score in the win over Fulham\n\n‘It's going away from that sort of old-school football isn’t it? It’s the way the world's going. Football’s more business now than it was. It will only increase. I just don't want it to lose its identity and lose why we fell in love with the game. I grew up watching Match of the Day and all I cared about was seeing people score goals. I don't want kids in 10 years watching it and going: “What is this?”\n\n‘It should be about the love. But look at the last week. The north London derby is taking 15 minutes to get restarted. Lloyd Kelly gets sent off for Juventus in the Champions League for the most ridiculous thing in the world. Rules are rules in football but sometimes you just need to smell a situation.\n\n‘The players, we're humans just like you. We grew up watching the sport. It's obviously just because we're inside it now, it's a bit more close to home. But we see the same things you see. We have the same concerns.’\n\nFor now, Dewsbury-Hall is probably too busy to save football. But Everton have a fine player and the rest of us have a genuine thinker in our midst. He is in Tuchel’s thoughts for a reason."

            "content": "Why Aston Villa can feel a Champions League place slipping through their fingers AGAIN: The three key players they look half a team without and where Unai Emery is going wrong after Wolves defeat: TOM COLLOMOSSE\n\nWhen Rodrigo Gomes sealed Wolves' victory with a handful of seconds remaining, Unai Emery had seen enough.\n\nThe Aston Villa boss marched straight down the tunnel and when Rob Edwards approached the away dugout at full-time to shake hands, Emery was nowhere to be seen. Soon after full-time his captain, Ezri Konsa, appeared to be restrained by a Villa staff member. There were suggestions Konsa had exchanged cross words with some away supporters.\n\n'In September I was worried about being in the relegation zone,' said Emery, referring to Villa's poor start. 'Then maybe a month ago I was dreaming of fighting with Manchester City and Arsenal for the title.\n\n'We are having a great season and I want to tell our fans now that we need them. We are grateful for them for being with us but at Villa Park we need their help. We need to be together – players, coaches, fans, everyone.\n\n'Our points total is similar to clubs who have finished in the top five before. We are competing against great teams and for them it is necessary to finish in the Champions League. We need to keep our position.'\n\nJoao Gomes' opener and Rodrigo's clincher means Wolves eclipse Derby's record low points total from 2007-08 and they deserved their win. 'I have not been especially focused on [the total] but it is important for the club and the fans,' acknowledged Edwards.\n\nAston Villa will have fears over their Champions League spot again after losing 2-0 at Wolves\n\nUnai Emery was left with his head in his hands as his third-place side stumbled at Molineux\n\nThe lasting image of the night, however, was Emery's touchline meltdown. Villa fans hope their toiling team do not follow suit as they fear a Champions League place will slip from their grasp for the second season in a row. Their next two fixtures are against fellow contenders Chelsea and Manchester United.\n\nAsked about the pressure on Villa, Morgan Rogers said: 'It does weigh on us but it shouldn't. We deserve to be here and we should not forget that. There is nothing to worry about.'\n\nEmery's early exit was no surprise. From the moment he gave Jadon Sancho an earful midway through the first half, the Spaniard looked ready to boil over. 'Only seven?!' he seemed to scream at the fourth official after the stoppage time board was raised, with his side chasing an equaliser. Earlier, Emery appeared to ignore Emi Buendia and Lucas Digne when they were substituted, his frustration growing when play was delayed due to an issue with referee Craig Pawson's earpiece.\n\nEmery is one of the finest managers in Villa's history but this was not his finest hour. From the moment the team sheet landed, his night started going wrong. Ollie Watkins and Lucas Digne ahead of the in-form Tammy Abraham and the adventurous Ian Maatsen. Really?\n\nThen there was his demeanour throughout the game. Emery is always full of nervous energy on the touchline and usually it is a positive force. Here, though, it could not possibly have been.\n\nVilla are still third in the table, six points ahead of Liverpool in sixth, and are favourites for the Europa League.\n\nVilla needed Emery to be calm. Instead he acted like a man who was watching everything go up in smoke, though he had cooled down by the time he faced the media.\n\nIn this form, Villa will struggle to succeed at home or in Europe. When Joao Gomes gave Wolves the lead just after the hour mark, only Ezri Konsa and Digne tried to encourage their team-mates. Konsa and Amadou Onana berated Buendia for dragging his heels as the Argentine walked to the bench after being substituted.\n\nWolves know they are down but there are still certain matches that can bring some light in the darkness. One is next week's FA Cup fifth-round tie against Liverpool. The other is the chance to knock over one of their local rivals.\n\nThe absence of key players is starting to take its toll on Villa. Shorn of Boubacar Kamara, as well as John McGinn and Youri Tielemans, they look half the team.\n\nJoao Gomes (above) struck midway through the second half to put Wolves in the ascendancy, before Rodrigo Gomes grabbed the hosts' second goal with virtually the last kick of the game\n\nVilla's dismal defeat marked just the second time Wolves have won in the league this season\n\nThe early signs were not promising. Buendia's clumsy challenge on Jean-Ricner Bellegarde gave Wolves a free-kick that Mateus Mane sent just wide from 22 yards. Many expected Abraham to be preferred to Watkins here and in the sixth minute Watkins wasted a great chance to repay that faith.\n\nSent clear by Morgan Rogers, Watkins hesitated just long enough for Yerson Mosquera to steal the ball before the forward could even shoot. Moments later, Pau Torres wasted a free header from Douglas Luiz's corner. Luiz then volleyed straight at Jose Sa and at the other end, Mateus Mane put a free-kick just wide and Toti Gomes miscued a volley.\n\n\n\nThe pattern did not change in the second half until, moments after Emery had made a double change, Jackson Tchatchoua crossed from the right, Adam Armstrong laid the ball off and Gomes crashed it in off the bar from 15 yards. Maatsen's arrival made a difference and his rising shot forced Sa into another sharp stop and Mosquera cleared off the line from Abraham before Rodrigo sealed it in front of the South Bank."

            "content": "Igor Tudor forced to abandon his plan to save Tottenham from relegation with high-energy football as interim boss realises his players are too UNFIT\n\nIgor Tudor has shelved plans to impose his full-throttle brand of football at Tottenham after realising his players are not in good enough physical shape.\n\nTudor has forged a reputation for an intense, man-to-man, high-pressing tactical style during his 13-year coaching career.\n\nIt was part of his appeal for Spurs where fans demand adventure and ambition but just a fortnight and one game into his tenure, he admits this will not be possible with the tired and depleted squad he has inherited.\n\n'Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,' said Tudor. 'They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and the physical condition of the team has dropped down. So, we need to use this period where we don't play the games to put some petrol in the engine, so the engine starts to work better.\n\n'They are fatigued and to press high you need to be fit. But all of them. If someone is not in the right shape, there is a problem because someone is coming [pressing] late. And the second thing, is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back so if you run up and don't run back it's a problem.\n\n'For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it's a big question what we can do and what we cannot.'\n\nIgor Tudor has revealed that he was shocked by his players' fitness at this point in the season\n\nTudor has surprised some Spurs players with some gruelling running sessions in training overseen by the fitness coach he brought with him Riccardo Ragnacci.\n\n'That's the only way, running,' said the Spurs interim boss. 'The pitch is a hundred yards, it's long. You need to run. There are habits. Maybe you have habits to work a bit less. Players never like runs without the ball so we put in some runs without the ball.\n\n'There is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn't like. And the best thing is that they understand this.'\n\nTudor's initial assessment is not dissimilar to predecessors Ange Postecoglou and Thomas Frank, who both concluded that the squad was neither strong nor robust enough to cope when coupled with the expectation to play adventurous, exciting football and attack four competitions.\n\nBut the urgency of these circumstances, four points above the relegation zone without a win in nine Premier League games, together with the Croatian's imposing stature and taciturn delivery gave his message the ring of a chilling wake-up call for his players.\n\n'There is some pressure here in this club,' said Tudor. 'Some players are still young. They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to solve the problems.\n\n'If you have too many of these players because of injuries who are playing together it does create some problems, but it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man.\n\n'To grow fast and say, 'Come on, I'm the guy, give me the ball, I will score' instead of just, 'What can I do, I'm just here you know'. This is the challenge for each of them. Why not say, 'Come on, I will be the guy, give me the ball, I will not cry, I will take the ball, I will defend my box'.\n\n'It's always how you see the situation. You can always see it both ways. Or 'I'm not, I'm just here and we had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play'. How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy, positive there is opportunity.'\n\nWhen asked ahead of Sunday's trip to Fulham if he thought there were enough soldiers for the fight ahead, Tudor said that he hoped and believed there were and promised not to read too far into performances in his first game, a 4-1 defeat against Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\n\n\n'If you play against the best team in the world, at this moment, for us, I need to be honest, it's not a realistic game to show we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,' he said. 'That's the truth. For long periods in the game we had problems, in defence especially. It's not easy against them. Let's see in the next games.'"

            "content": "Arne Slot defends Liverpool's £450m summer spending spree amid dip in form from last season\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot thinks people are quick to forget extenuating circumstances when discussing the club's £450million summer spending spree.\n\nThe champions spent a lot of money but Slot says that he has not had access to half of those assets as Alexander Isak and other new boys have spent the majority of their Liverpool careers injured.\n\nDoubling down on similar comments made earlier in the week, Slot said: 'I have tried 450 times to say we also sold £300m (worth of players in the same window), that never comes across and people NEVER talk about it.\n\n'In general I only ever see, \"£450m spent, 450, 450, 450\". And no one looks at the circumstances, which are that the 450 is very well spent… very, very, VERY well spent, one more time: very well spent.\n\n'They are great football players which will be a big, big, big success for this club. Some already now and some in the future. The reality of this season is we sold for £300m, some starters like Trent (Alexander-Arnold) sold for only £10m.\n\n'We had to recoup the money with players. From that spend, then £250m of it (has not been used)… Alex has not been the Alex of Newcastle, maybe 20 minutes at Tottenham, I don't criticise him because we signed him for six years not six months.\n\nArne Slot has insisted Liverpool were right to splash out £450million in the summer because of the players they sold\n\n'Giorgi (Mamardashvili), we needed him because Caoimh (Kelleher) left but we hardly played with two goalkeepers. Jeremie (Frimpong) has been injured, Giovanni (Leoni) out for the season.\n\n'Tomorrow, I miss out on Florian (Wirtz, who is injured).'\n\nMeanwhile, Slot has also urged for patience with 17-year-old winger Rio Ngumoha, who has been subject to much clamour from fans and media this week after his promising cameo off the bench at Nottingham Forest last week.\n\nIt comes at the same time fellow wingers, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo, have been out of form in front of goal.\n\nSlot said: 'Let's be clear, he is a special player that will have more playing time and already has more playing time recently.\n\n'But for a player that is playing for the Under 19 team of England, if everyone thinks he is so good, then he should be in (in a higher international team).'\n\n\n\nThe Reds will be without Wirtz for the visit of West Ham but Frimpong is back in the squad after missing the last month with a groin problem."

            "content": "Two significant dates are marked in the calendar for Harry Maguire next week.\n\nOn Thursday, a celebration for the Manchester United and England defender’s 33rd birthday. Twenty-four hours earlier, a retrial over allegations he assaulted a police officer and of attempted bribery is scheduled to take place on the Greek island of Syros.\n\nSafe to say, he will only be turning up at one of them.\n\nIn the unlikely event that the shambolic Greek legal process functions on this occasion after no fewer than four previous postponements, Maguire isn’t even required to appear in person. He will instead be doing what he does best, anchoring United’s defence against Newcastle in the Premier League at St James’ Park.\n\nThe good times and the bad times have never been far apart during a rollercoaster career at Old Trafford that could feasibly come to an end in June, although there is growing optimism that contract talks will have a positive outcome before then.\n\nAside from the arrest in Mykonos on a family holiday in 2020, Maguire has been booed by his own fans playing for club and country, and been the target of a bomb threat. He has been dropped from the United team, stripped of the captaincy, and would have been sold in 2023 had he not rejected a £30million move to West Ham.\n\nHarry Maguire has fought his way back into a key role for Manchester United\n\nThe good times and the bad times have never been far apart during a rollercoaster career at Old Trafford that could feasibly come to an end in June\n\nThroughout it all, Maguire has kept his dignity and remained loyal to United when it didn’t always feel like the club were being loyal to him. Those who have worked with him describe the ultimate team player who puts his body on the line and faces adversity while worrying more about those around him.\n\nThere he was again at Everton on Monday, leading the defensive effort in the face of a late onslaught to earn a 1-0 win that put United back into the top four.\n\nRestoring Maguire to central defence in a 4-2-3-1 formation has been one of the key changes under Michael Carrick.\n\nAfter missing the final two months of Ruben Amorim’s tumultuous reign through injury, he returned on the bench for two games under Darren Fletcher, and has started all six of Carrick’s matches in charge.\n\nNo wonder United’s new head coach expressed hope on Friday that Maguire will stay beyond this summer, when his contract expires. United are known to be concerned about losing him at the same time as another experienced player in Casemiro.\n\n‘Harry's had a great career so far, and hopefully there's a lot more to come,’ said Carrick, who was first-team coach under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when Maguire arrived at United from Leicester in a £80m deal in 2019.\n\n‘He’s an impressive character. He has been here on the journey and the experiences that he's had, and with England as well, shows exactly what he is. I think we all know the player he is and what he's capable of doing.’\n\nWith all Maguire’s experience, is he in some of the best form of his career?\n\n<p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>\n\n‘There's a case,’ nodded Carrick. ‘I think as your career goes, when you're a young player everything's fresh and new, and you're fearless and there's not many scars there.\n\n‘You get to your peak years and you feel good, but obviously you've had a few ups and downs along the way. The experience that you've gained then makes you a better player; that sweet spot of being able to do it physically still, but using the experiences to know what's coming.\n\n‘Experience is massive, it's hard to put a price on how valuable that can be. Harry's gained an awful lot of it in different ways through this club.’\n\nIncluding interim managers and caretaker coaches, Maguire has played under seven different bosses at United. Some have valued him highly, others less so. Most of them had to rely on him at some point.\n\nLikewise the fans, although for the most part he has always had the backing of hardcore United supporters who appreciate his endeavour and a knack for late goals. His winners against Liverpool and Lyon were the stand-out moments under Amorim.\n\nMaybe not the Australian day-trippers who booed him at the Melbourne Cricket Ground when United played Crystal Palace – their opponents at Old Trafford on Sunday – on tour in 2022, and again in Perth a few days later.\n\nOr the idiot who had threatened to bomb Maguire’s home in March of that year, leading to the player moving his partner Fern and their two young daughters to a safe house while police carried out a sweep of the property and United brought in extra protection.\n\nThe so-called United boo-boys never bothered Maguire, but that wasn’t the case with his England critics.\n\nTargeted by Three Lions fans when England played Ivory Coast and Germany in 2022, he was hammered so relentlessly by Scotland supporters as he scored an own-goal at Hampden Park the following year that his mother Zoe took to social media to hit back at the ‘disgraceful’ behaviour. ‘That was a bad one for him,’ says an insider, referring to the lows of the 2022-23 season.\n\nThe so-called United boo-boys never bothered Maguire, but that wasn’t the case with his England critics\n\nNew United manager Erik ten Hag preferred Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane in central defence. The captain and mainstay under Solskjaer, Maguire only started eight Premier League games.\n\nThere was the awkwardness of coming off the bench in the Carabao Cup final against Newcastle at Wembley to then lift the trophy with Bruno Fernandes.\n\nMaguire had to publicly deny rumours of a leadership challenge from Cristiano Ronaldo before the Portugal star was pushed out of Old Trafford, but insiders say that he saw Ten Hag’s decision to hand the armband to Fernandes coming long before he was stripped of the captaincy that summer.\n\nNews broke just before a pre-season tour in which Maguire had the added indignity of being berated by goalkeeper Andre Onana on the pitch against Borussia Dortmund in Las Vegas and again booed by fans before a pre-season game against Athletic Bilbao in Dublin.\n\n‘He was very consistent in terms of his emotions,’ says one source. ‘When the younger players look at him, they must think “he’s been through so much, what have we got to complain about?”.’\n\nAll the while, the shadow of his trial in Greece continued to hang over the player and his family after he was arrested in August 2020 following a brawl. Maguire, who claimed to be defending his sister Daisy during the altercation in a bar, was handed a 21-month suspended sentence. However, the conviction was automatically quashed on appeal under Greek law and four retrials have been postponed.\n\nThe Maguire camp want to clear his name, and their legal team will be ready for court again on Wednesday, but no-one expects it to go ahead. There are doubts it will ever take place at all before the statute of limitations runs out in August 2028.\n\nMaguire is said to be very close to his family. His parents Zoe and Alan travel the world watching him. His brothers Laurence and Joe are both footballers, and Daisy works in the sports and entertainment industry.\n\nMaguire has played under seven different bosses at United. Some have valued him highly, others less so. Most of them had to rely on him at some point\n\n‘He was very consistent in terms of his emotions,’ says a source. ‘When younger players look at him, they must think “he’s been through so much, what have we got to complain about?”.’\n\nThat's one reason why Sheffield-born Maguire is said to be keen to stay in the North West and sign a new deal with United. The signs are promising.\n\nHe has been able to talk to foreign clubs since the beginning of the year, but turned down AC Milan and Brendan Rodgers’ new Saudi club Al Qadsiah in January.\n\nUnited are committed to driving down the wage bill and want to reduce his £180,000-a-week salary. But at least they are open to negotiation, which was not necessarily the case with Casemiro.\n\nAt this stage of his career, Maguire wants some security in terms of length of contract as he prepares to turn 33. ‘It’s an amazing club to play for and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could,’ he said last year.\n\nForm and fitness will be factors in United’s decision, and in that sense Maguire has a strong case.\n\nHe has outlasted his central defensive partners Varane, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans at Old Trafford. Martinez is out again after only recently returning from a long-term injury, and Matthijs De Ligt has not been available since the end of November. Youngsters Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven have had their teething troubles.\n\nThomas Tuchel has also taken note and says Maguire is in his thoughts for the World Cup. The player is desperate to go to North America after missing out on Euro 2024 through injury.\n\nHe has yet to play under Tuchel and won the last of his 64 caps in a Nations League win over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in 2024.\n\nHe has yet to play under Thomas Tuchel and won the last of his 64 caps in a Nations League win over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in 2024\n\nMaguire is still holding out hope of playing in a third World Cup for England\n\nSteve Bruce, who knows a thing or two about playing centre back at United and captaining the club, believes Maguire is worthy of a new contract and a World Cup spot.\n\n‘I believe Harry has been made the whipping boy for what was going on around him for too long,’ Bruce told Daily Mail Sport. ‘I don't think he's ever let Man United down. In fact, he's never let England down either.\n\n‘I wouldn't be surprised if he went to the World Cup and gets offered a new deal. Why wouldn't you? I think centre-halves get better with age. Over the last five or six weeks, he's given a reminder of just what he's about – if he ever needed to.’"

            "content": "England have spent this entire Twenty20 World Cup talking about playing the perfect game, yet remain firmly in the hunt to become the first country to win the tournament three times because they have learned to deal with their imperfections.\n\nThis astonishing late heist against New Zealand kept up their 100 per cent record in the Super Eight stage, meaning Harry Brook's team will, barring some extraordinary results this weekend, be heading for the second semi-final in Mumbai on ­Thursday — where the prospect of a frenzied atmosphere against co-hosts India or a replay of their group-stage meeting with West Indies, their only defeat here, awaits.\n\nMore top-order failure meant that for much of a chase of 160, it looked like they would be destined for Kolkata instead, until a seventh-wicket union between Will Jacks and the recalled Rehan Ahmed worth 44 off just 16 deliveries catapulted them to victory.\n\nIt speaks of the dysfunctional aspects of this team that Jacks, their No7 batsman and sixth bowler, has won four man-of-the-match awards in 20 days. On the balance of probabilities, their luck must run out eventually.\n\n'Yeah, you're right, because ideally I would do nothing, and I'm kind of at some stage the extra bowler and the extra batter. If I didn't bowl and didn't bat, we'd have had that perfect game that we keep speaking about,' Jacks said, following two for 23 with an unbeaten 32.\n\n'We've won six out of seven games and qualified for a semi-­final. We obviously want to play well but we're not gutted we ­haven't been perfect. What we've done well is in the key moments, we've kept a calm and clear head and managed to get those rewards.'\n\nWill Jacks starred with both bat and ball as England beat New Zealand at the T20 World Cup\n\nEngland required 42 off 17 when Ahmed, preferred to Jamie Overton because the match was contested on a used pitch, got off the mark by launching a 103-yard six off spinner Glenn Phillips, who had been reintroduced to the attack for his ability to dart the ball in from around the wicket, cramping his opponents for room.\n\nIt was almost fantasy cricket: as he left the dugout at 117 for six, all-rounder Ahmed received a walkie-talkie message from coach Brendon McCullum to bat like India great Virender Sehwag.\n\nTwo balls later, Jacks sent a skyscraper of a hit over the midwicket boundary to truly seize the momentum and with New Zealand reeling, he powerfully pierced the field for back-to-back fours.\n\nWhen Ahmed danced down the track to hit a second six from the final ball of the penultimate over, sent down by the usually parsimonious Mitchell Santner, they were on the verge of a victory set to an all too familiar template: Nepal, Scotland and Italy discomforting them until late in proceedings in the group stage.\n\nHowever, after New Zealand followed the way of Sri Lanka and Pakistan, captain Santner said of England: 'If you can get yourselves out of a tricky position to end up winning it does a lot for the team, and a lot for the confidence.\n\n'There's no better team at finding a way to win from anywhere. There's different guys stepping up at different times, which is what you want. I wouldn't want to face them, if we're in the semi-finals.'\n\nThe Kiwis face a nervous wait as defeat has presented the outside possibility of Pakistan pipping them for the last four. To do so, Pakistan must defeat Sri Lanka by a minimum of 64 runs or chase down their target in 13.1 overs in Pallekele today.\n\nIn England's favour is an extraordinary belief that they can win from anywhere, and an enviable team spirit. 'This is the era of Harry Brook as white-ball captain,' said Jacks, as if to emphasise the captain's popularity within a youthful squad.\n\nRehan Ahmed put on a more-than-useful partnership wirth Jacks to steer his side to their sixth win from seven games\n\nBut members of the old guard are an issue: the opening partnership of Jos Buttler and Phil Salt averages just 12 in the tournament, and Buttler has just 62 from seven visits to the crease.\n\nEngland have been effective at the start of bowling innings, taking 18 powerplay wickets in the tournament, before this fruitless return against Tim Seifert and Finn Allen.\n\nJofra Archer's form bodes well whichever opponents await. Here, he started with a maiden featuring a successful Seifert review for caught behind, but did not bowl out, as Brook opted to send down a record 16 overs of spin.\n\nThings will get tougher but despite being outhit by opponents, England's engine room has fired.\n\nIn addition to Jacks, who has figures in the Sri Lankan leg of 10-0-72-5, Sam Curran followed closing out the last-ball thriller versus Nepal with handy runs, and combined in a 42-run stand with Tom Banton that kept the prospect of another dramatic England win alive."

Their conflict came to a head at the 2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and resulted in a crash for the ages — not so much because of its intensity or damage, but more so because it ultimately led to Ricciardo’s departure from Red Bull Racing and straight into the arms of their biggest rival — Renault.\n\nEpisode three — Redemption — was a deep dive into the Verstappen-Ricciardo rivalry, exploring the build-up of tension and the ultimate fallout from the collision.\n\nThe drivers had pretty much been inseparable from the start of the Baku race, surviving early wheel-to-wheel contact by a hair’s breadth.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nVerstappen’s refusal to yield even as the seemingly faster Ricciardo fought tooth and nail was a fight for the ages, and things finally boiled over on lap 40, when Ricciardo slammed into the rear of his team mate’s mean machine in an attempt to slipstream past him on the Turn 1 run.\n\nSpeaking about the dramatic collision between his team members, Red Bull’s then Team Principal Christian Horner said at the time: “We allow them to race, we allow them to go wheel to wheel. We even discussed it in pre-race meetings about giving each other space.\n\n\"Unfortunately this was the culmination of two guys taking things into their own hands which shouldn’t have happened. We talked about it before the race, both drivers nodded in agreement that they would give each other space. It was a low point and I made my feelings very clear to both drivers.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nExcellent primetime television, that.\n\nRomain Grosjean’s terrifying fireball crash in Season 3 (and all his other crashes)\n\nView 6 Images Romain Grosjean's fireball crash was one of the most terrifying moments in F1 history (Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix will forever live on in the minds of motorsport lovers and Formula 1 drivers — especially those racing on the grid at the time.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe race saw Romain Grosjean’s Haas engulfed in horrific, eat-you-alive flames and it was considered to be a certified miracle that Grosjean survived the horrific crash.\n\nThe ex-Haas driver crashed through the barriers in the opening lap itself as his vehicle spontaneously combusted into monster flames.\n\nOnlookers were peering at the fiery wreck with instant grief, however miraculously, Grosjean emerged from the flames, having escaped death by the narrowest of margins.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe suffered extensive burns on both of his hands, and it turned out that his 179th Grand Prix was to be his last, the crash invariably spelling the end of his Formula 1 career.\n\nSeason three’s 9th episode, Man on Fire, took us behind the scenes and showed the impact the terrifying incident had on the rest of the paddock, with Lewis Hamilton saying: “This one was hard to watch. I felt very vulnerable at that moment.”\n\nHaas Team Principal Guenther Steiner said: “Once you see fire, that is the worst thing you can have. This is bad,” while Sergio Perez reflected: “Only when you see those things do you believe the danger we go into.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMax Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton’s Silverstone collision — and that\n\nView 6 Images Max Verstappen's car is loaded onto a truck after his crash with Lewis Hamilton in Silverstone in 2021 (Image: Sutton Images)\n\nWorld Champ Max Verstappen and his rivalries know no end, with another one for the books playing out in Drive to Survive’s fourth season, this time between seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton and the Flying Dutchman.\n\nThe enthralling battle between the titular protagonists of season four came to a head in Silverstone, where the two collided on lap 1 itself with Verstappen suffering a 51G hit as he flew into the barriers at 180mph.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHamilton had made contact with Verstappen’s mean machine at the infamous Copse corner at the British Grand Prix and the collision led to the Dutchman being taken to the hospital for checks.\n\nVerstappen later admitted that he had raced with blurred vision in a few races after the collision with a quote in the Red Bulletin: “Since my Silverstone crash, I've struggled with visibility problems, especially on undulating circuits or those with lots of advertising boards on the side of the track. In this race, I wasn't just fighting against Lewis, but also against blurred images.”\n\nSpeaking about the collision, Hamilton had said at the time: “If you don’t go for a gap, you may as well stop racing.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe dramatic season finally culminated in Verstappen clinching his first‑ever Formula 1 World Championship after winning the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix — a finale that saw him defeat Hamilton for the coveted title on the final lap after a (highly contentious) Safety Car restart.\n\nLewis Hamilton’s bombshell announcement in season 7\n\nView 6 Images Lewis Hamilton created shockwaves worldwide with his Ferrari announcement (Image: PA)\n\nHaving raced with Mercedes since 2013 and winning six out of his seven World Championship titles with them — Lewis Hamilton actually leaving the Silver Arrows was on no one’s bingo cards, ever.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSo we don’t exaggerate when we say that Drive to Survive Season 7’s most dramatic moment was most definitely Hamilton’s bombshell pre-season announcement that he was leaving Toto Wolff’s team’s friendly ranks for the legacy red of the Scuderia for the 2025 season.\n\nTackled in the first episode itself, Netflix was able to capture some thrilling behind-the-scenes moments from the fallout of the announcement, even finding themselves in the room when Toto and Hamilton reunite onscreen after the announcement at the Mercedes car launch.\n\nRaw and unfiltered comments from Toto regarding the switch and Mercedes’ future plans feature in Episode 1 and 3, with the Mercedes Team Principal questioning the timing of Hamilton’s move and even discussing the potential poaching of Verstappen with his wife and current managing director of the F1 Academy, Susie Wolff.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nToto can be heard saying: “I haven’t talked to him [Verstappen], because I promised Lewis not to talk to him, but I will have the conversation now.”\n\nUltimately the coveted Mercedes seat goes to Kimi Antonelli, the teenager and his family’s joy caught square on Netflix’s lens when he is informed. Hamilton’s Ferrari move also meant fan-favourite Carlos Sainz lost his seat with the Scuderia, prompting his eventual move to Williams (another gripping season seven storyline — and one of our favourite subplots).\n\nCharles Leclerc’s home race ‘curse’ and emotional Monza win in Season 7\n\nView 6 Images Charles Leclerc's Monza win in Season 7 was one of the most emotional moments of the show (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSeason 7’s Episode 5 titled ‘Le Curse of Leclerc’ takes us behind the scenes with Formula 1’s mega talented softboy Charles Leclerc.\n\nOne of the most emotionally rousing episodes in Drive to Survive’s loaded history, it gives us a closer glimpse into the life of Leclerc — something fans of the seemingly introverted motorsport champ can’t help but cherish.\n\nTaking a closer look at his unfortunate run in all his home races at Monaco during his almost 9-year long career, Drive to Survive gives us one of the most emotionally charged moments of the show when Leclerc finally clinches the trophy that has been eluding him for so long.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nTender moments with friends and family are shown throughout the episode, including a lovely moment with Leclerc getting an at-home haircut from his mom and speaking about his late father and his F1 aspirations for him.\n\nIn a quintessential ‘I’m not crying, you’re crying’ moment as a viewer — Leclerc finally gets his hands on the Monza trophy after an electric drive in his home race, telling the cameras: “I definitely did not only realise my dream, but my father’s dream. He’s probably celebrating it from above.”\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Now 30 years since the Dallas Cowboys' last Super Bowl appearance, owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he has let the fans down with his team's championship drought.\n\n\"I really can't accept just the thought of winning one Super Bowl and then what?\" Jones said Friday night from the NFL scouting combine. \"I've got more time on my clock than that in my mind. And so I don't see it that way. I see a chance to put a team together and basically be knocking at the edge and get another one or get a chance at a another one.\n\n\"It runs that way in my view. ... Make no mistake about it now, if you told me I could, because I've done a lot of hitchhiking in my life. ... I'd start here with you right now and hitchhike back to Dallas to win a Super Bowl.\"\n\nAfter a 7-9-1 finish in 2025, Jones promised change. One change will be the team's approach to free agency.\n\nThe Cowboys have not relied heavily on free agency in years, choosing to pick their spots to shore up holes on the roster with cost-effective players.\n\n\"I would bet that we will spend more money in free agency than we have,\" Jones said.\n\nTo do so, the Cowboys will first have to create salary cap room. Well over the $301.2 million cap that was set Friday, they will restructure the contracts of quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and left guard Tyler Smith, which will create $66 million of room.\n\nJones said the Cowboys will rework the contracts of defensive tackles Kenny Clark, Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa, who are scheduled to count around $63 million against the cap. With Clark and Williams, the Cowboys can look to add voidable years to their contracts then restructure that way.\n\n\"I want you to know that the only way to push more [out] is for me to go borrow some of my future, OK?\" Jones said. \"Expect me to go borrow some of my future.\"\n\nTo Jones, it goes beyond his personal Super Bowl wishes.\n\n\"I look at where we are with Dak and I look at where he is in his career. And I look at some of the pluses that we have on our front and what we think we can do there. And what we can do with [George] Pickens and Lamb and what we can do with our running back that we just signed [Javonte Williams],\" Jones said. \"And so all of those things I want to do everything we possibly can to stop somebody and to basically win some third downs more than we did last year. And so I think that would be the area that you would see me bust the budget. Where you would see me do that is what we're doing defensively.\n\n\"And I would expect anybody that's a Cowboy fan or a critic of the Cowboys to say, 'Duh, that's not hard to see, Jerry, to do.' But I guess what I'm doing is saying, yes, I intend to do that if given the opportunity.\"\n\nThe Cowboys defense finished at or near the bottom of the league in yards and points allowed in 2025. Christian Parker has been hired as the new defensive coordinator, and Jones acknowledged the need for more than just one or two new players, while also saying players that were on the defense in 2025 will be better in 2026 \"because the situation has changed.\"\n\nWith two first-round picks, the Cowboys have an opportunity to add more talent to their defense. Jones would not rule out the possibility of making trades, like the additions of Williams from the New York Jets and Clark from the Green Bay Packers for Micah Parsons.\n\n\"I don't know that I'd expect it but we have the ammunition to be good at it,\" Jones said. \"And I wouldn't hesitate to be good at it if it will help our team and help the timeline that we're talking about.\"\n\nNow 83, Jones was introspective at times during the hourlong meeting with reporters. His resolve to win a championship is strong.\n\n\"It's every bit the prize of anything I have, with the exception of family and your love for family,\" Jones said. \"I guess what I would say is make no mistake about it, I don't have a higher priority than to go and win a Super Bowl.\""

Including the playoffs, it was the club's third-highest percentage in a game in the shot clock era (since 1954-55), behind 67.9% in 1984 and 67.0% in 1990, according to ESPN Research.\n\nThe Celtics also shot 64.7% from the 3-point line Friday, which equated to an 80.8% effective field goal percentage -- the highest in the shot clock era. Effective field goal percentage measures shooting efficiency by adjusting for the fact that 3-pointers are worth more than two-point shots\n\nAll-Star Jaylen Brown led the way, finishing with 28 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. But he got plenty of support from his teammates, with trade deadline acquisition Nikola Vucevic adding 28 points and 11 rebounds for his third double-double as a member of the Celtics.\n\n\"I thought we just did a good job reading the game,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"I thought we made the right reads throughout most of the entire game. I thought tonight Vooch really looked comfortable in his offensive reads and his offensive screening. He unlocked a lot of stuff for us.\"\n\nAll 13 Celtics players scored, with Boston committing only three turnovers after halftime.\n\n\"We just try to read the game and take what's there,\" Brown said.\n\nBoston, winners of five of its six games since the All-Star break, will wait to see if Sunday night's home matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers will mark the return of Tatum.\n\nThe game, originally scheduled to be played earlier in the day, was moved by NBC into an 8 p.m. ET prime-time slot, creating speculation it could signal Tatum's plan to return.\n\nIt's been 41 weeks since Tatum ruptured his right Achilles tendon in May in the waning minutes of the Celtics' loss to the New York Knicks in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe Celtics are required by the NBA to release an initial injury report by 5 p.m. ET on Saturday ahead of Sunday's home game against the 76ers.\n\nAfter practicing with the Celtics' G League team two weeks ago, Tatum said he hadn't decided whether he would return.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that I'm coming back or I'm not, it's just following the plan. So it's just another step,\" Tatum said. \"I don't know percentage. I just know I feel a little bit better every day. I just try to focus on that.\"\n\nTatum said in the same interview that he is also mindful of not wanting to disrupt the progress of a Celtics team that at 39-20 sits in second place in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\n\"I'm just hyper aware of what's going on. I think it would just stem from that. Obviously, I know what I bring to the table and bring to the team. But I'm also aware that these guys have been playing extremely well,\" Tatum said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

Miami extended the best start in program history and added to its school record for wins in a season.

Justice Williams and EJ Ryans each added 14 points.\n\nMiami is used to playing close games and won for the seventh time this season by fewer than six points.\n\n\"Our grouip is unflappabe,\" Miami coach Travis Steele said. \"It's calm, cool and collected. It's very, very even the entire time, even during tight moments.\"\n\nThe RedHawks trailed 30-26 at the half and fell behind by eight points twice early in the second half before tying the score at 49-49 with 11:02 remaining.\n\nWestern Michigan ran off eight straight points for a 57-49 advantage with 8:40 remaining and led 59-50 with 6:38 left before Miami chipped away and moved ahead 66-65 on a layup by Antwone Woolfolk with 14 seconds left.\n\nElmer's free throw with 37 seconds remaining gave the RedHawks a 67-65 edge, but Western Michigan tied it with 11 seconds left on a basket by Williams before Perry made the winner.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe Women's National Basketball Players Association submitted a new counterproposal to the WNBA on Friday evening with some concessions on revenue share and housing, a source familiar with the collective bargaining negotiations told ESPN.\n\nIn the new CBA proposal, the players' union is asking for players to receive 26% of gross revenue (defined as revenue before deducting expenses) over the lifetime of the agreement, with the salary cap in Year 1 of the deal (about $9.5 million) unchanged from its previous offer.\n\nThe revenue share split is down from 27.5% of gross revenue as proposed in the WNBPA's Feb. 17 proposal, a change that a source said amounts to nearly $100 million in reductions on revenue share.\n\nThe new proposal also contains tweaks to the union's housing offerings: Previously, the players asked that teams continue to provide housing to players in the first several years of the new deal, but that in later years, teams will no longer be obligated to provide it for players making at least 80% of the maximum salary, on multiyear deals and receiving full salary protection.\n\nIn the new proposal, the union struck the multiyear component and lowered the salary threshold to 75% at which players would no longer be obligated to receive team-provided housing.\n\nThe two sides are still negotiating the years of service limit for developmental players -- a new feature of this CBA with each team now expected to have two developmental player spots. The union is now proposing a years of service limit of six after originally asking for no experience limit for those players, a source said, whereas the league's latest proposal suggested a limit of four or five years of service based on minutes played.\n\nThe WNBPA's counterproposal comes one week after the league submitted one of its own. That Feb. 20 league proposal guaranteed housing for all players in 2026 before being phased out in subsequent years of the deal. Players on their applicable minimum salary and those with zero years of service would be provided a one-bedroom apartment in 2027 and 2028 only, and developmental players would be provided studio apartments for the entirety of the deal.\n\nBut the two sides are still far apart on the issue of revenue sharing, including proposing different revenue sharing systems: The WNBA has held firm in its proposals, with players being offered on average over 70% of net revenue (revenue after deducting expenses), which would amount to less than 15% of gross revenue. The 2026 salary cap would come in at $5.65 million (up from $1.5 million in 2025) and in subsequent years would grow in line with revenue growth.\n\nThe league's proposal features maximum salaries, including revenue sharing payouts, amounting to nearly $1.3 million in 2026 and projecting to approach $2 million in 2031. The supermax in 2025 came in at $249,000. The average player salary, including revenue sharing, would be projected to reach $540,000 in 2026 and $780,000 by 2031, up from $120,000 in 2025.\n\nThe WNBA publicly struck down the WNBPA's previous proposal as \"unrealistic\" and \"caus[ing] hundreds of millions of dollars of losses for our teams.\" A source familiar with the negotiations told ESPN the league projected that Feb. 17 plan would result in losses of $460 million over the lifetime of the agreement, though the union has maintained its revenue sharing model would still put the league in a \"profitable position,\" another source said.\n\nEarlier this week, the league gave its teams and the WNBPA a target date of March 10 to complete a term sheet, or else the schedule for the 2026 season might be impacted."

(0:34)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nITHACA, N.Y. -- Jake Fiegen hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with one second left as Cornell upset first-place Yale 72-69 on Friday night to keep pace in the Ivy League postseason chase.\n\nCornell entered the day having lost five straight games against Yale, its last win coming Feb. 23, 2024. That included a 34-point loss to the Bulldogs earlier this season.\n\nWith the win, Cornell (13-12) improved to 6-6 in Ivy League play and moved into sole possession of fourth place in the regular-season standings with two games remaining. The top four teams advance to the Ivy Madness tournament, with the winner securing the league's automatic NCAA bid.\n\nFiegen scored 17 points to lead five double-figure scorers for the Big Red and also contributed eight rebounds and four assists. He shot 7-of-12 from the field and 3-of-6 from beyond the arc\n\nCooper Noard added 16 points on 6-for-16 shooting to go along with six rebounds. Josh Baldwin was 4-of-5 from the field (3-for-4 from 3) en route to finishing with 13 points.\n\nAs a team, Cornell shot 14-of-35 from 3-point range, with nine of those coming in the first half. The Big Red led by as many as 14 before the Bulldogs battled back to tie the score at 69 on a Nick Townsend layup with seven seconds remaining.\n\n\"We started out lousy in three of our last four games and put ourselves in a hole that we had to dig out of,\" Yale coach James Jones said. \"It's great that the guys were able to fight back and get back into it, but we've got to do a better job of starting each half.\"\n\nCornell won the rebounding battle 31-28 and outscored Yale 12-3 on second-chance points.\n\nCasey Simmons, Isaac Celiscar and Townsend led the way for the Bulldogs (21-5, 9-3) with 14 points apiece. The loss snapped Yale's five-game winning streak.\n\nESPN Research and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "content": "AUBURN, Calif. -- Former MLB pitcher Daniel Serafini was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 2021 shooting of his wife's parents during a burglary at their home by Lake Tahoe, authorities said.\n\nSerafini, 51, was convicted in July 2025 of first-degree murder of his father-in-law, Gary Spohr; attempted murder of his mother-in-law, Wendy Wood; and first-degree burglary. Spohr was killed, and Wood survived, though she died a year after the shooting.\n\nPlacer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said in a statement Friday that Spohr and Wood were loving grandparents and that Serafini's crimes greatly impacted family members and friends.\n\n\"The impact of this attack has extended far beyond the immediate victims, deeply affecting family members and the broader community, and highlighting the lasting harm caused by deliberate violence,\" Gire said.\n\nSerafini's attorney did not return requests for comment.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Serafini addressed the court and maintained his innocence, according to MyNews4. He said he was out partying with his wife the night of the shooting and described himself as a \"broken, imperfect man that makes mistakes.\"\n\nSerafini was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 1992. In a career spanning 11 years, the left-hander played for the Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies.\n\nProsecutors said Serafini hated his wife's wealthy parents and was heard saying he was willing to pay $20,000 to have them killed, according to the Sacramento Bee. Prosecutors showed jurors transcripts of angry emails and text messages between Serafini and his in-laws.\n\nDuring the six-week trial, Serafini's attorney, David Dratman, argued that there was no physical evidence linking his client to the crime scene. Dratman told the jury that although Serafini had a rocky relationship with his in-laws, he did not have a motive to kill them.\n\nAfter his conviction, Serafini filed multiple motions for a new trial, but those were denied.\n\nSerafini will serve his sentence at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the Placer County District Attorney's Office."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

Pot 4: Romania, Northern Ireland, Sweden, North Macedonia.\n\nHow did teams qualify for the World Cup play-offs?\n\nFor the first time, 16 European teams will play at the World Cup owing to the 50 per cent increase in the size of the 2026 tournament. Of those, 12 places are reserved for UEFA qualifying group winners, with the other four coming via the play-offs.\n\nThe 12 group runners-up will be joined by four teams who finished outside the top two of their respective qualifying groups, who were the 'best performers' in the 2024/25 Nations League.\n\nImage: Troy Parrott's stunning hat-trick against Hungary saw the Republic of Ireland secure a shock play-off spot\n\nHere are the final standings from each of the 12 groups:\n\nGroup A: Germany qualified, Slovakia and Northern Ireland into play-offs\n\nGermany qualified, and into play-offs Group B: Switzerland qualified, Kosovo and Sweden into play-offs\n\nSwitzerland qualified, and into play-offs Group C: Scotland qualified, Denmark into play-offs\n\nScotland qualified, into play-offs Group D: France qualified, Ukraine into play-offs\n\nFrance qualified, into play-offs Group E: Spain qualified, Turkey into play-offs\n\nSpain qualified, into play-offs Group F: Portugal qualified, Republic of Ireland into play-offs\n\nPortugal qualified, into play-offs Group G: Netherlands qualified, Poland into play-offs\n\nNetherlands qualified, into play-offs Group H: Austria qualified, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Romania into play-offs\n\nAustria qualified, and into play-offs Group I: Norway qualified, Italy into play-offs\n\nNorway qualified, into play-offs Group J: Belgium qualified, Wales and North Macedonia into play-offs\n\nBelgium qualified, and into play-offs Group K: England qualified, Albania into play-offs\n\nEngland qualified, into play-offs Group L: Croatia qualified, Czech Republic into play-offs\n\nCould every home nation be at the World Cup?\n\nNo! Wales and Northern Ireland have been drawn in the same play-off path which means at least one of them will not qualify.\n\nImage: Northern Ireland's defeat to Slovakia ended their automatic hopes - but they will compete in the play-offs in March\n\nHow does UEFA decide Nations League performance?\n\nUEFA ranks Nations League teams first by the number of points won by group winners, from the top tier down to the fourth. More often than not, this means the four additional play-off spots are filled by four of the 14 Nations League group winners.\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:"

            "content": "Dr Kwabena Bempah Tandoh, a former Deputy Director-General of the Ghana Education Service (GES), has finally put to rest the long-standing public scepticism regarding the educational background of the NPP’s Ashanti Regional Chairman, Bernard Antwi Boasiako, popularly known as Chairman Wontumi.\n\nFor years, social media and political circles have buzzed with debate over whether Chairman Wuntomi truly walked the hallowed halls of the Kumasi-based school as he claims.\n\nBut Dr Tandoh, speaking with the authority of a fellow 'Amanfour' (as Prempeh College alumni are known), ended the conjecture by revealing that their bond dates back to their very first year.\n\nSpeaking on JoyNews’ Personality Profile on Friday, February 27, Dr Tandoh provided a definitive eyewitness account of Wontumi’s time at the prestigious Prempeh College, revealing that the two were not only in the same year group but also shared the same sleeping quarters.\n\nDorm 7: The shared history\n\n“I know in this country people are always wondering whether Wontumi went to Prempeh College. Wontumi was my mate. We went into Form One together. Not only was he my classmate, but he was actually my dorm mate,” Dr Tandoh revealed.\n\nThe duo belonged to Aggrey House, where they specifically shared Dorm 7, a period Dr Tandoh credits for developing \"great friendships\" that have sustained them into their professional adult lives.\n\nDr Tandoh has not only cleared the air on a piece of political trivia but has also underscored the enduring influence of Ghana's traditional secondary school brotherhoods in national life.\n\nThe ‘Amanfoo’ spirit: A house built on loyalty\n\nBeyond settling the Wontumi debate, Dr Tandoh used the platform to highlight the unique and intense loyalty shared by alumni of the school. He described an environment where seniority is respected regardless of age and where support for one another is unconditional.\n\nRecounting a remarkable personal experience, Dr Tandoh shared how a senior colleague he had never met before facilitated his relocation to Ghana from the diaspora.\n\n“When I was relocating to Ghana, my first home that I moved into, the entire one-year rent was paid for by a senior I didn’t know... He left Prempeh College some 15 years before I went there,” he shared.\n\nThe senior, identified as Senior Poku-Agyemang, not only secured a home for Dr Tandoh’s wife and children but also provided him with a car and fully paid insurance for a year.\n\nLessons beyond the classroom\n\nFor Dr Tandoh, the Prempeh College experience was defined by a philosophy of collective growth rather than individual success. He noted that the institution taught him to be \"focused on growing people around me and supporting things around me.\"\n\nThe bond between the Amanfuo, he suggests, is a powerful social network that transcends political and professional boundaries.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Violent scenes erupted at the Kasoa Old Market in the Awutu Senya East Municipality on Friday, February 27, as an aggrieved mob turned their frustrations on emergency responders during a devastating fire outbreak.\n\nWhile two container shops were being razed to the ground, a team from the Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS) was met with a hail of stones, resulting in significant damage to a fire tender and the disruption of life-saving operations.\n\nThe incident has once again brought the dire state of firefighting equipment in the municipality into sharp focus, with local stations reportedly unable to respond due to broken-down machinery.\n\nWhile no casualties were reported, the total loss of goods in the two shops has left traders in despair.\n\nThe fire, the cause of which remains under investigation, started in the heart of the market, quickly engulfing two metal container shops. As the flames intensified, residents were horrified to learn that neither the Kasoa nor the Budumburam fire stations could deploy their tenders.\n\nDO Addo Danso, the Weija Fire Station Administrator, confirmed the systemic failure that led to the delayed arrival of help. He explained that a crew had to be dispatched all the way from Weija to fill the vacuum left by the non-operational local units.\n\n“All the fire tenders stationed at both Kasoa and Budumburam were not operational at the time of the incident,” DO Addo Danso revealed, explaining the logistical nightmare that triggered the community's anger. Violence against the 'First Responders'\n\nUpon their arrival, the Weija crew were not greeted as saviours but as targets. Local youth, incensed by what they perceived as a lethargic response, allegedly attacked the firefighters. Stones were pelted at the moving vehicle, successfully shattering the windscreen and forcing the officers to navigate both the inferno and a hostile crowd.\n\nDespite the assault, the team managed to deploy their hoses and eventually brought the blaze under control, preventing a wider catastrophe in the densely packed market.\n\nCondemnation and police hunt\n\nThe Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) for Awutu Senya East, Seth Serwono Banini, visited the scene to assess the damage and expressed absolute disgust at the treatment of the officers. He has formally tasked the police to track down the individuals behind the assault.\n\n“I urge residents, especially the youth, to desist from the act of attacking security personnel on duty,” the MCE stated, reinforcing that such actions only endanger the lives of the entire community during emergencies.\n\nDO Addo Danso further confirmed that the GNFS is not taking the matter lightly and will seek criminal prosecution for the damage caused to state property.\n\n“We are going to make an official complaint to the police so that they can arrest some of the culprits,” he added.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

This growth was propelled by a near-tripling of digital revenue and robust gains in the mobile money and data sectors, reflecting Ghana’s rapidly maturing digital economy.\n\nIn a move that will delight investors, the Board of Directors has recommended a final dividend of GH¢0.40 per share. This represents a significant increase from the GH¢0.24 paid out the previous year, signaling deep confidence in the company’s liquidity and future growth path.\n\nPending shareholder approval at the next Annual General Meeting, the dividend is slated for distribution on 10 April 2026.\n\nIn his review of the year, MTN Ghana CEO Stephen Blewett attributed the financial windfall to a combination of heavy infrastructure spending and a friendly economic backdrop.\n\n\"MTN Ghana reported a strong operational and financial performance for 2025, driven by the significant investment in our network and targeted commercial initiatives that have enhanced the customer experience,\" Blewett remarked.\n\nHe further observed that the broader economic recovery played a crucial role: \"These results were achieved in a favourable macroeconomic climate, with subsiding inflation and a strengthened local currency boosting consumer purchasing power.\n\nTo sustain this growth, MTN Ghana committed GH¢6.4 billion in capital expenditure during the year. This investment was primarily directed at bolstering 4G coverage and improving overall service quality to support a burgeoning subscriber base. Total mobile subscribers now stand at 31.2 million, with active data users jumping to 19.9 million.\n\nAs the company transitions out of its \"Ambition 2025\" strategic cycle, the leadership team remains bullish on the medium-term horizon. The company has maintained its guidance for service revenue growth in the \"mid-to-upper thirties\" per cent range.\n\n\"Looking ahead to 2026, MTN Ghana is well-positioned to capitalise on Ghana's improving macroeconomic environment. Building on 2025's performance and operational agility, we will continue to deliver value to our stakeholders,\" Blewett concluded.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

That’s why we were thrilled to join hands with the Greater Accra School Feeding Coordinator and the amazing cooks who fuel the future of our nation.”\n\nMr Ocran explained that the engagement forms part of a broader strategy to channel and supply schools with organic, healthy and locally produced chicken.\n\n“By working directly with the school feeding programme, we are not only ensuring our children get the best nutrition but also empowering our local farmers and reducing our reliance on imported poultry.”\n\nHe further encouraged stakeholders to support the initiative, stressing that the programme seeks to build a sustainable future, one healthy meal at a time.\n\n'Nkoko Nkitinkiti'\n\n'Nkoko Nkitinkiti' is a flagship agricultural initiative launched by the Government of Ghana in November 2025.\n\nUnder the broader Feed Ghana Programme, it aims to revitalise the domestic poultry industry, improve food security, and reduce the country’s high annual expenditure (over $300 million) on imported chicken.\n\nKey Objectives and Components:\n\nImport Reduction: Aims to cut down Ghana's massive chicken import bill and save foreign exchange.\n\nJob Creation: Targets economic empowerment for approximately 55,000 households and thousands of young people nationwide.\n\nHealth and Safety: Promotes \"fresh Ghanaian-grown chicken\" over imported options that may use growth hormones or GMOs.\n\nTwo-Pronged Approach: Anchor Farmer Programme: 50 commercial farmers aim to produce 4 million birds annually. Household Initiative: Distributed to everyday spaces like homes and schools, where individual households raise smaller batches of birds (e.g., 50–500 per year).\n\n\n\nImplementation Details\n\nBeneficiary Support: Participants receive essential inputs, including day-old chicks, high-quality feed, and veterinary services.\n\nInfrastructure: The government is establishing Farmer Service Centres in agricultural districts and plans to build modern processing plants, such as one in Bechem, Bono Region.\n\nCurrent Progress: As of February 2026, the programme has begun distributing birds in regions like Ashanti, with targets to scale production to over 7 million chicks.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "A legal showdown has commenced at the Supreme Court as a farmer from Techiman, Mariam Alhassan, has filed a landmark suit to strike down the government’s stringent regulatory framework for industrial cannabis cultivation.\n\nThe plaintiff is seeking to invoke the original jurisdiction of the apex court to declare the current licensing fees and entry requirements unconstitutional, arguing they are designed to exclude ordinary Ghanaians from the emerging multi-billion-dollar industry.\n\nThe suit, filed at the Supreme Court on Friday, February 27, names the Ministry for the Interior, the Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC), the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, and the Attorney-General as defendants.\n\n“The Defendants acted unfairly and in breach of legitimate expectation by imposing materially higher... fees without reasonable accommodation of the consultative process,” the filing states, noting that the government failed to provide a tiered system that would allow smaller enterprises to enter the market.\n\nAt the heart of the legal challenge is the claim that the government has imposed \"materially higher, unscaled, and cumulative fees\" that make it impossible for smallholder farmers to participate in the legal hemp trade.\n\nMadam Alhassan argues that these fees violate Article 23 of the 1992 Constitution, which guarantees administrative justice and fair treatment.\n\nThe plaintiff contends that despite extensive stakeholder consultations where \"proportionate, tiered, and risk-based regulation\" was advocated, the authorities ignored these recommendations in favour of an extortionate fee structure.\n\nReliefs sought\n\nIn the Supreme Court filing, Mariam Alhassan (the Plaintiff) seeks the following reliefs against the Defendants:\n\nA declaration that the industrial hemp licensing framework established under section 43 of the Narcotics Control Commission Act, 2020 (Act 1019), as amended, and L.I. 2475, is inconsistent with Articles 17, 23, 36, and 296 of the 1992 Constitution. This is due to its \"irrational design, exclusionary economic effect, and disproportionate exercise of administrative discretion\".\n\nA declaration that the high licence fees (up to USD 45,000 per hectare), annual regulatory levies, and percentage-based charges constitute the imposition of de facto taxes. The Plaintiff argues this violates Article 174, which grants taxing power exclusively to Parliament.\n\nA declaration that the requirement for narcotics-style transport permits and armed security escorts for industrial hemp (containing no more than 0.3% THC) is irrational and arbitrary.\n\nAn order for the Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC) and other relevant ministries to reconsider and redesign the framework to be constitutionally compliant. This redesign must include: Tiered, scaled, and risk-based licence fees. Elimination of narcotics-style transport and escort controls unless objectively justified. Removal of unscaled, cumulative, and USD-denominated fee structures that exclude ordinary Ghanaian citizens.\n\nAn interim order to restrain the enforcement of the challenged fees, levies, and transport/escort requirements until the framework is made compliant.\n\nAny further orders or directions the Court deems fit to safeguard inclusive economic participation and the rule of law.\n\nDetails of the suit\n\nMariam Alhassan, based in the Bono East Region, represents a growing movement of local farmers who view industrial hemp as a transformative cash crop for the middle belt of Ghana. The suit highlights that industrial hemp (cannabis with low THC levels) is a vital raw material for textiles, construction, and medicine, yet the current \"unscaled fees\" effectively bar local agriculturalists from the supply chain.\n\nThe filing raises several critical questions regarding economic governance and the directive principles of state policy:\n\n\"If imported hemp goods circulate normally, can domestic production of the same non-narcotic material rationally be treated as a high-risk narcotics activity?\"\n\nThe plaintiff argues that the difference creates:\n\n• economic exclusion (Article 17)\n\n• irrational administrative action (Articles 23 & 296)\n\n• potential frustration of economic participation goals (Article 36)\n\n• and possibly de facto taxation through licensing (Article 174).\n\nConsumers face almost no unusual hurdles, but Ghanaian producers face many.\n\nThat mismatch between the free entry of finished hemp goods and the heavy restriction of local hemp cultivation is the constitutional tension at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe plaintiff is of the view that if a hemp product is imported into Ghana, such as a hemp body scrub, lotion, oil, or cosmetic containing ≤0.3% THC, such goods typically enter the country through ordinary commercial channels because they are treated as finished consumer goods, not narcotic substances.\n\nHowever, if a Ghanaian farmer produces industrial hemp of the same grade (≤0.3% THC — the same non-psychoactive material), the activity shifts from product regulation to narcotics-administration regulation under the current framework.\n\nThe hurdles identified by the plaintiff include:\n\nHigh entry licensing\n\nA Ghanaian producer must obtain:\n\n• cultivation licence\n\n• application approvals\n\n• background/security vetting\n\n• compliance clearances\n\nWith fees reaching tens of thousands of USD per hectare in some categories.\n\nUSD-denominated fees create a structural barrier for local farmers operating in cedis.\n\n• Payments tied to U.S. dollars\n\n• Exposure to exchange-rate fluctuations\n\n• Costs unrelated to farming risk or yield\n\nAnnual regulatory levies\n\nEven after paying licence fees:\n\n• recurring annual charges (e.g., percentage of licence value)\n\n• payable regardless of production success or market conditions.\n\nLayered licensing across the value chain\n\nSeparate permissions may be required, with each attracting additional fees for:\n\n• cultivation\n\n• processing\n\n• storage\n\n• transport\n\n• export\n\n• research or testing\n\nTransport permits\n\nMoving harvested hemp within Ghana may require:\n\n• official transport authorization\n\n• pre-approved logistics arrangements.\n\nSecurity / escort requirements\n\nTransport may involve:\n\n• supervised or escorted movement\n\n• additional security costs\n\nControls typically associated with controlled narcotics.\n\nSecurity bonds and compliance costs\n\nFinancial guarantees may be required before operations begin.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "General News of Saturday, 28 February 2026\n\nSource: www.ghanaweb.com\n\nRev Dr Ebenezer Markwei, Head Pastor of Living Streams International Church, has outlined five essential criteria Christians should use to assess prophetic ministries and protect themselves from false prophecies and misleading spiritual guidance.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on Channel One TV’s “Point of View” on February 25, 2026, Reverend Markwei introduced what he called the “Five Ms,” five pillars that believers must carefully consider when evaluating a prophetic ministry.\n\n\n\n1. Money: The pastor advised Christians to pay close attention to how finances are handled in a prophet’s ministry.\n\n\n\nHe warned against ministries where every prophetic act or declaration is tied to monetary contributions.\n\n\n\n“When spiritual direction consistently revolves around payments, offerings, or financial exchanges, it raises serious concerns about integrity and intent,” he noted.\n\n\n\n2. Motive: Rev Markwei stressed the importance of understanding the purpose behind prophetic messages.\n\n\n\nHe explained that prophecy should never be used to manipulate people, seek personal recognition, or exploit the vulnerable.\n\n\n\nHow can God reveal different outcomes to different prophets? - Christian Council asks\n\n\n\n“The underlying motive must be to edify and guide, not to control or impress,” he emphasised.\n\n\n\n3. Message: He pointed out that the content of any genuine prophecy must align with Scripture and sound biblical teaching.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the message should point believers toward Christ rather than glorify the prophet. He added that authentic spiritual depth fosters humility, not arrogance.\n\n\n\n4. Morals: Rev Markwei noted that character is just as important as gifting. A prophet’s personal life must reflect godly values, and any disconnect between public ministry and private conduct undermines credibility.\n\n\n\n“The Bible says dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking smell. That means dead flies in the character of the person make the anointing stink in the nostrils of people because people cannot marry the charisma with the character,” he explained.\n\n\n\n5. Methods: Finally, the man of God warned against practices that go beyond Scripture or put people at risk.\n\n\n\nAny method used in ministry should be biblically grounded, and practices that endanger believers physically, emotionally, or spiritually are red flags that must not be tolerated.\n\n\n\nRev Markwei also urged Christians to develop a personal and direct relationship with Christ, emphasising that faith should not be dependent on any single spiritual leader.\n\n\n\nWatch NPP MPs in all-black as President Mahama delivers 2026 SONA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAK/BAI"

            "content": "Business News of Saturday, 28 February 2026\n\nSource: angelonline.com.gh\n\nHistorically, Ghana’s carbohydrate base had centered on indigenous staples like fufu, banku, gari, plantain, and rice.\n\n\n\nImported pasta especially spaghetti was once a symbol of celebration, served mostly on special occasions.\n\n\n\nBut a transformation has quietly taken place.\n\n\n\nIn the early hours of a busy Accra to the quiet late nights, you are likely to see the unwrapping of a steaming plate of spaghetti for breakfast, lunch or supper.\n\n\n\nThat wasn’t always the image at Ghana’s dining tables.\n\n\n\nYet today, from the bustling streets of Kumasi to the quieter corridors of Tamale kitchens are simmering pots of spaghetti, signaling an undeniable truth: Ghana is eating more spaghetti than ever.\n\n\n\nAccording to trade and customs data from the Ghana Revenue Authority and Ghana Statistical Service, imports of pasta products have increased tremendously by over 50% in the last five years, with spaghetti making up the lion’s share.\n\n\n\nRetail surveys estimate that urban households now consume spaghetti more frequently than brown rice or even gari.\n\n\n\nWhile rice still dominates overall carbohydrate preferences, spaghetti has surged ahead not only as a delicious and affordable meal but as the fastest-growing staple in urban diet.\n\n\n\nThis is largely fueled by busy urban lifestyles, coupled with quick spaghetti cook time.\n\n\n\nTelevision cooking shows, social media food reels, and youth influencers are aggressively promoting the consumption of spaghetti.\n\n\n\nIn Accra’s trendier neighbourhoods, a plate of spaghetti is more than food. It’s a “modern” badge of new lifestyle patterns, a gender-neutral favourite snack, and a weekend comfort meal.\n\n\n\nBut what are we really consuming?\n\nA 100-gram serving of cooked spaghetti typically contains:\n\n• ~160 calories\n\n• ~6 grams of protein\n\n• ~30 grams of carbohydrates\n\n• Minimal fibre\n\n• Very little fat\n\n\n\nKey nutritional points include:\n\n• High carbohydrate content, providing quick energy.\n\n• Low in dietary fibre compared to whole grains like brown rice or millet.\n\n• Lack of significant vitamins and minerals unless paired with nutrient-rich sauces.\n\n\n\nThe surge in consumption of spaghetti has dire health consequences.\n\n\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework on Balanced Diets, excessive reliance on refined carbohydrates like pasta can undermine dietary diversity, thus increasing the risk of metabolic issues when consumed disproportionately.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, a 2024 study by the University of Ghana’s Department of Nutrition revealed that urban youth now list pasta as a preferred lunch choice, and many consumers pair it with high-salt sauces or processed meats, amplifying health risks.\n\n\n\nExperts however warn that habitual consumption without balanced diets could propel non-communicable diseases, especially diabetes and cardiovascular conditions in a population already navigating nutritional transitions.\n\n\n\nAccording to the WHO, at least 30 percent of all cancers could be prevented through simple measures such as adopting a healthy diet.\n\n\n\nAs spaghetti expands its footprint, some local staples risk being marginalized, thus reducing the diversity once characteristic of Ghanaian tables.\n\n\n\nNutritionists emphasize that how spaghetti is eaten really matters.\n\n\n\nFor example, pairing it with vegetables (kontomire, garden eggs, okra), using lean proteins (beans, fish, chicken), including legumes or whole-grain pasta occasionally, and maintaining daily physical activity.\n\n\n\nFrom a once-occasional imported fare, spaghetti has woven itself into the fabric of Ghana’s daily diet.\n\n\n\nIt reflects broader shifts; urbanization, globalization, and changing lifestyles.\n\n\n\nBut behind every steaming plate is a question: Are we eating for comfort, convenience, or long-term health?\n\n\n\nAs Ghana continues to write its nutritional future, the story of spaghetti is more than pasta on a plate. It’s simply a mirror of who we are and what we may become."

When we were growing up, I found that he had three wives… those days, women who loved their husbands could bring their younger sisters or their family to enjoy.”\n\n\n\nThe retired Supreme Court justice said that he himself had seven children, but his first was born in 2025.\n\n\n\nHe also narrated how he wanted to become a Catholic priest, but his father dismissed his dream without question.\n\n\n\nJustice Atuguba settles contentious 'stated misbehaviour' debate in CJ's removal?\n\n\n\nWatch the interview below:\n\n\n\n\n\nBAI\n\n\n\nWatch NPP MPs in all-black as President Mahama delivers 2026 SONA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe didn't arrest the dollar, we strengthened the cedi to fight other currencies - Mahama"

            "content": "Business News of Saturday, 28 February 2026\n\nSource: starrfm.com.gh\n\nPresident John Dramani Mahama has announced a major initiative to reduce electricity consumption in public institutions by installing solar energy systems across Ghana.\n\n\n\nSpeaking during his 2026 State of the Nation Address on Friday, February 27, 2026, Mahama said the government is taking deliberate steps to make public institutions more energy-efficient while reducing operational costs.\n\n\n\n“Under the off-grid solar home system for public institutions, delivery of materials for the first phase of 350 systems has commenced. It means that public institutions are going to be fitted with solar to reduce their power consumption,” he told Parliament.\n\n\n\nThe program is part of a broader set of energy sector reforms that have seen the Rural Electrification Program connect 200 out of 400 targeted communities to the national grid, raising electricity access to 89.05 percent.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Ministry of Energy and Green Transition is constructing 35 mini-grids to serve 47 islands and lakeside communities in the Oti, Savannah, and Bono East regions.\n\n\n\nMahama highlighted the government’s efforts to strengthen electricity generation and distribution, noting that solar projects already include 250 megawatts of installed capacity, with 50 megawatts added through the Bui Power Authority and 30 megawatts via rooftop installations.\n\n\n\n“A few months ago, I broke ground for a 200 megawatt solar power project at the Dawa Industrial Zone, with the first 100 megawatts scheduled for completion in December 2026,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe solar initiative for public institutions is expected to reduce electricity expenditure, enhance energy security, and support environmental sustainability, while complementing other reforms like the operationalization of ECG’s single holding accounts, which has minimized revenue leakages and improved payment capacity.\n\n\n\n“This is part of our commitment to reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy security for our nation,” Mahama stressed, reinforcing the government’s broader agenda to modernize Ghana’s energy landscape."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "Pakistani media report a drone has hit a mosque in Bannu near the border, injuring at least five people.\n\nInternational calls for mediation are growing as Pakistan and Afghanistan engage in cross-border fighting for a third day, in the most serious flare-up in violence between the neighbours in months that Pakistan says has brought them into “open war”.\n\nThe European ⁠Union’s ⁠foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas urged on Saturday ⁠for the countries to bring down the temperature and enter talks, warning the violence could affect the wider region.\n\nIran, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Russia, as well as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, also urged de-escalation and mediation.\n\nAfghanistan’s Taliban rulers have said they are open to negotiations to bring an end to the conflict. But Pakistan on Saturday said there would be “no dialogue”, repeating its long-running demand that Afghanistan stop harbouring “terrorism”, an allegation Kabul denies.\n\n“There won’t be any talks. There’s no dialogue. There’s no negotiation. Terrorism from Afghanistan has to end,” the Pakistani prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, Mosharraf Zaidi, told Pakistan TV, stressing that Pakistan’s responsibility was to protect its citizens and territory.\n\nMeanwhile, tit-for-tat attacks occurred near the fraught border. Afghan media reported that Taliban forces fired drone attacks on Pakistani military camps in the border areas of Miranshah and Spinwam.\n\nPakistan’s Dawn newspaper reported a drone attack hit a mosque in the city of Bannu further south, injuring at least five people. And Pakistan TV said Pakistani forces waged their own attack targeting several positions of the Afghan Taliban.\n\n\n\nThe latest violence erupted after Pakistani air strikes on Afghan territory last weekend triggered retaliatory Afghan attacks stretching across six Pakistani districts on Thursday. In response, Pakistan carried out widespread aerial attacks in the early hours of Friday on the Afghan capital and two other areas, Kandahar and Paktia. It was Pakistan’s first air strikes on the southern power base of the Taliban authorities since they returned to power in 2021.\n\nBoth sides reported heavy losses with conflicting tolls. Pakistan said 12 of its soldiers and 274 Taliban ⁠were killed, while the Taliban said 13 of its fighters and 55 Pakistani soldiers died. Neither side’s claims could be independently verified by Al Jazeera.\n\nThe United States, which considers Pakistan a major non-NATO ally, said it backs Pakistan’s right to “defend itself against Taliban attacks”.\n\nPakistan has witnessed a sharp rise in violence within the country in recent years, including suicide bombings and coordinated assaults targeting security forces. Pakistani authorities blame the Pakistan Taliban, or TTP, for many of the attacks, and accuse Afghanistan of sheltering the group inside Afghanistan.\n\nKabul rejects the allegations and says it does not allow anyone to use Afghan soil for attacks on any country, including Pakistan.\n\nPakistan is nuclear-armed and its military capabilities are vastly superior to Afghanistan’s. However, the Taliban is adept at warfare, hardened by decades of fighting with United States-led forces."

Kim’s young daughter, wearing a brown leather coat similar to her father’s, was also seen handling a weapon.\n\nSince first appearing in public at a long-range missile test in November 2022, the girl – believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and about 13 years old – has accompanied her father to a growing number of events, including military demonstrations, factory openings and a trip to Beijing in September, where Kim Jong Un held his first summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in six years.\n\n\n\nThe party congress, which concluded on Wednesday with a military parade in the capital, Pyongyang, after seven days, is North Korea’s most significant political event, held every five years since 2016, and a carefully choreographed spectacle glorifying Kim’s leadership before some 5,000 delegates.\n\nAt this year’s meetings, Kim reiterated his plans to accelerate North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, which already is equipped with various weapons systems threatening the US and its allies in Asia, and confirmed his hardline view of rival South Korea.\n\nEarlier this week, Kim dismissed dialogue with South Korea, claiming his forces could “completely destroy” his southern neighbour, while signalling that the future of talks with the US required Washington to discard “hostile” policies towards Pyongyang.\n\nIf Washington “respects our country’s current status as stipulated in the Constitution … and withdraws its hostile policy … there is no reason why we cannot get along well with the United States”, Kim said on Wednesday, as the country wrapped up the week of meetings.\n\nHe repeated Pyongyang’s earlier stance, calling for the US to abandon demands for the North’s denuclearisation as a condition for resuming talks."

            "content": "Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.\n\nYet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, Kodak, and others.\n\nAll the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.\n\nIf you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that offers great image quality and lets you choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like Kodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.\n\nTake a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for most people\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 306 grams / Charging method: AA batteries / Companion app: None / Other features: Built-in selfie mirror, film counter\n\nIf all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well-suited for kids and those new to photography.\n\nFor an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most struggle to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash helps. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both bright and dark environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. Photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before, but selfies captured my features and skin tone more accurately, thanks in part to the small front-facing mirror. The updated lens design also lets you twist into Close-Up Mode to zoom slightly and activate the Parallax Correction features for a more aligned photo. It’s a fun, point-and-shoot-style feature, though aligning photos still takes some practice (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).\n\nFor an instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 produces vivid, relatively true-to-life photos. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nThe Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the small counter that shows your remaining shots, which is a useful tracking feature given that each print costs about $1. However, it doesn’t support Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it doesn’t feature filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for a solid instant camera that caters to all ages and experience levels, you’ll likely be satisfied with the Instax Mini 12.\n\nThe best premium instant camera\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 285 grams / Charging method: USB-C (on newer models) / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nOne of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo was a favorite of my former colleague Becca Farcase — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a handsome brown version, as well as a newer pink model.\n\nIt’s easy to balk at its price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.\n\nBeing able to adjust the brightness of the prints helped me capture night photos and a low-light immersive exhibit a little more clearly and realistically, which is a feature the Instax Mini 12 doesn’t offer. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Mini 12, the Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can disable the flash, leverage the 3-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder, and adjust the brightness of a print — a helpful feature, given Evo doesn’t capture dark environments well. The camera’s dials also let you apply various lens options and effects, from retro filters to monochrome shades, and you can even take app-based remote shots, allowing for better seflies and more photographic control.\n\nThe Evo isn’t perfect, though. The companion app isn’t as feature-rich as competing software, the menu system can be confusing to navigate, and the camera’s internal storage maxes out at 45 images. Still, these are relatively minor drawbacks for a stylish, portable camera that makes it easy to quickly capture and print quality shots.\n\nThe best instant camera for social occasions\n\nFilm type: Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / Film size: 3 x 3-inch square prints / Weight: 467 grams / Charging method: Micro USB / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nWhereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app lets you apply frames, stickers, filters, and a wide range of customization options to photos, making it great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature in the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making it a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.\n\nLike the Evo, the Shot 3 Retro features an LCD screen — albeit a much smaller one — that lets you decide whether to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp images from your phone. Unlike the Evo, however, the Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of film. It also uses cheaper film; you can often pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for under $20. The cheaper arguably encourages creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than those from both Fujifilm and Polaroid.\n\nPhotos taken with the Kodak Mini Shot 3 aren’t particularly sharp and can have an excessive pink tint. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nHowever, there are notable drawbacks to the Shot 3 Retro. The resulting prints aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone, for one, nor were they as clear or sharp as what you might get with the Evo or Mini 12 (some even have an excessive pink tint). The Shot 3 Retro doesn’t store images the way the Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish. Nonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.\n\nThe best instant camera for retro fans\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / Weight: 648 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: Yes / Other features: Flip-up lid, scene analysis feature\n\nIf you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the Polaroid Flip is the camera for you. It resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 more than any other camera on our list, thanks to its classic, retro-inspired design and flip-up lid. Its square I-Type film prints and iconic white frame give photos an authentically vintage look, while modern touches like Bluetooth, USB-C charging, and a beginner-friendly companion app add greater convenience and creative control.\n\nCompared to the third-gen Polaroid Now Plus, my former retro pick, the Flip delivers clearer shots with fewer wasted photos, making the extra $50 worthwhile given that eight I-Type sheets are a spendy $18.99. The increased clarity can be attributed to several factors, including the Flip’s sonar autofocus and a four-lens hyperfocal system — which result in sharper, more focused images — along with its excellent flash. It’s the most powerful of any Polaroid camera, and while it can sometimes overexpose images, you can adjust exposure directly from the camera or app. The Scene Analysis feature also helps by warning if a shot is likely to be over- or underexposed, or if you’re too close to your subject. In my experience, the warnings didn’t always prevent overexposure, but they did leave me with shots that looked less blown than those from the Now Plus.\n\nA few outdoor examples I captured with the Polaroid Flip. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nAll that being said, there are some notable drawbacks. The Flip is relatively heavy and awkwardly sized, so you can’t slip it into a purse or easily carry it around. Prints also take up to 15 minutes to develop — during which they must be shielded from light — which can be quite an inconvenience. Low-light performance remains a weak spot as well, and I struggled to capture indoor shots given the contrast and saturation are lower than with Instax film. Admittedly, this gave my pictures a more dreamy, vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust the saturation and exposure settings.\n\nTruth be told, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, the Flip is the perfect camera for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for portability\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / Weight: 239 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: No / Other features: Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter\n\nWhereas the Flip is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It weighs just over a pound and fits easily in the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it the most portable instant camera on our list. If its images were more true to life and didn’t require you to sheild them from the light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d call it the best instant camera for kids or travel.\n\nAt $89.99, the latest Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera available, with film that costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (a 16-sheet pack runs $21.99). The new Go sports a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including USB-C support, and Polaroid claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor. Photos are slightly brighter, though the original Go produced warmer images that felt more true to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low, but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Flip.\n\nThe second-gen Polaroid Go produces charming photos but with a cooler tone. Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Flip, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. There’s no Bluetooth or companion app for added effects; however, the camera does include a self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. The smaller prints may disappoint those who prefer traditional Polaroid sizes, though, and its modern design lacks the retro charm of older models. But classic Polaroid cameras didn’t come with an app, either, and the Go’s simplicity makes it an a easy-to-use option that delivers a traditional instant film experience at less than half the price of the Flip.\n\nOther instant cameras to consider\n\nFujifilm’s $116.99 Instax Mini 41 is the long-awaited follow-up to the Mini 40. The updated model retains the retro design found on the prior model but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups. It didn’t take long testing the Mini 41 for me to realize it’s simply the Mini 12 for adults. With its black-and-silver body and flatter, squarer edges, the Mini 41 looks sleeker and more stylish. The two cameras are nearly identical, aside from the design, with the same solid photo quality and feature set. Both battery-powered options turn on with a simple twist of the lens, and each comes equipped with a selfie mirror, a close-up mode, and a flash (which cannot be disabled).\n\nThere are a few subtle upgrades to the Mini 41, however. A textured grip in the front makes it easier to hold, and its shape makes shooting in landscape mode more comfortable. But those are small differences, and at their core, the cameras offer the same experience. Since the Instax Mini 12 retails for less, I ultimately believe it’s the better value; however, if a fashionable, mature look appeals to you, the Mini 41 is a great alternative, especially if you can find it on sale.\n\nIf you’re looking for an advanced analog instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At $234.95, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12 or the Mini 41, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click cameras given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket, an aluminum extension column, and a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur when capturing fast-moving subjects.\n\nThanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12, Mini 41, and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera, not a hybrid like the Evo, so you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The newer model is also less user-friendly than the Mini 12 and Mini 41, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters.\n\nThe Kodak Smile Plus is another hybrid instant camera that allows you to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $129.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with a physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers.\n\nHowever, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark.\n\nThat said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software isn’t as snappy or feature-rich, it still lets you add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it’s often available for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.\n\nFrom photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, Leica’s Sofort 2 is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.\n\nThe drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s challenging to recommend at $399, as most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The Leica user interface is easier to navigate, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also appreciate that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.\n\nWhile it didn’t make the cut, the Instax Square SQ1 is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and features a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $159.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100. That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Flip and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.\n\nFujifilm also sells the newer Instax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at $199.95. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.\n\nFujifilm’s Instax Wide Evo Hybrid is nearly identical to the Instax Mini Evo. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $409.95 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lenses and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.\n\nPlus, unlike the Wide 400, the Wide Evo Hybrid is a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful feature that can reduce wasted shots. However, at $409.95, it costs significantly more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken, which is something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects, such as a dog or hyperactive toddler.\n\nIf you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $409.95 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $175.95 Instax Wide 400 is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar stills to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.\n\nFujifilm’s new Instax Mini LiPlay Plus isn’t nearly as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo, but it’s worth considering if you take a lot of selfies. At $234.99, the hybrid camera costs the same as the Instax Mini Evo, but features a 3-inch LCD screen on the back, along with a second, rear-facing wide-angle lens designed specifically for self-portraits. That dedicated selfie camera, paired with the LCD, delivers some of the best — and most precise — selfies I’ve captured with an instant camera to date.\n\nThe LiPlay Plus also includes some fun extra features, such as a layered photo mode that combines images from both cameras into a single shot. It can also record short audio clips, which are saved as a QR code you can place in a corner of the printed photo. Both features are enjoyable to play with, though the layered photo mode can, admittedly, come off as gimmicky. You’re basically just dropping a selfie onto a background image with no way to reposition or resize it.\n\nWhat I’m looking for How we test instant cameras Collapse Typically, I try to spend at least a couple of weeks, if not months, testing each camera to get a sense of what it would be like to actually own one. I’ll use them to capture photos of loved ones while hanging out, as well as subjects and scenes I stumble across as I explore Los Angeles and its many beaches. I shoot indoors and outside, with and without the flash, allowing me to compare how each camera performs in both bright and low-light environments.I also ask friends and family — both young and old — for their input on image quality, and I have them take photos with the instant camera to get their thoughts on usability. If the camera comes with extra features, such as filters or support for a companion app, I’ll make sure to put them to the test in real-life situations. I note how easy it is to pull up and navigate the app, apply the effects, and, of course, how the results look. Photo quality Collapse Instant cameras aren’t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most struggle in low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life. Ease of use Collapse How easy is it to set the instant camera up and take photos with it? Ease of use is a big part of what makes instant cameras fun and accessible to people of all ages. You shouldn’t need a professional photography background just to enjoy an instant camera. Value Collapse Instant cameras come with different features at various price points. Generally, the more feature-rich cameras tend to be pricier, but do the extra capabilities justify the added cost? Some cameras, for example, pair with a companion app or feature a built-in selfie mirror, while others let you print images from your phone. None of these are essential, though the added niceties may be worth it for some people. Suitability Collapse Some instant cameras aren’t as well-suited for certain situations and / or people as others. For example, there are instant cameras that print old-fashioned Polaroid photos that aren’t very clear. They frustrate me, but retro lovers might find them charming. Other cameras come with advanced creative modes that let you edit photos and even print smartphone photos, but a young child might find them difficult to use. Film Collapse Each instant camera requires a different kind of film, which means that the sticker price of the camera isn’t the true price. This is something you should take into account before making a purchase, as the cost of film can quickly add up. Depending on the brand, you may have to pay anywhere between 50 cents and $2 a shot.It’s also important to take into account that some film is easier to find. The Instax Mini 12, for example, uses credit card-size Instax Mini film that’s sold at most major retailers. Other types of film, including the film needed for Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, are available on Amazon but aren’t sold by as many retailers.Finally, most instant camera brands sell films of varying quality in a range of styles. Some are decorated with colorful frames and patterns, while others are black and white. They also vary in shape and size, from small rectangular prints you can stick in your wallet to square-shaped ones. You can also buy wider prints, and some brands even sell film with an adhesive backing that allows you to use the resulting images as stickers.\n\nUpdate, February 27th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and shorten the copy for all of our main entries."

The Artemis III mission, scheduled for 2027, was originally going to attempt to land on the Moon but will now be a test flight instead. NASA also says it’s “increasing its cadence of missions,” including adding a second test flight in 2027 and aiming for “at least one surface landing every year thereafter,” including the Artemis IV landing.\n\nThe overhaul to the Artemis launch schedule follows a report from NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) earlier this month that highlighted serious safety risks with NASA’s previous plans for future launches. ASAP was particularly concerned about Artemis III, which its report said included too many “cumulative technical, operational, and schedule risks associated with multiple first-of-a-kind objectives planned for a single mission.”\n\nThe Artemis II mission, scheduled for this year, has faced a string of issues during testing over recent weeks, delaying its launch until no earlier than April. Artemis II is intended to orbit the Moon — if it’s successful, it will be the first time humans visit lunar orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance’s merger agreement is now official. On Friday, the two companies announced plans to merge into a massive media company that will fold WBD’s studio, linear channels, streaming service, and gaming segment into Paramount.\n\nThough WBD initially signed onto an $83 billion agreement to merge part of Warner Bros. with Netflix, Paramount persisted with a hostile takeover bid, followed by a series of offers. That persistence paid off, as WBD determined that Paramount’s “best and final” offer is “superior” to Netflix’s deal. On Thursday, Netflix declined to match Paramount’s bid, calling it “no longer financially attractive.”\n\nParamount and WBD say the board of directors of both companies has signed off on the deal. The companies expect it to close in the third quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Under the agreement, Paramount will acquire WBD in a deal valued at $110 billion. Paramount has also agreed to cover the $7 billion regulatory termination fee and the $2.8 billion breakup fee owed to Netflix, which it has already paid, according to Bloomberg.\n\n“Together, Paramount and WBD will deliver greater choice for consumers through its leading streaming platforms with an exceptional intellectual property portfolio that has produced popular franchises such as Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Top Gun, the DC Universe and SpongeBob SquarePants,” the companies say in the press release.\n\nLawmakers and regulators are skeptical about the Paramount-WBD merger. “A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a statement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta also warned that the agreement isn’t a “done deal,” and that the state’s Department of Justice will be “vigorous” in its review of the merger."

            "content": "Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts, and have stopped getting a response. This week, thanks to a reader tip, we think we’ve found the original phone the T1 is based on.\n\nA long time ago, back when the Trump phone was but a single, inaccurate render and a contradictory spec sheet, we tried to figure out what other phone it might be based on. Now, eight months, two spec overhauls, and one redesign later, I have a good guess: the HTC U24 Pro.\n\nI didn’t spot this by myself. A reader first tipped me off to the similarities between the U24 Pro and the Trump phone I revealed a few weeks ago, which are numerous: a similar angled body and curved display, a unique front sensor array, and broadly similar specs, including oddities like a headphone jack and microSD card support.\n\nLet’s get one thing out the way at the top: I’m pretty sure HTC isn’t secretly building the Trump phone. Sohaib Ahmed, the company’s global director of PR, told me as much: “HTC does not design or manufacture phones for third parties.” But that doesn’t rule out another company playing a part in designing or building both phones, and given just how similar they look, I suspect that’s exactly what happened.\n\nIt’s a little hard to make out in this screenshot, but the Trump phone shares the sharply angled edges of the HTC U24 Pro. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nThe U24 Pro is an odd phone in its own right. It launched in 2024 for €549 (around $600 at the time), and was heralded in some corners as a return from the dead for HTC, despite the fact that it followed the U23 Pro a year earlier, and a string of smaller releases that targeted the Asian market. HTC, once one of the major players in the Android phone industry, had been greatly diminished ever since selling a large part of its smartphone business to Google for $1.1 billion in 2017.\n\nBoth the T1 Phone and the U24 Pro share a slightly asymmetric angular frame, jutting out into a point along every edge, with a heavily curved screen on the front. I cannot think of, nor find, another phone that is quite the same shape — even small details like the positions of the antenna lines around the power and volume buttons line up. Even more telling is the set of sensors along each phone’s top. The U24 Pro splits up its speaker grill, notification LED, and proximity sensor into three, resulting in an unusual design with a long bar, a small dot for the LED, and then a second shorter bar, at the point where the display meets the phone’s top. What looks like the same sensor design can be clearly seen on the Trump phone I was shown, though I can’t confirm that the sensors themselves are the same, or that the T1 Phone will also have a notification LED.\n\nBoth phones have near-identical sets of speakers and sensors about the front selfie camera, with headphone jack and microphone visible behind them on the top edges. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nOther details are subtler. It’s hard to tell exactly from the glimpses I got of the Trump phone, but along the top frame it certainly looks to have both a headphone jack and a microphone in the exact same positions as on the HTC device. Even having a headphone jack in the first place is evidence of the phones’ connection, given how rare the feature is in modern devices. The same can be said for the fact that both phones include a microSD card slot, sharing support for up to 1TB cards on top of a base 512GB of storage.\n\nWhile the rear cameras look completely different, which seems to scupper my theory, look again: The U24 Pro’s cameras are split into a pair close together, with a third lens lower down. The new Trump phone sets all its cameras in one mount, but they’re unevenly spaced, with a larger gap between the second and third lenses. These cameras may look totally different on the surface, but I suspect that underneath you’ll find they’re similar. And what we know of the specs matches too: Trump Mobile told me that its phone will have 50-megapixel sensors for both the main and selfie cameras, and my glimpse of its camera UI showed an ultrawide and a 2x zoom option — all of which you’ll find on the U24 Pro.\n\nThe two phones’ cameras look different at first, but the unusual lens placement might just line up. Screenshot: Dominic Preston / The Verge and Image: HTC\n\nAssuming that the two phones are essentially the same, does the U24 Pro tell us any more about what to expect from the T1? It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, matching what I’d been told about a Snapdragon 7-series chip in the Trump phone. The U24 Pro has a 6.8-inch OLED display, 60W wired charging and even wireless charging support, and an IP67 rating for dust and water protection. There’s reason to be cautious reading too much into the spec sheet, though: The U24 Pro released with a 4,600mAh battery, smaller than the 5,000mAh capacity I’ve been told will be in the Trump phone. If that spec differs, then other elements of the internals could well too — the bigger battery in particular might replace the wireless charging coils of the HTC phone.\n\nThe U24 Pro launched to middling reviews, which may not inspire much confidence in Trump Mobile’s offering. Tech Advisor gave the phone two and a half stars out of five, calling it “hard to recommend over rivals,” while Notebookcheck declared it “modern and yet out of date.” Still, it fared surprisingly well in a JerryRigEverything teardown and durability test.\n\nHe noticed, however, that this didn’t appear to be the HTC of old, lacking the sapphire crystal HTC previously used on its displays and optical image stabilization on the front camera it once pioneered. The U24 Pro and other HTC phones released in the last few years share little consistent design language, and ship with near-stock Android software. Speculation has been rife that HTC isn’t in fact manufacturing the phones internally, but had commissioned an ODM — original design manufacturer — to produce the hardware. ODMs design and manufacture phones for other companies, usually to a set of specifications provided by the consumer-facing brands, and often retain ownership of the designs, allowing them to reuse and repurpose them for other clients. I asked HTC for clarification, but the company wouldn’t confirm whether the U24 Pro was made in-house or contracted out.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that Trump Mobile, or its manufacturing partner, is simply ripping off the design of a little-known HTC device. But I think the most likely answer here is a more mundane one: HTC probably worked with some unnamed ODM to design and manufacture the U24 Pro, and Trump Mobile just happened to work with the same company. That manufacturer may have either dug out its old designs for HTC when developing the T1 Phone, or perhaps gave new life to old, unused components from HTC’s production run. Without knowing the hypothetical ODM involved, it’s hard to say for sure. Trump Mobile has previously confirmed that it’s working with a partner or partners to manufacture its phones outside the US, before their “final assembly” in Miami, but executive Don Hendrickson wouldn’t tell me the name of its manufacturer or where it’s based. I reached out to the company again for comment on this story, and received no reply.\n\nSo no, I don’t think that HTC made the Trump phone. But it does look likely that it is based, more or less, on one of that company’s phones. It remains to be seen how the T1 Phone will differ in its details, but the fact that its origins seem so closely tied to an unpopular midranger from two years ago doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the T1 Phone’s flagship credentials.\n\nGot inside information on Trump Mobile or the Trump phone?

            "content": "is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nOn Thursday morning, I attended a Q&A panel with four top Samsung smartphone executives. Until 2025, Samsung was the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer, and by association, the world’s largest maker of cameras. It’s still the second largest after Apple.\n\nSamsung handed me the microphone first. I asked:\n\nWe see a divide in society between people who want AI to do impressive things with their photos and videos, and those who don’t want AI to do anything with photos and videos because it’s eroding our ability to believe that what we have seen is real, destroying the concept of photographic evidence. Metadata tools like C2PA have utterly failed to stem the tide. Does Samsung have any new and different ideas on how to prevent AI images from taking over the world?\n\nSamsung’s four executives did not have any new and different ideas to share.\n\nI will credit Won-Joon Choi, the mobile division’s COO and R&D chief, for not dodging the question. He told the room that the erosion of reality is a problem and he wants to fix it.\n\nBut he, and other Samsung executives, suggested that the company needs to balance the desire for photographic reality with letting smartphone buyers be “more creative.” They passed the buck by suggesting it’s an industry-wide problem, one that requires a broader conversation, and suggested that Samsung has already partially solved it simply by adding a watermark to AI-generated images. A watermark that can easily be removed.\n\nGiven an opening later, an exec suggested our feelings toward AI-generated content might become more favorable in the future.\n\nHere are some of those answers.\n\n“We recognize the issue, because a lot of content is generated by AI,” Choi began. “On the one hand, people want to be more creative, so we believe we have to provide a solution so people can be more creative,” he said. “On the other hand, it’s really hard nowadays to distinguish the real photos and videos from the fake ones. I think this is a problem, we recognize that, and I think it’s a problem we have to solve at an industry level.”\n\n“The C2PA, you may view it as a failure, but it’s still enough to provide a mechanism if people want to validate that those pictures and videos are made by AI. I think we have to provide a mechanism so people can use it. I think it’s an ongoing effort throughout the industry to solve this problem,” he added.\n\n“I think if we make joint efforts to solve this problem, I believe that we should be able to do it,” he concluded.\n\nAs my colleague Jess Weatherbed wrote earlier this week, we’re starting to worry that this sort of “the industry will solve this together” rhetoric, and the C2PA itself, are substitutes for actual meaningful action.\n\nPerhaps responding to our Samsung AI slop watch reporting, Samsung America exec Dave Das also chimed in to say that the company’s still learning about how much AI is acceptable when creating its own ads. He admitted that the company has “just started utilizing some AI content in our creative, and the feedback has been pretty clear.”\n\n“We’re trying to discern what is the right place to use it, and absolutely how to be very clear about when we are using AI generated content vs naturally generated content,” Das said.\n\nBut Das still frames it as a balancing act between business priorities, not a social responsibility. “It really boils down to giving the creator choice,” he said, suggesting that Samsung’s job is to find “the right balance.”\n\nLater in the morning, KTLA-TV tech reporter Rich DeMuro felt out Samsung’s stance with a very different question. He asked whether Samsung might want to make it easier for customers to remove its AI watermark from AI-generated photos.\n\nThree screenshots taken from AI-generated Samsung ads on YouTube. More on Samsung slop watch here. Image: Samsung / The Verge\n\n“If I’m making a Christmas card with all your fun tools, do I really want that to say ‘AI-generated content?’” asked DeMuro.\n\nDrew Blackard, Samsung America’s SVP of mobile product management, took that one. He concluded by saying that “If we feel like consumers really want that ability to remove watermarks, and there are other ways to address the first point around authenticity at the same time, we’ll do both things and deliver the best of what people are wanting out of the experiences.”\n\n“At least right now, there’s enough concern from consumers around authenticity that that’s the primary thing we’ve solved for, in terms of the watermarking both in the metadata and on the photo itself. Not all services do that,” he said.\n\nBlackard also suggested we might look back one day and realize that AI-generated content isn’t such a big deal, that our perceptions might change over time, the same way perceptions changed toward user-generated content to begin with. People were concerned then with “the amount of content now flowing into the system” and how it wasn’t the professional video product they were used to, he said.\n\nI wonder if Samsung and fellow smartphone makers have considered the opposite: that perceptions of AI-generated imagery might become even less favorable after people lose their jobs in favor of cheap-to-produce AI slop, and after it becomes far easier to lie and cheat and steal in the absence of reliable recorded evidence.\n\nI wonder if they’ve considered solving this problem ”at an industry level” before they break the dam, and whether perception might turn against Samsung for helping create the flood that comes after."

            "content": "Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.\n\nThe blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.\n\nThe Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.\n\nAccess to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.\n\nWe understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase. We acknowledge the difficulties this is causing for our users there. Supabase continues to follow up through all available channels to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nWe continue to advise affected customers… — Supabase (@supabase) February 27, 2026\n\nAn Indian founder, who asked not to be named to avoid potential repercussions, told TechCrunch they had stopped seeing new user sign-ups from India over the past two to three days. A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.\n\nWhile Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.\n\nAt the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.\n\nThe incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.\n\n“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.”\n\nIndia has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted access to developer platform GitHub, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also reported that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.\n\nFounded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has gained traction amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its valuation to $5 billion.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond."

However, a spokesperson said that such actions violated a company policy that bans workers from using inside information for personal gain, including on prediction markets.\n\nPrediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi allow people to make wagers on the outcomes of real-world events. For instance, on Polymarket, there are wagers being made around the kind of products OpenAI will announce in 2026 and when the company will go public. They can cover any event, and some eye-popping money can be made. As we recently reported, an accountant won a $470,300 jackpot on Kalshi by betting against DOGE believers.\n\nPrediction markets insist they are not gambling sites, preferring to label themselves as financial platforms. Kalshi is a regulated exchange and, in fact, it fined and banned a MrBeast editor for similar alleged insider trading earlier this week.

The president allowed for a six-month phase-out period for departments using the products, but emphasized that Anthropic was no longer welcome as a federal contractor.\n\n“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again,” the president wrote in the post.\n\nNotably, the president’s post did not mention any plans to designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk, as had been previously mentioned as a consequence. However, a subsequent tweet from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made good on the threat.\n\n“In conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security,” Secretary Hegseth wrote. “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\n\nThe Pentagon dispute centered on Anthropic’s refusal to allow its AI models to be used to power either mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, which Secretary Hegseth found unduly restrictive.\n\nCEO Dario Amodei reiterated his stance in a public post on Thursday, refusing to compromise on the two points.\n\n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters — with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei wrote at the time. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Per the BBC, CEO Sam Altman sent a memo to staff on Thursday saying he shared the same “red lines” and that any OpenAI-related defense contracts would also reject uses that were “unlawful or unsuited to cloud deployments, such as domestic surveillance and autonomous offensive weapons.”\n\nOpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who very publicly fell out with Altman in November 2023 and has since co-founded his own AI company, also waded into the conversation on Friday, writing on X: “It’s extremely good that Anthropic has not backed down, and it’s significant that OpenAI has taken a similar stance.”\n\nBut within hours of the Trump administration ordering federal agencies to cut ties with Anthropic, OpenAI moved to fill the void, announcing a deal with the Pentagon that Altman said preserved the same core principles Anthropic had fought for — prohibitions on domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, OpenAI and the government began meeting about a potential tie-up on Wednesday of this week.\n\nSurely, there will be more twists to come.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI and Google each received contract awards from the U.S. Defense Department last July. While some Google employees have come out in support of Anthropic, Google and its parent company have yet to comment.\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.\n\nSuno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\n\nStill, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more."

The deal is reportedly valued at around $150 million per season, a significant jump from the roughly $85 million ESPN reportedly paid. All races are available to Apple TV subscribers at no extra charge. The previous partnership with ESPN achieved an average viewership of 1.3 million in its final year.\n\nNotably, Netflix was previously reported to be eyeing U.S. media rights for Formula 1 back in 2022."

            "content": "US secretary of defense Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon to designate Anthropic a “supply-chain risk” on Friday, sending shock waves through Silicon Valley and leaving many companies scrambling to understand whether they can keep using one of the industry’s most popular AI models.\n\n“Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic,” Hegseth wrote in a social media post.\n\nThe designation comes after weeks of tense negotiations between the Pentagon and Anthropic over how the US military could use the startup’s AI models. In a blog post this week, Anthropic argued its contracts with the Pentagon should not allow for its technology to be used for mass domestic surveillance of Americans or fully autonomous weapons. The Pentagon asked that Anthropic agree to let the US military apply its AI to “all lawful uses” with no specific exceptions.\n\nA supply-chain-risk designation allows the Pentagon to restrict or exclude certain vendors from defense contracts if they’re deemed to pose security vulnerabilities, such as risks related to foreign ownership, control, or influence. It is intended to protect sensitive military systems and data from potential compromise.\n\nAnthropic responded in another blog post on Friday evening, saying it would “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court,” and that such a designation would “set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government.”\n\nAnthropic added that it hadn’t received any direct communication from the Department of Defense or the White House regarding negotiations over the use of its AI models."

            "content": "Other Wireless Chargers We Tested\n\nThere are a lot of wireless chargers. Here are a few more we like, but for one reason or another don't warrant a place above.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nKrafted Couch Wireless Charger for $52: I thought this wireless charger that’s designed to be draped over the arm of your couch was a great idea when I saw it, but the ridges failed to keep it in place on my velvety couch, so it kept slipping down the side. The silicone finish with the Krafted logo is also a bit ugly. It's just a silicone mat with a magnetic charger inside, though there is a fairly generous 6.6-foot (2-meter) cable, and it is Qi2 rated. If you’re always rooting around for a charger and one of the colors blends well with your furniture, it might be a good solution for you.\n\nEinova Eggtronic Charging Stone for $70: Made with 100 percent solid marble or stone—you can choose from a variety. Every single pick in this guide looks very much like a wireless charger, but I've had visiting friends ask if this one is a drink coaster. (I'm still figuring out whether that's a good or bad thing.) It has zero LEDs, perfect for bedrooms; just try to hide the cable to truly make it blend into your home. We recommend putting a case on your phone when using it with this charger, as there's a risk of scuffing up the back with these harder surfaces.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nBaseus Nomos 5-in-1 Charging Station for $100: If you liked the PicoGo W2 above but need more gadget-charging power, this 5-in-1 could be worth a look. It also has a tilting pad and retractable USB-C cable, but adds two more USB-C ports and one USB-A, along with a stats-filled display. It’s perfect for your desktop. I also tried and quite liked the Baseus Nomos 8-in-1 Magnetic Charging Station ($70), which combines a similar folding Qi2 pad with three US AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one USB-A.\n\nRapport London Formula Wireless Charging Tray for $475: Yes, this is an obscene price for a Qi wireless charger. You can probably make a version for a fraction of the cost. But Rapport's build quality is quite nice, with a lacquered grey box and a soft-touch fabric to keep your watches and phone scratch-free. It reliably recharged several Android phones without making them too warm, all while offering storage for a few watches. It's attractive, but you have to have cash to burn at this price.\n\niOttie iOS Wireless Duo for $50: This dual-charging system looks pretty—I like the fabric-wrapped stand—and you can charge another device on the rubberized charging pad next to it. The stand can be used in portrait or landscape, though in the latter orientation it'll block the pad. I use the pad to top up my wireless earbuds, but I wouldn't use this iOttie on a nightstand, because the LED on the front can be glaring. A cable and adapter are included, which makes it a good value. It can charge Pixel phones at up to 15 watts, iPhones at 7.5 watts, and other Android phones at 10 watts.\n\nJourney Alti Play Performance Desk Mat for $120: This is a desk mat that doubles as a wireless charging pad. On the left side is a plasticky rectangle with a Qi2 magnetic puck for your smartphone. Above it is a little area to charge wireless earbuds (5 watts). Naturally, there's RGB all over, and there are two buttons you can press to cycle through patterns and colors. It's a smart-looking system, though the quality of the actual mat leaves a bit to be desired. I didn't have issues gliding my mouse on it, and it stays put thanks to the rubber underside, but I just didn't like the look and feel of the Lycra surface. Journey has some other versions of this mat that use different materials, so take a look if you like the overall aesthetic.\n\nCourant Catch:2 Essentials for $75: Wireless chargers should look nice. You shouldn't settle for anything less! This Courant dual charger oozes luxury with its Belgian linen-wrapped surface (especially in the camel color). I've used it by my front door to recharge my partner's and my wireless earbuds for two years. The rubber feet prevent it from shifting around, but even if there are five coils in this pad, you should try to be precise when you put your device down to charge and make sure the LED lights up to double-check. It comes with a color-matching USB-C cable.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nZens Liberty Wireless Charger for $150: I tested the Glass Edition of this wireless charging pad, and it looks stunning with the 16 overlapping copper coils on display (the standard version has a woolen fabric top). It can charge two devices simultaneously at up to 15 watts apiece, and there’s an optional Apple Watch add-on ($19). As stylish as it is, the price is too high. Because you can see the coils, placement is never an issue, but it’s a bulky charger; the fan is audible at times, and while I had no problem charging my iPhone or AirPods, my Pixel 6 Pro got very warm on this pad.\n\nXiaomi Mi 80-W Wireless Charging Stand for $50: By far the fastest wireless charger we have tested, this stand is only worth considering for Xiaomi phones (it seems to charge most other phones at 10 watts or below). I tested with the Xiaomi 13 Ultra, which tops out at 50 watts (some Xiaomi models can go higher). The unusual sail shape combines a white triangular section with a clear acrylic base that has a subtle groove to hold your phone in place and a gap underneath for the exhaust grill from the noisy fan. The USB-C port and LED indicator are on the back.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

            "content": "The snow is melting, the days are getting longer, and I can almost smell the springtime ahead. Soon, we'll be cruising around town on ebikes and electric scooters instead of burning fossil fuels. For now, the weather hasn't quite caught up, which is great for markdowns. Many of the best electric scooters are still seeing significant discounts. If you've been thinking about buying one, now's the best time: prices are low, and sunny commuting days are just ahead.\n\nGear editor Julian Chokkattu has spent five years testing more than 45 electric scooters. These are his top picks that are also on sale right now.\n\nApollo Go for $849 ($450 Off)\n\nThis is Gear editor Julian Chokkattu's favorite scooter. The riding experience is powerful and smooth, thanks to its dual 350-watt motors and solid front and rear suspensions. The speed maxes out at 28 miles per hour (mph), which doesn't make it the fastest scooter on the market, but it has a good range. (Chokkattu is a very tall man and was able to travel 15 miles on a single charge at 15 mph.) Other Apollo features he appreciates: turn signals, a dot display, a bell, along with a headlight and an LED strip for extra visibility.\n\nApollo Phantom 2.0 for $2099 ($900 Off)\n\nThe Apollo Phantom 2.0 maxes out at 44 mph, with plenty of power from its dual 1,750-watt motors. It's a gorgeous scooter, designed with 11-inch self-healing tubeless tires and a dual-spring suspension system for a smooth riding experience. But with great power comes great weight. At 102 pounds, the Phantom 2.0 is the heaviest electric scooter Chokkattu has tested, so I would only recommend this purchase if you don't live in a walkup and/or have a garage.\n\nMore Discounted Electric Scooters"

            "content": "US President Donald Trump announced Friday that he was instructing every federal agency to “immediately cease” use of Anthropic’s AI tools. The move comes after Anthropic and top officials clashed for weeks over military applications of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump said that there would be a “six month phase out period” for agencies using Anthropic, which could allow time for further negotiations between the government and the AI startup.\n\nThe Pentagon and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nShortly after the President’s announcement, defense secretary Pete Hegseth said that Anthropic would also be designated a “supply chain risk,” a move normally reserved for foreign businesses considered a danger to American national security. The designation will bar the US military and its contractors and suppliers from working with the AI company.\n\nHegseth also lashed out at Anthropic and its CEO, Dario Amodei, over the company's refusal to agree to its demands. “Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of ‘effective altruism,' they have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission—a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives,” Hegseth wrote on X.\n\nThe Department of Defense has sought to change the terms of a deal struck with Anthropic and other companies last July to eliminate restrictions on how AI can be deployed and instead permit “all lawful use” of the technology. Anthropic objected to the change, claiming that it could allow AI to be used to fully control lethal autonomous weapons or to conduct mass surveillance on US citizens."

            "content": "Looking for an upgraded Roku that's a great match for your new 4K TV? Right now, both Amazon and Best Buy have the 2024 Roku Ultra discounted to $80, a $20 break from the usual price. It sports dual-band Wi-Fi and Ethernet for a more consistent connection, support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and the remote has a headphone port.\n\nWhile there are a ton of great Roku streaming devices to choose from, the Ultra stands out for a few reasons. Streaming in 4K requires a huge amount of bandwidth, and some wireless networks just aren't up to the task, particularly if your TV isn't near your router. A true dual-band Wi-Fi setup in the Roku Ultra helps ensure a stutter-free experience on all of your favorite streaming services. If you really hate buffering and dropped connections, there's an Ethernet port around back for a wired hookup, something most other streaming devices can't claim.\n\nAnother nice upgrade you get with your Roku Ultra kit is the remote, which includes a built-in 3.5-mm headphone jack. That's perfect if you like to sneak in a few episodes of your favorite show after everyone's gone to bed, or want to catch a movie without waking a sleeping baby. The Roku Ultra even includes a pair of earbuds you can use right out of the box, which are surprisingly good for what they are, and they include extra ear tips for getting the fit right.\n\nLike some of the other premium Roku streaming devices, the hands-free voice controls make it super easy to find what you're looking for. Rather than dig through all of your apps and services looking for a movie, you can just say the title into the remote and let Roku go and find it for you.\n\nIf you're ready to take your 4K streaming to the next level, both Best Buy and Amazon have the Roku Ultra marked down to $80. We also have a great guide that breaks down the differences between all of the available Roku streamers, and a roundup of our favorite media streamers, in case you're wondering what the Roku alternatives look like."

            "content": "A few months ago, a family came into Pasadena Cyclery in Pasadena, California, for a repair on what they thought was their teenager’s ebike. “I can’t fix that here,’ Daniel Purnell, a store manager and technician, remembers telling them. “That’s a motorcycle.” The mother got upset. She didn’t realize that what she thought was an ebike could go much faster, perhaps up to 55 miles per hour.\n\n“There’s definitely an education problem,” Purnell says. In California, bike advocates are pushing a new bill designed to clear up that confusion around what counts as an electric bicycle—and what doesn’t.\n\nIt’s a tricky balance. On one hand, backers want to allow riders access to new, faster, and more affordable non-car transportation options, ones that don’t require licenses and are emission-free. On the other hand, people, and especially kids, seem to be getting hurt. Ebike-related injuries jumped more than 1,020 percent nationwide between 2020 and 2024, according to hospital data, though it’s not clear if the stats-keepers can routinely distinguish between ebikes and their faster, “e-moto” cousins. (Moped and powered-assisted cycle injuries jumped 67 percent in that same period.)\n\n“We’re overdue to have better ebike regulation,” says California state senator Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat who sponsored the bill and represents parts of North County in San Diego. “This has been an ongoing and growing issue for years.”\n\nSenate Bill 1167 would make it illegal for retailers to label higher-powered, electric-powered vehicles as ebikes. It would clarify that ebikes have fully operative pedals and electric motors that don’t exceed 750 watts, enough to hit top speeds between 20 and 28 mph.\n\n“We’re not against these devices,” says Kendra Ramsey, the executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition, which represents riders and is promoting the legislation. “People think they’re ebikes and they're not really ebikes.”\n\nBill backers say they hope the fix, if it passes, makes a difference, especially for teenagers, who love the freedom that electric motors give them but can get into trouble if something goes wrong at higher speeds. Kids 17 and younger accounted for 20 percent of US ebike injuries from 2020 to 2024, about in line with the share of the total population. But headlines—and the laws that follow them—have focused on teen injuries and even deaths.\n\nThere are no national laws governing ebike riding. But bike backers spent years moving between states to pass laws that put ebikes into three classes: Class 1, which have pedal-assist that only works when they’re actually pedaled, and goes up to 20 mph; Class 2, which have throttles that work without pedaling but still only reach 20 mph; and Class 3, which use pedal-assist to move up to 28 mph. Plenty of states and cities restrict the most powerful Class 3 bikes to people older than 16. (In a complicated twist, some ebikes have different “modes,” allowing riders to toggle between Class 2 and Class 3.)\n\nLast year, researchers visited 19 San Francisco Bay Area middle and high schools and found that 88 percent of the electric two-wheeled devices parked there were so high-powered and high-speed that they didn’t comply with the three-class system at all.\n\nEbikes have clearly struck a chord with state policymakers: at least 10 bills introduced this year deal with ebikes, according to Ramsey.\n\nSome bike advocates believe injuries have less to do with ebikes than “e-motos,” a category that’s less likely to appear in retail stores or the sort of social media ads attracting teens to the tech. These have more powerful motors and can travel in excess of 30 mph. Vehicles, like the Surron Ultra Bee, which can hit top speeds of 55 mph, or Tuttio ICT, which can hit 50, are often marketed by retailers as \"electric bikes.” Because so many sales happen online, it can be hard for people, and especially parents, to know what they’re getting into."

            "content": "OpenAI has fired an employee following an investigation into their activity on prediction market platforms including Polymarket, WIRED has learned.\n\nOpenAI CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, disclosed the termination in an internal message to employees earlier this year. The employee, she said, “used confidential OpenAI information in connection with external prediction markets (e.g. Polymarket).”\n\n“Our policies prohibit employees from using confidential OpenAI information for personal gain, including in prediction markets,” says spokesperson Kayla Wood. OpenAI has not revealed the name of the employee or the specifics of their trades.\n\nEvidence suggests that this was not an isolated event. Polymarket runs on the Polygon blockchain network, so its trading ledger is pseudonymous but traceable. According to an analysis by the financial data platform Unusual Whales, there have been clusters of activities, which the service flagged as suspicious, around OpenAI-themed events since March 2023.\n\nUnusual Whales flagged 77 positions in 60 wallet addresses as suspected insider trades, looking at the age of the account, trading history, and significance of investment, among other factors. Suspicious trades hinged on the release dates of products like Sora, GPT-5, and the ChatGPT Browser, as well as CEO Sam Altman’s employment status. In November 2023, two days after Altman was dramatically ousted from the company, a new wallet placed a significant bet that he would return, netting over $16,000 in profits. The account never placed another bet.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former tech worker who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at kateknibbs.09.\n\nThe behavior fits into patterns typical of insider trades. “The tell is the clustering. In the 40 hours before OpenAI launched its browser, 13 brand-new wallets with zero trading history appeared on the site for the first time to collectively bet $309,486 on the right outcome,” says Unusual Whales CEO Matt Saincome. “When you see that many fresh wallets making the same bet at the same time, it raises a real question about whether the secret is getting out.”"

            "content": "Less than a year ago, Skydance Media closed its $8 billion merger with Paramount, making the Trump-friendly Ellison family—billionaire Oracle founder Larry and his son David, CEO of Paramount Skydance—among the most powerful media moguls in the country. A looming Paramount Skydance merger with Warner Bros. Discovery would expand their empire even further.\n\nNow that Netflix has backed out of its bid to acquire WBD, the Ellisons stand to gain an entirely new trove of significant intellectual property, from DC Comics to Harry Potter. According to Reuters, Warner Bros. agreed to be acquired by Paramount Skydance in a $110 billion deal signed Friday, with Paramount Skydance agreeing to pay a $7 billion termination fee if federal regulators don’t approve the merger.\n\nParamount’s merger with Skydance has already brought about mass layoffs, including at CBS News, where Free Press founder Bari Weiss is leading a cultural overhaul as editor in chief. In January, Oracle became a partial owner of TikTok, giving the Ellisons even more cultural currency.\n\nHere’s everything the family would control if the WBD deal goes through.\n\nCBS and CBS News\n\nBesides its news division, which includes 60 Minutes, CBS is also home to hits like Tracker and Matlock, along with reality stalwarts Survivor and Big Brother.\n\nHBO and HBO Max\n\nAmong the most Emmy-winningest networks to exist, HBO’s library includes classics like Game of Thrones, The Wire, and Veep, as well as newer hits like The Pitt, The Gilded Age, and Thrones spin-off A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. (Outside of Canada, HBO Max is also a key distributor of the hockey smut drama Heated Rivalry.)\n\nCNN\n\nWhile CNN’s ratings dipped last year, it remains a news juggernaut and a top 5 cable network, featuring household names like John King, Kaitlan Collins, and Anderson Cooper (who recently announced he will be leaving 60 Minutes at the end of the current season).\n\nDC Comics\n\nThe merger would put Paramount Skydance in control of storied comic book franchises like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nThe wizarding world of Harry Potter, including all eight fantasy films and the upcoming HBO television series slated to premiere in 2027 would also be under the Ellisons’ purview.\n\nTikTok\n\nAs of a deal finalized in January, Oracle now holds a 15 percent stake in TikTok’s US operations.\n\nStar Trek\n\nAll 13 Star Trek movies and television shows are owned by Paramount Skydance. At a press event last year, Dana Goldberg, cochair of Paramount Pictures and chair of Paramount Television, said the franchise would be a “priority across the company.”\n\nWarner Bros. Studios\n\nHome to blockbusters like Barbie, The Dark Knight, and more recently, One Battle After Another and Sinners.\n\nComedy Central\n\nSouth Park announced a five-year, $1.5 billion deal with Paramount last July, just prior to the merger with Skydance. The show has since skewered Donald Trump and those in his administration regularly.\n\nAvatar Studios\n\nIn December, Paramount+ announced it would be the exclusive streamer of Avatar Studios content, including animated film The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender and series Avatar: Seven Havens.\n\nA Bunch of Cable Channels and Networks\n\nThe Food Network, HGTV, Discovery, TLC, OWN, Adult Swim, Showtime, TNT, and TBS are all part of WBD.\n\nOther Key Franchises\n\nOther notable titles that are or would be controlled by the Ellisons, pending the WBD takeover, include: The Lord of the Rings franchise, the Mission Impossible franchise, and the distribution rights to Dune: Part Three.\n\n2/27/26, 2:34 PM EDT: WIRED updated details about Paramount Skydance's deal with Warner Bros. Discovery."

            "content": "Sick of your smart ring's battery not holding up? Ultrahuman's new $479 Ring Pro smart ring, unveiled on Friday, offers up to 15 days of battery life on a single charge. The Ring Pro joins the company's $349 Ring Air, which boosts health tracking, thanks to longer battery life, increased data storage, improved speed and accuracy and a new heart-rate sensing architecture. The ring works in conjunction with the latest Pro charging case.\n\nUltrahuman also launched its Jade AI, which can act as an agent based on analysis of current and historical health data. Jade can synthesize data from across the company's products and is compatible with its Rings.\n\n\"With industry-leading hardware paired with Jade biointelligence AI, users can now take real-time actionable interventions towards their health than ever before,\" said Mohit Kumar, CEO of Ultrahuman.\n\nNo US sales\n\nThat hardware isn't available in the US, though, thanks to the ongoing ban on Ultrahuman's Rings sales here, stemming from a patent dispute with its competitor, Oura Ring. It's available for preorder now everywhere else and is slated to ship in March. Jade's available globally.\n\nUltrahuman says the Ring Pro boosts battery life to about 15 days in Chill mode -- up to 12 days in Turbo -- compared to a maximum of six days for the Air. The Pro charger's battery stores enough for another 45 days, which you top off with Qi-compatible wireless charging. In addition, the case incorporates locator technology via the app and a speaker, as well as usability features such as haptic notifications and a power LED.\n\nThe ring can also retain up to 250 days of data versus less than a week for the cheaper model. Ultrahuman redesigned the heart-rate sensor for better signal quality. An upgraded processor improves the accuracy of the local machine learning and overall speed.\n\nIt's offered in gold, silver, black and titanium finishes, with available sizes ranging from 5 to 14.\n\nJade's Deep Research Mode is the cross-ecosystem analysis feature, which aggregates data from Ring and Blood Vision and the company's subscription services, Home and M1 CGM, to provide historical trends, offer current recommendations and flag potential issues, as well as trigger activities such as A-fib detection. Ultrahuman plans to expand its capabilities to include health-adjacent activities, such as ordering food.\n\nSome new apps are also available for the company's PowerPlug add-on platform, including capabilities such as tracking GLP-1 effects, snoring and respiratory analysis and migraine management tools."

            "content": "Strength\n\nReading glasses typically range from +0.25 to +2.50 diopters (the unit of measurement for eye prescriptions), though the average starting strength is usually around +0.75. In rare cases, reading glass strength can go up to +4.00.\n\n“Tips for buying reading glasses online are similar to buying ready-made reading glasses at the drugstore: It’s a convenient option but it’s not a good idea for everyone,” says Dr. Ravi Goel, clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. “If you have different prescription needs in each eye, astigmatism, high-power or more complex prescription needs, you should see an eye care professional for updated prescription eyewear.”\n\nReed seconds this, adding, “The wrong prescription can lead to headaches, eye strain or even nausea. If you do choose to buy online, we recommend selecting a lower power when deciding between two strengths, as this is generally a safer choice, and overly strong lenses tend to cause more discomfort than those that are slightly weaker.”\n\nGoel notes that everyone older than 40 should see an ophthalmologist for a medical eye exam because that is the age when presbyopia and potentially blinding eye diseases usually begin developing. Plus, not all eye diseases begin with noticeable symptoms.\n\nType of reading glasses\n\n“There are four main types of reading glasses: single vision, bifocal, trifocal and progressive,” says Goel, defining them as:\n\nSingle-vision reading lenses are typically designed to correct just for near vision.\n\nare typically designed to correct just for near vision. Bifocal lenses have a correction for reading on the bottom half of the lens and another for distance on the top.\n\nhave a correction for reading on the bottom half of the lens and another for distance on the top. Trifocal lenses have three sections: distance, intermediate and near vision. Reed says these can be particularly helpful for people over 50 experiencing reduced depth of focus.\n\nhave three sections: distance, intermediate and near vision. Reed says these can be particularly helpful for people over 50 experiencing reduced depth of focus. Progressive lenses have a smooth transition between distance and near focal areas without visible dividing lines. “They deliver a more natural look and a smoother transition between different viewing distances,” adds Reed.\n\n“When generic OTC readers are no longer enough, prescription reading glasses -- also called single-vision readers -- are a great next step. These are custom-made by an eye doctor to correct for astigmatism, unequal prescriptions or other specific vision needs,” says Reed. “For those who need multiple levels of vision correction, there are multifocal lenses.”\n\nThe best lens material\n\n“This depends on lifestyle,” Goel says. “For example, if you spend a lot of time outdoors, you might prefer polycarbonate, which is lightweight and doesn’t break easily. There are also various lens coatings available for convenience (i.e., anti-reflective coatings) but are not required.”\n\nGoel notes that the American Academy of Ophthalmology doesn't recommend blue light-blocking coatings or lenses because “there is no scientific evidence to suggest blue light-blocking glasses help reduce eye strain.” Instead, take breaks from near-work activity and use eye drops if necessary. If you continue to experience symptoms, see an ophthalmologist.\n\nAccording to Reed, most people choose among the following three lens materials for reading glasses:\n\nCR-39 plastic lenses: Affordable, lightweight and provide good optical clarity, making them a popular choice for basic reading glasses.\n\nAffordable, lightweight and provide good optical clarity, making them a popular choice for basic reading glasses. Polycarbonate lenses : Lighter and significantly more impact-resistant than CR-39 plastic, making them a safer option for people who tend to drop their glasses or want something more durable.\n\n: Lighter and significantly more impact-resistant than CR-39 plastic, making them a safer option for people who tend to drop their glasses or want something more durable. High-index plastic lenses: Thinner and lighter than other materials and are a good choice for people who need a stronger prescription but want to avoid thick, heavy lenses.\n\n“For most reading glasses, especially for occasional or indoor use, CR-39 plastic works well,” says Reed. “If you need extra durability or prefer thinner, lighter lenses, polycarbonate or high-index materials may be a better fit. Your doctor of optometry can help recommend the best lens material based on your specific needs.”\n\nReed adds that not all lens materials and coatings are created equal. That’s why it’s important to check with your eye doctor to ensure the reading glasses you choose are the right fit for you.\n\nStyle\n\nOne of the most fun parts of buying glasses is finding a frame that speaks to your personal style and fits with your face shape. When shopping for glasses online, pay attention to the material, color and width.\n\nPrice\n\nReading glasses can range from affordable to expensive. For instance, if you want a designer pair of reading glasses, be prepared to spend over $100. If you tend to lose your reading glasses, you may want to buy more inexpensive pairs to keep multiple on hand.\n\n“Price of eyeglasses is not necessarily reflective of quality; the real question is if someone finds the ready-made reading glasses helpful or if they need custom reading glasses to meet their vision needs,” explains Goel.\n\n“In general, spending more on frames doesn’t mean you’ll end up with better-quality eyeglasses. You don’t need designer frames to have a good set of glasses. For prescription lenses, such as bifocal, trifocal or progressive lenses, an optician will help you select good lenses that best meet your vision needs. A personalized evaluation of vision needs is a value-add that is often missed by online sellers.”\n\nAdditional coatings\n\nYou can get reading glasses with lenses treated with blue light, anti-glare and polarization coatings. But note that you'll likely have to pay extra for these.\n\nShipping and returns\n\nIf you buy your reading glasses online, you likely won’t get to try them on before you buy. As a result, ensure the company has a return and exchange policy you can work with. As for shipping, if you need your reading glasses ASAP, you’re better off going with a company that offers express or overnight shipping."

            "content": "Two of the largest internet providers in the US are set to merge, as the FCC announced its approval of Charter’s $34.5 billion acquisition of Cox Communications Friday afternoon.\n\nCharter, which sells phone, internet and TV services under the Spectrum brand, agreed to buy Cox in May 2025. The deal will create the largest internet provider in the country, with Cox’s 6.5 million customers joining Charter’s 31 million.\n\nWhile internet monopolies are a major problem in the US -- over a third of Americans only have access to one or no internet provider -- this acquisition won’t necessarily make that problem worse. That’s because Charter and Cox have very little overlap in the areas where they operate.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\n“No consumer is going to lose a competitive offering they currently have,” Blair Levin, a former FCC chief of staff and a telecom industry analyst at New Street Research, told CNET. “There's no reduction of competition in any relevant geographical product market.”\n\nThe FCC’s announcement doesn’t specify when Cox customers will transfer to Spectrum, but it could be a welcome change for many. Cox received a score of 68/100 in the most recent American Customer Satisfaction Index survey, while Spectrum earned a 71/100.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nHowever, a CNET analysis of internet plans found Spectrum’s price hikes to be steeper, with Spectrum increasing prices by an average of $37 monthly after one or two years, depending on the location. Cox’s plans increased by $28 per month, but only after two years.\n\nSome critics argued that the FCC should have done more to help consumers before granting Charter approval.\n\n“The FCC approved the largest cable merger in nearly a decade and did not require Charter to do anything it wasn’t already planning to do,” John Bergmayer, legal director at the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said in a statement. “Consumers, as always, will bear the costs of reduced competition.”\n\nAs part of the approval process, Charter agreed to move all of Cox’s offshore jobs to America within 18 months. According to a post on its website, Charter says it has a 100% US-based workforce as of Dec. 31, 2025."

As revealed on Thursday by the company's chief digital officer in an interview with The Verge, the fast-food chain is adding Patty, an AI chatbot, to the headsets some of its employees wear as part of a 500-location pilot later this year.\n\nThe Patty chatbot will assist with work tasks but will also monitor manners, ensuring employees use phrases such as \"please\" and \"thank you\" in customer interactions.\n\n\"This is meant to be a coaching tool,\" Burger King's Thibault Roux told The Verge.\n\nPatty, not to be mistaken for the Krabby Patty burger from SpongeBob SquarePants, will also perform tasks such as alerting the inventory management system when an item is out of stock. Patty is part of a larger AI-driven system called BK Assistant that will be in all Burger King restaurants by the end of the year.\n\nWhile Burger King will be using AI in headsets, Roux said it's not quite ready to use the technology for taking orders yet, although other fast-food chains have tried. While AI seems to be taking over entire industries, businesses such as Taco Bell have found that rolling out AI to hungry customers is a lot harder than it sounds.

Testing five smartwatches for accuracy looked to me more like a few leisurely jogs, rocking what looked like the entire smartwatch section of Best Buy stacked on my wrists. I've tested dozens of smartwatches over the years, but never five at once, and never under the level of scrutiny this test demanded. Mile after mile, I pushed my heart rate (and my body) well beyond my comfort zone with the finish line in focus.\n\nFitness trackers have come a long way since the early Fitbit days of step counting, and in today's wearable landscape, a reliable step counter isn't enough. Smartwatches, rings, fitness bands and even earbuds compete for real estate on your body to monitor everything from heart rate to temperature. To edge out the competition, they must be accurate enough to catch subtle changes in your vitals and turn that data into results.\n\nI tested five models (one at a time), ranging from $80 to $550, to determine which was most accurate for steps, distance and heart rate. Heart rate, in particular, is the most critical (and the hardest to get right) since so many other metrics depend on it.\n\nFrom left to right: Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, Google Pixel Watch 4, Amazfit Bip 6, Garmin Venu 4 and Apple Watch Series 11, alongside the Polar H10 chest strap and tally counter used in our accuracy tests. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nIt's not like I was starting from scratch. I'd already reviewed the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, Google Pixel Watch 4, Garmin Venu 4, Apple Watch Series 11 and Amazfit Bip 6, and each had proven itself in its category. There's a reason they landed on our best lists. But glancing at a workout summary and dissecting raw data are entirely different beasts.\n\nAfter two months and more than 30 miles of testing, I'm finally ready to share the results (and give my legs a rest). The biggest takeaway: All five watches performed well in real-world testing. None deviated by more than a few percentage points from the control when measuring steps and distance.\n\nHeart rate accuracy proved to be the biggest differentiator. On the surface, the watches looked similar: average and maximum heart rates were often only a few beats apart. But the gaps became clear in the second-by-second data. While most stayed within 8% of our control, the Apple Watch Series 11 remained within 1% of the Polar H10 chest strap, which served as our control, earning it the CNET Labs Award for most accurate heart rate tracking.\n\nThe Garmin Venu 4 came in second, recording heart rate every second compared to every 5 seconds on the Apple Watch. For most people, that level of granularity is overkill, but for serious athletes who depend on second-by-second feedback, it could be the deciding factor.\n\nHeart rate: electrodes vs. optical sensors\n\nHeart rate is one of the most important vitals your smartwatch tracks because it feeds into so many other metrics, like calories burned, intensity, heart rate variability (a measure of the variation in time between heartbeats), and VO2 max (the maximum amount of oxygen your body uses during exercise). As a casual fitness enthusiast, I regularly use live heart rate data from my watch to make runs and strength training workouts more intense.\n\nMost smartwatches, including the five we tested, take background heart rate readings at intervals throughout the day. However, they increase sampling frequency during exercise. Even a short workout can generate hundreds more data points than passive tracking alone.\n\nWe used the Polar H10 chest strap as our control during the heart rate tests. Giselle Castro-Sloboda/CNET\n\nCNET's heart rate test\n\nTo capture a broad range of heart rate data, I tested each watch individually across three separate 1-mile runs on a flat track. I held a moderate intensity for the first half of the run (roughly Zones 3 to 4), then went all out for the second half, pushing myself as close to my peak (Zone 5) as possible.\n\nI cleaned the sensors and secured each watch snugly (about one to two fingers below the wrist bone) before each run. Each watch was tested one at a time alongside a Polar H10 chest strap, CNET's top-rated consumer heart rate monitor. Unlike wrist-based optical sensors, which detect changes in blood flow using light, chest straps like Polar's use electrodes to directly measure the heart's electrical signals. Because of this method and proximity to the heart, chest straps are widely considered more precise than wrist-based devices. Matching that level of precision isn't realistic for a watch, but they're coming close.\n\nDuring testing, I noticed a consistent pattern: most watches lagged behind the chest strap during the first minute of a run, when heart rate rose rapidly from rest. Once I reached cruising altitude (Zones 3 and 4), the readings aligned more closely. But when I pushed into Zone 5, differences reappeared, with some watches struggling to keep up during spikes above 160 beats per minute. The Bip 6, for example, never registered my peak heart rate. That lag helps explain why workout summaries often look similar. Average and peak heart rate were just a few beats away from the chest strap, while the second-by-second analysis revealed significantly wider gaps.\n\nBecause raw, second-by-second heart rate data isn't easily accessible in most apps and can include thousands of data points, I teamed up with CNET Senior Lab Engineer Gianmarco Chumbe to interpret and map the results. The graph above shows just how close the Apple Watch Series 11 was to the Polar chest strap, with an error rate of less than 1% (an average of 1.4 bpm for the three tests). In our results, it tracked almost side-by-side throughout the run, even at the outer edges of the graph where the other watches struggled. This consistency earned it our Labs Award for most accurate heart rate tracking. There is, however, an important nuance.\n\nThe Apple Watch data we extracted (via the HealthFit app pulling from Apple Health) sampled heart rate roughly every five seconds. By comparison, the Polar chest strap and Garmin Venu 4 recorded data nearly every second. Of the data points we could compare, the Apple Watch was closest to the chest strap, but it had fewer data points. The Venu 4 matched the chest strap's sampling frequency, but with a slightly higher error rate of 3.89% (5.5 bpm). Those extra seconds of data could help guide training decisions and, over time, mean the difference between finishing strong and setting a new personal record.\n\nAll of the watches posted heart rate error rates below 8%, which is impressive -- especially at higher-intensity levels. It's worth noting these were short workouts (8-9 minutes per run). Because the Google Pixel Watch (5.6% error rate) and Samsung Galaxy Watch (6.6%) tended to catch up to the chest strap over time, longer runs would likely narrow some of those gaps. The Amazfit posted a similar overall error rate (7%), but struggled to capture the highest heart rate spikes. That limitation makes it less ideal for prioritizing heart rate precision for intense workouts.\n\nAfter over 30 miles of testing, I'm more convinced than ever that heart rate accuracy really does impact training. Over six weeks, my VO2 max climbed from 41.3 to 45.8, according to Apple Health. I haven't reached that level since before my third pregnancy three years ago. Without the watches and chest strap as a guide, I might not have recognized what \"pushing myself\" actually felt like in the moment.\n\nCNET distance test\n\nMeasuring distance proved significantly easier, both physically and technically. Distance accuracy matters because it also feeds into other metrics, such as pace, calories burned and training load (the duration and intensity of exercise over a specific period of time).\n\nThe most reliable way to test distance was on a route with precise measurements and minimal elevation change. (Credit goes to Gianmarco for suggesting a track test.) Most high school and college tracks are built to official specifications: 400 meters per lap. I found an old college track near my house that had been paved over, but remained within regulation length. I even broke out a measuring wheel to be sure. I ran every single test on this track, reliving high school mile day 30 times over, but with more knee pain.\n\nThis is the track as shown in the Polar H10 chest strap app (summary view, not raw data). Vanessa Hand Orellana/Polar/CNET\n\nWhile GPS is a major factor in outdoor tracking, distance is also calculated using accelerometer and motion sensor data. To control for variables, I put the watch's paired phone on airplane mode before each run to prevent it from using GPS. I photographed each watch display after every lap (400m increments) to capture a data point, repeating the process four times (1,600m is a little more than 1 mile).\n\nAll five watches were within a tenth of the actual distance, which is an impressively tight spread. The Apple Watch again led the pack, measuring my runs at 0.99 miles for all three tests. The runner-up was the Garmin Venu 4, which averaged 0.96 miles per test (only 0.03 miles behind the Apple Watch).\n\nAccurate distance tracking isn't reserved for premium price tags. The $80 Amazfit Bip 6 averaged 0.95 miles per test, proving it is more than capable for casual walkers or joggers looking to log miles.\n\nCNET's step test\n\nOnce considered the holy grail of fitness tracking, step count has slid down the metric hierarchy as more advanced health markers have taken center stage. And while the 10,000-step goal is somewhat arbitrary, it set a target and got people moving.\n\nToday, we know it's less important to hit a specific step count and more about walking and your progress over time. Steps remain an accessible starting point for many people, and accuracy is important. \"Extra credit\" from a faulty tracker can lull people into a false sense of accomplishment. And if a device can't nail the basics, it raises questions about the rest of its metrics.\n\nWhile pedometers were once considered the gold standard in this category, a $10 model today is likely less precise than the smartwatches on this list. Traditional pedometers use a simple mechanical switch triggered by hip movement, while most modern smartwatches use accelerometers and motion sensors to detect and measure movement in multiple directions.\n\nThis (photos) is how I'd keep tabs of the steps out in the field: smartwatch on the left and clicker (tally counter) in my right hand. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nTo test accuracy, I went old-school and counted every single step myself with a manual tally counter (like what you use for baseball). I also used StepsApp, a pedometer app on my phone, as a backup. I started with 1,000 steps for each watch on a flat path. I didn't use the track, but didn't follow the exact same route for every test, which may introduce minor variance.\n\nThe results were impressively tight; all within about 10 steps of the clicker. The Galaxy Watch 8's results (18 steps off) were the exception, but I suspected it might be a fluke. So I re-tested and raised the stakes; this time, walking 2,500 steps with each watch. The results were nearly identical. None deviated by more than 11 steps, or less than half of a percentage point.\n\nThe differences were negligible, so all of the watches were winners in this category, proving that you don't have to splurge for accuracy. That Amazfit Bip 6 is looking pretty fantastic right now.\n\nTwists, turns and variables to consider when tracking workouts\n\nEven with the best intentions, 30 miles of testing and a data scientist in my corner, there is no way to eliminate every variable in real-world conditions. These results aren't gospel. They're rigorous, repeated and carefully averaged, but they're still human, and your mileage may vary (pun intended).\n\nIt took more than 30 miles of testing before I felt comfortable putting results down on paper because I kept encountering variables, especially for heart rate.\n\nThe testing order was significant. The first watch in any session was always at a disadvantage because my heart rate started lower and spiked more dramatically. By the second and third runs -- even with deliberate rest periods to bring my heart rate back down -- the jump wasn't as sharp. Your body doesn't fully reset that quickly.\n\nTo mitigate this, I rotated the starting watch for each session. I limited each outing to three runs (three miles total), making sure that every device had a chance to be tested first, middle and last. Our Labs data and results (on the charts in the story) are averages of the error rates across these three tests.\n\nFit and sensor interference were other issues. My jacket sleeve occasionally moved the watch; warmer days meant more sweat by mile three, which can interfere with optical readings, and then there was the time I almost cut off my circulation from wearing the Galaxy Watch too tightly.\n\nThe data extraction nightmare\n\nThis is just a snapshot of the layers of folders and raw data we had to comb through to compare heart rate. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nThen came the data. Polar's raw heart rate data can be downloaded as a .CSV file (spreadsheet) ready for analysis.\n\nGarmin's is almost as easy, as long as you have a data analyst and Reddit thread on hand. It can export workout-specific heart rate data as a .TCX file, which was foreign to me. Gianmarco wrote custom code, based on info he found on Reddit, to extract and convert the data into a format that matched Polar's output. Amazfit required a similar conversion process.\n\nApple, Google and Samsung made us work for it. All three require exporting your entire health archive (and I mean everything, not just workouts or heart rate). For me, this meant downloading more than a decade of health data. Once extracted, the compressed file opens into a maze of nested folders with cryptic labels. The best strategy is to sort by date and hope that one of the files mentions heart rate.\n\nFor Google, I got lucky and found the right file after what felt like hours of searching. For Apple, several third-party apps are available that can do the sorting for you. I downloaded the $6 HealthFit app, which filters and extracts data directly from the Health app. However, the sampling frequency wasn't as dense as the Polar strap, leaving fewer data points for comparison. It's hard to say whether it would've been any different if I'd been able to extract it directly from the Health app.\n\nWith Samsung, the only workable option was to use the Strava app as a middleman. I started workouts in the Strava watch app and exporting the data to the desktop version. All of this took two people many hours across multiple days to figure out. Accessing your own health data shouldn't be this hard.\n\nThe paved college track at sunset where I completed all distance and heart rate testing. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nSmartwatch accuracy bottom line\n\nIf heart rate accuracy is your top priority, the $400 Apple Watch Series 11 is what to buy. It was the all-around winner, consistently strong across every category and the most precise for heart rate, staying within 1% of the chest strap during runs.\n\nBut the bigger takeaway after 30 miles of testing is that you can't go wrong with any of these watches; it just depends on what you value most.\n\nThe $550 Garmin Venu 4 may be better suited for data nerds and serious athletes. It's Gianmarco's pick: \"The combination of high fidelity and clean export access makes it especially appealing for users like me, who want full visibility into their training data.\"\n\nIt's also the best option for Android phone owners wanting elite-level heart rate tracking.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 8 (both $350) are reliable for steps, distance and overall heart rate trends. You may not get the same second-by-second precision during intervals, but for everyday workouts, they're more than capable. And the Amazfit Bip 6 is the reminder that accurate distance tracking doesn't have to be expensive. For beginners looking to build a baseline without a major investment, it's better than its $80 price suggests."
