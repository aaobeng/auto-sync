The Arsenal loanee has found himself on the periphery in recent weeks following a turbulent spell at the club.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNwaneri scored on his Marseille debut against Lens the day after completing his switch during the January transfer window. The 18-year-old struck after only 13 minutes in a 3-1 victory for his new side, leading many supporters to expect the Arsenal prospect would continue to flourish under manager Roberto De Zerbi.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, shortly after his standout display, Nwaneri was substituted at the half-time interval on two occasions. The Marseille boss insisted he was trying to protect the teenager, only for the manager to depart the club following a 5-0 hammering by PSG in early February.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA caretaker boss temporarily took charge before ex-Rennes manager Habib Beye was appointed De Zerbi's permanent replacement. Since Nwaneri's debut, the club have secured just one victory from their last six matches and Marseille's decline has led to a diminished role for the Arsenal youngster.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\nThe 18-year-old remained on the bench throughout the first match following De Zerbi's exit, while new manager Beye introduced him for 20 minutes during a defeat to Brest. Journalist Fabrice Lamperti covers Marseille for La Provence and feels frustrated that Nwaneri has faced such struggles after immediately impressing his new team-mates.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nInside Arsenal's academy refocus to chase profits made by Chelsea and Man City READ MORE :\n\nViktor Gyokeres set to trigger Arsenal contract clause after Tottenham brace READ MORE :\n\n\"They were blown away by his performance against Lens,\" he told football.london. \"Afterwards, the crisis hit everyone and Nwaneri can no longer showcase his footballing ability or talent. A real shame.\"\n\nThe Arsenal loanee started four successive games under De Zerbi, though he was substituted at half-time on two occasions, including during the loss to PSG. It has been a sharp learning curve for Nwaneri, who was quickly inserted into the Marseille side after battling for game time with Arsenal, only to find himself returned to the substitutes' bench.\n\n\"After Lens, everyone was enthusiastic,\" Lamperti recalled. \"OM still had ambitious goals ahead and Nwaneri could help the club achieve them. But then everything fell apart.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Nwaneri will hope to work his way back into the Marseille team (Image: Xavier Laine/Getty Images)\n\nFOLLOW OUR ARSENAL FB PAGE! Latest Gunners news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n\"Nwaneri had a poor game against PSG and everyone realised how much work he still had to do. It's not easy for him, having gone from being a substitute most of the time at Arsenal to an undisputed starter at OM. That's hard to grasp when you're so young.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"In Marseille, expectations are very high and poor performances are rarely forgiven, especially when they come in quick succession. Right now, everyone is left wanting more... but the season isn't over yet.\"\n\nDespite encountering numerous challenges during his first month at the club, Nwaneri has shown flashes of his potential in a Marseille jersey. Based on the midfielder's performances so far, Lamperti suggests that Nwaneri's early difficulties could ultimately improve his game.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"His main strength is his dribbling, his ability to beat opponents,\" Lamperti explained. \"He also has an excellent left foot and isn't afraid to try things even after missing earlier opportunities. He seems to have great confidence in himself and his football.\n\n\"I think he can improve his decision-making: knowing when to pass or attempt a dribble and not getting stuck in a pre-prepared pattern. He also needs to become mentally stronger. In Marseille, he's certainly got what he needs!\"\n\nNwaneri will be eager to impress new manager Beye as he quickly did with the rest of the Marseille team. He will be competing for a starting spot as the club prepare to host Lyon on Sunday.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Salah is back in the Liverpool team following a huge falling out with the manager in December, but his performances and contract status make a summer exit probable.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA lot of water has passed beneath the bridge since Salah said Slot had \"thrown me under the bus\" and that \"there is no relationship\" between the pair. They have since patched up their relationship and Salah is a regular fixture on the right wing for Liverpool once again.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, things are not completely settled, despite Salah being under contract with the Reds until June 2027. Transfer interest from Saudi Arabia has been a constant around the Egyptian star, while a move to MLS has also been mooted as a possibility this summer.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSalah has seven goals and eight assists in 28 games across all competitions - a far cry from his lofty standards - and has gone nine Premier League games without scoring. BBC Sport says that his exit is now 'increasingly likely', in part because Liverpool don't want to lose him for nothing at the end of his contract.\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE!

Saudi clubs Al-Hilal, Al-Qadisah and Neom have all shown an interest in signing Salah and a league source said in January that a move is 'inevitable', given the factors at play.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSlot defended Salah's dip in form in his press conference before Liverpool's Premier League game against West Ham. \"He set his own standards and those are so, so, so high that the moment when he doesn’t score for a few games, people are immediately surprised. So that is only something that’s probably the biggest compliment he can get,\" he said on Friday.\n\n\"We are used to Mo scoring a lot of goals and that’s at this moment of time maybe the biggest difference in his performances or in his game time.

But I also know that in the end, he always starts scoring again.\n\n\"And that’s the challenge he has now and we have now – to make sure he starts scoring again. Because he’s not our only attacker that at this moment of time doesn’t score as much as we are used to of our attackers.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"So, it’s not only the focus he deserved that is totally on him because of everything he did for the club, but Hugo [Ekitike] and Cody [Gakpo] haven’t scored that many goals recently as well.

The former Manchester United midfielder's influence has been felt far and wide, with his decision to spread his wings and move to Los Angeles proving a factor.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBeckham joined Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy in 2007 after a spell with Real Madrid. During a five-year MLS spell, he rubbed shoulders with some huge names from Hollywood as well as sporting legends from the 'big four' sports Stateside.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOne of those sports stars was Wayne Gretzky, an iconic figure in ice hockey and a Los Angeles Kings legend. The Canadian had never been hugely into his football - the European kind, that is - but that didn't stop Beckham from making a big impact when the pair met.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGetting the opportunity to watch Beckham play was only part of it, though.

He was involved in the draw for World Cup 2026 where his home country, Canada, will co-host with Mexico and the United States.\n\nJesse Marsch's Canadian side have been drawn in a group with Qatar, Switzerland and the winner of the European play-off involving Italy, Northern Ireland, Bosnia & Herzegovina and Wales.

A midfield rebuild is anticipated at Old Trafford with Casemiro departing at season's end and Manuel Ugarte's long-term prospects unclear.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBrighton's Carlos Baleba, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton feature amongst those being monitored. Tonali, 25, also appears on that list having impressed over nearly three years at Newcastle.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Italy international's St James' Park deal runs until summer 2029, with an option for a further 12 months. Yet the Magpies' underwhelming league form - languishing in 11th position - has fuelled conjecture about Tonali's future and whether it truly lies in the North East.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe midfielder is consistently referenced amongst the elite in his role throughout the division, with Scholes previously declaring he outshines Arsenal's Declan Rice. Whilst praising Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister, Scholes selected Tonali when questioned about the league's premier midfielder.\n\n\"I love Sandro Tonali as well,\" the United icon remarked on Sky Bet's The Overlap earlier this season. \"He's been brilliant. Very good. I would probably choose Tonali at this point.\" When questioned further on his selection, Scholes continued: \"Yes, you're going to say Declan Rice, but I think he's better than Rice.\n\nMarcus Rashford transfer 'confirmed' as Man Utd star finally reaches agreement READ MORE :\n\nEight players could miss Man Utd vs Crystal Palace as Michael Carrick left 'disappointed' READ MORE :\n\n\"I really like Rice, don't get me wrong, I think he's got everything.

I prefer Tonali but they're both good players.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThroughout the January transfer window, Tonali's representative Giuseppe Riso is understood to have held discussions with Arsenal regarding a potential transfer and acknowledged that his client's future remains undecided.\n\nView 2 Images Sandro Tonali's future at Newcastle United is uncertain (Image: Newcastle United via Getty Image)\n\nRiso explained: \"Newcastle are having a hard time letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League.

It's not always just about the money. If you perform well, the rest will follow naturally. I'm young. I need game time to enhance my sporting value, to progress. And that wouldn't happen from the bench.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFast forward nearly two years since making this decision and Diomande is now hot property. A slew of reports suggest numerous top European clubs will be vying for his signature come summer.\n\nLiverpool are among those rumoured suitors and Diomande addressed such speculation. He said: \"People made it [Liverpool] out to be my dream club.\n\nView 3 Images The teenager has impressed in the Bundesliga (Image: Getty)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"But primarily, it's my dad's favourite team. His ultimate wish has always been to see me play there one day because he adores the atmosphere at Anfield. He would constantly sing praises of Steven Gerrard. I was too young to watch him play. We didn't even have a telly at home for a long whilst. I hold a great deal of respect for Liverpool, but my dream club at present is Leipzig.\"\n\nBayern Munich are another side reportedly in contention. Diomande added: \"I haven't had a conversation with anyone from Bayern. The timing isn't right for that. I'm content here in Leipzig and want to stay fully focused.\n\n\"There are always numerous parties involved in a transfer – clubs, agents, family, players. So, I don't make these decisions on my own. One thing I can assure: I'll never fall out with my club! Of course, I likely won't conclude my career here. When the moment arrives, we'll discuss. But if I remain here this summer, I'll be absolutely chuffed.\"\n\nArticle continues below"

Last February, United were linked with emerging talent Geovany Quenda after Ruben Amorim's switch to the Premier League in November 2024.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nReports at the time suggested United had 'verbally agreed' personal terms with the youngster ahead of the summer window. Sporting were understood to have valued the forward at £50m, with Manchester City and Liverpool also reportedly monitoring his situation.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOver the past two seasons, Quenda has registered 24 goal contributions in 66 outings for the Portuguese outfit. His form attracted widespread attention.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Speaking about the national side, he said: \"He will probably steal my place. At 17, I wasn't even playing for Benfica's youth team.\"\n\nMan Utd and Premier League clubs sent warning by UEFA after financial results revealed READ MORE :\n\nMan Utd star Senne Lammens reveals secret to success under Michael Carrick READ MORE :\n\nAmorim was equally impressed by the young forward after handing him his debut at his former club. During his time at Sporting, the 41-year-old said: \"[He's] very physically robust, very focused, with his feet firmly on the ground. That's very important for a young player.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"He got his chance and there was no chance to take it away, no doubt, nothing. I think he's going to be a great player, but let's give it time.\"\n\nA year later and Amorim has since been shown the door at United. The head coach endured a turbulent 14 months at the helm at Old Trafford, suffering defeat in the Europa League final to Tottenham while setting some deeply unwanted records.\n\nView 2 Images Quenda was man in demand (Image: Gualter Fatia, Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Quenda remains at Sporting under Rui Borges, but he has already secured his switch to the Premier League. Just a month after the speculation linking him to United, the teenager agreed a pre-emptive deal to join Chelsea in the summer of 2026, signing a seven-year contract.\n\nWith a transfer fee worth up to £40m, the Blues nipped in ahead of Amorim to land the highly-rated winger. Quenda is due to stay at Sporting throughout the 2025/26 campaign before linking up with Chelsea this summer — though an injury has altered his immediate situation.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!

It appears his future employers are keen to assist him in preparing for a comeback that could come as soon as next month.\n\nThe youngster sustained the injury back in December against Benfica, and is hopeful of returning to action for Sporting in time for their Champions League round of 16 fixtures."

Prior to Liam Rosenior's appointment as head coach last month, the Blues had spent well over £300million in the summer with several of their big-money signings yet to show a return on their investment.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe likes of Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens, Jorrel Hato and Alejandro Garnacho have failed to consistently perform in a side whose expenditure warrants a Premier League title charge, yet that is not the reality for the west London club.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite the substantial spending under Clearlake Capital's ownership, Chelsea remain some distance from reclaiming their position at the summit of English football. With Rosenior in the early stages of his reign, there's scope for the Blues to strengthen their squad through free agents.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHere, Mirror Football examines some of the club's most triumphant free transfers....\n\nThiago Silva\n\nThiago Silva was secured by Frank Lampard's side on a free transfer following his exit from Paris Saint-Germain. He signed a one-year deal in 2020 and stayed at the Bridge until 2024.\n\nThe Brazilian, who had collected titles with AC Milan and PSG but never the Champions League, claimed the prestigious trophy in his maiden campaign with the Blues. Silva accumulated 155 appearances for Chelsea and became the first defender since John Terry in 2006 to be crowned the club's Player of the Year in 2023.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe departed at the conclusion of his contract last summer to return to Fluminense before signing with Porto last December to enjoy a second stint with the Portuguese giants.\n\nDidier Drogba\n\nDidier Drogba, amongst Chelsea's greatest ever strikers, arrived from Marseille in 2004 and amassed 10 trophies, including the unforgettable 2012 Champions League triumph sealed with his iconic header and decisive penalty.\n\nView 4 Images Didier Drogba is a Chelsea icon (Image: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFollowing a short spell in China with Shanghai Shenhua, he transferred to Galatasaray where he helped secure the Super Lig title before making an emotional return to Stamford Bridge in 2014. The Ivorian penned a one-year contract and claimed his fourth Premier League crown under Jose Mourinho.\n\nGus Poyet\n\nAfter a seven-year stint at Real Zaragoza where he left the club as their longest-serving foreign player, Gus Poyet joined Chelsea as a free agent in 1997. The ex-midfielder had an injury-hit debut season as he tore his ACL but went on to become a reliable goalscorer for the next three years in west London.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAccruing a total of 49 goals in 145 games, Poyet enjoyed a trophy-laden stint at the Blues, winning the FA Cup, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, UEFA Super Cup and League Cup.\n\nSamuel Eto'o\n\nAnother legendary striker who arrived on a free was Samuel Eto'o in 2013. Having been amongst the select few players who joined Russian outfit Anzhi Makhachkala, the Cameroon star linked up with Mourinho again on a one-year agreement.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe signed after Chelsea's unsuccessful pursuit of Wayne Rooney, bringing with him a remarkable record of over 250 goals for the likes of Barcelona, Inter Milan and Mallorca. The forward found the net 12 times for the Blues, including a memorable hat-trick against Man United.\n\nWhile Chelsea never witnessed Eto'o at his absolute peak, his time at the club was certainly entertaining.\n\nRuud Gullit\n\nIn the 16 years Ruud Gullit was a professional footballer before his 1995 move to Chelsea on a free, the legendary Dutchman was part of one of the greatest club dynasties in sport during his time at AC Milan.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe 1987 Ballon d'Or winner may have been in the twilight years of his career while at Stamford Bridge but his consistent performances meant he finished runner-up to Eric Cantona for the Football Writers' Association (FWA) Footballer of the Year award in his debut season.\n\nView 4 Images Ruud Gullit was Chelsea's player/manager for two years (Image: Getty Images)\n\nGullit also became Chelsea's player/manager in his last two seasons at the club as he guided them to FA Cup glory in 1997 - their first major trophy in 26 years.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMichael Ballack\n\nMichael Ballack made the switch to Chelsea after his Bayern Munich contract expired, turning down approaches from Manchester United, Real Madrid, Inter Milan and AC Milan. His choice to join Stamford Bridge was swayed by Robert Huth and Jens Lehmann.\n\nView 4 Images Michael Ballack won five trophies at Chelsea (Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nHaving collected three Bundesliga titles with Bayern, the midfielder arrived to vie with Frank Lampard, Claude Makelele and Michael Essien for a place in Mourinho's midfield. Throughout his four-year spell in the capital, Ballack secured three FA Cups, a Premier League title and the League Cup, racking up over 160 appearances.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe departed Stamford Bridge in 2010 before calling time on his playing career in 2012.\n\nGianluca Vialli\n\nGianluca Vialli, who tragically passed away in 2023, enjoyed a glittering 16-year career in his homeland where he turned out for Cremonese, Sampdoria and Juventus. It was after Vialli's four-year stint in Turin that he opted to go abroad for the first time to join the Blues in 1996 on a free transfer.\n\nThe former forward spent the last three years of his career in west London and scored an impressive 40 goals in 88 games. He'd won 11 major honours before his move to the Premier League and added three more pieces of silverware at Stamford Bridge as he won the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.\n\nArticle continues below"

            "content": "The FIA has confirmed a mid-season rule change will be made following Formula 1's engine dispute, with a new test being introduced from June.\n\nThe build-up to the new 2026 season, which begins in Melbourne next weekend, has led to potential loopholes being exploited, with Mercedes in the spotlight after rival teams claimed they have found a way around engine compression ratio limits.\n\nAs part of F1's biggest regulation changes ever, the compression ratio limit has been lowered from 18.0 under the previous ruleset to 16.0, but measurements are currently only taken when the engine is not running at full temperature, with Mercedes being believed by teams to be exploiting this which could give them a competitive advantage.\n\nHowever, the FIA has announced a new test will take place from June 1 when the engine ambient temperature is at 130 degrees.\n\nSeven races are scheduled before the new test is introduced, with 17 rounds on the calendar from June onwards.\n\nThe FIA said \"some aspects of the amendments were concurrently approved unanimously by the Formula 1 power unit manufacturers\". F1's engine manufacturers are Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull-Ford, Audi and Honda.\n\n\"The modifications to the technical regulations follow the pre-season tests in Barcelona and Bahrain and extensive feedback received from drivers and teams,\" said the FIA.\n\n\"A significant effort has been invested in finding a solution to the topic of the compression ratio. This parameter, which was one of the key fundamental targets of these regulations in order to attract newcomers to the sport, is limited in the regulations to 16:1, measured in cold conditions.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports F1's David Croft takes a closer look at how F1 in 2026 will evolve as the sport begins a new era of recharge, featuring more electric power, new teams, and engine suppliers\n\n\"The FIA has worked to find a compromise solution which determines that the compression ratio will be controlled in both hot and cold conditions from June 1 2026, and subsequently only in the operating conditions (130deg C) from 2027 onwards.\n\n\"The regulations introduced for 2026 represent one of the biggest changes in recent memory. All parties acknowledge that with the introduction of such significant regulatory changes, there are collective learnings to be taken from pre-season testing and the initial rounds of the 2026 championship.\n\n\"Further evaluation and technical checks on energy management matters are ongoing.\"\n\nF1's governing body confirmed that from the new test \"any component, assembly, mechanism, or integrate arrangement of components that is designed or functions to in ratio in operating conditions beyond 16.0 is prohibited\".\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Hear from George Russell, Oscar Piastri and many more following the third and final day of the second testing in Bahrain\n\nWill this impact the pecking order?\n\nMercedes team principal Toto Wolff stated before F1's two pre-season tests in Bahrain that a change to the power-unit regulations could be \"quite damaging for the performance\".\n\nBut, during the final Bahrain test, Wolff softened his stance and said Mercedes would be \"pretty comfortable\" if a team protested their engine at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix - a scenario that now seems highly unlikely given a resolution appears to have been found.\n\nHe added: \"We said it all along that this looks like a storm in a teacup, the whole thing, and numbers were coming up that were… if these numbers would have been true, I absolutely understand why somebody would fight it, but eventually, it's not worth the fight.\n\n\"It doesn't change anything for us, whether we stay like this or whether we change to the new regulations, and that's been a process.\n\n\"But we also want to be good citizens in the sport because it doesn't make a big difference we then changed opinion.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff spoke out against Formula 1 bosses moving to close a loophole in the new engine rules\n\nIn January, when the engine saga was first reported, Red Bull engine chief Ben Hodgkinson said it was \"a lot of noise about nothing\" and had sided with Mercedes against the other three engine manufacturers - Ferrari, Audi and Honda.\n\nHowever, Aston Martin team principal Adrian Newey told Sky Sports News in February that \"everybody is aligned bar one manufacturer\". Newey did not name Mercedes, but the stance Wolff has taken suggests Red Bull had changed their stance.\n\nRed Bull team principal Laurent Mekies said: \"Sometimes it was felt that we were not so sure where Red Bull was standing. At least that's what I was reading, listening to you guys.\n\n\"The simple truth is that we don't really mind if the regs goes left or if the regs goes right.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Jenson Button unpacks life in Formula 1 by answering the 11 questions you have always wanted to ask an F1 world champion\n\nFIA single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis said \"I don't think this topic ever needed to get to the level of attention\" that it has over the off-season.\n\nHe said: \"I don't think that we are anywhere near the levels of performance that was stated, and certainly there was no cheat or anything like that, or no allegation of anybody being illegal.\n\n\"It is just a matter whether that was an intent of the regulation, and, as new regulations currently enforce, there will be this, but there will be other little topics that we will need to resolve going forward, and the approach will try to be even-handed.\n\n\"Each time that we follow something, I'm sure there will be people that are unhappy that we're not acting soon enough, and there will be people who are unhappy that we are not letting things by, and part of our job is to try to keep that on a on a sort of balanced way.\"\n\nBernie Collins on new engine test Sky Sports F1's Bernie Collins during Bahrain pre-season testing\n\n\n\n“It’s not the first time we have had this sort of thing in F1.\n\n\n\n“The suggestion is Mercedes have a different compression ratio in the engine, which compresses the gas more at a higher temperature, which gives them more power out of the engine.\n\n\n\n“We had this last year with front and rear wings where midway through the season we brought in an extra test to try and slow the leaders, at that stage McLaren, but they passed all the tests and nothing changes in the pecking order.\n\n\n\n“We don’t know the details of the test exactly, how thorough it will be, and whether it will make a change to the pecking order because we don’t even know what it is.\n\n\n\n“It’s a move to quieten the rumours that Mercedes have got an advantage over others in this area. Any change to regulations, particularly engine regulations, are a hard thing to change quickly because these engines are changed over years and years, so hopefully Mercedes, or other teams, don’t have any changes to make to comply with this regulation.”\n\nQualifying rule tweak announced and no mandatory Monaco pit stops\n\nAlso on Saturday, the FIA revealed Q3 will increase from 12 minutes to 13 minutes from this season.\n\nQualifying will still be scheduled for one hour as to compensate the minor change, the interval between Q2 and Q3 will be reduced from eight to seven minutes.\n\nNewcomers Cadillac join the F1 grid this year, so there will be 11 teams in the field, and it means the bottom six cars in Q1 and Q2 will be eliminated, rather than five.\n\nLast year's mandatory two pit stops at the Monaco Grand Prix has been shelved, so the race will have the same regulations as the other grand prix when it takes place at the later-than-usual date of June 7.\n\nThursday March 5\n\n3am: Drivers' Press Conference\n\n6am: Paddock Uncut\n\n9.45pm: F3 Practice\n\n10.55pm: F2 Practice\n\nFriday March 6\n\n1am: Australian GP Practice One (session starts at 1.30am)*\n\n2.55am: F3 Qualifying*\n\n3.30am: Team Bosses Press Conference\n\n3.50am: F2 Qualifying*\n\n4.35am: Australian GP Practice Two (session starts at 5am)*\n\n6.15am: The F1 Show*\n\nSaturday March 7\n\n0.10am: F3 Sprint*\n\n1.10am: Australian GP Practice Three (session starts at 1.30am)*\n\n3.05am: F2 Sprint*\n\n4.10am: Australian GP Qualifying build-up*\n\n5am: AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX QUALIFYING*\n\n7am: Ted's Qualifying Notebook*\n\n9.45pm: F3 Feature Race*\n\nSunday March 8\n\n12.20am: F2 Feature Race*\n\n2.30am: Australian GP build-up: Grand Prix Sunday*\n\n4am: THE AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX*\n\n6am: Australian GP reaction: Chequered Flag*\n\n7am: Ted's Notebook*\n\n7.55am: Australian GP race replay*\n\n10am: Australian GP highlights (also on Sky Showcase)*\n\n*Also on Sky Sports Main Event\n\nWatch every race of the 2026 Formula 1 season live on Sky Sports, starting with the Australian Grand Prix from March 6-8.

After seeing her ball plugged in a hazard off the green on the eighth hole and having to return to the fairway to hit her fifth shot, she sank a 20-foot putt for bogey to minimise the damage.\n\nKim finished with a 73 and is tied for sixth at eight under, three behind Green and Lee.\n\n\"Definitely, there are a lot of birdies to be made but it's very easy to make bogey,\" Green said. \"So I think just limiting as many of those as possible.\n\n\"I've been hitting the ball into the greens, so if I can continue to do that, and even though I'm playing with Minjee, we are good friends, I don't want to get too caught up in what her scores are.\"\n\nInstagram Instagram , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Like Usyk in boxing, Verhoeven is the dominant heavyweight in his sport.\n\nThe Dutchman has the longest winning streak ever in the Glory promotion. He has previously competed in MMA and professional boxing, winning his only fight in each sport by knockout.\n\nVerhoeven defended his heavyweight title last June and after that victory vacated his championship, leaving kickboxing with an outstanding record of 66 wins in 76 fights.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Speaking on the Toe2Toe podcast, trainer Gary Logan, Matty Harris and Julius Francis debate whether we can really compare eras of heavyweight fighters\n\nBut he will be hard pushed to defeat Oleksandr Usyk.

At cruiserweight he won the World Boxing Super Series while becoming the undisputed world champion at 200lbs.\n\nIn his heavyweight career he's beaten Anthony Joshua twice, Tyson Fury twice and Daniel Dubois twice, becoming the undisputed champion twice in that division too.\n\nLiam Harrison is a British legend from the world of kickboxing.

He's the best heavyweight on this planet and he's the best heavyweight of this era.

Guys like that who paved the way in kickboxing have been the GOATs [greatest of all time] in their generation, they deserve to get these sort of paydays and these sort of chances to showcase what they can do and get some big money,\" he said. \"It'll be nice to see.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player A look back at some of Liam Harrison's big hits during his ONE career\n\nBoxing promoter Frank Warren represents both Fabio Wardley, who was Usyk's previous mandatory challenger, and Agit Kabayel, who will be Usyk's mandatory for the WBC belt.\n\nHe was, however, expecting Usyk to take a 'crossover' bout like this fight with Verhoeven. \"All he's doing now he's looking at fights, what is the value for him of a fight. That's why he wants this,\" Warren told Sky Sports.\n\n\"He's probably looked at what AJ's done, what Tyson did when he fought [Francis] Ngannou and thinking he'll have some of that and they look at it sometimes as being an easier job.

With Celtic and Rangers locked on 55 titles apiece, there would be something very timely about the Gorgie Boys winning their first since 1960 and fifth of all time.

Let's hear it for Rob Edwards, he's turned around Wolves amazingly, I thought he was two pence short of a ten pence for going there and leaving Middlesbrough, but maybe I was wrong, and Wolves look a strong outfit now, so I'd suggest the bounce back to the Premier League will be immediately next season. lester48 28 February 2026 8:40am View image in fullscreen A happy Rob Edwards.

Imagine if all six English sides made it? It’s not unfeasible. PSG have not hit the levels they scaled last season so Chelsea have a chance. Barcelona are good on their day but St James’s Park could be a real cauldron for Newcastle in that home leg, while Spurs are a different prospect entirely in Europe compared to the Premier League.

A home win at Signal Iduna Park, however, could spice things up, though whether Dortmund will be weather-beaten by their Champions League collapse against Atalanta remains to be seen.

Villa have now firmly been dragged into the battle for Champions League qualification with Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea. Unai Emery was in phlegmatic mood after the defeat, though. He said: “In September I was worried and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. In December I was so happy and excited to get the top-five position and achieve the Champions League. “One month ago I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League. Now we are in the average to be in the top five. “Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, they are trying to get to us, for them it is a priority to get into the Champions League.” Share Updated at 03.42 EST"

            "content": "There’s a good advert right now on the rolling TV sports news channels. It starts with a rush of beeps and plinks and flashing symbols, generating instantly the flat, glazed, hungry quality of the online casino. A well-groomed middle-aged woman is shown sitting in an armchair in a suburban living room. It’s a jarring tonal shift, but we’re still in that same space, betting graphics dancing around her head.\n\nThe middle-aged woman turns to the camera and says: “The games are all different … It never gets boring,” eyes gleaming strangely, hands gripping the struts of her chair. Here is a person who is not just pleased, but uncontrollably energised by the prospect of WowBet.com’s 10bn mildly divergent AI-generated gambling patterns. At this point the words “Sandra Frottwangle, funeral director” appear on the screen.\n\nBy now it’s just an overload of feelings. The first thought is about transgression. Sandra Frottwangle’s job is to curate death. She spends her days managing the nobility of human flesh. She stands at the far edge of existence creating ritual and comfort, a timeless figure, the eternal footman, the director of last things. But she also gets bored easily and prefers stuff with flashing lights.\n\nIs this OK? Would you want Sandra Frottwangle to direct your funeral? Death is repetitive. Mortality is tedious. What if she decides this is all really dull and needs more beeping noises, less weeping and organ music? The ferryman is at the door. He’s unsheathing his scythe. He’s also got 400 free online spins at GambleDick.com.\n\nThe second thought is a rush of tenderness. Yes, Sandra Frottwangle’s life is spent in that liminal space. She stares into the void. She sees the weakness of the flesh, fish-grey monkey-brown. But even here she is still hungry for life, still craving that wild human energy. Eyes gleaming like opals, casino chips circling her head, she looks like one of those renaissance friezes expressing the glory and brevity of human life, the globe, the skull, the bowl of rotting fruit.\n\nOnly now we’re strapped into a velour armchair, drooling down our necks, being force-fed endless brain-shredding content and just wanting to feel something. I … love her. I love Sandra Frottwangle (funeral director). And she’s right. All the games are the same. But we still want the games.\n\nEither all of that stuff, or the people who make daytime TV adverts are bored twentysomething creatives who just thought it would be funny to put the words “funeral director” over shots of an actor pretending to be really into gambling websites. Probably it’s one or the other.\n\nAnd yes, this is supposed to be about the Scottish Premiership title race, which enters its spring ignition phase this weekend, and which is now arguably the most interesting title race in Europe.\n\nEither way Sunday’s Old Firm derby at Ibrox is a genuinely rare thing. For once this is not a title decider. It could be a title eliminator. It could be a step towards neither of Celtic or Rangers winning the league for the first time in 41 years. A draw in Glasgow could leave Hearts six points clear at the top. But by now it is a startling transformation whatever the outcome.\n\nHearts finished 40 points behind Celtic last year. The great clanking hand of Tony Bloom and his big data hive-brain robots has been on site for only eight months. The word “disruption” is usually shorthand for tech bro types in $4,000 Japanese trainers working out new ways to fire people. This is actual, good disruption. A three-way title race isn’t just deeply un-Scotland, it’s deeply un-anywhere these days.\n\nIn the major European leagues only Greece, Denmark and Poland have something this close. The trend is towards stratification, dead air after Christmas, a single basking giant or a two-way chase energetically spun by the broadcasters. Money has made this happen. The Premier League in particular has harvested talent, turning previously robust leagues into clearing houses, exit lounges to the life-altering four-year deal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Hearts have sustained a title challenge and it has provided a welcome alternative to the traditional dominance of Celtic and Rangers. Photograph: Steve Welsh/PA\n\nThis is perhaps partly the case in Scotland. But there is also a sense of useful incompetence in play, accidental competitiveness. The Glasgow clubs have spent decades trying to sustain a place in the roided-up Euro elite, taking it in turns to fall over their feet. Now we have this, a perfect storm of super-smart newcomer and a pair of sleepwalking giants.\n\nThere are other places for proper chapter and verse on whether Hearts can sustain this. The key aspect at this stage is that this title race has taken on a sense of outside life. My own kids follow every Hearts game with a rare sense of urgency, despite being fully TikTok-brained, zombified by reel culture.\n\nIt is, of course, only one season. It could all fall away quite rapidly. But there is also a lesson here, perhaps even a control experiment. Because big football is often boring now. The direction of travel is fewer meaningful matches, a cartel of mega-clubs resting on the ropes, a Champions League group stage that feels like an autumn exhibition tour.\n\nThe idea is out there that younger people will be happy with this, will feast instead on clips, screengrabs, parasocial celebrity worship; that young people are essentially industrialised idiots who have for the first time in all human existence lost the craving for actual narrative.\n\nThe reality is this culture creates a yearning for something else. Marketing people will assume hate clicks, or boredom clicks, or any kind of clicks represent actual value and desire. But young people also like real things.\n\nFinding interest in a competitive football league is a bit like getting into vinyl, or books made from paper, or the revelation, usually via an American man on YouTube who looks as if he keeps a collection of children’s dolls in a shed, that food can actually be made from ingredients.\n\nPerhaps Scottish football has fallen into a less globalist version of how to thrive. Tend to the soil. Build it and they will come. The league has plenty that can be weaponised: deep history, heritage value, the same authenticity that made it so moreish back in the days when Old Firm games were basically catharsis, insanity, people at the edge of their own emotions colliding for 90 minutes.\n\nWhy do sporting leagues roll over so willingly? Why do they turn themselves inside out, shred the basis of their own value – English cricket: we see you – in order to chase those precarious streams of macro-money? What if you just stopped trying to expand outward in every direction? What if the guiding principle is: what will make the thing we have right here in front of us better? Why not go hyper-local?\n\nThere is an argument that Hearts winning would be better for Rangers and Celtic. It energises the league, supercharges the brand, speaks to the desire for sporting tension among those bored by the drift of big football.\n\nWe have replaced a great deal that was valuable with generalised digital noise. In a sense we are all strapped into our armchairs now, craving a place where the games are different, anything with heart and life to distract us from the grey, out there staring into the void with Sandra Frottwangle eyes."

            "content": "Arsenal had to expect the jibes from Tottenham and they were not disappointed. Just before kick-off in last Sunday’s north London derby, the Spurs support in the South Stand of their stadium spelled out a giant message in mosaic form. “North Ldn since 1882,” it read.\n\nA clear dig, then, at Arsenal’s south of the river history from the Woolwich days and, as mentioned, very much a part of a rivalry where goading and baiting go hand in hand with the loathing. Arsenal had been similarly provocative before the derby against Spurs at the Emirates Stadium last November, lighting the pre-match scene with a tifo featuring images of various club greats. The most prominent at the top of it? Sol Campbell, of course.\n\nWhat was more surprising – and certainly led to raised eyebrows at Arsenal – was Wolves’ now infamous TikTok post on the Thursday before last. The 80-second clip, uploaded after the 2-2 draw between the clubs the previous night, was a savage take on Arsenal’s “game management”. Or, to put it another way, and as Wolves surely intended, their dark arts and shithousery.\n\nThe social media team at Wolves showed how Gabriel Martinelli taunted the home crowd by flashing up the scoreline on his fingers as Arsenal led 2-1. They highlighted the delay in Arsenal taking a corner as they continued to lead. They mocked Gabriel Magalhães for going down after an apparent head clash before he got back up and carried on.\n\nThere was indignation from the in-house commentators when Leandro Trossard also went to ground after an aerial clash in the 90th minute. In the background, it was easy to make out the chant from the Wolves fans: “Same old Arsenal, always cheating.” There was laughter and the corresponding emojis on the clip when Wolves equalised at the bitter end.\n\nThere was more from elsewhere later in the day. At tea time, Manchester City’s X account piped up with a three-year-old clip of their team playing keep-ball by the corner flag in the dying minutes of a 2-0 home victory over Newcastle. “Seeing out the win,” read the text with a tick emoji above footage of Erling Haaland and Jack Grealish, well, managing the game to a successful conclusion. It was a mickey-take with an obvious target.\n\nThis is where Arsenal find themselves as they prepare for Sunday’s home game against Chelsea – the latest staging post in their draining push for the Premier League title. Their rivals, big and small, are lining up the pot shots, eager to have fun at their expense, to prey on their sensitivities. To drive a particular narrative and make Arsenal prisoners of it.\n\nThe Wolves TikTok clip overlooked a major detail when it came to Trossard. On as a 73rd-minute substitute, the winger was cleaned out by a shoulder barge from Santiago Bueno, who was on a yellow card. Trossard had eyes only for the high ball; the Wolves defender looked directly at him and left a calling card on his opponent’s jaw. A dazed Trossard was forced off after treatment, Arsenal relieved that he avoided injury, and how do you think the club’s doctors felt about essentially being accused of complicity in a plot to run down the clock?\n\nNobody thought about that. They were too busy enjoying the clip, which went viral for the reason that these things always do. It struck a chord. It fed a perception with which opposing fans are seemingly on board. Arsenal as the roughhouse guys – and not only when they are loading men into the six-yard box on corners. The ones that will do whatever it takes to win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Leandro Trossard’s injury at Wolves seemed to invoke opprobrium from the home side. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nArsenal were much better than Spurs. They deserved to beat them, which they did; to clear their heads after the trauma of Wolves. As an aside, it was only this Spurs team. Chelsea ought to be a tougher prospect. Yet Arsenal did get away with one in the 53rd minute as they led 2-1. Would it have been different if Randal Kolo Muani had not been penalised for the slightest of pushes into Gabriel’s back before he shot past David Raya? At the very least, Arsenal would have felt their anxiety levels rise.\n\nGabriel drew the contact to the referee’s attention in theatrical fashion, as he had done at Newcastle last September in a similar situation against Nick Woltemade. That day, the referee said no foul and Woltemade scored. This time, Gabriel got the decision.\n\nWhat did Gabriel do after the game? Did he a) keep his head down and quietly count his blessings? Or b) post a picture to social media of him holding a hand of cards with the four of hearts visible, signifying his team’s four goals? He went for the latter, even tagging the Spurs forward Richarlison. Cue a host of diving memes in the responses. Was goading really the right option given the climate around the club? On the other hand, you have to admire Gabriel’s chutzpah.\n\nMikel Arteta’s response to what we are obliged to call the “outside noise” has been to narrow the focus; to dial up the intensity while also talking up his players and their mindset. The manager has his eyes on the prize and there are a number of points that need to be made, beginning with the feeling towards him and his side in coaching circles.\n\nTowards the end of January, Pep Guardiola described Arsenal as the “best team in the world” and it did not sound like just mind games from the City manager. The Wolves head coach, Rob Edwards, messaged Arteta after last week’s game to say that Arsenal were the best side in the league and there have been others in their positions who have privately expressed the highest admiration for what Arteta is doing. Namely, how Arsenal press, massing men around the ball, cutting off the passing lanes, forcing turnovers. How they dominate in possession, playing on the front foot, creating overloads, moving it quickly. The watchwords are remorselessness and control.\n\nAccording to Opta, Arsenal have had seven yellow cards for time-wasting in the league this season – the same number as Chelsea and behind only Bournemouth and Fulham, who each have eight. They are the seventh-worst offenders for the average time of delays for restarts, taking in set pieces and goal-kicks. They sit behind Sunderland, Brentford, Crystal Palace, Newcastle, Leeds and Burnley on the list in that order.\n\nArteta and his players remain at the centre of a storm, buffeted by ill winds, Chelsea ready to bring the latest of them. If Arsenal hold their nerve, they will have done it the hard way."

            "content": "“I just want to have my name out there to the point where when someone hears it they know instantly who is being talked about,” says the Chelsea full-back Chloe Sarwie. “I want to be that player who can amaze people constantly and that is up there as one of the best.”\n\nYou could be forgiven for viewing this level of confidence as arrogant, but you would be wrong. The talented 17-year-old defender comes across as grounded, intelligent, hard-working and humble, but her edge is a steely belief in her football.\n\nSarwie is speaking to the Guardian shortly before signing her first professional contract, four months after her debut in the 1-1 draw with Twente in the Champions League and three months after her first call-up to the England Under-23s.\n\nSarwie is back with the under‑23s for next month’s games against France and the Netherlands, one of two 17-year-olds considered good enough to compete alongside those vying for a chance in the senior side (the other is Erica Meg Parkinson, who plays her club football in Portugal). Last summer, at 16, she was in the squad that competed at the Under-19 Euros in Poland. “I was taken aback and I didn’t really have any expectations so it was incredible,” she says.\n\n“It’s honestly a really intense environment and every training session everyone just wants to one-up each other. It gets really competitive and just being around that wanting-to-win group was incredible.”\n\nHer Chelsea debut in October, when still 16, came as a surprise. “As soon as I got the nod from Sonia [Bompastor] that I’d be coming on for Sandy [Baltimore] and making my debut, I was just down on the sideline, shocked but pumped and ready to get on the pitch,” says Sarwie, who entered the fray against Twente in the 73rd minute.\n\nShe impressed instantly, playing with an admirable fearlessness. “Honestly, when I stepped on that pitch, I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know how to play, but I was just trying to play my part for the team, fit in and see what I could do. Towards the end of the game, I was being myself a bit more and the more playing time I’m getting, the more I’m able to express myself, but my full self hasn’t come out yet.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Chloe Sarwie (right) made her Chelsea debut in the Champions League draw with Twente last October. Photograph: Chris Lee/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\nChelsea are well equipped at right-back, with two of the world’s best in Lucy Bronze and Ellie Carpenter at their disposal, but at left-back there is a hole. With Baltimore performing well in the position but naturally a more attacking player and Niamh Charles out with an ankle injury, there have been some opportunities for Sarwie, against Crystal Palace in the FA Cup and West Ham and Tottenham in the Women’s Super League.\n\nShould her development continue at its accelerated pace there is also the chance to stake a claim in the senior England squad that has had question marks at left‑back under Sarina Wiegman. London City Lionesses’ Poppy Pattinson is the latest to receive a call-up with an eye on finding a solution to the conundrum.\n\nSarwie was introduced to the Chelsea senior side in pre-season. It was “quite exciting but also quite nerve-racking”, though training and playing with the first team has been hugely beneficial. “It’s a great challenge and I love being challenged and going up against these players, seeing how their level compares to mine and how I can get to that level,” says Sarwie.\n\n“Obviously, Lucy’s at England as well and being able to have that connection is great, even though I’m in one of the lower age groups because, ultimately, I’m learning how I can then progress to that next step and be part of the senior squad. That’s where she can give me tips and show what it takes.”\n\nSarwie began playing football in the park on her own, light on her feet thanks to ballet from the ages of two until eight. “I used to turn up to ballet with muddy tights after playing football and rolling around in the mud for a good hour or two. But ballet had a big impact on my journey as a football player as my dribbling playing style kind of links back to it. Ballet made me light on my feet. I also had to adapt from a ballet mindset, from a solo stage, to a football mindset and a team performance stage.”\n\nIt was in the park where coaches would approach her and tell her she should be playing for a club and eventually she thought: “Why not?” After a season at Millwall, she had trials at Arsenal and Chelsea and had offers from both. “I had to pick Chelsea because it was closer,” she says. “I let my family down on that one because they’re all Arsenal supporters, but oh well.”\n\nShe juggles playing and training with studying for her BTec in engineering and her mum, Jean, who is a teacher at her school, is the force that has enabled her to pursue football. She takes her laptop everywhere, to catch up with coursework, with one day a week spent in the classroom.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie takes a selfie with fans after featuring in the FA Cup against Crystal Palace. Photograph: Sport Press Photo/Alamy\n\nSarwie is having to contend with an influx of information. “It’s mad trying to switch the brain from studying engineering to football and back,” she says. “I’m still taking in everything in relation to the first team. I have all that information coming at me and then I have to go home, switch off and then do my work and it’s all a bit chaotic.”\n\nOn the pitch, there is also a balance to be struck between what is being asked of her and instinct. “Sometimes on the pitch I can be quite hesitant because I’m trying to think about what I should do at that moment instead of what I want to do, because that’s sometimes two different things. The coach wants me to do something but I want to do something else in the moment and it’s about quickly processing which one I should do.\n\n“Every day I’m getting new information coming in and I’m just trying to soak that up but trying to show myself on the pitch and putting those words into actions on the pitch can be quite difficult and it’s going to be like that for a while because of my age.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie practised ballet until the age of eight. ‘It made me light on my feet,’ she says. Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\n“Once I’m on the pitch I just want to be my most relaxed self. Breathing techniques on the pitch really help me stay calm and I’ve been told I look arrogant doing this, but chewing gum on the pitch makes me relax as well.\n\n“I want to be that person that looks in place and calm with the rest of the team, that calms that team down. I don’t want to be nervous when I get the ball, or for them to be nervous when I get the ball, I want to get the ball and to express myself as much as possible with it.”"

            "content": "As Wolves applied the seal to only their second Premier League victory of the season, Rodrigo Gomes doubling their lead over Aston Villa deep into second-half stoppage time, Rob Edwards hared down the touchline, yelling into the stands as his players started a celebratory pile-on a few yards behind him. It was a moment of catharsis for Edwards, who beat his chest and wellied an advertising hoarding, but for Unai Emery it was a different kind of cue.\n\nAs those in old gold savoured a win over near neighbours that takes them to 13 points, ending any fears that they may not eclipse Derby’s record-low tally of 11 in 2007-08, Emery marched straight down the tunnel before the post-match handshakes.\n\nWolves’s other Premier League win came against West Ham at the start of last month and no wonder the supporters savoured every second. “The two games we’ve won in the league this year, both managers have disappeared from the touchline,” Edwards said with a smile. “I think everyone expects just to turn up and win, which is understandable given how this season has gone.”\n\nAt the end of the season, how costly might this untimely slip prove for Villa? Judging by the way Emery fumed, this defeat will hurt for a while yet and, significantly, it could have major implications for their hopes of returning to the Champions League. They are on a poor run of form having taken only one win in their past six matches in all competitions and 12 points from their past nine league games. Emery called for perspective.\n\n“Maybe you can say: ‘We are losing the chance to the win the Premier League,’” Emery said animatedly. “Some supporters maybe were dreaming. Now we are not with the possibility to fight for the Premier League, some can feel frustrated, even myself because I have my dreams. In September I was worried and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. One month ago I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League.”\n\nView image in fullscreen A sodden Unai Emery tries to spur on his Aston Villa team as they struggled against Wolves. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters\n\nVilla were unpicked by a team almost certainly heading for the Championship but, as they did when rousing to a draw against the leaders, Arsenal, Wolves showed they will go down fighting.\n\nJoão Gomes fired in his first goal in a year just after the hour, starting the move himself after nutmegging the Villa substitute Ross Barkley, and then Rodrigo Gomes put the game beyond doubt on the counterattack, after Yerson Mosquera and José Sá combined to deny Amadou Onana. Morgan Rogers’s attempt to recycle a corner ended with Wolves attacking three v two. Rogers had his face in the turf as Rodrigo Gomes swivelled near the penalty spot and buried the ball past Emiliano Martínez.\n\nIt was never going to be an evening for the purists and driving rain did little to enhance this soggy Midlands derby as a spectacle. It was a contest bogged down by misplaced passes, clunky touches and the ball slowing unpredictably on a saturated surface. Ezri Konsa can vouch for that, the Villa centre-back nudging the ball back to Martínez with his big toe, just as Adam Armstrong sought to prey on Douglas Luiz’s loose pass. It was a night for the poncho-clad Wolves supporters in the uncovered Graham Hughes stand in a corner of this stadium. Hugo Bueno looked battle-hardened, the reverse of the Wolves full-back’s old gold shirt caked in mud.\n\nEmery grew increasingly agitated as the game went on. He exploded as Jadon Sancho declined to take a shot first time at the back post and there was a restlessness within the home support too. Edwards gestured for calm as the locals aired their frustration at Jackson Tchatchoua looking inside for the perceived easy pass. Wolves struggled to hold on to the ball and when they did have it surrendered possession cheaply, João Gomes among those guilty. Sá, wearing the captain’s armband, shanked a goal-kick straight out of play to the disbelief of those in the stands.\n\nWolves, certainly not lacking in spirit, defended admirably. Tchatchoua did well to halt Ian Maatsen, one of those thrown on by Emery as Villa chased the game. Toti Gomes halted an advancing Leon Bailey, another second-half substitute. Bueno blocked off all avenues for Cash and turned to celebrate with the home fans. Then, at the final whistle, having doubled their lead, Wolves let loose."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says his Tottenham players are not fit enough and has questioned their desire to put in the hard yards without the ball.\n\nThe interim head coach has a clearer idea of the problems he faces after two weeks – and there are many of them, including low levels of confidence and the capacity of the younger players to handle the pressure of a relegation battle.\n\nTudor knows there are reasons for the physical issues with the squad stretched by an injury crisis amid a punishing schedule. Although Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso are in contention to return for Sunday’s trip to Fulham, Tottenham will be without eight injured players plus the suspended Cristian Romero.\n\nTudor believes there is only one way out of the situation – an on-the-hoof fitness reboot in training, particularly as the club had no midweek fixture last week or this. The Croat surprised the players by working them extremely hard throughout last week and not tapering off before last Sunday’s home game against Arsenal, which they lost 4-1. As Tudor made plain, it is not a time to pander to player sensibilities.\n\n“Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,” Tudor said. “They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and it made the physical condition of the team drop down. So we need to use this period where we don’t play the games to put some petrol in the engine so the engine starts to work better.\n\n“They are fatigued. To do the pressing high you need to be fit. But [it is] all of them because if someone is not in the right shape there is a problem because someone is coming late [to the press].\n\n“The second thing is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back. If you run up and don’t run back it’s a problem. For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it’s a big question what we can do and what we cannot do.”\n\nTudor was asked about his full-throttle approach from the first training session. “Yes, that’s the only way – running,” he said. “The pitch is 100 yards, it’s long. So you need to run.\n\n“Maybe you have habits to, I don’t know … work a bit less. I put some runs without the ball [into the sessions]. Never players like runs without the ball so we put some runs without balls. But it’s a moment when there is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn’t like. And the best thing is that they understand this. They gave me their availability to do these things.”\n\nTudor is under no illusions about the size of the challenge. It was put to him that the striker, Randal Kolo Muani, had played well against Arsenal. “That’s good, one good thing,” he replied.\n\nWhat Tudor wants to see at Fulham and beyond is players such as Kolo Muani stepping up, accepting the responsibility. “Some players are still young,” he said. “They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to resolve the problems.\n\nView image in fullscreen Randal Kolo Muani scores against Arsenal – Igor Tudor wants him to keep raising his game for Spurs. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\n“If you have too many of these players because of the amount of injuries, who are playing together in the squad, it does create some problems. But it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man. To say: ‘Come on, I’m the guy, give me the ball, I will score.’ Instead of just: ‘What can I do? I’m just here, you know.’\n\n“It’s always how you see the situation. It’s not: ‘I’m just here. We had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play.’ How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy and positive, there is opportunity.”\n\nTudor has not dwelt for long on the derby with Arsenal. “No, no, forget that,” he said. It was never likely to be a game that would define the club’s survival hopes. The same is not true of Fulham – or the home fixture against Crystal Palace next Thursday.\n\n“After the first game, I said if you play against the best team in the world at this moment, it’s not a realistic game to show [whether] we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,” Tudor said. “That’s the truth. They show they can be in some parts of the game. But for long periods we had problems, in defence especially. It’s not easy against them. Let’s see in the next games.”"

            "content": "Premier League clubs are unhappy with Uefa’s decision to reveal details of their financial results before some have been published and without warning.\n\nChelsea’s record pre-tax loss of £355m last season formed a key part of Uefa’s European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report, which was presented by its executive director, Andrea Traverso, at the Financial Times’s Business of Football Summit on Thursday, with the losses incurred by Tottenham and Aston Villa also featuring prominently.\n\nThe issue is understood to have been discussed by Premier League representatives at Friday’s Champions League draw in Nyon, where there was agreement that Uefa had failed to keep them informed.\n\nNone of the clubs were briefed about Uefa’s plans, leaving Chelsea in particular frustrated at being given no time to prepare for questions on their results. The club are not planning to publish their 2024-25 accounts until the end of March.\n\nChelsea, while not contesting the £355m loss, which is based on information they provided to Uefa, insist the headline figure does not reflect the economic reality.\n\nClub sources have disclosed that the record loss reflects non-cash accounting adjustments required by Uefa’s financial sustainability regulations, specifically one-off transactions related to player contract and asset write-offs, and that they are profitable on an operational basis.\n\nChelsea were fined £27m by Uefa last summer for breaching its spending restrictions and ordered to submit to a business plan, but are confident of avoiding another sanction. As part of that settlement agreement Chelsea were permitted to continue running at a substantial loss, as long as it remained in line with “the projected deficit submitted in the business plan”."

            "content": "1. Title run-in all about ‘little details’ Pep Guardiola has told his Manchester City players their pursuit of honours in the final three months of the season will depend on their “brains and minds”. City, who remain in contention for four trophies, meet title rivals Arsenal in the Carabao Cup final and Newcastle in the fifth-round of the FA Cup next month, as well as Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League. In the Premier League, they are five points behind Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal with a game in hand. City have had no midweek games for two weeks and – after the visit to Leeds on Saturday – Guardiola has given his players Sunday to Tuesday off as he believes the challenge in the defining part of the campaign is more mental than technical. Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more “There are still things that we should train and practise more, but I prioritised rest,” Guardiola said. “With three months left, there are many things that the team have improved in and still some things that the team has to improve, but now it is the little details. “Now it is how it is in your brains and your minds that will make the difference. Maybe for the new players it is new, but we have talked a lot in many meetings for many years that, when you arrive in the last three months, competing in all competitions, everything is here [points to his head].” Jamie Jackson\n\nEddie Howe has urged Anthony Gordon not to be distracted by reports linking him with a summer move to Arsenal amid speculation that the 25-year-old winger will be a target for the title-chasing Gunners. Howe, who is still dealing with the fallout from Alexander Isak’s defection to Liverpool last summer, could do without a repeat of that saga, but the Newcastle manager admits there is little he can do to prevent it. Newcastle face Gordon’s former cub Everton in the Premier League on Saturday and Howe said: “I’m not sure there’s a lot I can do about that. I’ve not seen the story, so it’s news to me. But we’re mid-season, we’re in the middle of some of the biggest games of his career and who knows what’s going to happen internationally with him in the summer as well? “He’s got no time to look left or right, he’s got to be fully focused on straight ahead and the next game and trying to be as good as he can be.” View image in fullscreen Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon is reported to be on Arsenal’s wishlist. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA Gordon, who earlier this month dismissed rumours he was on the way out of the club where he signed a new contract in October 2024, will hope to continue his good run of form to secure a place in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for this summer’s World Cup finals and Howe is hopeful he will not be unsettled by talk over his future. “It comes with the territory of being a top player and playing at this level, that there’s going to be speculation,” said Howe. “You’ve just got to put it out of your brain and you’ve got to focus on the football because as we know with our schedule, there’s so many games, there’s no time for distractions. We have to be fully focused on each match.” PA Media\n\n3. Moyes blames referees for corner ‘dark arts’ David Moyes has claimed corner-kick routines are turning into wrestling contests because referees have ignored “the dark arts” for too long. Moyes’s Everton team were criticised for crowding the Manchester United goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, at several corners during their 1-0 defeat at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Monday. Ahead of Saturday’s game at Newcastle, the Everton manager insisted that went against his gameplan but he, and other managers, would seek any advantage that the laws of the game offer. However, he also believes referees should take a harder line to try to eradicate jostling at set-pieces. “Truthfully, it wasn’t the plan for our corner kicks to end up like that. But I think there’s a bigger issue with it,” Moyes said. “It has been allowed to let go, whether it be blocking of goalkeepers or blocking of defenders, and you get the feeling now that referees really don’t want to get involved in any of it. It is nearly wrestling to an extent, which it shouldn’t be. It should never have got to this situation, but I think it’s been really poor that they’ve not tried to deal with it well enough and stop it. “You are now allowed lots of blocking, for example. In my day, if you blocked someone it would have been a free-kick. But blocking has become a big part of it. Let’s be fair, the best at it – but with style – would be Arsenal: good delivery, good style, but ultimately there’s a lot of dark arts in it such as blocking the goalkeeper from the back or the front, blocking defenders and making it difficult for them to be your key headers of the ball. “It is a big thing in football, but I do think the level of refereeing has let that part of the game drop. And managers, if we see somebody else doing it and not getting punished for it, then we are all on it.” View image in fullscreen More wrestling match than football as Manchester United and Everton players indulge in some dark arts from a corner. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images Ironically, Moyes felt Everton’s approach in the closing stages against United worked against his team. He wanted more variety from Everton’s corners but claimed: “It was very difficult to get the message on.” Moyes admitted: “The plan was not to deliver the corners in the fashion we did the other night. They shouldn’t have been delivered as close to the goalkeeper. They should have been delivered into different areas at different times according to what we had worked on. It became a bit of a wrestling match and I didn’t think it showed enough quality or enough thought.” Andy Hunter\n\n4. Glasner wary of United’s Carrick bounce Oliver Glasner credits Michael Carrick for imbuing Manchester United with a “great spirit” and “clear structure” since his appointment last month. No team has picked up more Premier League points in 2026 than United, with Carrick winning five of his six games in charge since replacing Ruben Amorim. Palace have been a thorn in United’s side in recent years, winning three of their five last encounters, but Glasner expects Carrick’s side to be in fine form on Sunday when the Eagles head to Old Trafford. View image in fullscreen The Crystal Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, steered his team into the last 16 of the Uefa Conference league on Thursday. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA “Of course, when Man United plays at home against Crystal Palace, everybody there is expecting now a win,” said Glasner. “They are a very good team now. They gave a very good balance between, it’s a very experienced team, with really, very experienced Premier League players, and very young players with huge talent. “It’s a good mix they have now, but I think the most important thing for them is they are consistently playing with their team and have a clear structure in the way they are playing. This is what I could see against Everton. They have a great spirit right now. It was really impressive seeing Matheus Cunha celebrating winning a duel in their own box. This, I think, is what Michael Carrick brought into this team.” PA Media"

No wonder they were the best team in the world at that time.\"\n\n\"I’d never been more sure that I was going to make it as a professional footballer,\" he later added. \"All I had to do was shoot for the stars.\"\n\n4 Pike had a trial with Ajax and had European giants looking to sign him Credit: YouTube\n\nHe wouldn't be offered a contract by Ajax though, returning to the UK after playing in two games for their youth side.\n\nThroughout that trip, such was the interest in him that Pike, cameras from popular TV show Blue Peter followed him around.\n\nPike said to The Sun: “I wasn’t too worried about the cameras being there at that age, because from the ages of 10 to 12-years-old I had got used to that then.\n\n“It was only towards about 14-years-old onwards that it got too much for me and I struggled to concentrate on my football.”\n\nAt 14, Pike had his legs insured for £1million and that led to horrible backlash from his opposition's parents during games.\n\nHe explained: “Because I had long hair, they used to say, ‘he’s only a girl, break his legs.’ Not just that, off the pitch and at school, I got different treatment that didn’t help me either.\"\n\n4 Things sadly started crumbling down for Pike after he featured in a documentary Credit: Getty\n\n'It was just too much'\n\nIn 1996, Pike signed for Leyton Orient following his unsuccessful trial at Ajax and that is where his story started to crash down.\n\nWhile at Orient, his father worked with a journalist and agreed to sign him up for a documentary named 'Coaching and Poaching'.\n\nBut despite thinking the documentary was going to be about him, it was actually being filmed to expose a poaching scandal.\n\nHe featured for Chelsea, but by doing so, through no fault of his own, was caught out for breaking FA rules on tapping up.\n\nAfter an inquiry, Pike was banned from football for a year, and he missed out on training with multiple other clubs, with his relationship with his father broken after the ordeal too.\n\nOn what it was like during that time, he revealed to The Sun: “After watching that documentary, I came out of the pub and I stood in the middle of the main road in Edmonton, actually on a roundabout.\n\n4 Pike fell into a depression and left football behind - but he now coaches other young players after his terrible experience Credit: Getty\n\n“There’s cars just whizzing around me and I just felt that’s what my head was getting like. ‘This is too much, enough of this now.’\"\n\nPike would eventually get back into football after his ban, being given a chance by Crystal Palace, which didn't last long.\n\nHis love for the game had gone - and at just 16, he'd had enough.\n\nHe admitted: “I pretty much had a mental breakdown on the pitch. I came on for 15 minutes, I was given the opportunity and I just walked off. The pressure of me going on, it was just too much.\n\n\"I looked at the coach and just walked off. I broke down and I knew it was all over from then.”\n\nPike went on to spend two years at Stevenage until he was 18, before completely giving up football for good - having not played a single professional game at senior level.\n\nHe battled with depression before turning his life around and leaving the sport behind, becoming a taxi driver in London and also starting to coach young players and support their fledgling careers.\n\nOn top of that, he also wrote a book called 'My Story: The Greatest Footballer That Never Was' to reveal more about his journey."

However, there has been little evidence to support that view and, if anything, Pep Guardiola’s men have been riding their luck.\n\nYes, City have won seven of their last eight matches, but the victories have come against Newcastle twice, Galatasaray, Wolves, Fulham, Liverpool and Salford, which hardly rates a difficult set of fixtures.\n\n\n\nThe Citizens gave up 13 shots, five corners and 45 per cent possession in a 2-1 Etihad success over the Magpies last weekend and that was not a convincing triumph.\n\nLeeds have lost only two of their last 16 matches and the Whites haven’t benefited from a kind run of fixtures.\n\nDaniel Farke’s men have faced Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Newcastle and Manchester United in the last couple of months and that hasn’t stopped them from putting in an excellent sequence of results.\n\nAt 17/4, there appears to be plenty of mileage in punting Leeds to upset City on Saturday evening.\n\n\n\nSpecial of the Day – Liverpool to win, over 2.5 goals and Liverpool to score the first bet builder @ 23/20\n\nWest Ham will no doubt attempt to sit in and frustrate Liverpool at Anfield, but the Reds have scored 19 times in their last six home matches and the task may be beyond the Hammers.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo’s side are desperate for points in their bid to avoid relegation, which may mean they are forced to chase the contest if falling behind and that’s a dangerous game against the Reds.\n\nThere have been a total of 31 goals in the last eight matches between Liverpool and West Ham and all but one of those games has bust the 2.5 goal line.\n\n\n\nTaking a Liverpool victory, over 2.5 goals and the Reds to score first in a bet builder pays an enticing 23/20.\n\nLongshot of the Day – Hearts, Hibernian, Livingston, Motherwell fourfold @ 11/1\n\nHearts are unbeaten in 16 Tynecastle Scottish Premiership matches this season and the league leaders can continue their title push against Aberdeen.\n\nThe Dons have lost seven of their last eight away games and they still haven’t appointed a full-time manager.\n\n\n\nHibernian picked up a huge win when beating Celtic 2-1 at Parkhead last weekend and in-from Hibs can see off a Dundee side who have won only one of their last six games.\n\nLivingston almost grabbed a huge victory over Rangers last time out, but it’s 28 matches without success for Livi. However, that 2-2 draw can boost their confidence and they may be able to get the better of St Mirren at Almondvale.\n\nMotherwell have lost only two of their last 19 games and the progressive Steelmen have tasted victory in seven of their last eight home games.\n\nDundee United offered little in a 0-0 draw with Aberdeen last time out and the Terrors are heading for a Fir Park nightmare.\n\n\n\nGET UP TO £30 WHEN YOU BET ON THE FOOTBALL WITH talkSPORT BET\n\nOdds correct at time of publish and subject to change*\n\n18+ New customers only.

            "content": "Gareth Southgate would be perfect for one Premier League job\n\nGareth Southgate has been tipped to make a sensational return to management at former club Crystal Palace by talkSPORT's Alex Crook.\n\nThe ex-England boss has enjoyed an extended football sabbatical after leaving his post with the Three Lions following defeat to Spain in the Euro 2024 final.\n\n4 Gareth Southgate has not managed in club football for 17 years Credit: Getty\n\nDuring his time away, Southgate has continued to be linked with a number of top jobs, most notably the hot seat at Manchester United.\n\nDespite this, the 55-year-old has refused to jump into a new role, and recently reiterated that he is in no rush to return to the dugout.\n\nBefore his eight-year spell as Three Lions boss, Southgate’s only previous job was at Middlesbrough between 2006 and 2009.\n\nHe guided Boro to two mid-table finishes in the Premier League before being relegated in his third campaign.\n\nSouthgate: 'No passion' for Premier League job\n\nSpeaking on The Football Boardroom Podcast, Southgate admitted he is not motivated by a potential return to Premier League management, insisting it would take a 'big club' to tempt him.\n\nHe said: “I’ve got no passion to just go and manage in the Premier League.\n\n“I did that at 35, I finished 11th, 12th. Who is in those positions now, probably Bournemouth, Brighton?\n\n“So I don’t feel the need to just go and do it to say I’ve managed in the Premier League.\n\n“I’ve had one of the biggest jobs in world football so I’ve been spoiled. Huge nights, working with outstanding players. No owner interfering.\n\n“The bit that, externally, people are saying is, ‘Well, he didn’t win’. So how do you prove that you can win? You’ve got to one of those big clubs.\"\n\n4 Southgate took charge of Middlesbrough in 2006, immediately after retiring from football at the club Credit: Getty\n\nSouthgate fell just short of ending England's long-standing trophy drought - suffering defeat in the finals of both Euro 2020 and 2024.\n\nAnd the ex-Three Lions boss claimed he could understand football club owners opting against appointing him due to the negative publicity surrounding his past near misses.\n\nHe continued: “Now we know those big clubs… do I think I could have done the job that some people who have been in those clubs recently have done? Could I do better? I think I could.\n\n“But we’ve talked about the baggage that comes with me as an appointment if you’re an owner.\n\n“And there’s a reality around (that), I can understand what that noise is. There’s that bit which makes me potentially a complicated appointment for a club.”\n\nCrook: Southgate a 'good fit' for Palace\n\nWhile Southgate might have distanced himself from a return to club management in the near future, this didn't stop the talkSPORT studio from speculating where he could eventually end up.\n\n4 Oliver Glasner will depart Crystal Palace after two years as manager Credit: Getty\n\nAnd chief football correspondent Alex Crook was quick to suggest Crystal Palace, where Southgate began his playing career and made 191 appearances between 1988 and 1995.\n\nThe Eagles will soon be looking for a new head coach, after Oliver Glasner announced he will leave the club in the summer.\n\nTipping Southgate for the vacancy, Crook said: “I think he'd be a good fit at Crystal Palace.\n\n\"[He] obviously knows the club, he will know Steve Parish. I think he will get the respect that his record does deserve at Crystal Palace.\n\n“But the question that he's got to ask himself and he sort of said it - he's had the biggest job in the country, even though Palace obviously has a special place in his heart.\n\n“Is he going to get the same motivation out of being Crystal Palace manager as he did taking England to the finals?”\n\n4 Southgate captained Crystal Palace to Premier League promotion as a player Credit: Getty\n\nSouthgate's Man United credentials questioned\n\nDespite Southgate insisting he would be more tempted by the prospect of managing a top club, Crook was not convinced he would be the right man for the job at United.\n\nMichael Carrick is in interim charge of the Red Devils until the end of the season, having taken over following Ruben Amorim's sacking.\n\nBut Southgate has frequently been linked with the job at Old Trafford after both Erik ten Hag and Amorim were dismissed during his football sabbatical.\n\nAsked why Southgate was not his first pick for the role, Crook said: “I don't think he's a top-level manager, certainly not domestically.\n\n“Look at what happened at Middlesbrough and I think there's a big difference between being England manager and being Manchester United manager.\n\n“Especially when you look at the England team and one of the big things that he did, Gareth, he took the ego out of the dressing room.\n\n\"There's a lot of ego still in that dressing room [at Man United].”"

Gary Hart: Er, no, I wasn’t far from the M1, it’s just where the A1, just where the, the railway line. Operator: Right, okay, it’s just that I’m going to need a better location than that, you’re through to North Yorkshire Police here. Gary Hart: But there’s a train coming. Operator: Oh my God. [Sound of train going past] Gary Hart: F***ing hell, f***ing hell. Operator: Hello? Gary Hart: The train’s just gone straight through the front of me Land Rover. Operator: Right. Gary Hart: It’s … off. Operator: Is, is the train still on the track? Gary Hart: Yes. Operator: It’s carried on going? Gary Hart: Still going. For God’s sake. Operator: Is the car now, is it off the line now? Gary Hart: No, it’s, the Land Rover’s off the line, but there’s a car, the car’s on the line as well. Operator: The car’s still on the line?\n\nChillingly, mid-way through his call to police, the passenger train, which had been travelling at speeds of up to 125mph, hit his Land Rover.\n\n\n\nIn a recording of the call, the screeching of brakes can be heard as Hart tells the operator the train has “gone straight through my Land Rover”.\n\n06:13am – First Smash\n\nThe 04:45 Great North Eastern Railway InterCity 225 service from Newcastle to London had just left York travelling at high speed, smashing into the Land Rover.\n\nThe collision derails the leading undercarriage of the passenger train.\n\nAround 99 people are on board.\n\nThough damaged, the train remains upright and continues down the track — fatally destabilised.\n\n\n\nSeconds Later – Disaster doubles\n\nThe derailed passenger train is deflected into the path of a northbound Freightliner coal train.\n\nInevitably, in a horrific second smash, the two trains collide head-on.\n\n06:14am – Catastrophe\n\nThe force of the collision leaves locomotives and carriages mangled and scattered across both lines and into surrounding fields.\n\nOne coach comes to rest upright in a field. The driving part of the carriage at the front is flattened.\n\nBy the end of the morning, 10 people — including both train drivers — are dead.\n\n\n\nA further 82 are seriously injured.\n\nThree helicopters and a fleet of ambulances ferried the injured to seven different hospitals across Yorkshire, with snow, sleet and freezing weather creating difficult conditions for the rescue efforts.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nIt was later found the Land Rover driver had little sleep the night before and was found guilty of 10 counts of causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nHe was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nShockingly his trial heard he fell asleep at the wheel after staying up all night chatting on the phone to a woman he met on the internet.\n\n\n\nAfter a sleepless night of online flirting, he then embarked on a 145-mile (230km) journey to work at 4.40am.\n\nThe 10 who died\n\nRaymond Robson, 43, GNER senior conductor\n\nPaul Taylor, 42, GNER buffet chef\n\nJohn Weddle, 47, GNER train driver\n\nSteve Dunn, 39, freight train driver\n\nSteve Baldwin, 39, passenger\n\nChris Terry, 30, passenger\n\nAlan Ensor, 44, passenger\n\nBarry Needham, 40, passenger\n\nClive Vigden, 39, passenger\n\nRobert Shakespeare, 43, passenger\n\nOn the morning of Feb 28, 2001, Tony Thompson, a superintendent for the British Transport Police, was on a train into central London to take his post at the Tavistock Place office when he learned of the news of the disaster.\n\nHe reported straight at the HQ for a briefing on the smash before hopping in his boss’s unmarked police car and driving more than 200 miles north to the scene.\n\nHaving worked on other notable train crashes – including 1999’s Ladbroke Grove crash and the Paddington crash in the same year – in his 32 years at BTP, he said this was the “most devastating”.\n\n\n\nHe estimated there were at least 1278 emergency responders at that scene.\n\nThis included 472 police officers, 167 firefighters and 128 ambulance personnel—a testament to the extraordinary multi-agency effort.\n\n‘IT WAS LIKE A WAR SCENE’\n\n“I have been to so many crashes during my career, but this one was different,” Tony, who is now 77, told The Sun.\n\n“There were carriages on either side of the bridge and even one of the Freightliner carriages had passed under the bridge.\n\n“It was like a war scene, you would only really see stuff like this in movies and on TV, but of course this was real, the scale of it was just unbelievable.\n\n\n\n“But from an emergency services point of view, we had a job to do. The physical aspect of the crash was one thing, but the emotional aspect was another.\n\n“First thing first, and what everybody was most desperate to find out was the exact extent of the devastation to human life.\n\n“And amid the chaotic scenes, it was going to be a big task to work that out. This was the most devastating crash I had ever seen; it was totally unprecedented.\n\n“I will never forget standing on the little bridge over the railway line with sort of wreckage scattered around on both sides.\n\n“You certainly appreciate how large and complicated trains are when they are derailed.\n\n\n\nHe continued: “This was described in one of the national papers as a billion to one horror, and that was right.\n\n“The death toll would have been so much worse if the incident hadn’t occurred moments after sunrise.”\n\n\n\nTony was tasked with hosting the press conferences for the disaster.\n\nWhen it was safe to do so he opened a vantage point at the top of the bridge which is where he held them.\n\nBut in addition to that, he had the responsibility of dealing with the victims’ families.\n\nHe said one of the most poignant moments was when he showed one the families around the crash scene.\n\nA boy, 7, left a drawing he had done for his father – intending to give it to him when he next saw him – at the wreckage.\n\n\n\n“I gave them a private moment there, and days later when I inspected [the wreckage], the boy had left his drawing there,” he said.\n\n“Eventually when the site was being cleared I took the picture he had drawn with me and later gave it to their mother.”\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIn total, Tony showed seven of the 10 families that lost their loved ones in the tragedy around the site.\n\nToday (Feb 28) is speaking at a memorial service held at Selby Abbey."

            "content": "NOT EASY BEING GREEN Migrant crackdown must go ahead & PM should resist lurching party to left after brutal by-election loss, warns Home Sec\n\nTHE Labour Party must resist a shift to the left following a humiliating defeat in the Gorton and Denton by-election, the Home Secretary will warn.\n\nShabana Mahmood is set to say that the party must push forward with its migration crackdown or face putting its future in jeopardy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter being roundly bested by the Green party, Labour will need to stick to its “centrist” path on migration to counter the “fairytale” of the Green’s open borders the Home Secretary will say.\n\nMahmood and her migration reforms are battling continued demands from senior Labour figures to shift to the left in the wake of the Green’s victory in Manchester.\n\nHer new legislation to completely overhaul Britain’s asylum system is understood to be aimed at blunting the appeal of Reform UK.\n\nIt comes after Mahmood visited Denmark, where a social democratic-led government has drastically reduced the number of asylum applications to the lowest number in 40 years.\n\n\n\nThe Danish government has also removed 95% of rejected asylum seekers in a major crackdown.\n\nThe Home Secretary has made little secret of her admiration for the approach.\n\nMahmood is now expected to use a speech next week to face down her party’s demands and call for support for her sweeping migration reforms.\n\nHer party came a humiliating third in a crunch by-election with Reform and the Green Party soundly beating them out.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the disastrous result, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faced down fresh calls for him to quit.\n\nHe vowed to fight on though, and accused the Green Party of “sectarian” politics.\n\nThe Prime Minister pledged to “fight against extremes in politics” on both the left and the right that threatened to “tear our country apart.”\n\nReform leader Nigel Farage accused Muslim voters of cheating in the election through “illegal family voting.”\n\nIn the wake of the defeat, Labour’s deputy prime minister Angela Rayner said the result should be a “wake-up call” for the party.\n\n\n\nShe called for a shift to the left in Labour’s politics, asking her colleagues to “rededicate” themselves to “a Labour agenda that puts people first.”\n\nBut instead of bowing to her left-leaning colleagues the Home Secretary is expected to double down on her divisive immigration policies.\n\nA source told The Times: “The idea that we are losing Muslim voters over immigration is just plain wrong.”\n\n\n\nDenmark’s tough stance on asylum seekers, which Mahmood is understood to have taken inspiration from, began in the mid 2010s when the hard-right Danish People’s Party began to rise in the polls.\n\nMahmood is expected to say the government must cut migration or risk opening the door to the right who would divide communities with the kind of anti-immigration raids seen in the US.\n\nIn her speech next week the Home Secretary is reportedly planning to say Britain will always provide sanctuary to people genuinely fleeing war and danger.\n\nHowever she will also add that the generosity of the asylum system is attracting people from across the world, funding human traffickers and encouraging false asylum claims.\n\nIt is understood she faces a backbench revolt over the plans with Labour split more than ever after the all-important Gorton and Denton by-election.\n\n\n\nMs Mahmood is likely to face opposition in her efforts to emulate the Danish model from at least a few dozen Labour MPs who would see the party move left.\n\nLabour backers of her policies say that without taking any action on migration, the party faces future electoral defeats.\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph this week in Denmark, Mahmood said: “The levels of illegal migration are putting immense strain on our country, and our public services – creating division within communities across the country.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“Illegal migration is undermining the contract between government and its citizens – eroding support for the asylum system entirely.\n\n“But Denmark shows us how to be firm but fair: increasing the removals of illegal migrants that have no right to be in their country while providing refuge to those in genuine need.”"

Defensive systems are operating to intercept the threat.\n\n\n\n“In the past few minutes, the Home Front Command has sent a precautionary directive directly to mobile phones in the relevant areas.\n\n“The public is asked to act responsibly and follow the instructions – they save lives.\n\n\n\n“Upon receiving an alert, the public is instructed to enter a protected space and remain there until further notice. Leaving a protected space is permitted only after receiving explicit instructions.\n\n“The public is requested to continue acting in accordance with the Home Front Command’s guidelines.”\n\nThe strikes come after Donald Trump confirmed he had pulled the trigger on “major combat operations” against Iran – warning Tehran’s “menacing activities directly endanger the US and our allies”.\n\nIn an eight-minute speech on Truth Social, the US president urged Iranian officials to “lay down your arms” – or “face certain death”.\n\n\n\nHe described the attacks as “a noble mission”, saying they were necessary because of Iran’s pursuit of its nuclear programme and long-range missiles that could reach the US.\n\nThe US Department of Defense revealed the strikes on Iran have been named “Operation Epic Fury”.\n\nThe strikes in Iran are expected to last several days, two US officials told NBC news.\n\nThe UK did not take part in “Operation Epic Fury”, it is understood, and PM Sir Keir Starmer is expected to chair an emergency Cobra meeting today.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the chaos, many airlines have axed flights to the region, including to Dubai.\n\nKLM, Lufthansa, and Wizz Air are among operators who have scrapped flights until further notice.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nWizz Air has cancelled all flights to and from Israel, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Amman until March 7.\n\nThe airline said: “The airline is closely monitoring developments and remains in ongoing contact with local and international authorities, aviation safety agencies, security authorities, and relevant governmental bodies.”"

It’s completely abhorrent.\n\n“Churchill was a great Briton. This Government will always stand up for our values and the perpetrator must be held to account. We’re glad the police have made an arrest.”\n\nThe statue has been targeted by left wing demonstrators several times before.\n\nIn 2020, Black Lives Matter activists crossed out Churchill’s name and wrote “was a racist” on the base.\n\n\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters followed suit later that year and scrawled the same graffiti on the plinth.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nTrans rights demonstrators climbed on top of the sculpture in protest of the Supreme Court’s ruling on the definition of being a woman last year.\n\nIt is now a criminal offence for protesters to climb on the memorial following legislation passed last year."

            "content": "ISRAEL and the US have launched a huge attack on Iran as Donald Trump warns: “lay down your arms – or face certain death”.\n\nTrump confirmed he had pulled the trigger on major strikes in an operation dubbed Epic Fury as he vowed to obliterate Tehran’s missiles, and end the Ayatollah’s evil regime.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US president said: “For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted ‘Death to America’ and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed.\n\nIt comes as...\n\n“It’s been mass terror, and we’re not going to take it any longer.”\n\n\n\nThe U.S – Israeli strikes were met with a fierce response from Tehran as the regime launched missiles at sites across the middle east.\n\nIn an eight-minute address in the aftermath of the strikes, Trump said Iran had been attempting to rebuild its nuclear programme and was developing long-range missiles despite repeated warnings.\n\nConfirming “major combat operations” were underway to wipe out the “menacing activities endangering the US and allies”, he insisted “we are going to destroy Iran‘s missiles” and “annihilate their navy”.\n\nIn a stark warning, he told the Islamic Revolutionary Guard to “lay down their arms” – or “face certain death”.\n\n\n\nFollowing this morning’s strikes, explosions rocked several Gulf countries as Iran responded to the attack – blitzing Bahrain’s headquarters of the US Navy’s 5th Fleet.\n\nMeanwhile, sirens are reportedly sounding in Kuwait ahead of an expected strike as reports of an explosion in Abu Dhabi flood in.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates has now confirmed that it has closed its airspace amid the rapidly escalating incident with strikes now also reported to be taking place in Iraq.\n\nU.S bases in Kuwait, UAE, Qatar and Bahrain are understood to be under missile attack from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.\n\nExplosions have now also been reported in Dubai – including one near the marina, an area popular with tourists.\n\n\n\nIranian MP Ebrahim Azizi struck a defiant tone in the wake of the incident this morning.\n\n“We warned you!” Azizi wrote in a post on X. “Now you’ve started down a path whose end is no longer in your hands.”\n\n\n\nSeparately, hardline Iranian parliamentarian Alaeddin Boroujerdi said there would be no “red lines” in responding to the attack.\n\n“We had previously announced that we would have no red lines. We hope this action marks the beginning of the end of the Zionist regime,” he said in an interview with state TV.\n\n“Our response will be regret-inducing. We will use all of our capacities. Our rightful and necessary response, especially to the Zionist regime, will be delivered.”\n\nPresident Trump has urged Iranians to rally against the Ayatollah’s regime, adding: “The hour of your freedom is at hand.\n\n“When we are finished, take over your government, it will be yours to take.\n\n\n\n“This will be, probably, your only chance for generations. For many years, you have asked for America’s help, but you never got it.”\n\nIran has responded by launching a barrage of rockets at Israel, with air raid sirens ringing out in Tel Aviv.\n\nThe country’s air defence system has been seen working to shoot down the incoming Iranian missiles.\n\nAmid the strikes the UK Government said its priority is “the safety of UK nationals” in the Middle East but that it is “ready to protect our interests.”\n\nIt is understood the UK was not involved in the US and Israeli strikes on Iran – Sir Keir Starmer will chair a meeting of the Government’s emergency Cobra committee later this morning.\n\n\n\nIt comes after the US president spent weeks building up a formidable military presence in the Middle East.\n\nTrump warned the twisted Ayatollah he would be forced to blitz his regime if a nuclear deal put forward by Washington wasn’t signed off.\n\nIsrael this morning launched a “pre-emptive” daylight attack on Iran’s capital – with plumes of smoke seen rising from Tehran.\n\n\n\nStrikes against the rogue nation are being launched by the US by air and sea, one official told Reuters.\n\nThe first strike happened near Khamenei’s office in an attack Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, said was to “remove threats”.\n\nKhamenei, 86, hasn’t been seen publicly in days as tensions with the US have grown – and it is unclear whether he was in his offices at the time.\n\nBut the attack comes as the US has assembled a vast fleet of fighter jets and warships in the region to try to pressure Iran into a deal over its nuclear program.\n\n\n\nAnd yesterday, the UK evacuated embassy staff out of Iran – with China and Canada urging their citizens to leave immediately on Friday.\n\nWhite House officials were briefed about the possibility Trump could drop bombs last weekend after a surging build-up of US warships and attack jets within striking distance of Tehran.\n\nOn Friday morning, Canada and China urged its citizens to evacuate Iran “as soon as possible”. And the US Embassy in Jerusalem told all non-emergency government personnel to leave Israel.\n\nAround one third of the US Navy amassed within striking distance of Tehran marking the biggest military build-up in the Middle East since the US invaded Iraq in 2003.\n\nNegotiations over ending Iran’s nuclear programmes have been ongoing for weeks now but it appears Trump’s patience has finally worn thin.\n\n\n\nThe US are adamant that Iran has accelerated its efforts to build a nuclear bomb and was working on ballistic missiles which could strike America.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance accused Khamenei’s regime of rebuilding secret atom plants smashed by US stealth bomber strikes last June.\n\nTrump echoed the same claims in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, where he claimed Iran would soon be able to strike the US mainland.\n\nWashington warned they would launch a broad campaign against Iran’s nuclear facilities and heads of state if a deal wasn’t made, the WSJ reported.\n\nThe blitz comes as a relative shock after Trump declared at a Board of Peace ceremony on Thursday that he was giving Iran ten more days to sign off on the nuclear deal.\n\n\n\nIn recent weeks, the US had been building up a huge armada in the Middle East as they looked poised to strike on Trump’s command.\n\nThe mighty USS Gerald R. Ford joined up with the USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike group already in the region – putting two full carrier battle groups within reach of Tehran.\n\nA dozen other warships and hundreds of fighter jets equipped with advanced air-defence systems have also been stationed near Iran.\n\n\n\nAnd Trump’s first kamikaze drone squad, dubbed “Task Force Scorpion”, has been authorised for deployment.\n\nMeanwhile, Khamenei had warned last week that he would sink US warships lurking in the Persian Gulf if they showed any sign of preparing for a fight.\n\nThe tyrant said “the strongest army in the world might sometimes receive such a slap that it cannot get back on its feet.”\n\nWith a full-scale conflict looming, civilians in Iran are continuing to mourn the lives of those killed during nationwide protests which started in December.\n\nOfficial figures put the death toll from the horror attack on protesters at around 3,117.\n\n\n\nWhile US-based human rights news agency Hrana fears the number is likely above 6,500.\n\nToday’s attack is the second time Trump has directly launched strikes on Iran in the past eight months.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nBack in June 2025, Trump deployed bunker buster bombs on Iranian nuke sites in strikes named Operation Midnight Hammer.\n\nThe US claimed they wiped out the majority of Iran’s nuclear capabilities but Tehran vowed they were still able to enrich uranium from the sites.\n\nWhat has the US sent to the Middle East Aircraft Carriers: 2 – USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)\n\nUSS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78)\n\n2 – USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) Destroyers : 9\n\n: 9 Specialist ships : 3\n\n: 3 Fighter jets : 114+\n\n: 114+ Bombers : 6\n\n: 6 Missiles: 800+"

It didn’t crash. It was a runway excursion,” he incredulously claimed.\n\nSeveral drivers were left injured as the aircraft performed an emergency braking manoeuvre.\n\nThe total number of casualties is still unknown and a probe has been launched into the cause of the crash.\n\nReports indicate that the stricken plane was transporting valuables from the Central Bank of Bolivia.\n\nHundreds of banknotes were scattered in the wreckage.\n\n\n\nA fire truck also sprayed the aircraft with the airport’s water tanks in case of a blaze, although the plane did not explode.\n\nThe injured have been rushed to a nearby hospital to receive specialist care.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 300 officers are still guarding the crash site as an estimated 15,000 hopefuls gather outside.\n\n\n\nSome have reportedly tried to knock down a metal fence in a bid to get to the money.\n\nIt comes as another 15 people including a congressman were killed in a horror crash in Colombia last month.\n\nJust 12 minutes after take-off, authorities lost all communication with Satena Airlines Flight HK4709, which had two crew and 13 passengers on board.\n\nTragically, there were no survivors, Colombia’s civil aviation authority said.\n\nThe government-owned airline did not say what caused the crash and said the plane’s emergency beacon had not been activated.\n\n\n\nDiógenes Quintero, a member of Colombia’s House of Representatives, and congressional candidate Carlos Salcedo Salaza were both on board the flight, according to a passenger list released by the airline.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe crash site was found near Colombia’s border with Venezuela in Curasica, Playa de Belén, Norte de Santander.\n\nPolitical party Union for the People claimed members of its officials’ teams were also on board the flight."

The Greens, who had the Greater Manchester seat as 127th on their target list, were jubilant, describing the result as \"seismic\".

In a letter sent to all Labour MPs on Friday afternoon, he added: \"It hurts. But this is the kind of result that we have often seen parties of government face. In by-elections people can make their voice heard without risking a change of government. I get it: people are rightly impatient to see the change they voted for.\" A No10 source said: “We have a progressive manifesto which is popular with the public and we need to get on with the delivery. It’s not about copying the Greens platform. There is always a problem in Government that there are distractions. But there is a meaty agenda that we need to shout about. “The most important thing is the cost of living and we have to keep going at that really hard rather than giving up to go down another alley.\" The source added: “We have the Greens on one extreme and Reform on the other.

That's the truth and we can't deny it, \" he fumed on the Today programme. \"Andy Burnham would have been the MP for that seat now.\" But while some were keen to vent their anger on the airwaves the vast majority of Labour MPs - at least publicly - have remained silent so far.\n\nView 4 Images Labour had claimed it was a straight fight between them and Nigel Farage's candidate, Matthew Goodwin (Image: Getty Images)\n\nOne Labour MP said: “It was clear after the failed coup [against the PM] the other week that whilst people aren’t happy with us they don’t want pissing around.

It will be Mr Starmer’s biggest electoral test since the 2024 general election and one that could determine his future in Downing Street."

For decades Pentagon and Tel Aviv military planners have mapped out how to attack Iran and this new mass export of violence on the region will be debated for decades more.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut what comes afterwards will be crucial and it could mean years of terrorism exported far beyond the Middle East against the west as Iran’s fighters and proxies are unleashed. Iran’s shadowy Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp leaders may defect to a new leadership or, as happened in Iraq, go to ground and launch an insurgency against a new Iran. If the regime falls Hezbollah in Lebanon loses its support, perhaps a billion dollars a-year, and could use their global connections to launch terror attacks- along with Iran’s other proxies.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

For now the drama and fighting is in Iran but it may well spread. What happened in Iraq in 2003, which I reported on from the beginning, is a minor template for regime change in the region, toppling Saddam Hussein, but sparking violence in which some one million people died.\n\nMore than 20 years later the killing, years of unimaginable and cruel violence is largely over in Iraq but corruption seeps into every area of society and then there is Islamic State. War in Iraq gave birth to this monstrous group, a murder network spawned from al-Qaeda, dubbed ‘terror on steroids,’ with beheadings and drill tortures its video nasty publicity tool. And it is resurging yet again, our MI5 operators digging up plots against the UK and elsewhere from the region.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 7 Images The attack on Tehran is a joint US-Israel mission (Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nView 7 Images US President Donald Trump has been bullish over the strike on Iran (Image: TRUTH SOCIAL)\n\nManaging Iran in the months to come will be crucial and how it is done remains to be seen - but the mistakes of its neighbour Iraq may well be made once more. The implications for the rest of the world are huge as you cannot simply bomb the regime’s refrain “death to America” out of existence and it will be said in the shadows of terror networks.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd Britain is vulnerable too, even though our intelligence agencies and counter-terror police are the best in the world at trying to quell the rise of terror threats. For now smoke is rising over Tehran, the leadership has fled the capital and Iranian missiles are being fired at Israel, now on a war-footing for days, as the public flees for air-raid shelters.\n\nView 7 Images Explosions rock Tehran as attacks get under way (Image: AP)\n\nTel Aviv is on high-alert for an onslaught, sirens blaring as waves of missiles fired by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps head for the city.

These F-22 Raptors, the most lethal warplanes in the world, were the final piece in the huge military armada and air-attack force that America has grinded into position now for weeks.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThey paved the way for bigger stealth bombers and fighter jets to unleash bombs and missiles on Tehran’s defence and military installations. It is likely the first shots in a long-awaited attempt by Israel and America to change Tehran’s regime, which has dominated Middle Eastern aggression for decades.\n\nView 7 Images US newest aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford (Image: David Parody / SWNS)\n\nSources say the US -Israeli attack was from the air and the sea, meaning America’s powerful USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike force unleashed weapons from the Arabian Sea.

The catch is that people won't know what's in the 'mystery bag' until it's delivered.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Iceland Lucky Dip bags, which include a mystery selection of six surprise frozen products, took the internet by storm last week, with shoppers excitedly sharing the contents of their hauls online. The bags can be purchased by any online order when shoppers spend £25 or more, with the mystery six items then added to eligible baskets.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe contents of these bags are completely random, with some Iceland customers getting a few premium items for a bargain, such as turkey crowns, half lamb legs, luxury products and a lineup of branded frozen favourites.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOne shopper reviewing their bag on TikTok, said: “Wow. This is a lot of food for £4. That’s such a good deal! I think this is such a fantastic deal, this is possibly worth £30.”\n\nAnother TikTok user claimed their haul was the “bargain of the year\". They added that, for £4, they believe the bag contained around \"£24 worth of food”.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThese Lucky Dip bags, limited to two per customer, were previously available online but sold out quickly. The return will have fans excited to see what bargains they can grab, but shoppers have been warned that the supply of these mystery parcels will be limited.\n\nAn Iceland spokesperson said: \"The lucky dip bags will be available online only from Friday, February 27. The deal will run from Friday until Sunday (March 1) or until they sell out - and when they’re gone, they’re gone.\"\n\nShoppers are encouraged to head online and try their luck with a same-day delivery on the Iceland website. For full terms and conditions, go to the Iceland website here.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images The offer is only available for online shoppers (Image: Iceland)\n\nIn other supermarket news, popular chain Sainsbury's has installed a new security measure in some stores across the UK. But reports suggest that customers have spotted a ' major issue'.\n\nThe anti-theft sliders have been installed in front of certain items on shelves at a number of stores across the UK to prevent theft. The plastic sliders, also referred to as \"pushers\" or \"dividers\", were introduced to tackle \"shelf sweeping\" – a method in which thieves clear an entire row of goods into a bag or trolley in a single quick movement.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHowever, one shopper pointed out a problem with them on X, writing: \"Hey Sainsbury's, you've not only made the chocolate unstealable, but it's also unsellable. Can't even get it out without ripping the product to pieces. The whole shelf has these plastic sliders, so there are no gaps to slide them out of the way.\""

Dr Leigh Erin Connealy wrote The Cancer Revolution and has been practising medicine since 1986.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe now heads up the Center For New Medicine as medical director, where her expertise lies in both cancer prevention and treatment. The doctor has also amassed a substantial social media presence, regularly dishing out health advice to her followers.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHer content spans everything from fitness and lifestyle guidance for cancer prevention to snapshots of her professional life. According to Cancer Research UK, more than 1,100 people receive a cancer diagnosis daily, with the disease claiming 168,000 lives annually across the UK. Around half of those diagnosed live for a decade or longer, with tobacco use identified as the leading cause.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDr Connealy outlined her personal list of 10 things she avoids as a cancer-focused physician. She explained:\n\n1. Sleeping with my phone near my bed.\n\nChronic nighttime exposure to light and electromagnetic signals can disrupt sleep, which is downstream from nearly every repair and regulatory process in the body.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n2. Vegetable oils.\n\nIndustrial seed oils are high in unstable polyunsaturated fats that oxidize easily, contributing to lipid peroxidation and inflammation in cell membranes.\n\n3. Food heated in plastic.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHeat increases the leaching of plastics like phthalates and BPA, which act as endocrine disruptors and can interfere with hormone balance.\n\nLorraine doctor Amir Khan's two golden rules to cut risk of heart disease and inflammation READ MORE :\n\n4. Estrogen-only HRT. Unopposed estradiol stimulation can promote proliferation of cells. We want all hormones to be balanced, that includes progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA, and thyroid.\n\n5. Wireless headphones.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nProlonged close-range wireless exposure places radiofrequency signals directly near brain tissue for extended periods – something I minimise when possible.\n\n6. Fragranced laundry detergent.\n\nSynthetic fragrance blends often contain phthalates and volatile organic compounds that add to cumulative endocrine and chemical burden through daily skin contact.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n7. Non-stick cookware.\n\nDamaged or overheated non-stick coatings can release per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are persistent environmental toxins linked to cancer.\n\n8. Scented candles.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMany scented candles release carcinogenic volatile organic compounds and combustion byproducts.\n\n9. Printed receipts.\n\nThermal paper receipts frequently contain BPA or BPS, which can transfer to skin and contribute to endocrine disruption.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n10. Polyester workout clothing.\n\nSynthetic fabrics shed microplastics – increased skin contact with petroleum-derived fibres has been shown to alter hormone balance."

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

No finder's fee, no compensation,’ Rueda allegedly wrote in an email to his publicists at the time.\n\nManny Pacquiao is suing a law firm and their client for allegedly fabricating a case against him\n\nThe message never came to light despite a judge ordering Rueda’s messages be turned over in 2018, and was only uncovered from a forensic analysis by Pacquiao’s team in 2023.\n\nPacquiao’s lawyers say they traced the gruesome texts of body parts back to a mass-distributed cartel scam.\n\nRecords cited by his new lawsuit allegedly show identical threats were sent to more than 100 other people unconnected to the case.\n\nAfter losing the case, Withers Bergman tried to withdraw as Rueda’s lawyers, and his attorney Amman Khan’s profile was removed from the firm’s website.\n\nOver a decade on from their first encounter, Pacquiao is set for a stunning rematch with Mayweather in Las Vegas later this year.\n\nA Hollywood waiter sued Pacquiao in 2016 after claiming he was owed an $8million fee for helping to arrange his blockbuster May 2015 fight against Floyd Mayweather (pictured)\n\nThe fight icons will meet again in September in the first ever boxing match at 'The Sphere' off the strip in Sin City, it was announced earlier this week.\n\nThe bout is set to be globally broadcast on Netflix as part of the streamer's growing investment into live sports.\n\nMayweather, 49, first has to take on Mike Tyson, 59, in an exhibition bout this spring.

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Light heavyweight Joseph George suffered a head clash in the first round and then collapsed during the break between rounds. 😱\n\n\n\n#ShieldsCrewsDezurn2 pic.twitter.com/qH3AMEoDgw — Permante (@PermantexG) February 23, 2026\n\nJoseph George had to be rushed to hospital after collapsing during his fight with Atif Oberlton\n\nHylon Williams, George's trainer, has since confirmed that the fighter is 'undergoing an MRI' and is 'in stable condition at a Detroit hospital'.\n\nOberlton confirmed that he did get the chance to speak to George as he was escorted out of the ring, but he was 'a bit confused'.\n\n'I'm so glad that he got up on his feet and that he's OK,' said Oberlton. 'I'm a true champion, true warrior. We can do whatever you want to do it, but I'm just happy that he's OK.\n\n'I just wanted to make sure he was safe. At the end of the day, we're warriors, but we want to leave here the same way we come out.'\n\nLater in the night, Shields defended her undisputed heavyweight championship in dominant fashion, dispatching Crews-Dezurn by unanimous decision.\n\n\n\nThe 30-year-old American won 100-90 on all three judges' scorecards and remains unbeaten in her professional career, with a record of 18 wins."

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "Andre Onana is intent on reclaiming the No 1 spot at Manchester United, with his close friend revealing that 'things weren't right' for the Cameroonian under Ruben Amorim.\n\nOnana, 29, joined the Red Devils from Inter Milan in a £44million deal in July 2023, but inconsistent performances interspersed with a string of calamitous errors forced ex-boss Amorim to search for an alternative in last summer's transfer market.\n\nUnited landed Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp for £18m, shifting Onana to Turkish side Trabzanspor on loan in the process.\n\nThe young Belgian has impressed during his debut campaign at Old Trafford, and his performance in Monday night's 1-0 win at Everton earned him widespread praise - with Daily Mail Sport's Chris Wheeler tipping him to be the club's bedrock for another decade.\n\nBut with Amorim no longer at the club and United enjoying a new lease of life under interim boss Michael Carrick, Onana is seemingly up for the fight with his fellow stopper. A report in The Guardian this week claimed the 29-year-old is keen to return to United's starting XI once his loan comes to an end in May.\n\nAnd his countryman Geremi has shed light on Onana's state of mind.\n\nAndre Onana is eager to fight for his place in United's starting XI when his loan spell ends\n\nSpeaking to Telecom Asia via The Sun, Geremi said: 'Listen, I know Andre very well and during his time at United there were a lot of things that were not right.\n\n'It wasn't just him. And believe me, with the arrival of Michael Carrick, things are looking good for everyone, including him.\n\n'He is clearly talented and his gifts are rare. The next thing is for him to go back there and fight for his spot.\n\n'Andre has always excelled when faced with a challenge. He thrives when he's given a fair chance to prove himself.'\n\nThe former Chelsea star added that football's biggest clubs need big characters, and says Andre needs that same mentality to thrive at United.\n\nHe said: 'In my career I enjoyed playing in teams with big ambitions and big personalities.\n\n'If I had a few bad games, there was always someone knocking on the manager's door asking for a chance.\n\n'That meant I had to stand up, be counted and not walk away.\n\nHis replacement, Senne Lammens, has seriously impressed since joining the Red Devils\n\n'But that is for Andre to decide.'\n\nShould Carrick stay at the club beyond this season, Onana will have to seriously impress to dislodge Lammens from the team.\n\nAfter the Everton win, Carrick said of the Belgian: 'You want a goalkeeper to be reliable, trustworthy and, instead of creating the chaos, you want him to take the chaos away and calm things down.\n\n'I think Senne is that. He's quite quiet at times and unassuming but he's got a real steeliness. To step in, it's a big role – for some.'"

            "content": "The reality of being married to a professional footballer can be difficult. Wives and girlfriends – better known as WAGs – are constantly fighting to prove they are more than just trophy wives.\n\nThey are persistently put in a box, and it's not one that they always enjoy. Yes, WAGs are known for what their husbands do on the football pitch, but they have their own lives too.\n\nTake Victoria Beckham, for example. A megastar in the music world, winning five Brit Awards with the Spice Girls. She was, and still is, far from just 'David's wife'; she has her own uber-successful career in her own right.\n\nNot only this, but being the partner of a professional player who is constantly travelling around the country, or even the world, to do their job, can feel very lonely. Louise Redknapp once stated that she felt 'invisible' at times while married to former Tottenham and Liverpool star Jamie, and ultimately, the pair got divorced in 2017.\n\nIt's fair to say that being a WAG is not always as glamorous as it looks.\n\nLisa Muller, who is married to Bayern Munich legend Thomas Muller, has now opened up on how she gets treated being the wife of one of German football's greatest-ever forwards. Spoiler alert: it's not all sunshine and rainbows.\n\nThomas Muller's wife Lisa (right) has claimed she no longer cares what people think of her\n\nLisa, 36, has a somewhat successful sporting career herself as a professional dressage rider, winning a variety of competitions, including the Stuttgart Masters in 2019.\n\nOver the years, though, as her husband racked up a series of accolades, people often saw her as just his wife, not as the athlete she is.\n\nThis used to frustrate her hugely, and she would often feel the need to prove herself to banish those views from people's minds. These days, though, she places no value on what people think and just lives her life.\n\nSpeaking at a campaign event via Bild, Lisa said: 'At first, I tried for a long time to fight against it and say: I'm more than that, I can ride. Now I don't care anymore.'\n\nThomas and Lisa met in 2007, while the former was still in the Bayern academy, looking to make a name for himself.\n\nThey were only 18 years of age when they first came across each other, but they didn't hang back, getting married only two years later.\n\nThe majority of the Mullers' marriage has been spent in Bavaria, where Thomas spent 17 years playing for the Bundesliga's most successful club, and Lisa regularly rides.\n\nHowever, the dynamic of their marriage changed due to Thomas's move to MLS side Vancouver Whitecaps. Lisa opted to stay in Germany despite the move, with the pair now living 5,200 miles and over a 10-hour flight apart.\n\nShe continued: 'As an athlete, he knows how much I live for my sport. As an athlete, I know how much he lives for his.\n\n'The decision to continue working on two continents wasn't easy for us. We wouldn't leave our stud farm unattended for a year.'\n\nLisa has always made it clear that she won't throw away her career by moving away from Germany, just because of potential opportunities for Muller.\n\nLisa has her own successful career as a dressage rider and she also owns a farm with Thomas\n\nShe has too much going on in her homeland. Not only does she regularly ride and work at her own stables, but alongside Thomas, she has a rather interesting entrepreneurial venture.\n\nThe couple own a company called EU Insemination Station, a breeding farm for their horses, and it's fair to say it brings in a more than healthy amount of money on the side.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, rumours were ramping up that Thomas was close to joining Manchester United from Bayern, which would have been a huge move at the time. However, Louis van Gaal has since said that Lisa blocked the move due to her desire to stay in Bavaria.\n\nVan Gaal said of Lisa's involvement: 'In 2015, it would have been possible if his wife had been a little more open to a transfer abroad.\n\n'At least that was the reason Thomas gave my assistant Marcel Bout, who had had all the conversations with him, why the transfer had been rejected.'\n\nOutside of riding, Lisa is trying to expand her horizons, challenging herself by getting involved in politics in Germany.\n\nLast year, Lisa, who hails from the Miesbach district, is now part of the Christian Social Union party and has completed an internship with the Bavarian State Parliament. She was even asked if she would consider running as a candidate for their next election.\n\nHowever, she declined because, in her own words, she was ‘too much of a chicken'.\n\nDespite all of this, Lisa still feels there are people who downplay her intellect before even having a conversation with her.\n\nLisa has always made it clear that she won't throw away her career by moving away from Germany\n\n'It's sometimes quite amusing,' she added. 'I'm always considered the dumbest person in the room.\n\n'Sometimes it's nice to be considered the silly one, then you can impress people more when they talk to you.'\n\nPolitics will continue to play a big part in Lisa's life moving forward, even when Thomas inevitably moves back from his venture across the pond.\n\n'The CSU is my political home,' she has told Antenne Bayern radio station, and in the future she may just turn from party member to candidate.\n\nThen there can't be anybody who can call her the so-called 'dumbest in the room'."

Being blunt about everything that everyone thought wasn't right,' he added.\n\n'If you're five or six weeks in and you think he's not delivering, okay, then you have a point. But to throw out such strong opinions based on his first half hour, I thought, was inappropriate.'\n\nAfter Sterling's cameo appearance last Sunday, one Instagram account called FootballPark, boasting almost 100k followers, wrote that the ex-England international looked like 'Bambi on Ice' and even suggested he should consider retiring.\n\nThe author, who was by no means the only social media account ripping into the footballer, posted: 'Raheem Sterling's debut for Feyenoord was not exactly a success story – in fact, it looked like a veritable disaster from the Dutch club's point of view.\n\n'The English winger looked like Bambi on ice. On a downward spiral since 2022, lacking motivation, and seemingly unable to play under anyone who isn't named Pep Guardiola, Sterling is well and truly into his twilight years. Is it time to hang the boots up once and for all?'\n\nSterling's former Manchester City team-mate Jack Grealish jumped in to defend the 31-year-old star online, taking issue with the post.\n\n'What a f*****g stupid Instagram post man what's wrong with you guys. Guy hasn't played or trained for so long. Ppl like u guys is what wrong with the world. Have some respect,' he wrote."

A pathway for ambitious clubs remains (at least in theory), while new investors can be confident they are not throwing money into a black hole.\n\nAfter the RFU council approved the changes yesterday, Exeter Chiefs owner Tony Rowe told Daily Mail Sport that investor confidence immediately spiked.\n\nNow 77, Rowe is speaking to new investors and negotiations can now advance with financiers in America. ‘We’re talking to a couple of investors and one of them wanted to wait to hear what happened this week,’ he said.\n\n‘English rugby is desperate for money but it’s difficult to find investment because of the worry of relegation. Red Bull didn’t just come along and say, “we don’t mind if we get relegated”. They were banking on this decision.\n\n‘I’m certain we’ll see more big names invest in English rugby now. Money dictates where sport goes and if somebody wants to pay handsomely to change the name of Exeter I have no doubt that might happen.\n\n‘We’re in the market for a partner investor. It’s going to cost you somewhere between £50m and £100millon to get a Prem side together with a stadium. I’m sure there are people out there interested in doing it.\n\n‘There are talks about rugby at the new stadium in Birmingham. Yorkshire has more rugby clubs than any other county but none of them perform at the top level so it would be nice to see another club there. Maybe someone in the North West. We want people to come into the Prem and first we want to get back to 12 clubs.’\n\nThe likes of Ollie Chessum, Freddie Steward and Fraser Dingwall have all played in the second division and the competition must not be set up to fail. It is key the chances of promotion remain genuine if teams meet the relevant criteria.\n\nSeason ticket renewals for Norwich City are among the highest in the country because it is a remote part of the country which has little other professional sport on offer\n\nYorkshire has not had a Premiership team since 2011, when Leeds Carnegie went down - a year later, they sold their P shares in the competition to Exeter Chiefs\n\nThe perfect scenario is more big hitters enter the market and rugby’s ecosystem grows. We could see more investment into playing squads, stronger academies and a trickle-down effect on the Champ.\n\nWe have seen London Irish, Wasps and Worcester fold under the financial pressures of professional sport but, after years of turmoil, there is an opportunity for new shoots to appear off the beaten path."

If you win a trophy here you'll go down in history - this fanbase deserves good times': KIERNAN DEWSBURY-HALL on being 'ready' for England, the 'mental block' his team have at new stadium and his guilty pleasure\n\nUnlock more of the best of our journalism with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight and the writers you love every day\n\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall always thought he would play for David Moyes, ever since the Everton manager tried to sign him for West Ham.\n\n‘It felt like I needed to work with him at some point,’ he says. But then close relationships with managers don’t always take you where you think they will.\n\nTwo summers ago, Dewsbury-Hall followed Enzo Maresca from Leicester to Chelsea only to find himself on the fringes. Two Premier League starts in a season was not what he thought Chelsea had paid £30million for.\n\n‘There were times when it felt very dark,’ Dewsbury-Hall admits. ‘If I am not playing, I can feel useless. I am very emotional.’\n\nNow, three-quarters of the way through a debut season at Everton, Dewsbury-Hall can talk about a career revived and some ambitions of winning a first cap for his country that have not been discouraged by England manager Thomas Tuchel.\n\n‘I've spoken to him once or twice,’ he tells Daily Mail Sport. ‘He was at Old Trafford when I scored. He was at Fulham when I scored. So I wouldn't mind him coming to more games! He's been complimentary and told me to stick at it. I feel like I am ready now. I feel like I am moving forwards again.’\n\nIn his debut season at Everton, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall can talk about a career revived and some ambitions of winning a first cap for his country\n\n'I feel like I am ready (to play for England) now. I feel like I am moving forwards again.’\n\nDuring a season of change – most of it positive – at Everton, Dewsbury-Hall stands out. Jack Grealish was the big-name signing but injury has ended his season. Young Tyler Dibling has struggled. Dewsbury-Hall, now 27, has assumed the role of senior player quite naturally.\n\n‘When I broke through at Leicester I just went on to the pitch trying to do the right thing,’ he says. ‘Now I've got a different mentality. I want to stand out.\n\n‘The manager and myself have history. He's known me for a while. He was interested when he was at West Ham. So it felt like the right time now to come to him. I just genuinely thought it would click here and it has. I know if I had the opportunity at Chelsea, it would have been the same.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall was a late developer and a thinker. It’s not always a great combination. As a teenager he interpreted his slow physical progress as a weakness. But now that he’s through all that, a clear intellect radiates and it’s to his benefit.\n\nFew footballers are as engaging or as curious. Two years into a degree in sports management, he has concerns about the direction football is taking on and off the field. He is also obsessed with West End musicals – 'my guilty pleasure' – and is convinced he will stand on a different kind of stage one day. Meanwhile he is an accomplished snooker and pool player.\n\n‘I do like to learn,’ the Nottingham-born midfielder says in his broad East Midlands accent. ‘I don't just like sitting on my backside doing nothing.’\n\nIn three weeks, fatherhood beckons. A little girl. That learning process is about to be accelerated and maybe it’s fitting, then, that Everton chose him to visit Much Woolton Primary School, 10 miles from Hill Dickinson Stadium, to read to a class of 25 children ahead of World Book Day next week.\n\nThe kids are blindfolded and have to guess the identity of their ‘secret reader’ as Dewsbury-Hall makes his way slowly through a page of a Harry Potter book he has chosen. When his identity is revealed, there is classroom bedlam. An enthusiastic signing session follows, as Dewsbury-Hall makes his way from table to table talking about books, reading and a fair bit of football.\n\nThe kids at Much Woolton Primary School are blindfolded and have to guess the identity of their ‘secret reader’ as Dewsbury-Hall reads a page of a Harry Potter book he has chosen\n\nWhen his identity is revealed, there is classroom bedlam. Dewsbury-Hall makes his way from table to table talking about books, reading and a fair bit of football\n\n‘You know, I was really nervous before going in there,’ he smiles as he sits down to talk in the headteacher’s office. ‘I haven't read out loud for a while. Football's not easy but I'm used to that, aren’t I? I thought, \"God, if I start making mistakes here, I'll make myself look like a right sausage\". But no, it was good in the end.’\n\nChildren can be blunt. At one stage, Dewsbury-Hall is asked by an eight-year-old why Everton can’t win at home. It’s a theme we return to. Ahead of today’s visit to Newcastle, Everton sit ninth despite having won only twice at their new Hill Dickinson Stadium in the Premier League since the start of November, and none of the last six.\n\n‘I do think there's maybe a little mental block there at the moment,’ he admits. ‘That does happen in football. I truly believe it. Something will happen in a game and it will just knock us for six or it will change the way we play. Whereas away, we know what we're doing.\n\n‘We do talk about it. I'm not gonna lie to you. We're humans. We ask ourselves why it goes wrong. We have tried training on the pitch and stuff and will probably do it again.’\n\nReflection is common in football and Dewsbury-Hall is prone to it. His home library comprises largely of autobiographies and motivational business books but not much of it prepared him for what happened at Chelsea.\n\nFollowing Maresca to Stamford Bridge in 2024 felt like the next step. Instead, Dewsbury-Hall found himself buried beneath a mountain of midfield bodies. He was the only player to feature in all 15 games of the club’s Conference League triumph and had some minutes at the Club World Cup. But every weekend brought Premier League disappointment.\n\n‘I had a lot of options but signed for Chelsea genuinely thinking I was gonna play,’ he says. ‘I believed I could. I know I could. And then football is football. Things happen.\n\n‘Obviously the competition was high. Rival midfielders were £100m players (Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez). It was a strange dynamic at times. It was quite fortunate for the club that the manager could field two very strong teams.\n\nHe was the only player to feature in all 15 games of the club’s Conference League triumph and had some minutes at the Club World Cup\n\nHis home library comprises largely of autobiographies and motivational business books but not much of it prepared him for being overlooked by Enzo Maresca at Chelsea\n\n‘But it was weird - it almost felt like no matter how well I played in midweek, I would not play at the weekend and that was the only thing that didn't sit well with me. In football it's important, if you're playing well, that you get the chance to play. I'm a very emotional guy. If I'm not playing, I feel useless, basically. I feel like I haven't got a purpose because that's my life.\n\n‘So yeah, there were dark times where I thought, “I don't care about money or anything else. I just wanna play football, so why aren’t I?”.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall’s relationship with Maresca meant there were regular conversations but not reassurances. ‘He was as honest as maybe he could be,’ the player adds. ‘He said some things that I wanted to hear and maybe some things that I didn't want to hear. He told me I had to be patient and said I wasn’t as big a fish in a pond as I was at Leicester.\n\n‘I am not gonna cry over it. I know if I did play more I would have been able to show people what I could do. In my head, that's a fact. But the strategy worked for the club, didn’t it? They won trophies and they got in the top four.\n\n‘I could easily have stayed at Chelsea for much longer but I wanted to go to a club with a project and be a main player. Everton felt perfect. Seamus Coleman has been here 17 years and tells me to imagine what winning a trophy would be like.\n\n‘If you can do that here, you'll go down in history books. This fanbase deserves good times and it gave me that extra motivation to come. Now I'm in such a better place. People look at me in a different light I hope.’\n\nRelationships with coaches and managers are always key to a player’s development. Dewsbury-Hall has had his bumps in the road and sometimes they have been impossible to see coming.\n\nAt Leicester, the club he joined aged eight, Brendan Rodgers gave him his senior debut at the age of 21 but he soon learned that managers have egos too.\n\nAt Leicester, the club he joined aged eight, Brendan Rodgers (right) gave him his senior debut at the age of 21 but he soon learned that managers have egos too\n\nScoring the winning goal at Old Trafford in November as David Moyes' side pulled off a famous win with 10 men\n\n‘He organised a pool tournament and everyone had to join in,’ recalls Dewsbury-Hall, a friend of four-time world snooker champion Mark Selby, the 'Jester from Leicester'. ‘I was playing for a pub team when I was 10 years old. I mean, I can play.\n\n‘I was young at the time – wasn’t a first-team player – but was drawn to play him (Rodgers) in the first round. I said to the lads: “Do I try my hardest?” Because he was having himself. He was going, “I'm really good at pool” and all the lads thought he fancied himself to win the whole thing.\n\n‘Quite a few people were watching and I beat him 3-0 and you could tell he was raging. I've just gone, “Yeah, sorry gaffer” and a week later got sent out on loan to Blackpool. So yeah, I mean, that was a fun week of my life.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall’s talents as a snooker player are not in doubt. As an actor, there is not yet any proof but he does yearn to find out. His love of the West End runs deep. He has watched endless shows in London and on New York's Broadway, and has contacts and friends in the business. A few years ago he was due to have a brief role through a BBC project in The Lion King but an injury got in the way.\n\nHe has tried and failed to encourage interest in various team-mates. ‘They just look at me like I am alien,’ he says. 'But one day I genuinely believe I'll do something in the West End.\n\n‘I resonate with what they do every night, giving their best to a completely new set of eyes. That's hard to do, so I respect them so much.’\n\nIn terms of the football, Dewsbury-Hall looks at where the game is going and, along with many others inside and outside of dressing rooms, has concerns about the influence of money, endless VAR checks, 100-minute matches and social media.\n\nAsked if the game is losing a bit of its innocence, he says: ‘Yeah, a little bit. And look, I'm old school. I'm an old head. That's why I hang around with people like Seamus.\n\nDewsbury-Hall looks at where football is going and has concerns about the influence of money, endless VAR checks, 100-minute matches and social media\n\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel was at Craven Cottage earlier this month to see Dewsbury-Hall score in the win over Fulham\n\n‘It's going away from that sort of old-school football isn’t it? It’s the way the world's going. Football’s more business now than it was. It will only increase. I just don't want it to lose its identity and lose why we fell in love with the game. I grew up watching Match of the Day and all I cared about was seeing people score goals. I don't want kids in 10 years watching it and going: “What is this?”\n\n‘It should be about the love. But look at the last week. The north London derby is taking 15 minutes to get restarted. Lloyd Kelly gets sent off for Juventus in the Champions League for the most ridiculous thing in the world. Rules are rules in football but sometimes you just need to smell a situation.\n\n‘The players, we're humans just like you. We grew up watching the sport. It's obviously just because we're inside it now, it's a bit more close to home. But we see the same things you see. We have the same concerns.’\n\n\n\nFor now, Dewsbury-Hall is probably too busy to save football. But Everton have a fine player and the rest of us have a genuine thinker in our midst. He is in Tuchel’s thoughts for a reason."

            "content": "When Rodrigo Gomes sealed Wolves' victory with a handful of seconds remaining, Unai Emery had seen enough.\n\nThe Aston Villa boss marched straight down the tunnel and when Rob Edwards approached the away dugout at full-time to shake hands, Emery was nowhere to be seen. Soon after full-time his captain, Ezri Konsa, appeared to be restrained by a Villa staff member. There were suggestions Konsa had exchanged cross words with some away supporters.\n\n'In September I was worried about being in the relegation zone,' said Emery, referring to Villa's poor start. 'Then maybe a month ago I was dreaming of fighting with Manchester City and Arsenal for the title.\n\n'We are having a great season and I want to tell our fans now that we need them. We are grateful for them for being with us but at Villa Park we need their help. We need to be together – players, coaches, fans, everyone.\n\n'Our points total is similar to clubs who have finished in the top five before. We are competing against great teams and for them it is necessary to finish in the Champions League. We need to keep our position.'\n\nJoao Gomes' opener and Rodrigo's clincher means Wolves eclipse Derby's record low points total from 2007-08 and they deserved their win. 'I have not been especially focused on [the total] but it is important for the club and the fans,' acknowledged Edwards.\n\nAston Villa will have fears over their Champions League spot again after losing 2-0 at Wolves\n\nUnai Emery was left with his head in his hands as his third-place side stumbled at Molineux\n\nThe lasting image of the night, however, was Emery's touchline meltdown. Villa fans hope their toiling team do not follow suit as they fear a Champions League place will slip from their grasp for the second season in a row. Their next two fixtures are against fellow contenders Chelsea and Manchester United.\n\nAsked about the pressure on Villa, Morgan Rogers said: 'It does weigh on us but it shouldn't. We deserve to be here and we should not forget that. There is nothing to worry about.'\n\nEmery's early exit was no surprise. From the moment he gave Jadon Sancho an earful midway through the first half, the Spaniard looked ready to boil over. 'Only seven?!' he seemed to scream at the fourth official after the stoppage time board was raised, with his side chasing an equaliser. Earlier, Emery appeared to ignore Emi Buendia and Lucas Digne when they were substituted, his frustration growing when play was delayed due to an issue with referee Craig Pawson's earpiece.\n\nEmery is one of the finest managers in Villa's history but this was not his finest hour. From the moment the team sheet landed, his night started going wrong. Ollie Watkins and Lucas Digne ahead of the in-form Tammy Abraham and the adventurous Ian Maatsen. Really?\n\nThen there was his demeanour throughout the game. Emery is always full of nervous energy on the touchline and usually it is a positive force. Here, though, it could not possibly have been.\n\nVilla are still third in the table, six points ahead of Liverpool in sixth, and are favourites for the Europa League.\n\nVilla needed Emery to be calm. Instead he acted like a man who was watching everything go up in smoke, though he had cooled down by the time he faced the media.\n\nIn this form, Villa will struggle to succeed at home or in Europe. When Joao Gomes gave Wolves the lead just after the hour mark, only Ezri Konsa and Digne tried to encourage their team-mates. Konsa and Amadou Onana berated Buendia for dragging his heels as the Argentine walked to the bench after being substituted.\n\nWolves know they are down but there are still certain matches that can bring some light in the darkness. One is next week's FA Cup fifth-round tie against Liverpool. The other is the chance to knock over one of their local rivals.\n\nThe absence of key players is starting to take its toll on Villa. Shorn of Boubacar Kamara, as well as John McGinn and Youri Tielemans, they look half the team.\n\nJoao Gomes (above) struck midway through the second half to put Wolves in the ascendancy, before Rodrigo Gomes grabbed the hosts' second goal with virtually the last kick of the game\n\nVilla's dismal defeat marked just the second time Wolves have won in the league this season\n\nThe early signs were not promising. Buendia's clumsy challenge on Jean-Ricner Bellegarde gave Wolves a free-kick that Mateus Mane sent just wide from 22 yards. Many expected Abraham to be preferred to Watkins here and in the sixth minute Watkins wasted a great chance to repay that faith.\n\nSent clear by Morgan Rogers, Watkins hesitated just long enough for Yerson Mosquera to steal the ball before the forward could even shoot. Moments later, Pau Torres wasted a free header from Douglas Luiz's corner. Luiz then volleyed straight at Jose Sa and at the other end, Mateus Mane put a free-kick just wide and Toti Gomes miscued a volley.\n\nThe pattern did not change in the second half until, moments after Emery had made a double change, Jackson Tchatchoua crossed from the right, Adam Armstrong laid the ball off and Gomes crashed it in off the bar from 15 yards. Maatsen's arrival made a difference and his rising shot forced Sa into another sharp stop and Mosquera cleared off the line from Abraham before Rodrigo sealed it in front of the South Bank."

'We have earned the right to be in a strong position (with) what we've done in the group stage, and that's it.\n\n‘And now we need to start to analyse them and find ways to be better than them (Bayer Leverkusen), to try to go through the tie.’\n\n\n\nAsked if the route ahead gives him excitement, Arteta added: ‘Yeah, we are really excited. Obviously, being in the forefront and the way the team is consistently performing gives you a lot of hope and positive thoughts about what is coming.'"

Robert Milkins won one of snooker's most historic tournaments just three years ago after defeating Shaun Murphy 9-7 in the final, having seen off Mark Selby and Mark Allen earlier in the event.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, the Milkman has been missing from the 2026 edition in Llandudno this week following a qualifying defeat to youngster Liam Pullen. The loss extended a concerning pattern for the 49-year-old, who has competed on the World Snooker Tour continuously since 1995.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThis campaign has seen him grapple with the possibility of losing his card. In October, he was provisionally placed as low as 74th, with players finishing the season beyond the top 64 forfeiting their cards and needing to go through the notoriously tough Q-School to reclaim them.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nProgression to the last 16 of the Xi'an Grand Prix in October hauled him back into the top 64 but he hasn't managed to replicate that showing since. Currently, Milkins, now 60th on the provisional rankings, would hold on to his tour card for another campaign.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

Nikolas Sanchez was competing at the ATP Challenger in Rosario, Argentina, earlier this month.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut before his round-of-16 clash against his Argentine opponent, the 26-year-old from Barcelona was sent a chilling death threat from gamblers demanding he throw the match. Having initially dismissed it as a prank, the gravity of the situation became clear when the culprits revealed they had his family's personal information and home address.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSanchez alerted his coach to the text messages, who quickly reported the matter to the appropriate authorities. He was then escorted to the players' room, where he remained in isolation for three hours.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

It was from an unknown number. I said yes and three minutes later, they wrote again.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWorld Cup chaos as Mexican gang violence sparks major security fears READ MORE :\n\nTennis chiefs told to rescue stars in Mexico after cartel chief’s death sees violence erupt READ MORE :\n\n\"They told me they had located my family and wrote me their full names, both my parents' and my brother's. They wrote me the exact family address: street, building, floor and door. They invited me to secretly lose the match I was going to play but warned me not to say anything, otherwise my family would be kidnapped and I would suffer serious consequences.\n\n\"How did they get my phone number? This has never happened to me before, which is what's worrying, that they also knew my ID number. They tell me that if I don't comply with their demands, I won't get out of there alive.\n\n\"I look around and search for someone who is laughing, thinking it's a joke. The second thing I do is look for someone I don't know in the area, mainly because I fear something serious will happen to me if I don't follow the instructions. Within a few minutes, I rule out that it's a joke... basically because, if it weren't and then what they say actually happened, I could never forgive myself. My family suffering because of a tennis match? This cannot happen under any circumstances.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSanchez admitted he considered pulling out of the match entirely, desperate only to return home to his family in Spain. But he couldn’t get the match postponed after trying to delay it as long as possible and ended up playing, as he couldn’t afford to forfeit the points and prize money.\n\nHe continued: \"I was contacting my family to make sure they were okay but without conveying the fear I felt inside, as there was no point in calling them in tears. I tried to locate them first, call them home and ask them not to go out for a walk or anything like that.\n\nView 2 Images Sanchez received a text telling him to lose his next match (Image: Getty)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"With no experience in such a situation, we all did the best we could. The tournament director was incredible, providing me with maximum security at all times. Those were moments of anguish and great fear.\n\n\"Could there be someone in the doorway of my building? My brother is coming back from the gym. Could there be someone following him? The match is no longer a priority; I'm even considering not playing. At this time of year, all players tend to receive horrible messages.\n\n\"In the end, you put up with everything that comes your way until one day this happens. My intention now is to draw a line of zero tolerance, hire a solicitor and spend money on these resources, and react immediately to the first message. They must pay for what they have done; I see no other solution.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nSanchez broke down in tears at the end of the match, his performance visibly affected by lapses in concentration throughout. He flew home the next morning and will return to competitive action in Argentina this week at Challenger de Tigre II.\n\nHe revealed plans to change his phone number but admitted he lacks the financial means to relocate, while authorities continue their search for the perpetrator."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Now 30 years since the Dallas Cowboys' last Super Bowl appearance, owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he has let the fans down with his team's championship drought.\n\n\"I really can't accept just the thought of winning one Super Bowl and then what?\" Jones said Friday night from the NFL scouting combine. \"I've got more time on my clock than that in my mind. And so I don't see it that way. I see a chance to put a team together and basically be knocking at the edge and get another one or get a chance at a another one.\n\n\"It runs that way in my view. ... Make no mistake about it now, if you told me I could, because I've done a lot of hitchhiking in my life. ... I'd start here with you right now and hitchhike back to Dallas to win a Super Bowl.\"\n\nAfter a 7-9-1 finish in 2025, Jones promised change. One change will be the team's approach to free agency.\n\nThe Cowboys have not relied heavily on free agency in years, choosing to pick their spots to shore up holes on the roster with cost-effective players.\n\n\"I would bet that we will spend more money in free agency than we have,\" Jones said.\n\nTo do so, the Cowboys will first have to create salary cap room. Well over the $301.2 million cap that was set Friday, they will restructure the contracts of quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and left guard Tyler Smith, which will create $66 million of room.\n\nJones said the Cowboys will rework the contracts of defensive tackles Kenny Clark, Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa, who are scheduled to count around $63 million against the cap. With Clark and Williams, the Cowboys can look to add voidable years to their contracts then restructure that way.\n\n\"I want you to know that the only way to push more [out] is for me to go borrow some of my future, OK?\" Jones said. \"Expect me to go borrow some of my future.\"\n\nTo Jones, it goes beyond his personal Super Bowl wishes.\n\n\"I look at where we are with Dak and I look at where he is in his career. And I look at some of the pluses that we have on our front and what we think we can do there. And what we can do with [George] Pickens and Lamb and what we can do with our running back that we just signed [Javonte Williams],\" Jones said. \"And so all of those things I want to do everything we possibly can to stop somebody and to basically win some third downs more than we did last year. And so I think that would be the area that you would see me bust the budget. Where you would see me do that is what we're doing defensively.\n\n\"And I would expect anybody that's a Cowboy fan or a critic of the Cowboys to say, 'Duh, that's not hard to see, Jerry, to do.' But I guess what I'm doing is saying, yes, I intend to do that if given the opportunity.\"\n\nThe Cowboys defense finished at or near the bottom of the league in yards and points allowed in 2025. Christian Parker has been hired as the new defensive coordinator, and Jones acknowledged the need for more than just one or two new players, while also saying players that were on the defense in 2025 will be better in 2026 \"because the situation has changed.\"\n\nWith two first-round picks, the Cowboys have an opportunity to add more talent to their defense. Jones would not rule out the possibility of making trades, like the additions of Williams from the New York Jets and Clark from the Green Bay Packers for Micah Parsons.\n\n\"I don't know that I'd expect it but we have the ammunition to be good at it,\" Jones said. \"And I wouldn't hesitate to be good at it if it will help our team and help the timeline that we're talking about.\"\n\nNow 83, Jones was introspective at times during the hourlong meeting with reporters. His resolve to win a championship is strong.\n\n\"It's every bit the prize of anything I have, with the exception of family and your love for family,\" Jones said. \"I guess what I would say is make no mistake about it, I don't have a higher priority than to go and win a Super Bowl.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- After Denver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic tumbled to the Paycom Center court early in the fourth quarter Friday night, he determined that he needed to react to what he considered a dirty tactic by Oklahoma City Thunder guard Luguentz Dort.\n\nA chippy game between rivals who faced off in a seven-game series in last season's Western Conference semifinals escalated into a heated confrontation at that point, resulting in Dort's ejection and double technical fouls on Jokic and Oklahoma City center Jaylin Williams.\n\nThe fracas began when Dort appeared to trip Jokic as he ran up the court with 8:03 remaining in the fourth quarter. Dort backed into Jokic and stuck out his right foot, knocking down the big man, who quickly pounced to his feet to angrily confront Dort.\n\n\"It's an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction,\" Jokic said after the Nuggets' 127-121 overtime loss to the defending champions. \"There is no such thing -- I think there's not supposed to be those things on a basketball floor. So, it was just an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction by me.\"\n\nAfter Jokic chest-bumped Dort, Williams rushed over to intervene. Jokic and Williams exchanged shoves and grabbed each other's jerseys as a scrum of players, coaches, officials and staffers formed around them and eventually separated them.\n\n\"Just competing,\" Williams told ESPN. \"Two teams competing, that's it. That's all I got.\"\n\nAfter a review, the foul called against Dort was upgraded to a flagrant foul 2, resulting in an automatic ejection. Crew chief James Williams told a pool reporter that the officials \"deemed [Dort's] contact on Jokic to be unnecessary and excessive with a high potential for injury.\" Williams also cited the contact leading to an \"altercation that did not dissolve\" as a reason for upgrading it to a flagrant foul 2.\n\n\"I will say this: If [Williams] is running up the floor and gets tripped, we expect a flagrant 2 from this point forward,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \"That's all. If that's the precedent, if that becomes a malicious play and flagrant 2 is the line in the sand on that, we would expect that if it's [Williams]. We would expect that if it's anybody. And if that's the case, we're good.\"\n\nAsked if he believed the play was ruled a flagrant 2 because the foul was committed against a three-time MVP, Daigneault said: \"No, I'm not going to answer the question like that. I said what I needed to say about it.\"\n\nNuggets star Nikola Jokic confronts Thunder guard Luguentz Dort, who was called for a flagrant foul 2 after an apparent trip in the fourth quarter. Jokic and OKC's Jaylin Williams received technical fouls. Photo by Joshua Gateley/Getty Images\n\nThe referees determined that the actions of Jokic and Jaylin Williams during the altercation did not rise to the level of an ejection, James Williams said in the pool report.\n\nThe fracas overshadowed the return of reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had 36 points on 12-of-29 shooting and dished out nine assists in 34 minutes. Gilgeous-Alexander sat out the overtime period because he had reached his minutes limit after missing the previous nine games because of an abdominal strain suffered Feb. 3.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was called for a technical foul in the first quarter when he responded to Jokic's post-whistle contact by throwing the ball at him. James Williams told the pool reporter that Jokic was not called for a technical on that play because the officials determined that his contact with his left forearm did not rise to the level of an unsportsmanlike act.\n\n\"They're obviously a high-level team, we're a high-level team, and we've seen each other a lot in the past couple of years, so we might be a little bit more into the game just because we know the opponent,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"It was fun. It was good out there. End-of-season basketball is like that. It's that chippy, that physical, so it was good to get one of those in the regular season.\"\n\nThe Nuggets fell to 4-7 since Jokic returned from a monthlong absence, including 1-6 in clutch games (within five points in the final five minutes) during that span. Jokic recorded his league-leading 22nd triple-double with 23 points, 17 rebounds and 14 assists against the Thunder, but his uncharacteristic recent shooting struggles continued, as he went 9-of-25 from the floor and 2-of-10 from 3-point range.\n\nJokic, who was 3-of-5 from the free throw line, animatedly protested no-calls after several of his shots. There were also multiple instances of Jokic bumping and shoving with Thunder players during the game.\n\n\"I think his frustration is sometimes because the game's officiated differently out on the floor than it is near the basket, and I think he was reacting to what was being done to him,\" Nuggets coach David Adelman said. \"And his reaction's not going to be to cower away. He's competitive. ... I know why he's frustrated. I can feel his frustration with all the contact out there. He shot five free throws.\n\n\"It's just part of the game. The closer you get to the basket, it seems like for a bigger guy, it seems like it's called a little bit different, but he has to react to that the right way. Concentrate and finish through contact. And obviously with Dort's play, I think that took it to a different level for him. He felt like it was malicious, also.\"\n\nThe Nuggets and Thunder meet again March 9 in Oklahoma City."

Including the playoffs, it was the club's third-highest percentage in a game in the shot clock era (since 1954-55), behind 67.9% in 1984 and 67.0% in 1990, according to ESPN Research.\n\nThe Celtics also shot 64.7% from the 3-point line Friday, which equated to an 80.8% effective field goal percentage -- the highest in the shot clock era. Effective field goal percentage measures shooting efficiency by adjusting for the fact that 3-pointers are worth more than two-point shots\n\nAll-Star Jaylen Brown led the way, finishing with 28 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. But he got plenty of support from his teammates, with trade deadline acquisition Nikola Vucevic adding 28 points and 11 rebounds for his third double-double as a member of the Celtics.\n\n\"I thought we just did a good job reading the game,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"I thought we made the right reads throughout most of the entire game. I thought tonight Vooch really looked comfortable in his offensive reads and his offensive screening. He unlocked a lot of stuff for us.\"\n\nAll 13 Celtics players scored, with Boston committing only three turnovers after halftime.\n\n\"We just try to read the game and take what's there,\" Brown said.\n\nBoston, winners of five of its six games since the All-Star break, will wait to see if Sunday night's home matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers will mark the return of Tatum.\n\nThe game, originally scheduled to be played earlier in the day, was moved by NBC into an 8 p.m. ET prime-time slot, creating speculation it could signal Tatum's plan to return.\n\nIt's been 41 weeks since Tatum ruptured his right Achilles tendon in May in the waning minutes of the Celtics' loss to the New York Knicks in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe Celtics are required by the NBA to release an initial injury report by 5 p.m. ET on Saturday ahead of Sunday's home game against the 76ers.\n\nAfter practicing with the Celtics' G League team two weeks ago, Tatum said he hadn't decided whether he would return.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that I'm coming back or I'm not, it's just following the plan. So it's just another step,\" Tatum said. \"I don't know percentage. I just know I feel a little bit better every day. I just try to focus on that.\"\n\nTatum said in the same interview that he is also mindful of not wanting to disrupt the progress of a Celtics team that at 39-20 sits in second place in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\n\"I'm just hyper aware of what's going on. I think it would just stem from that. Obviously, I know what I bring to the table and bring to the team. But I'm also aware that these guys have been playing extremely well,\" Tatum said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

(1:49)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nKALAMAZOO, Mich. -- Trey Perry scored on a driving layup with a second remaining, and No. 21 Miami of Ohio rallied to beat Western Michigan 69-67 on Friday night to extend its season-opening winning streak to 29 games.\n\nThe RedHawks (16-0 Mid-American Conference) remain the only undefeated team in Division I men's basketball. Miami extended the best start in program history and added to its school record for wins in a season. Miami also boasts the best start and longest win streak in MAC annals.\n\nMiami is also just the fourth Division I team in the past 20 years to enter March unbeaten, according to ESPN Research. The previous three (2013-14 Wichita State, 2014-15 Kentucky and 2020-21 Gonzaga) all remained unbeaten heading into the NCAA tournament.\n\nPeter Suder scored 18 points for the RedHawks before fouling out with just over seven minutes remaining. Almar Atlason added 16 points, Perry finished with 14 and Eian Elmer 10.\n\nJayden Brewer led Western Michigan (10-19, 4-12) with 19 points and 11 rebounds. Justice Williams and EJ Ryans each added 14 points.\n\nMiami is used to playing close games and won for the seventh time this season by fewer than six points.\n\n\"Our grouip is unflappabe,\" Miami coach Travis Steele said. \"It's calm, cool and collected. It's very, very even the entire time, even during tight moments.\"\n\nThe RedHawks trailed 30-26 at the half and fell behind by eight points twice early in the second half before tying the score at 49-49 with 11:02 remaining.\n\nWestern Michigan ran off eight straight points for a 57-49 advantage with 8:40 remaining and led 59-50 with 6:38 left before Miami chipped away and moved ahead 66-65 on a layup by Antwone Woolfolk with 14 seconds left.\n\nElmer's free throw with 37 seconds remaining gave the RedHawks a 67-65 edge, but Western Michigan tied it with 11 seconds left on a basket by Williams before Perry made the winner.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe Women's National Basketball Players Association submitted a new counterproposal to the WNBA on Friday evening with some concessions on revenue share and housing, a source familiar with the collective bargaining negotiations told ESPN.\n\nIn the new CBA proposal, the players' union is asking for players to receive 26% of gross revenue (defined as revenue before deducting expenses) over the lifetime of the agreement, with the salary cap in Year 1 of the deal (about $9.5 million) unchanged from its previous offer.\n\nThe revenue share split is down from 27.5% of gross revenue as proposed in the WNBPA's Feb. 17 proposal, a change that a source said amounts to nearly $100 million in reductions on revenue share.\n\nThe new proposal also contains tweaks to the union's housing offerings: Previously, the players asked that teams continue to provide housing to players in the first several years of the new deal, but that in later years, teams will no longer be obligated to provide it for players making at least 80% of the maximum salary, on multiyear deals and receiving full salary protection.\n\nIn the new proposal, the union struck the multiyear component and lowered the salary threshold to 75% at which players would no longer be obligated to receive team-provided housing.\n\nThe two sides are still negotiating the years of service limit for developmental players -- a new feature of this CBA with each team now expected to have two developmental player spots. The union is now proposing a years of service limit of six after originally asking for no experience limit for those players, a source said, whereas the league's latest proposal suggested a limit of four or five years of service based on minutes played.\n\nThe WNBPA's counterproposal comes one week after the league submitted one of its own. That Feb. 20 league proposal guaranteed housing for all players in 2026 before being phased out in subsequent years of the deal. Players on their applicable minimum salary and those with zero years of service would be provided a one-bedroom apartment in 2027 and 2028 only, and developmental players would be provided studio apartments for the entirety of the deal.\n\nBut the two sides are still far apart on the issue of revenue sharing, including proposing different revenue sharing systems: The WNBA has held firm in its proposals, with players being offered on average over 70% of net revenue (revenue after deducting expenses), which would amount to less than 15% of gross revenue. The 2026 salary cap would come in at $5.65 million (up from $1.5 million in 2025) and in subsequent years would grow in line with revenue growth.\n\nThe league's proposal features maximum salaries, including revenue sharing payouts, amounting to nearly $1.3 million in 2026 and projecting to approach $2 million in 2031. The supermax in 2025 came in at $249,000. The average player salary, including revenue sharing, would be projected to reach $540,000 in 2026 and $780,000 by 2031, up from $120,000 in 2025.\n\nThe WNBA publicly struck down the WNBPA's previous proposal as \"unrealistic\" and \"caus[ing] hundreds of millions of dollars of losses for our teams.\" A source familiar with the negotiations told ESPN the league projected that Feb. 17 plan would result in losses of $460 million over the lifetime of the agreement, though the union has maintained its revenue sharing model would still put the league in a \"profitable position,\" another source said.\n\nEarlier this week, the league gave its teams and the WNBPA a target date of March 10 to complete a term sheet, or else the schedule for the 2026 season might be impacted."

The announcement means that former champion Alex Pereira, who has shown interest in moving up to heavyweight, has vacated the belt.\n\nWhite did not comment on Pereira's title reign ending.

Since his second loss to Pereira, Prochazka has recorded back-to-back finishes against Jamahal Hill and Khalil Rountree Jr.\n\nUlberg (13-1), who lives and trains out of New Zealand, has been steadily working up the light heavyweight ranks since he signed with the UFC in 2020.

            "content": "AUBURN, Calif. -- Former MLB pitcher Daniel Serafini was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 2021 shooting of his wife's parents during a burglary at their home by Lake Tahoe, authorities said.\n\nSerafini, 51, was convicted in July 2025 of first-degree murder of his father-in-law, Gary Spohr; attempted murder of his mother-in-law, Wendy Wood; and first-degree burglary. Spohr was killed, and Wood survived, though she died a year after the shooting.\n\nPlacer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said in a statement Friday that Spohr and Wood were loving grandparents and that Serafini's crimes greatly impacted family members and friends.\n\n\"The impact of this attack has extended far beyond the immediate victims, deeply affecting family members and the broader community, and highlighting the lasting harm caused by deliberate violence,\" Gire said.\n\nSerafini's attorney did not return requests for comment.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Serafini addressed the court and maintained his innocence, according to MyNews4. He said he was out partying with his wife the night of the shooting and described himself as a \"broken, imperfect man that makes mistakes.\"\n\nSerafini was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 1992. In a career spanning 11 years, the left-hander played for the Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies.\n\nProsecutors said Serafini hated his wife's wealthy parents and was heard saying he was willing to pay $20,000 to have them killed, according to the Sacramento Bee. Prosecutors showed jurors transcripts of angry emails and text messages between Serafini and his in-laws.\n\nDuring the six-week trial, Serafini's attorney, David Dratman, argued that there was no physical evidence linking his client to the crime scene. Dratman told the jury that although Serafini had a rocky relationship with his in-laws, he did not have a motive to kill them.\n\nAfter his conviction, Serafini filed multiple motions for a new trial, but those were denied.\n\nSerafini will serve his sentence at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the Placer County District Attorney's Office."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

Pot 4: Romania, Northern Ireland, Sweden, North Macedonia.\n\nHow did teams qualify for the World Cup play-offs?\n\nFor the first time, 16 European teams will play at the World Cup owing to the 50 per cent increase in the size of the 2026 tournament. Of those, 12 places are reserved for UEFA qualifying group winners, with the other four coming via the play-offs.\n\nThe 12 group runners-up will be joined by four teams who finished outside the top two of their respective qualifying groups, who were the 'best performers' in the 2024/25 Nations League.\n\nImage: Troy Parrott's stunning hat-trick against Hungary saw the Republic of Ireland secure a shock play-off spot\n\nHere are the final standings from each of the 12 groups:\n\nGroup A: Germany qualified, Slovakia and Northern Ireland into play-offs\n\nGermany qualified, and into play-offs Group B: Switzerland qualified, Kosovo and Sweden into play-offs\n\nSwitzerland qualified, and into play-offs Group C: Scotland qualified, Denmark into play-offs\n\nScotland qualified, into play-offs Group D: France qualified, Ukraine into play-offs\n\nFrance qualified, into play-offs Group E: Spain qualified, Turkey into play-offs\n\nSpain qualified, into play-offs Group F: Portugal qualified, Republic of Ireland into play-offs\n\nPortugal qualified, into play-offs Group G: Netherlands qualified, Poland into play-offs\n\nNetherlands qualified, into play-offs Group H: Austria qualified, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Romania into play-offs\n\nAustria qualified, and into play-offs Group I: Norway qualified, Italy into play-offs\n\nNorway qualified, into play-offs Group J: Belgium qualified, Wales and North Macedonia into play-offs\n\nBelgium qualified, and into play-offs Group K: England qualified, Albania into play-offs\n\nEngland qualified, into play-offs Group L: Croatia qualified, Czech Republic into play-offs\n\nCould every home nation be at the World Cup?\n\nNo!

More often than not, this means the four additional play-off spots are filled by four of the 14 Nations League group winners.\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:"

            "content": "When safety is compromised in a place meant for healing, the impact extends far beyond the facility's walls. It affects families, communities, and public trust.\n\nIn the wake of the widely reported security incident at Mamprobi Polyclinic in which a newborn was taken from the maternity ward by an individual who disguised herself as a nurse, Virtual Security Africa (VSA) chose not to stand on the sidelines.\n\nWhat followed was not silence or deflection, but decisive, meaningful action —swift, structured, and anchored in a genuine commitment to public safety.\n\nWithin days of the incident, the leadership of Virtual Security Africa, led by CEO Emmanuel Asiedu, engaged hospital management through a delegation not merely as a service provider, but as a committed partner in restoring confidence and safety.\n\nThe response was guided by a clear belief: responsibility in moments of crisis must be met with empathy, action, and long-term solutions.\n\nA high-level delegation from VSA paid an official visit to Mamprobi Polyclinic to commiserate with hospital leadership and staff, listen to their concerns, and offer direct support.\n\nManagement of the clinic, led by Medical Superintendent Dr Henrietta Fiscian, expressed profound gratitude, noting that VSA was the first private entity to provide tangible support since the incident.\n\nAs a heartfelt gesture of solidarity, Virtual Security Africa made a generous financial donation to the baby's mother.\n\nThis contribution reflected not only immediate humanitarian care, but VSA’s deeper conviction that the safety and peace of mind of patients and families is inseparable from its mission as a security technology company.\n\nBeyond Empathy: A Full Security Transformation\n\nVSA’s intervention extended far beyond immediate support. With the full consent and gratitude of hospital management, the company conducted a comprehensive security assessment of the facility and committed to a complete overhaul and upgrade of the clinic’s CCTV surveillance system at no cost to the hospital.\n\nThe upgrade will deliver:\n\nInstallation of new high-definition cameras across all critical areas, including maternity wards, entrances, and corridors\n\nEnhanced real-time monitoring and incident review capabilities for hospital leadership and security personnel\n\nA comprehensive security assessment with actionable recommendations for hospital management\n\nA long-term surveillance framework designed for institutional resilience and prevention\n\nThis is not a temporary intervention. It is a structural enhancement, a lasting commitment to ensuring that what happened once will not happen again.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility with Purpose\n\nThis initiative forms part of Virtual Security Africa’s 18th Anniversary Corporate Social Responsibility programme — a milestone that the company has chosen to mark not with ceremony, but with impact.\n\nVSA’s realignment of its CSR focus to address this urgent community need demonstrates that its commitment to Ghana runs deeper than business.\n\nWho We Are: Security Built for Ghana’s Realities\n\nFor nearly two decades, Virtual Security Africa has pursued a clear vision: to become a trusted leader in integrated electronic security and surveillance systems across Africa.\n\nAs a wholly Ghanaian-owned company with nationwide operations, VSA understands the realities of both the public and private sectors — including tight budgets, high expectations, and zero tolerance for failure.\n\nIts solutions are designed to be cost-effective, scalable, and suitable for mission-critical environments such as healthcare, education, government institutions, and public spaces.\n\nVSA believes personal and institutional security is no longer optional — it is essential for safety.\n\nA Partner for Safer Healthcare Across Ghana\n\nVirtual Security Africa remains committed to partnering with health facilities nationwide to create safer spaces for mothers, children, and staff.\n\nFor facilities with existing surveillance systems, VSA offers professional security assessments, upgrades, repairs, and periodic maintenance at affordable rates to ensure existing equipment remains reliable and effective.\n\nFor facilities looking to acquire new systems without the burden of high upfront costs, VSA also provides flexible lease-to-own options, making it easier for hospitals and clinics to own modern, high-quality electronic security infrastructure.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

So far, we are going in the right direction. Let’s sustain it over a long period of time,” he said.\n\nThe government has framed 2025 as a year of stabilisation. A February 23, 2026, press release from the Ministry of Finance highlighted a budget deficit narrowed to 1.0 per cent of GDP, below the 2.8 per cent target, alongside a primary balance surplus of 2.6 per cent of GDP.\n\nInflation fell to 3.8 per cent in January 2026, marking the 13th consecutive month of decline and the lowest level since Ghana’s CPI was rebased in 2021.\n\nThe Bank of Ghana has also cut interest rates cumulatively by 12.5 percentage points since July 2025.\n\nDespite these gains, Prof. Dzanku expressed caution, pointing to structural issues that could undermine sustained growth.\n\n“Ghana has spent an average of 36 per cent of government revenue on interest payments over the past decade — against a sub-Saharan average of 8 per cent,” he said. He also noted that government capital investment has dropped from around 27 per cent of GDP in 2015 to about 10 per cent today, while GDP per capita growth has been volatile, averaging just 2.3 per cent over the decade — far below the 4–6 per cent needed for meaningful structural transformation.\n\n“I want to be optimistic because everybody wants things to go well,” Prof. Dzanku said. “But because of where we’ve been and where we came to, I adopt a wait-and-see attitude.”\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

We say we want the rule of law and fair hearing, but we are quick to pronounce people guilty,” he stated.\n\nThe Minority Leader revealed that he was personally affected by the incident in the chamber.\n\nAccording to him, during the proceedings, he received a message from Mr Ofori-Atta’s brother, Duke Ofori-Atta, who is also a Member of Parliament.\n\n“When I was sitting there, his brother Duke texted me, ‘Leader, why are they doing this to my brother?’ I felt the pain,” he recounted.\n\nMr Afenyo-Markin stated that he is not shielding anyone from scrutiny but is concerned about what he described as the growing tendency to “crucify” individuals in the court of public opinion before investigations are concluded.\n\n“I am not standing in the way of anybody asking for accountability. I don’t want anybody to get me wrong. I am talking about the way and manner we are going about things,” he explained.\n\nHe noted that political actors, particularly those in opposition, are often privy to sensitive information but must exercise restraint in how such matters are handled.\n\n“You want to pronounce people guilty before trial.

He’s done. Meanwhile, if the man had started his business, I’m sure at a minimum he would have created some 100 jobs. Is that okay?” he said, recounting the experience of a friend whose factory has remained closed for more than six months.\n\nThe Minority Leader said the investor has been unable to secure a transformer from the Electricity Company of Ghana and is still negotiating the high cost of direct power supply with the Ghana Grid Company.\n\nHis comments come days after President Mahama signed the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill into law on February 19, 2026. The new legislation establishes a coordinating body for the policy and offers tax rebates and import duty waivers to companies operating multiple shifts.\n\nIn addition, the 2026 Budget allocated GH¢110 million to begin setting up the Authority and supporting implementation.\n\nHowever, Afenyo-Markin argues that these incentives mean little if businesses cannot afford power.\n\nGhana entered 2026 with a 9.86 per cent electricity tariff increase, and further adjustments are expected following reviews by the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission. Energy and gas inflation also rose sharply in early 2026, adding to pressure on manufacturers.\n\nThe Minority Leader said these conditions make it difficult for companies to operate around the clock, as envisioned under the government’s policy.\n\n“The PR — they are getting fixated on government PR. Ministers are more interested in social media talk than action,” he said. “The young men and women who followed them and were singing? They are tired of singing. They want jobs.”\n\nAfenyo-Markin, however, insists that more urgent and concrete steps are needed.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

You show signs of selective justice,” he said.\n\nAccording to the Minority Leader, the administration’s handling of corruption-related investigations gives the impression that prosecutions are being used to punish political opponents rather than uphold fairness under the law.\n\nHe was particularly critical of the Operation Recover All Loot (ORAL) committee, which he had previously described as unconstitutional.\n\nIn January 2025, he publicly called on the Attorney-General to dismantle the body, arguing that it bypasses established institutions and weakens democratic accountability.\n\nAfenyo-Markin also faulted what he described as the government’s early decision to involve the Office of the Special Prosecutor in cases that were already before the courts.\n\nHe said the better approach would have been to allow existing judicial processes to run their course.\n\n“You allow the courts to do their work and pronounce independently, instead of creating parallel processes,” he argued.\n\nThe Minority Leader further raised concerns about bail conditions imposed on some suspects, describing them as excessive and designed to humiliate.\n\n“I see that as one of the ways to frustrate, to punish, and to create a certain impression on the minds of the public that you’re already guilty,” he said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Somebody employed in 2018, somebody in 2017 — in employment for six or seven years — they were all sacked,” he said.\n\nHe named several affected institutions, including the Ghana Water Company Limited, Electricity Company of Ghana, Ghana Maritime Authority, Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority, and the Social Security and National Insurance Trust.\n\nAccording to the Minority Leader, the dismissals contradict the government’s narrative of job creation and risk deepening public mistrust.\n\nThe terminations followed a directive issued on February 10, 2025, by Chief of Staff Julius Debrah, instructing heads of government institutions to annul appointments made after December 7, 2024, the date of the general elections.\n\nWhile the directive was meant to target late appointments, its broad implementation sparked controversy, with reports indicating that workers employed years earlier were also affected.\n\nAfenyo-Markin also questioned the government’s claim that official data confirmed the creation of one million jobs, calling for greater transparency.\n\n“Where are these jobs? Which sectors? Which regions? We need a proper breakdown,” he said.\n\nHe urged the government to publish detailed figures from the Ghana Statistical Service to back its claims.\n\n“These dismissals undermine confidence and weaken the economy,” he added. “You cannot sack thousands and still claim you are creating jobs.”\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "(left to right) Rayan Ait-Nouri, Abdukodir Khusanov, Omar Marmoush and Rayan Cherki\n\nMuslims around the world are currently observing the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, including players in the Premier League.\n\nSaturday's game between Leeds United and Manchester City at Elland Road might be paused in the first half to allow players observing Ramadan to break their fast.\n\n\n\nWith the match kicking off at 17:30 GMT and the sun setting in West Yorkshire at 17:41, a stoppage in play may see the likes of Omar Marmoush, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Rayan Cherki or Abdukodir Khusanov come to the side of the pitch to take on food and fluids.\n\n\n\nSources say a firm decision on a short break is likely to be made on Saturday morning, while it is understood Leeds would happily accommodate any such request from City.\n\n\n\nAsked by BBC Sport if the club have to alter their schedules to help its Muslim players, manager Pep Guardiola said: \"They follow this religious tradition. We have good nutritionists and they adapt to what the team needs.\n\n\n\n\"We cannot adapt the schedule for the Premier League [kick-off] times and I think they are used to it - they are not young and have been playing [for] many years during this period.\n\n\n\n\"For the players I think it is not new. Both Rayans, Omar and Khusa, it is not the first time for [observing] Ramadan and they know perfectly how to handle it.\"\n\nThis season, the quartet have all started together once in each of the cup competitions but are yet to feature from kick-off in the Premier League.\n\n\n\nChaplaincy for players and staff\n\n\n\nCity have a memorable history with a number of Muslim players.\n\n\n\nGerman midfielder Ilkay Gundogan captained the side to the Treble in 2023, while Algeria winger Riyad Mahrez was also part of that squad and won the PFA player of the year award with Leicester City in 2016.\n\n\n\nIvorian Yaya Toure scored the winning goal in the 2011 FA Cup final against Stoke City to end the club's 35-year wait for a major trophy - a year later he refused a bottle of champagne for man of the match on live television, stating his Islamic beliefs, with the Premier League subsequently changing the prize to a trophy.\n\n\n\nThough City's training kit is sponsored by Japanese beer company Asahi, its Super Dry 0.0% brand is printed on it, meaning Muslim players are advertising a non-alcoholic product.\n\nIt is subjects like these that City players and staff are being educated about by the Muslim Chaplains in Sport (MCS) organisation, which has been working closely with the club since 2016-17 from the under-8s all the way up to the first team.\n\n\n\nMCS founder Imam Ismail Bhamji explains to BBC Sport: \"We visit clubs and often lead prayers and we sit down and learn about a particular subject afterwards. I am then available for club staff and players.\n\n\n\n\"I walk around club training facilities and buildings, meeting people and help sort out any issues that they may have and discuss in confidentiality.\"\n\n\n\nThis month Guardiola spoke at a news conference about the \"hurt\" he feels for victims of global conflict, including the thousands killed in Palestine.\n\n\n\nImam Ismail says it is a subject that has struck a chord within some clubs, adding: \"If help is needed, people do reach out to me for guidance on family matters and personal issues.\n\n\n\n\"One example is being asked about how to navigate the war in Gaza - in controlling their emotions and not be at risk of losing their jobs by posting something on social media.\"\n\n'We leave it to clubs to decide what do to'\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Manchester United held an Iftar (breaking of the Ramadan fast) at Old Trafford for supporters, with the Adhan (call to prayer) taking place inside the stadium.\n\n\n\nClubs up and down the country, including Manchester City, have held similar initiatives during Ramadan in recent years.\n\n\n\nImam Ismail delivers workshops on Islamic awareness and Halal food guidance, while the ongoing month of Ramadan is a particularly busy period.\n\n\n\n\"We explain what Ramadan is and why Muslims find it important and why we must observe it,\" he says. \"It is mentioned in the Quran and one of the five pillars of Islam.\n\n\n\n\"We explain the importance of fasting for those who qualify and we also explain the impact of fasting on professional athletes and how they could navigate and work around that to ensure they can fulfil their religious obligations and the sporting side too so that they can continue to play.\n\n\"Ultimately, we leave it to clubs to decide what do to - we can't tell them what to do.\"\n\n\n\nPlayers that work with MCS are understood to be pleased that they do not have to miss prayers and an Imam can come in to help them perform their duties as Muslims.\n\n\n\n\"I bumped into Pep Guardiola last week and he held my hand and wished me Ramadan Kareem,\" said a beaming Imam Ismail. \"That was nice of him.\"\n\n\n\nThe end of Ramadan is marked by the day of Eid, which will take place on Friday, 20 or Saturday, 21 March - depending on the sighting of the new moon - when celebrations take place with families and friends and gifts are exchanged.\n\n\n\nCity face Arsenal in a tantalising Carabao Cup final on the Sunday - lifting the trophy at Wembley will provide the perfect Eid present for players and supporters alike."

It transforms the bitter lessons of the 2023 spillage into a blueprint for resilience.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is more than just recovery; it is about delivering climate justice and equipping our frontline communities to build back not just what was lost, but a stronger, more climate-smart infrastructure. As a member of the CVF-V20 Troika, we are immensely grateful for the support from the Government of Wallonia for this much needed and timely initiative,” said Issifu Seidu, Minister of State for Climate Change and Sustainability whose office is working closely with the CVF-V20 Secretariat and Care Danmark to implement the project.\n\n\n\n“The Akosombo Dam spillage highlights the growing climate pressures on critical infrastructure and communities, reinforcing the urgent need for risk management, adaptation and addressing loss and damage,” said Mohamed Nasheed, Secretary-General of CVF-V20.\n\n\n\n“Through AkoLAD, we reaffirm our commitment to supporting those most vulnerable and ensuring that recovery efforts build sustainable livelihoods and long-term resilience.”\n\nGhana was the previous chair of CVF-V20, which today counts 74 member countries representing 1.81 billion people.\n\n\n\nThe CVF was founded in 2009 and in 2015 it established its sister association, the V20 Group of Finance Ministers.\n\n\n\nAkoLAD is a one year initiative. It restores what communities have lost while reinforcing their capacity to withstand future climate shocks.\n\n\n\nThe program emphasizes locally-led, climate-resilient rebuilding, aligning with CVF-V20 priorities of accelerating frontline adaptation, strengthening systems resilience, and ensuring financial support reaches affected populations rapidly and transparently.\n\n\n\nKey outcomes expected under AkoLAD include:\n\n\n\nRestoration of Physical and Livelihood Assets: This component includes the construction of climate-smart shelters for displaced families, support for repairingdamaged homes and livelihood assets, along with targeted training for women engaged in off-farm businesses, as well as for crop farmers and fishermen.\n\nRestoration of Community Infrastructure: AkoLAD will facilitate the repair and improvement of critical community infrastructure, such as sanitation facilities, using climate-informed, flood-resilient design standards.\n\n\n\nThe program places strong emphasis on rehabilitating natural infrastructure such as forests and freshwater ecosystems.\n\n\n\nIncrease in Community Resilience to Future Flooding: AkoLAD will enhance nature-based flood protection measures, including the establishment of vegetation buffer zones. It will also strengthen the capacity and coordination of community information centers and governance structures to respond to floods, including through digital Early Warning Systems.\n\n\n\nAkoLAD will deliver small grants directly to affected communities, ensuring swift recovery and targeted support where it is most urgently needed. A sum of USD 1 million has been allocated from the CVF-V20 Joint Multi-Donor Fund for this initiative with contribution from the Government of Wallonia.\n\n\n\nThe Fund, jointly managed by the CVF–V20 Secretariat and United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), is designed to advance climate prosperity, promote South–South cooperation, and scale up action on adaptation, mitigation, resilience, and loss and damage."

It’s never easy. So for me, I will definitely be pushing. Now that we have a sports fund, amateur boxing should be given more attention, more recognition, and more support. And I believe everybody here at this table will also push in their own way.\n\n“The National Sports Authority, Ministry of Sports and Recreation, and the Ghana Olympic Committee need to push. That is what we are going to do to make sure that in the next major competition Ghana participates in, people see the impact before the next Olympic Games,” he said while speaking at the Ghana Boxing Federation (GBF) logo unveiling ceremony on February 26, 2026.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the new GBF logo, Ampofo Ankrah indicated that he was impressed with the design and its uniqueness in representing the boxing federation and gaining more recognition.\n\n\n\n“I’ll say ayekoo to everybody, and I love the logo. Very simple, very distinct. You can wear it anywhere, even on t-shirts. It’s very fashionable. This is how you see Real Madrid, Liverpool, Barcelona, Kotoko, Hearts. It’s very distinct. So I believe with this logo, you will even be able to attract people who don’t necessarily like boxing and bring them in to learn more about the sport. So I’ll keep it here,” he added."

            "content": "General News of Saturday, 28 February 2026\n\nSource: www.ghanaweb.com\n\nFounder of Action Chapel International, Archbishop Nicholas Duncan-Williams, has condemned some Ghanaian politicians he describes as corrupt and greedy.\n\n\n\nIn a video shared on social media on February 27, 2026, the outspoken cleric stated that some politicians in the country, aside from politics, lack the capacity to generate income through other means.\n\n\n\nAccording to Duncan-Williams, many politicians thrive on propaganda, with the ultimate aim of discrediting the ruling party through falsehoods to gain power.\n\n\n\nRevolution Years: Duncan-Williams shares story of his detention\n\n\n\nHe further noted that the persistent negative criticism within Ghana’s political space is harming the country. He added that individuals who rely solely on political parties for financial gain often perform poorly when appointed to positions in government.\n\n\n\n“Some of you, your future depends on a political party to make money. Unless your party comes into power, you cannot make money because you haven’t developed the capacity to do so. You need your political party to be in power to make money. So whenever your party is out of power, you pursue the party in office and scheme against them.\n\n\n\n“You lie against them. It doesn’t matter how well they perform; you must sabotage and destroy them so you can come to power. Then, when you come to power, what you did to them, they “will also do to you until you lose power again, because they, too, must return. This cycle continues because people have not developed the capacity to create wealth,” he said.\n\n\n\nWhile preaching to his congregation, Duncan-Williams also pronounced curses on politicians involved in looting the country’s resources.\n\n\n\n'When you get it all right, don't do a wedding' - Duncan-Williams counsels\n\n\n\nAccording to him, such politicians will die prematurely after acquiring luxury through the national coffers.\n\n\n\nTurning his attention to the wives of such politicians, the cleric warned that they would face similar consequences.\n\n\n\n“…You enjoy it, give him more sex, and encourage him to kill, lie, steal, scheme, destroy, and make money at the expense of poor people. And you don’t understand the implications. He will die prematurely. His days will be few. He will not live long enough to enjoy that house. He will not live long enough to enjoy that brand-new car.\n\n\n\n“Because he didn’t sweat for it, he didn’t work for it, he cannot keep it. Whatever you did not earn, you cannot maintain. You only maintain what you have built the capacity for and paid a price for,” he added.\n\n\n\nWatch the video below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJHM/EB\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, watch GhanaWeb’s exposé on the ‘Dark Side of Kayamata’ and its devastating impact below:"

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "The US and Israel have bombed multiple Iranian cities, including capital Tehran. Iran hits back, launching missiles at Israel.\n\nThe United States and Israel have struck multiple locations across Iran, including the capital, Tehran, in what US President Donald Trump described as “major combat operations”.\n\nThe attacks come amid negotiations between the US and Iran over the latter’s nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes, after weeks of mounting threats from Trump — and eight months after the US and Israel waged a 12-day war against Iran.\n\nIran has struck back with missiles aimed at northern Israel. Details of casualties and damage in Iran and Israel are sparse at the moment.\n\nHere’s what we know so far:\n\nWhere in Iran have the US and Israel attacked?\n\nIsrael first announced on Saturday morning that it had launched a missile attack on Iran. A US official subsequently told Al Jazeera that Israel’s attacks were carried out as a joint military operation with the United States, which has assembled a vast fleet of fighter jets and warships in the region over the past few weeks — the US’s largest military mobilisation in the region since the Iraq war.\n\nSeveral missiles struck University Street and the Jomhouri area in Tehran, and close to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps headquarters, the Fars news agency reported.\n\nThe Associated Press news agency reported that a strike in Iran’s capital happened near the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nIran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported that explosions also occurred in Tehran’s northern Seyyed Khandan area.\n\nExplosions have also been reported in the cities of Kermanshah, Qom, Tabriz, Isfahan, Ilam and Karaj, as well as in Lorestan province, according to local media.\n\n\n\nWhat did Donald Trump say?\n\nWhile announcing “major combat operations”, Trump said that the aim of the US campaign was to “destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground”.\n\n“We are going to annihilate their navy,” Trump added in social media comments.\n\nTrump also said that the US would ensure that Iran’s “proxies” – an apparent reference to a range of Tehran-aligned groups in the region, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis – can “no longer destabilise the region or the world”.\n\nHe repeated his prior comments that he would not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, even though Tehran itself has repeatedly made clear that it is not interested in building one.\n\n“This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces,” Trump said.\n\nReuters quoted a US official as saying that the Trump administration was planning a “multiday operation”.\n\nThe US president’s comments suggest that Trump was setting “the table for a revolution in Iran” — 73 years after the CIA orchestrated a coup against democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher reported from Washington.\n\n“They’ve done it before. This time, they’re doing it with weapons and bombs rather than covertly through the CIA,” Fischer said. “It’s clear that this is going to be a continuous military operation, with Donald Trump accepting the fact that there may be casualties.”\n\nWhat is Iran’s response?\n\n⁠Iran ⁠has hit back, launching missiles at Israel, the latter’s military has confirmed. Sirens could be heard in several parts of the country, and explosions were seen and heard in Israel’s north.\n\n“The public is requested to follow the instructions of the Home Front Command,” Israel’s military said. “At this time, the Israeli Air Force is operating to intercept and strike threats where necessary to remove the threat.”\n\nEarlier, Ebrahim Azizi, the head of the national security commission of the Iranian parliament, threatened a “crushing” response.\n\n“We warned you!” Azizi wrote on social media. “Now you have started down a path which end is no longer in your control.”\n\nWhere are Iran’s leaders?\n\nIt is not immediately clear where the 86-year-old Khamenei is. He hasn’t been seen publicly in days as tensions with the United States have grown.\n\nRoads to Khamenei’s compound in downtown Tehran were shut down by authorities as blasts rang out across the capital.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency quoted a source in the presidential office as saying that President Masoud Pezeshkian was unharmed."

            "content": "Trump, who has previously said Khamenei should be ‘very worried’, is urging Iranians to overthrow their government.\n\nThe United States and Israel have waged a new round of attacks on Iran, again derailing negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme and raising questions about efforts to target the country’s security and leadership apparatus.\n\nAmong the areas targeted on Saturday in Iran’s capital Tehran were places linked to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.\n\nHere’s more on Khamenei and why the US and Israel are potentially seeking to “decapitate” the Islamic republic’s leadership:\n\nWhere did Saturday’s attacks take place?\n\nIranian media report the US-Israeli attacks occurred nationwide, including several areas in the capital, Tehran.\n\nIran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported that seven missiles hit an area near the presidential palace, located in Shemiran to the north of Tehran, as well as near Khamenei’s compound.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that attacks also struck near Khamenei’s offices in the capital.\n\nWhere is Khamenei?\n\nIt is unclear. The Reuters news agency cited a source as saying Khamenei was not in Tehran and had been transferred to a secure location.\n\nWho is Khamenei?\n\nThe 86-year-old Islamic scholar has been Iran’s Supreme Leader since 1989, succeeding the Islamic Republic’s late founder, the charismatic Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who returned from exile and drove Iran’s 1979 revolution that overthrew US ally and shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. He holds ultimate authority over all branches of government, the military and the judiciary, while also acting as the country’s spiritual leader.\n\n\n\nDuring his rule, Khamenei has withstood an adversarial relationship with the West, including intense sanctions, and several rounds of protests at home over the economy and rights issues. He has called the US Iran’s “number one enemy”, with Israel trailing close behind.\n\nCritical to Khamenei’s power is the loyalty of two of Iran’s premier security institutions – the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Basij paramilitary forces, which have hundreds of ⁠thousands of volunteers.\n\nKhamenei has long said Iran would never build a nuclear weapon and that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only. Neither US intelligence nor the UN nuclear watchdog have found any evidence that Iran was pursuing an atomic weapon, a narrative Israel and some in the Trump administration have nevertheless pushed.\n\nWhat have the US and Israel said about Khamenei?\n\nOfficials from both countries have previously issued threats against Khamenei.\n\nIn June, after the 12-day war of US-Israeli attacks on Iran, and Tehran’s retaliation against Israel, Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz said Khamenei “cannot continue to exist”.\n\n“A dictator like Khamenei who stands at the head of a state like Iran and has the horrible goal of destroying Israel – cannot continue to exist,” he said.\n\nThe same month, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested Israel had not ruled out attempting to assassinate Khamenei, an act he said would “end” the long-running conflict between the US and Iran.\n\nIn the US, President Donald Trump has also made remarks appearing to threaten Khamenei. In an interview with ABC News earlier this month, Trump said the Iranian leader should be “very worried”, as the US amassed military assets in the region. In separate remarks, he said regime change in Iran would be “the best thing that could happen” and that “there are people” who could assume leadership, without elaborating.\n\nAs he ordered attacks on Iran last year, Trump then claimed Khamenei would be an “easy target” if the US decided to go after him.\n\n“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” said Trump. “He is an easy target, but is safe there – We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”\n\nWhat was the goal of the latest attack?\n\nIn remarks following the attacks, Trump pledged to “annihilate” Iran’s navy and missile sites, and urged Iranians to overthrow their government.\n\n“When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take,” said Trump. “This will be probably your only chance for generations.\n\n\n\nAl Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, who has covered Iran extensively, said it is clear that the US-Israeli attacks are “mainly aimed at decapitating [the political elite]”.\n\n“How successful or unsuccessful this was, that is too early to tell.”"

            "content": "Sweden’s military has confirmed that a drone disabled near a visiting French aircraft carrier this week was Russian, prompting France to condemn what it described as a “ridiculous provocation” by Moscow.\n\nThe incident took place in the Oresund strait between Sweden and Denmark, as France’s flagship Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier was on a visit to the region.\n\n“During the visit of the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, one of the Swedish Armed Forces’ vessels observed a drone taking off from a Russian signals intelligence ship,” the Swedish military said in a statement on Friday.\n\n“The Swedish Armed Forces can now confirm that a Russian drone has carried out an unauthorised flight,” it added.\n\nSweden’s Defence Minister Pal Jonson said “technical data” confirmed the origins of the drone as being the Russian vessel “Zhigulevsk”, noting also that the incident “constitutes a breach of Sweden’s access regulations and a violation of Swedish airspace”.\n\n“The Swedish Armed Forces responded firmly and professionally with countermeasures that disrupted the drone,” Jonson said.\n\nAccording to the AFP news agency, a Swedish navy vessel, HMS Rapp, used technical equipment to disable the drone about 13km (eight miles) from the French carrier.\n\nSwedish forces took action when the Russian drone was deemed to be flying without authorisation.\n\nSweden said the Russian ship failed to comply with regulations governing transit through Swedish waters and HMS Rapp later escorted the vessel out of Swedish maritime territory into the Baltic Sea.\n\n\n\nThe French carrier and its escort ships had docked in Malmo on Wednesday for a visit by the vessel to the Swedish port before taking part in NATO exercises.\n\nSpeaking on board the Charles de Gaulle on Friday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that if Russian involvement was confirmed, “the only conclusion I would draw is that it would be a ridiculous provocation”.\n\n“The drone was neutralised away from the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier and in no way was the security of the aircraft carrier and its group threatened,” he said.\n\nSwedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said an investigation had been launched and suggested the timing was unlikely to be accidental.\n\n“It is a Russian way of acting that we recognise from other places,” he said.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the allegation, calling it “quite an absurd statement”.\n\nThe Baltic Sea region has become an area of mounting tension between Russia and NATO countries.\n\nSeveral members of the NATO alliance – bordering and near to Russia – have reported a surge in drone sightings which have caused disruptions in recent months, with some attributing them to Moscow."

            "content": "As antigovernment protests in Serbia continue into their second year, who is the man maintaining a grip on power?\n\nOn May 13, 1990, in Zagreb, two of Yugoslavia’s biggest football teams, Red Star Belgrade and the home team, Dinamo Zagreb, were set to play in the Maksimir Stadium of the Croatian capital. Among the excited Red Star fans riding on the train to Zagreb that day was a young law student named Aleksandar Vucic.\n\nOn the streets, fights began breaking out between rival fans. Cafe tables were flipped over, windows smashed. But the real ruckus erupted at the stadium, where Red Star fanatics, led by Serbian gangster Zeljko Raznatovic, aka Arkan, broke through the barrier holding them back and rushed at the Dinamo supporters, with punches and chairs thrown by both sides.\n\n“They threw everything they had at us [until] there were no more chairs to hurl at each other,” Vucic recounted in a magazine interview 20 years later.\n\nDinamo supporters then stampeded the pitch, where their team jumped into the fray, assaulting police officers, and the game was officially called off before it began.\n\nOver the next hour, authorities tried to restore order, playing soothing music over the loudspeakers to try to calm the mob. Two fire engines were dispatched to hose the fans, who pelted the trucks with stones.\n\nTrading insults and fisticuffs are hardly unusual in football hooliganism, but the riots laid bare the ethnic fault lines that would soon lead to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia.\n\n“It was already a conflict between Serbs and Croats, not Red Star and Dinamo fans,” Vucic explained in the same interview. “Football is always just a reflection of what is happening in society.”\n\n\n\nMaksimir exemplified the toxic nationalism and football hooliganism that have shadowed Vucic’s rise to dominate Serbian politics for more than a decade as prime minister from 2014 to 2017, and since then, as president.\n\nAs war raged through the former Yugoslavia, Vucic began his political career with a far-right group calling for a “Greater Serbia”. In 1995, merely days after Bosnian Serb forces perpetrated a genocide against Bosniaks, Vucic threatened to kill hundreds if outside powers intervened.\n\nTwo decades later, after founding a new, more centrist party, Vucic paid his respects to the Srebrenica victims and called the killings a “monstrous crime”. However, he has never recognised the crimes as a genocide and opposed the 2024 United Nations vote establishing an annual remembrance day. Meanwhile, he has led negotiations for Serbia to join the European Union and strengthened ties with China and Russia. Since taking the presidency in 2017, he has consolidated power and curbed democratic freedoms.\n\nThroughout, allegations of criminality have plagued his presidency – from football thugs to graft reaching the halls of power – as anticorruption protests continue into their second year.\n\nAmid the antigovernment protests, what motivates his grip on power, and how does he see the world today?\n\nVucic was born in 1970 in Belgrade, the capital of a country that no longer exists: Yugoslavia, a vast land home to many ethnic groups spanning what is now seven nations in southeastern Europe.\n\nVucic’s family fled their home village of Cipuljic in central Bosnia to escape the Ustase, Croatian fascists who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II. The family left after Vucic’s grandfather, a prosperous merchant, was murdered by collaborators in 1941. He’d offended them by serving a keg of rakija (a strong Balkan brandy) to passersby outside his shop in solidarity with anti-German demonstrations in Belgrade.\n\nThe Ustase sought a Greater Croatia, attempting to achieve this by throwing Serbs, Jews and Roma into death camps. A violent Serb movement, the Chetniks, organised in response, but their own ambitions of a Greater Serbia led them to massacre Bosniaks and Croats, and eventually, to collaborate with the Nazis.\n\nBut it was Josip Broz Tito’s communist, multiethnic Partisans who ultimately prevailed against the Nazi occupation.\n\n\n\nTito went on to lead post-war Yugoslavia, refusing to be drawn into either camp during the Cold War. Yugoslavs were much freer and enjoyed a decent standard of living compared with their neighbours behind the Iron Curtain, and could easily travel abroad, including a young Vucic, who spent a year learning English in the British seaside town of Brighton in the late 1980s. It was, nevertheless, a dictatorship, where nationalism and religion were suppressed.\n\nAfter the death of Tito – who was of Croat-Slovene descent – in 1980, his vision of a multiethnic Yugoslavia began crumbling. The Yugoslav army, as well as the central government in Belgrade, became increasingly dominated by Serbs led by strongman and eventual president, Slobodan Milosevic.\n\nIt was around this time that Vucic, then in his late teens, got drawn into the football hooligan scene through his favourite team, Red Star, whose fans had a reputation as hardcore Serbian nationalists.\n\nVucic often brings up this past. Once, he boasted of having been in 50 fights. “Even when I was beaten up around the stadium or in the stands, I never reported it to the police. I behaved like a slobbery [rascal] who still held onto his honour,” he told a Serbian tabloid.\n\nAccording to a New York Times article about Vucic’s alleged underworld ties, after one particularly heated game in 1988, the future president and his friends went “hunting” for Albanians on the streets of Belgrade and got into a fight.\n\n“I don’t like him now, but he was brave, brave in the fight,” said a self-professed hooligan who fought alongside Vucic that day.\n\n‘Kill one Serb and we will kill 100 Muslims’\n\nThe Yugoslav wars began in 1991, when Slovenia, followed by Croatia, and then Bosnia, declared independence. Common criminals became warlords as paramilitaries, such as Arkan’s Tigers, backed by Milosevic’s government in Belgrade, committed atrocities against Bosniaks and Croats.\n\n“Reports suggest that figures like Arkan recruited supporters directly from [football stadium] stands [into paramilitaries],” explained Sasa Dorđevic, a Serbia expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.\n\nBosnia – with its multiethnic population of Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats – suffered the most.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1995, the capital Sarajevo was besieged by Bosnian Serb forces, the longest siege in modern history, as they tried, but never succeeded, to take the city. Civilians ran for cover through the main boulevard of the city, nicknamed Sniper Alley, dodging bullets fired from nearby hillsides.\n\nVucic, then a law student in Belgrade, felt isolated on campus due to the political landscape – then split between Milosevic’s government and the opposition. In 1992, he volunteered with Bosnian Serb forces for 40 days behind the front lines. What he did exactly remains a matter of contention. Jovana Polic, a Serbian journalist who directed two documentaries about Vucic, said he worked at the Bosnian Serb propaganda television station Kanal S in Pale.\n\n\n\n“He claims to have interviewed [Bosnian Serb leader] Radovan Karadzic, and even managed to play a quick game of chess with [General] Ratko Mladic,” Polic said, emphasising that both men were later convicted of war crimes.\n\nAs commander of the Bosnian Serb army, Mladic orchestrated the siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica genocide.\n\nAfter returning from Bosnia, Vucic, then 23, found a political home with the far-right Serbian Radical Party.\n\nA spiritual successor to the Chetniks, the Radicals’ chief platform was a “Greater Serbia” encompassing most of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nA video from 1995 shows Vucic visiting Serb positions in the wooded valley around Sarajevo alongside the Radicals’ leader Vojislav Seselj, often described as Vucic’s “political father,” who once said he’d scoop out Croats’ eyeballs with a rusty spoon.\n\nIn the clip, Vucic is seen carrying a long, thin object, speculated to be a rifle, which he has denied, claiming to have never fired a gun.\n\nVucic’s rise through the party was meteoric. In 1993, he was elected to parliament as the country’s youngest MP, and less than two years later, became the party’s general secretary.\n\nThen, in July 1995, the worst atrocity in Europe since the second world war took place in Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia. Bosnian Serb forces rounded up and systematically murdered more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys.\n\nJust days later, speaking before Serbia’s parliament, Vucic warned against the interference of outside powers. “If you kill one Serb, we will kill a hundred Muslims,” he said.\n\nNevertheless, in late 1995, following NATO bombardment against Bosnian Serb forces, the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia agreed to end the conflict by signing the Dayton Accords.\n\nIn 1997, Serbia held elections, and the Radicals, to the extreme right of Milosevic and his followers, joined his governing coalition. The same year, Vucic married his first wife, Ksenija Jankovic, a journalist, with whom he’d have two children: a son, Danilo, and a daughter, Milica.\n\nMinister of wartime propaganda\n\nBut there was still the question of Kosovo: an autonomous province within Yugoslavia, formally part of Serbia but populated chiefly by ethnic Albanians.\n\nAlbanians wanted their own republic and ultimately, independence. But Kosovo, as the site of the 1389 battle between Serbs and Ottoman forces, holds immense symbolic, patriotic value in Serb national memory. In early 1998, clashes broke out between Albanian guerrillas and the Yugoslav army (now consisting of only Serbia and Montenegro).\n\nAt about this time, Vucic’s pragmatic, or perhaps opportunistic, approach became apparent. Despite publicly disparaging Milosevic in the past, Vucic accepted the post of minister of information in his government. He was 28.\n\nAmid mounting opposition, Milosevic’s regime grew increasingly repressive, and Vucic oversaw what were, at the time, the tightest media restrictions in Europe.\n\nNewspapers were held responsible for their interviewees’ words and could be heavily fined for printing what the government deemed untrue, effectively banning any suggestion that Serbian soldiers could have committed atrocities. Vucic took a very strict line, personally signing a letter to the newspaper, Danas, warning it’d be shut down if they didn’t cease its critical, “defeatist” tone over the Kosovo war.\n\n“Dismissals, intimidation and arrests of journalists became everyday occurrences; some independent media outlets were shut down or taken over by the state,” explained Polic.\n\n\n\n“Mandatory censorship was also introduced. Editors would … submit the next day’s editions to the censors for approval.”\n\nVucic publicly defended this position, accusing the noncompliant media of working to bring about “the destruction of Serbia as an independent and free state and … the destruction of the entire Serbian people” at the behest of the United States.\n\nAfter soldiers massacred 45 Albanian villagers in the village of Racak, NATO, fearing another Bosnia-style genocide, deployed its warplanes in March 1999. Over the course of 78 days, fireballs lit up the night skies over Belgrade. About 500 civilians and more than 300 members of the armed forces were killed, according to the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Centre, while Vucic and others say more than 2,500 people were killed.\n\nVucic was sitting nearby with Seselj, playing the board game Risk, when a bomb fell on the Yugoslav army’s headquarters. The windows shook, but the players were unharmed. Vucic was one move away from winning, but Seselj took advantage of the impact to flip over the game board, denying victory to his protege.\n\nIn a news release, Vucic decried the “evil, terrible, subversive, cowardly attack by the NATO army on Serbia and Yugoslavia”.\n\n“Serbia will defend itself against the aggressor and will defeat the enemy.”\n\nBut after two months of bombings, Milosevic capitulated, and Yugoslav troops withdrew from Kosovo, replaced by international peacekeepers.\n\nFor his services in silencing dissent, Vucic was awarded an apartment in Belgrade, but his new job wouldn’t last.\n\nRise to power\n\nDiscontent with Milosevic’s rule as a result of political repression, an economy in tatters, and defeat on the battlefield, had been brewing for a few years, but the country reached a tipping point in the 2000 elections: the federal electoral commission refused to concede that the opposition bloc won more than half the vote, amid widespread allegations of ballot-stuffing. Enraged, the opposition called for a nationwide strike.\n\nThe student-led Otpor (“Resistance”) movement protested in the streets, and even football hooligans had had enough, chanting, “Kill yourself, Slobodan!” at matches.\n\nOn October 5, a mob of protesters smashed a bulldozer through the front doors of RTS, the state-run broadcaster, before tearing the offices apart. Milosevic resigned that night.\n\nWhile some celebrated the fall of Milosevic, Vucic remembered it as a very dark day.\n\nBy his own account, he was walking outside with his son when they were attacked by men high on drugs.\n\n“I knocked them both out,” he stated in a 2003 interview.\n\n“I went back to the house, and I knew, of course, that Serbia was going to enter years of decline and destruction.”\n\nBut the former editor of Pravda, a Serbian tabloid, once close to Vucic, claimed the future president spent that day quietly sitting at home, waiting to see what would happen next. Observers see the anecdote as bolstering a tough image.\n\nVucic’s party was out. The new democratically elected Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic tried to face up to Serbia’s role in the Yugoslav wars, speedily extraditing war criminals, including Milosevic.\n\nOrganised crime had flourished in the 1990s, when the government worked closely with smugglers to bypass wartime sanctions and prop up the economy. Djindjic, who tried to clean up the country from the Milosevic-era crime, was assassinated in 2003 by a gang of ex-Arkan’s Tigers (Arkan himself had already been shot dead in an underworld feud before he could face justice).\n\nDjindjic’s centre-left Democratic Party governed Serbia for just under a decade. In this new, pro-Western Serbia, Vucic and the Radicals were back in the opposition. His “political father,” Seselj, had already been indicted in The Hague in 2003 for inciting ethnic cleansing.\n\nDuring the manhunt for Hague fugitive Mladic in 2007, Vucic brought a sign to parliament reading “safe house for Ratko Mladic,” and stuck posters saying “Ratko Mladic Boulevard” along the Belgrade boulevard named after Djindjic. Vucic claimed he was “prosecuted only because he was defending his country”.\n\nThe following year, he led rallies against Radovan Karadzic’s arrest.\n\nBut by now, Vucic was realising that ultranationalism was no longer so popular, and his next steps would prove politically savvy. In September 2008, he defected from the Radicals to cofound the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), a more moderate party with aspirations of joining the EU. Observers argue he was guided by both ambition and pragmatism.\n\n“He changed his clothes, removed Seselj from his lapel, put on a European suit and stepped into a new political chapter,” Polic explained.\n\nHe moderated his stance and highlighted how EU membership – the country formally applied in 2009 – was in the best interest of Serbia’s struggling post-war economy.\n\n“He realised that with that radical position, you cannot get a majority in Serbia,” said Florian Bieber, professor of Southeast European Studies at the University of Graz, Austria.\n\n“So in that sense, he moderated his position for pragmatic reasons, because it’s more important for him to come to power than to promote that particular agenda.”\n\nBut it is unclear how far his beliefs have evolved. Vucic visited Srebrenica in 2015 and acknowledged that terrible crimes took place. “[It] is a move away from where he was ideologically 20 years ago or so,” Bieber said.\n\nHe, however, has repeatedly denied that it was a genocide.\n\nMeanwhile, as Seselj raged at Vucic’s SNS from his prison cell, calling them traitors, Vucic rose in the polls.\n\nBy appealing to moderate, Eurocentric voters while keeping their nationalist base, the SNS became the dominant party in Serbia, winning key plebiscites in 2012 and 2014.\n\nVucic became prime minister after the 2014 elections, and in 2017, he won the presidency.\n\nBalancing act\n\nAfter the isolation, sanctions and war-induced trauma of the 1990s, and the post-Milosevic rush towards privatisation that followed – deepening wealth inequality – Vucic has overseen an improvement in living standards: Since he first entered office in 2012, unemployment has fallen from 24 percent to single digits, while wages have more than doubled. Officials describe the president as a workaholic who only sleeps for three hours a night and routinely calls them at six o’clock in the morning.\n\n“He’s incredibly intelligent, and everybody knows this about him … he’s very, very hardworking,” said Anthony Godfrey, the former US ambassador to Serbia from 2019 to 2022, who developed a close working relationship with Vucic.\n\nA lot of the economic improvements came as a result of investment from China, which has poured billions of dollars into Serbian infrastructure through its Belt and Road Initiative. Vucic has visited China at least seven times, more than any other European leader.\n\n“Vucic calls his relationship with China ‘the friendship made of steel’,” Godfrey told Al Jazeera.\n\nGodfrey described Vucic, who he says is “six-foot-seven, easy,” as towering over everyone else in the room and making a “serious impression,” as well as being a skilled diplomat.\n\n“He’s very respectful and humble when he meets with visitors. He’s a good host when people come to visit, and he genuinely wants to see what benefit a relationship can provide for Serbia.”\n\nThe president and the ambassador connected over their shared interests.\n\n“One of his hobbies, or actually a passion I would say, is the study of wine. He’s an oenophile, and he’s got a collection of very fine wines … Serbia now produces good wine, and a lot of that is his passion coming through.”\n\nMeanwhile, the ambassador added, Vucic has openly provided armaments to Ukraine, staving off criticism from the West over undemocratic practices. At the same time, he has refused to sanction Russia, asserting that “85 percent of Serbians will always side with Russia, whatever happens.”\n\nRussophilia is common in Serbia, dating back to the 19th century when Russia, a fellow Slavic Orthodox nation, supported Serbia’s independence from the Ottoman Empire. More recently, the two countries share a suspicion of NATO and the West.\n\n“He’s been trying to balance these competing global powers, which, of course, requires some level of skill considering the kind of global competition,” Bieber said.\n\nBut he also pointed to Vucic’s strategy of dodging EU demands that could threaten his hold on power. For instance, late last year, the EU expressed concern that a proposed judicial overhaul may undermine the rule of law and corruption investigations, at a time when prosecutors were probing high-ranking officials’ dealings with organised crime.\n\n“When a country is a candidate for EU membership, as Serbia is, we expect it to behave in a European manner,” said EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos. “This is a serious step backwards.”\n\n“It was said that Vucic must not sign, that Brussels ordered him not to. Someone ordering me? Anyone who thinks that is possible is not normal. I will listen to everyone, but I make the decisions,” the president fired back as he signed the proposal into law this year.\n\nVucic has to maintain a delicate balance at home, too. While he may have once held together a big tent of Europhiles and nationalists, according to Godfrey, the president has come to rely on the latter, including Serbs living in Kosovo or Bosnia who are eligible to vote in Serbian elections.\n\n“They are going to vote for Vucic, provided he still sings the right nationalist song,” Godfrey explained.\n\n“So as long as he keeps saying ‘NATO bad, Kosovo is Serbia,’ things like that, the people on the right will continue to vote for him.\n\n“But it’s pushing him to become even more extremist the more dependent he is on these votes.”\n\nThis doesn’t mean Vucic is a serious nationalist so much as an opportunist, according to Polic.\n\n“When he is speaking to the West, he is a reformist who strives for peace. When he is speaking to his voters, he is a warrior, defending every inch of the land,” she said. “In reality, Kosovo is his political currency with which he pays for his survival on the throne.”\n\nVucic has not recognised Kosovo’s 2008 declared independence, which Godfrey said would be extremely politically “costly”.\n\nBut some believe Vucic’s nationalist fervour is still very real.\n\nMilos Injac, a local government representative for the Green-Left Front in Belgrade, considers figures like Seselj as useful stand-ins for Vucic’s real beliefs, which he says haven’t changed since the 1990s. Since his release from a Dutch prison in 2014, Seselj has become a public supporter of Vucic.\n\n“I think he’s exactly the same as he was, but for the sake of looking normal and not having Europe breathing down his neck, he has his own goons that will say what he doesn’t want to say,” Injac said.\n\nNevertheless, that hasn’t stopped public disillusionment with Vucic, culminating in mass anticorruption protests since 2024 that threaten his grip on power.\n\nThe drop that spilled the glass\n\nIn November 2024, the concrete canopy of the railway station in Novi Sad, Serbia’s second-largest city, collapsed onto the pavement, killing 16 people.\n\nMass protests broke out – first in Novi Sad, then nationwide – against what was perceived to be a corrupt construction process, becoming a rallying cry for discontent with the government.\n\n“Every government since the 1990s has tried to make politics something dirty, and as the elections come up, less and less people were voting,’” Injac, a veteran of protests over the past 10 years, observed.\n\n“But what happened in Novi Sad made people realise that it doesn’t matter how much you don’t care about politics, your child could have been underneath that thing … This was like the drop that spilled the glass.”\n\nPolice used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse crowds, which shattered the windows of government buildings and threw eggs, bottles and bricks. Protest leaders said masked rioters were agent provocateurs. But the protests continued to swell.\n\nThe protests have led to resignations, including that of Serbia’s prime minister and Novi Sad’s mayor early last year.\n\nVucic has tried to placate the protesters by issuing pardons for 13 detained demonstrators. Meanwhile, 13 other individuals were arrested on corruption charges related to the catastrophe, including two former ministers. But Vucic has also publicly implied that the canopy catastrophe was deliberately orchestrated to stir up the opposition.\n\nThe protesters, unsatisfied, dug in, pitching tents on the road in front of the National Assembly. A separate camp of SNS supporters settled on the opposite side of the fence, acting as a buffer between the protests and the parliament.\n\nThe Serbian investigative outlet KRIK identified several individuals at the pro-government camp as prominent football hooligans and other criminals, including a burly one-eyed ex-convict named Petar Panic, a decades-long personal friend of Vucic.\n\nAccording to Dordevic, the crime expert, Serbian football thugs provide muscle for organised crime as well as “rent-a-mobs” for politicians, including to stir up police trouble or attack protesters.\n\nHe and Bieber say the same tactics apply now.\n\n‘Desire to be in control’\n\nAs protests continue, Vucic maintains a grip on power, including through the media. The majority of newspapers and TV stations are controlled by his allies, but independent media still exists in Serbia. Still, non-state-aligned journalists are threatened, harassed and occasionally assaulted, while oppositionists are smeared.\n\n“If [the opposition] are talked about, they’re slandered,” said Bieber. “They’re called scum, foreign traitors, collaborators with external powers.”\n\n“[Vucic] does not use the media — he owns them,” added Polic.\n\n“He orders ‘exclusives’, makes targets out of people, with a standard dose of state paranoia. Criticism of him or the regime is translated into this machinery as treason, and any suspicion as hatred towards Serbia.”\n\nAfter the broadcast of her documentary about Vucic, “The Ruler”, on Serbian television, for example, Vucic’s lawyers presented Polic with a lawsuit in 2023. There was an outcry, and Vucic announced on Instagram that he was withdrawing the lawsuit, which he claimed was filed behind his back.\n\nThe ongoing protest movement is demanding early elections before Vucic is officially due to step down in 2027. The president has agreed, but no date has been set for a vote.\n\n“If this lasts longer, he knows that in the long term, he will win,” Injac said.\n\n“People get tired … [they] have their jobs, their families, their own concerns. They don’t have time to stand in the streets all day … [But Vucic] knows that he’s sitting on a barrel of gunpowder that can explode any second.”\n\nWhy won’t Vucic step aside?\n\n“‘I am the state’ has been his motto for over a decade,” Polic said, comparing the president with the 18th-century French King Louis XIV, who reigned as an absolute monarch.\n\n“He turned Serbia into a personal possession … He captured the state, occupied institutions, killed democracy, threatened human rights, trampled on the media, collapsed society.”\n\n“He portrays himself as a martyr, as somebody who is sacrificing his time and energy for the country,” Bieber said. “But I think this desire to be in control really is a driving force for him.”\n\nAmbassador Godfrey pointed to Vucic’s thinking that he alone can do what’s best for Serbia.\n\n“Vucic wants to raise the living standard in Serbia, wants to invest in the infrastructure, wants to do all these things, but he thinks, in my view, that the only person who can do this is him.\n\n“And therefore, it’s very important for him to stay and to continue doing these things.”"

            "content": "US president makes a number of other claims and predictions without evidence, as Iran promises a ‘crushing’ retaliation of its own.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump has said the joint US-Israeli attacks on Iran are aimed at “eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime”.\n\n“Short time ago, US military began major combat operation in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating threats from the Iranian regime,” he said on Saturday.\n\nTrump made a number of other claims and predictions without any concrete evidence, as Iran promised a “crushing” retaliation of its own. Iran is preparing to “take revenge” on Israel and deliver “strong response”, State TV reported.\n\n“We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground.”\n\n“We are going to annihilate their navy. We are going to ensure that the region’s ‘terrorist’ proxies can no longer destabilise the region or the world.”\n\n“We will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It is a very simple message.”\n\n“They will never have a nuclear weapon. This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces.”\n\nIran has repeatedly said it would never build a nuclear weapon and that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only. Neither US intelligence, nor the UN nuclear watchdog have found any evidence that Iran was pursuing an atomic weapon, a narrative Israel and some in the Trump administration have nevertheless pushed.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, said sources told him that “US involvement in this attack is aimed at “decapitating the Iranian regime”.\n\n\n\n“They say that from what they can understand, the attacks were concentrated on areas where Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may be sheltering, so the intention was to try and take out the head of the regime and then see what would happen afterwards,” he added.\n\nOne of the areas targeted in Iran’s capital was near the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, The Associated Press reported. Khamenei is not in Tehran and has been transferred to a secure location, according to an official quoted by Reuters.\n\n“There are countries that have been cautioning the US against this attack and wanted to know what the plan for the day after would be, simply because you can’t guarantee that by removing the supreme leader you would necessarily form a pro-US government,” Fisher said."

Importantly, they sell below the €2,681 (about $3,160) e-bike average — expensive compared to the US, but far less likely to burst into flames.\n\nMy Tenways review e-bike arrived at my front door in a giant cardboard box. It seemed big enough to fit the CGO Compact fully assembled and with the handlebar twisted, yet I still had to attach the steering column and front wheel myself. The e-bike took about 20 minutes to unbox, but I’ve been assembling direct-to-consumer e-bikes about once a month for the last decade.\n\nQuickly adjusts to fit my wife who is 164cm (5ft 5in) tall. The handlebars and shock-absorbing seat can be raised in seconds to fit my 183cm (6ft) frame. Open the release to raise and lower the handlebars, lift that little pin to twist them out of the way. The folding pedals help create a wall-hugging profile that’s easy to walk past.\n\nThe first thing I did after assembly was play with the Byschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem. It’s magical. Open the lever to quickly raise and lower the handlebar, or to gain access to a pin release that lets the handlebar twist out of the way. It took a little practice for everyone to master but we soon got the hang of it.\n\nThe small LCD dashboard is bright and colorful even in the sun. You have to enter a four-digit PIN code at power-on, which can only be changed in the rudimentary app over Bluetooth. It’s the only theft-deterrence Tenways offers on the CGO Compact, which also means it won’t try to upsell you on subscriptions or software-locked features.\n\nDespite our height differences, ranging from 164cm to 183cm (5ft 5in to 6 feet), everyone found the CGO Compact to be very comfortable. Adjusting the handlebar and saddle takes less than 10 seconds, and the suspension seatpost did a good job of soaking up small bumps. But the seat’s quick release mechanism offers no additional security to prevent the post and saddle from being stolen. A no-no in the big European cities this bike targets.\n\nThe e-bike’s torque sensor made the ride exceptionally intuitive, ensuring that the power delivered by the 250W rear-hub motor was tuned to match the downward force exerted on the pedals. The motor was also very quiet, masked entirely by the sound of the wide, 2.4-inch tires riding over asphalt.\n\nThe Tenways motor is only capable of 45Nm of torque. And without additional gears, the CGO Compact is best for mostly flat environments. It still did better than I expected on hills, easily besting the 35Nm Raleigh One I recently reviewed. For example, I was able to cross a bridge with a 10 percent incline that stymied the Raleigh One, but only if I had a rolling start — otherwise, I had to get off and push. On downhill slopes, the large chainring allowed me to pedal comfortably at speeds approaching 30km/h without my legs frantically spinning out. The pedal-assist, however, quits helping at 25km/h (16mph) in Europe.\n\nI also didn’t experience any of the twitchiness you get from folding bikes with relatively short wheelbases, smaller 16-inch wheels, and narrow handlebars. In general I rode in pedal-assist levels 3 or 4 out of 5, with 3 feeling the most natural, and 4 for when I was in a hurry.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 25 The suspension seat post soaked up bumps on a variety of road surfaces.\n\nOn a full battery I managed to travel 65kms (over 40 miles) before needing a recharge. I received alerts on my iPhone and Apple Watch when the battery dropped to 10 percent, and power dropped noticeably when the estimated remaining range hit 4km. Charging the 494.36Wh battery took a relatively slow 4.5 hours from the bundled charger.\n\nThe CGO Compact was obviously designed by people that actually ride bikes in compact European cities. It comes standard with integrated lighting, mudguards, a loud bell, kickstand, and a partially covered transmission to protect trousers, skirts, and long coats from getting snagged. The little crossbar in the step-through frame even doubles as a handle to help hoist the bike up stairs.\n\nCity bikes need to haul things, which is why the CGO Compact comes fitted with the click-and-go MIK HD rear carrier system. It supports loads up to 27kg (almost 60 pounds) — enough to fit a compatible crate or child seat. The e-bike also has mounting points up front for a bottle cage or rack.\n\nIn general, the Android and iOS app is fine, but it’s rarely needed. It might eventually be useful for buying accessories and insurance, or starting a chat with support and finding the nearest service center. It also promises to show riding data collected by date, but this never worked for me, only showing zeroes.\n\nTenways’ CGO Compact is an excellent e-bike for €1,999 (about $2,365). The riding experience, everyone agrees, has been stellar. And when it eventually needs servicing, Tenways has a solid network of local bike shops in Europe to provide support, with a ready supply of the off-the-shelf parts from brands you know.\n\nThe CGO Compact is a highly adaptable e-bike that rides big and tucks away small, making it an ideal companion for European city life. It’s also exceedingly shareable — but nobody would blame you for keeping it all for yourself.\n\nCGO Compact Specs Tenways C9 Hub Motor (250W, 45Nm torque)\n\nSingle-speed Gates CDN Carbon belt drive\n\n494.36Wh removable battery\n\nSuspension seat post for Selle Royal saddle\n\nTektro hydraulic disc brakes\n\nByschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem\n\nBike weight: 24kg (almost 53 pounds) with all accessories\n\nMax load: 145kg (320 pounds)\n\nMIK HD Rear Carrier system with 27kg (almost 60 pounds) max load\n\nFits riders 160cm and 190cm (5ft 2in to 6ft 2in)\n\nAccessory mounting points on head tube\n\nIntegrated front and rear lighting with daytime running light\n\nLCD display\n\nBasic app for iOS and Android\n\nPhotography by Thomas Ricker / The Verge"

Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of “effective altruism,” they have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission - a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives.\n\nThe Terms of Service of Anthropic’s defective altruism will never outweigh the safety, the readiness, or the lives of American troops on the battlefield.\n\nTheir true objective is unmistakable: to seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military. That is unacceptable.\n\nAs President Trump stated on Truth Social, the Commander-in-Chief and the American people alone will determine the destiny of our armed forces, not unelected tech executives.\n\nAnthropic’s stance is fundamentally incompatible with American principles. Their relationship with the United States Armed Forces and the Federal Government has therefore been permanently altered.\n\nIn conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security. Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic. Anthropic will continue to provide the Department of War its services for a period of no more than six months to allow for a seamless transition to a better and more patriotic service.\n\nAmerica’s warfighters will never be held hostage by the ideological whims of Big Tech.

            "content": "Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.\n\nYet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, Kodak, and others.\n\nAll the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.\n\nIf you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that offers great image quality and lets you choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like Kodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.\n\nTake a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for most people\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 306 grams / Charging method: AA batteries / Companion app: None / Other features: Built-in selfie mirror, film counter\n\nIf all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well-suited for kids and those new to photography.\n\nFor an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most struggle to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash helps. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both bright and dark environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. Photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before, but selfies captured my features and skin tone more accurately, thanks in part to the small front-facing mirror. The updated lens design also lets you twist into Close-Up Mode to zoom slightly and activate the Parallax Correction features for a more aligned photo. It’s a fun, point-and-shoot-style feature, though aligning photos still takes some practice (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).\n\nFor an instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 produces vivid, relatively true-to-life photos. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nThe Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the small counter that shows your remaining shots, which is a useful tracking feature given that each print costs about $1. However, it doesn’t support Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it doesn’t feature filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for a solid instant camera that caters to all ages and experience levels, you’ll likely be satisfied with the Instax Mini 12.\n\nThe best premium instant camera\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 285 grams / Charging method: USB-C (on newer models) / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nOne of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo was a favorite of my former colleague Becca Farcase — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a handsome brown version, as well as a newer pink model.\n\nIt’s easy to balk at its price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.\n\nBeing able to adjust the brightness of the prints helped me capture night photos and a low-light immersive exhibit a little more clearly and realistically, which is a feature the Instax Mini 12 doesn’t offer. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Mini 12, the Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can disable the flash, leverage the 3-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder, and adjust the brightness of a print — a helpful feature, given Evo doesn’t capture dark environments well. The camera’s dials also let you apply various lens options and effects, from retro filters to monochrome shades, and you can even take app-based remote shots, allowing for better seflies and more photographic control.\n\nThe Evo isn’t perfect, though. The companion app isn’t as feature-rich as competing software, the menu system can be confusing to navigate, and the camera’s internal storage maxes out at 45 images. Still, these are relatively minor drawbacks for a stylish, portable camera that makes it easy to quickly capture and print quality shots.\n\nThe best instant camera for social occasions\n\nFilm type: Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / Film size: 3 x 3-inch square prints / Weight: 467 grams / Charging method: Micro USB / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nWhereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app lets you apply frames, stickers, filters, and a wide range of customization options to photos, making it great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature in the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making it a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.\n\nLike the Evo, the Shot 3 Retro features an LCD screen — albeit a much smaller one — that lets you decide whether to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp images from your phone. Unlike the Evo, however, the Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of film. It also uses cheaper film; you can often pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for under $20. The cheaper arguably encourages creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than those from both Fujifilm and Polaroid.\n\nPhotos taken with the Kodak Mini Shot 3 aren’t particularly sharp and can have an excessive pink tint. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nHowever, there are notable drawbacks to the Shot 3 Retro. The resulting prints aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone, for one, nor were they as clear or sharp as what you might get with the Evo or Mini 12 (some even have an excessive pink tint). The Shot 3 Retro doesn’t store images the way the Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish. Nonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.\n\nThe best instant camera for retro fans\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / Weight: 648 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: Yes / Other features: Flip-up lid, scene analysis feature\n\nIf you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the Polaroid Flip is the camera for you. It resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 more than any other camera on our list, thanks to its classic, retro-inspired design and flip-up lid. Its square I-Type film prints and iconic white frame give photos an authentically vintage look, while modern touches like Bluetooth, USB-C charging, and a beginner-friendly companion app add greater convenience and creative control.\n\nCompared to the third-gen Polaroid Now Plus, my former retro pick, the Flip delivers clearer shots with fewer wasted photos, making the extra $50 worthwhile given that eight I-Type sheets are a spendy $18.99. The increased clarity can be attributed to several factors, including the Flip’s sonar autofocus and a four-lens hyperfocal system — which result in sharper, more focused images — along with its excellent flash. It’s the most powerful of any Polaroid camera, and while it can sometimes overexpose images, you can adjust exposure directly from the camera or app. The Scene Analysis feature also helps by warning if a shot is likely to be over- or underexposed, or if you’re too close to your subject. In my experience, the warnings didn’t always prevent overexposure, but they did leave me with shots that looked less blown than those from the Now Plus.\n\nA few outdoor examples I captured with the Polaroid Flip. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nAll that being said, there are some notable drawbacks. The Flip is relatively heavy and awkwardly sized, so you can’t slip it into a purse or easily carry it around. Prints also take up to 15 minutes to develop — during which they must be shielded from light — which can be quite an inconvenience. Low-light performance remains a weak spot as well, and I struggled to capture indoor shots given the contrast and saturation are lower than with Instax film. Admittedly, this gave my pictures a more dreamy, vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust the saturation and exposure settings.\n\nTruth be told, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, the Flip is the perfect camera for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for portability\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / Weight: 239 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: No / Other features: Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter\n\nWhereas the Flip is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It weighs just over a pound and fits easily in the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it the most portable instant camera on our list. If its images were more true to life and didn’t require you to sheild them from the light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d call it the best instant camera for kids or travel.\n\nAt $89.99, the latest Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera available, with film that costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (a 16-sheet pack runs $21.99). The new Go sports a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including USB-C support, and Polaroid claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor. Photos are slightly brighter, though the original Go produced warmer images that felt more true to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low, but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Flip.\n\nThe second-gen Polaroid Go produces charming photos but with a cooler tone. Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Flip, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. There’s no Bluetooth or companion app for added effects; however, the camera does include a self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. The smaller prints may disappoint those who prefer traditional Polaroid sizes, though, and its modern design lacks the retro charm of older models. But classic Polaroid cameras didn’t come with an app, either, and the Go’s simplicity makes it an a easy-to-use option that delivers a traditional instant film experience at less than half the price of the Flip.\n\nOther instant cameras to consider\n\nFujifilm’s $116.99 Instax Mini 41 is the long-awaited follow-up to the Mini 40. The updated model retains the retro design found on the prior model but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups. It didn’t take long testing the Mini 41 for me to realize it’s simply the Mini 12 for adults. With its black-and-silver body and flatter, squarer edges, the Mini 41 looks sleeker and more stylish. The two cameras are nearly identical, aside from the design, with the same solid photo quality and feature set. Both battery-powered options turn on with a simple twist of the lens, and each comes equipped with a selfie mirror, a close-up mode, and a flash (which cannot be disabled).\n\nThere are a few subtle upgrades to the Mini 41, however. A textured grip in the front makes it easier to hold, and its shape makes shooting in landscape mode more comfortable. But those are small differences, and at their core, the cameras offer the same experience. Since the Instax Mini 12 retails for less, I ultimately believe it’s the better value; however, if a fashionable, mature look appeals to you, the Mini 41 is a great alternative, especially if you can find it on sale.\n\nIf you’re looking for an advanced analog instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At $234.95, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12 or the Mini 41, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click cameras given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket, an aluminum extension column, and a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur when capturing fast-moving subjects.\n\nThanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12, Mini 41, and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera, not a hybrid like the Evo, so you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The newer model is also less user-friendly than the Mini 12 and Mini 41, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters.\n\nThe Kodak Smile Plus is another hybrid instant camera that allows you to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $129.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with a physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers.\n\nHowever, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark.\n\nThat said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software isn’t as snappy or feature-rich, it still lets you add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it’s often available for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.\n\nFrom photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, Leica’s Sofort 2 is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.\n\nThe drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s challenging to recommend at $399, as most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The Leica user interface is easier to navigate, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also appreciate that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.\n\nWhile it didn’t make the cut, the Instax Square SQ1 is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and features a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $159.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100. That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Flip and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.\n\nFujifilm also sells the newer Instax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at $199.95. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.\n\nFujifilm’s Instax Wide Evo Hybrid is nearly identical to the Instax Mini Evo. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $409.95 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lenses and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.\n\nPlus, unlike the Wide 400, the Wide Evo Hybrid is a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful feature that can reduce wasted shots. However, at $409.95, it costs significantly more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken, which is something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects, such as a dog or hyperactive toddler.\n\nIf you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $409.95 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $175.95 Instax Wide 400 is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar stills to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.\n\nFujifilm’s new Instax Mini LiPlay Plus isn’t nearly as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo, but it’s worth considering if you take a lot of selfies. At $234.99, the hybrid camera costs the same as the Instax Mini Evo, but features a 3-inch LCD screen on the back, along with a second, rear-facing wide-angle lens designed specifically for self-portraits. That dedicated selfie camera, paired with the LCD, delivers some of the best — and most precise — selfies I’ve captured with an instant camera to date.\n\nThe LiPlay Plus also includes some fun extra features, such as a layered photo mode that combines images from both cameras into a single shot. It can also record short audio clips, which are saved as a QR code you can place in a corner of the printed photo. Both features are enjoyable to play with, though the layered photo mode can, admittedly, come off as gimmicky. You’re basically just dropping a selfie onto a background image with no way to reposition or resize it.\n\nWhat I’m looking for How we test instant cameras Collapse Typically, I try to spend at least a couple of weeks, if not months, testing each camera to get a sense of what it would be like to actually own one. I’ll use them to capture photos of loved ones while hanging out, as well as subjects and scenes I stumble across as I explore Los Angeles and its many beaches. I shoot indoors and outside, with and without the flash, allowing me to compare how each camera performs in both bright and low-light environments.I also ask friends and family — both young and old — for their input on image quality, and I have them take photos with the instant camera to get their thoughts on usability. If the camera comes with extra features, such as filters or support for a companion app, I’ll make sure to put them to the test in real-life situations. I note how easy it is to pull up and navigate the app, apply the effects, and, of course, how the results look. Photo quality Collapse Instant cameras aren’t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most struggle in low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life. Ease of use Collapse How easy is it to set the instant camera up and take photos with it? Ease of use is a big part of what makes instant cameras fun and accessible to people of all ages. You shouldn’t need a professional photography background just to enjoy an instant camera. Value Collapse Instant cameras come with different features at various price points. Generally, the more feature-rich cameras tend to be pricier, but do the extra capabilities justify the added cost? Some cameras, for example, pair with a companion app or feature a built-in selfie mirror, while others let you print images from your phone. None of these are essential, though the added niceties may be worth it for some people. Suitability Collapse Some instant cameras aren’t as well-suited for certain situations and / or people as others. For example, there are instant cameras that print old-fashioned Polaroid photos that aren’t very clear. They frustrate me, but retro lovers might find them charming. Other cameras come with advanced creative modes that let you edit photos and even print smartphone photos, but a young child might find them difficult to use. Film Collapse Each instant camera requires a different kind of film, which means that the sticker price of the camera isn’t the true price. This is something you should take into account before making a purchase, as the cost of film can quickly add up. Depending on the brand, you may have to pay anywhere between 50 cents and $2 a shot.It’s also important to take into account that some film is easier to find. The Instax Mini 12, for example, uses credit card-size Instax Mini film that’s sold at most major retailers. Other types of film, including the film needed for Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, are available on Amazon but aren’t sold by as many retailers.Finally, most instant camera brands sell films of varying quality in a range of styles. Some are decorated with colorful frames and patterns, while others are black and white. They also vary in shape and size, from small rectangular prints you can stick in your wallet to square-shaped ones. You can also buy wider prints, and some brands even sell film with an adhesive backing that allows you to use the resulting images as stickers.\n\nUpdate, February 27th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and shorten the copy for all of our main entries."

The Artemis III mission, scheduled for 2027, was originally going to attempt to land on the Moon but will now be a test flight instead. NASA also says it’s “increasing its cadence of missions,” including adding a second test flight in 2027 and aiming for “at least one surface landing every year thereafter,” including the Artemis IV landing.\n\nThe overhaul to the Artemis launch schedule follows a report from NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) earlier this month that highlighted serious safety risks with NASA’s previous plans for future launches. ASAP was particularly concerned about Artemis III, which its report said included too many “cumulative technical, operational, and schedule risks associated with multiple first-of-a-kind objectives planned for a single mission.”\n\nThe Artemis II mission, scheduled for this year, has faced a string of issues during testing over recent weeks, delaying its launch until no earlier than April. Artemis II is intended to orbit the Moon — if it’s successful, it will be the first time humans visit lunar orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance’s merger agreement is now official. On Friday, the two companies announced plans to merge into a massive media company that will fold WBD’s studio, linear channels, streaming service, and gaming segment into Paramount.\n\nThough WBD initially signed onto an $83 billion agreement to merge part of Warner Bros. with Netflix, Paramount persisted with a hostile takeover bid, followed by a series of offers. That persistence paid off, as WBD determined that Paramount’s “best and final” offer is “superior” to Netflix’s deal. On Thursday, Netflix declined to match Paramount’s bid, calling it “no longer financially attractive.”\n\nParamount and WBD say the board of directors of both companies has signed off on the deal. The companies expect it to close in the third quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Under the agreement, Paramount will acquire WBD in a deal valued at $110 billion. Paramount has also agreed to cover the $7 billion regulatory termination fee and the $2.8 billion breakup fee owed to Netflix, which it has already paid, according to Bloomberg.\n\n“Together, Paramount and WBD will deliver greater choice for consumers through its leading streaming platforms with an exceptional intellectual property portfolio that has produced popular franchises such as Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Top Gun, the DC Universe and SpongeBob SquarePants,” the companies say in the press release.\n\nLawmakers and regulators are skeptical about the Paramount-WBD merger. “A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a statement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta also warned that the agreement isn’t a “done deal,” and that the state’s Department of Justice will be “vigorous” in its review of the merger."

            "content": "Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts, and have stopped getting a response. This week, thanks to a reader tip, we think we’ve found the original phone the T1 is based on.\n\nA long time ago, back when the Trump phone was but a single, inaccurate render and a contradictory spec sheet, we tried to figure out what other phone it might be based on. Now, eight months, two spec overhauls, and one redesign later, I have a good guess: the HTC U24 Pro.\n\nI didn’t spot this by myself. A reader first tipped me off to the similarities between the U24 Pro and the Trump phone I revealed a few weeks ago, which are numerous: a similar angled body and curved display, a unique front sensor array, and broadly similar specs, including oddities like a headphone jack and microSD card support.\n\nLet’s get one thing out the way at the top: I’m pretty sure HTC isn’t secretly building the Trump phone. Sohaib Ahmed, the company’s global director of PR, told me as much: “HTC does not design or manufacture phones for third parties.” But that doesn’t rule out another company playing a part in designing or building both phones, and given just how similar they look, I suspect that’s exactly what happened.\n\nIt’s a little hard to make out in this screenshot, but the Trump phone shares the sharply angled edges of the HTC U24 Pro. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nThe U24 Pro is an odd phone in its own right. It launched in 2024 for €549 (around $600 at the time), and was heralded in some corners as a return from the dead for HTC, despite the fact that it followed the U23 Pro a year earlier, and a string of smaller releases that targeted the Asian market. HTC, once one of the major players in the Android phone industry, had been greatly diminished ever since selling a large part of its smartphone business to Google for $1.1 billion in 2017.\n\nBoth the T1 Phone and the U24 Pro share a slightly asymmetric angular frame, jutting out into a point along every edge, with a heavily curved screen on the front. I cannot think of, nor find, another phone that is quite the same shape — even small details like the positions of the antenna lines around the power and volume buttons line up. Even more telling is the set of sensors along each phone’s top. The U24 Pro splits up its speaker grill, notification LED, and proximity sensor into three, resulting in an unusual design with a long bar, a small dot for the LED, and then a second shorter bar, at the point where the display meets the phone’s top. What looks like the same sensor design can be clearly seen on the Trump phone I was shown, though I can’t confirm that the sensors themselves are the same, or that the T1 Phone will also have a notification LED.\n\nBoth phones have near-identical sets of speakers and sensors about the front selfie camera, with headphone jack and microphone visible behind them on the top edges. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nOther details are subtler. It’s hard to tell exactly from the glimpses I got of the Trump phone, but along the top frame it certainly looks to have both a headphone jack and a microphone in the exact same positions as on the HTC device. Even having a headphone jack in the first place is evidence of the phones’ connection, given how rare the feature is in modern devices. The same can be said for the fact that both phones include a microSD card slot, sharing support for up to 1TB cards on top of a base 512GB of storage.\n\nWhile the rear cameras look completely different, which seems to scupper my theory, look again: The U24 Pro’s cameras are split into a pair close together, with a third lens lower down. The new Trump phone sets all its cameras in one mount, but they’re unevenly spaced, with a larger gap between the second and third lenses. These cameras may look totally different on the surface, but I suspect that underneath you’ll find they’re similar. And what we know of the specs matches too: Trump Mobile told me that its phone will have 50-megapixel sensors for both the main and selfie cameras, and my glimpse of its camera UI showed an ultrawide and a 2x zoom option — all of which you’ll find on the U24 Pro.\n\nThe two phones’ cameras look different at first, but the unusual lens placement might just line up. Screenshot: Dominic Preston / The Verge and Image: HTC\n\nAssuming that the two phones are essentially the same, does the U24 Pro tell us any more about what to expect from the T1? It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, matching what I’d been told about a Snapdragon 7-series chip in the Trump phone. The U24 Pro has a 6.8-inch OLED display, 60W wired charging and even wireless charging support, and an IP67 rating for dust and water protection. There’s reason to be cautious reading too much into the spec sheet, though: The U24 Pro released with a 4,600mAh battery, smaller than the 5,000mAh capacity I’ve been told will be in the Trump phone. If that spec differs, then other elements of the internals could well too — the bigger battery in particular might replace the wireless charging coils of the HTC phone.\n\nThe U24 Pro launched to middling reviews, which may not inspire much confidence in Trump Mobile’s offering. Tech Advisor gave the phone two and a half stars out of five, calling it “hard to recommend over rivals,” while Notebookcheck declared it “modern and yet out of date.” Still, it fared surprisingly well in a JerryRigEverything teardown and durability test.\n\nHe noticed, however, that this didn’t appear to be the HTC of old, lacking the sapphire crystal HTC previously used on its displays and optical image stabilization on the front camera it once pioneered. The U24 Pro and other HTC phones released in the last few years share little consistent design language, and ship with near-stock Android software. Speculation has been rife that HTC isn’t in fact manufacturing the phones internally, but had commissioned an ODM — original design manufacturer — to produce the hardware. ODMs design and manufacture phones for other companies, usually to a set of specifications provided by the consumer-facing brands, and often retain ownership of the designs, allowing them to reuse and repurpose them for other clients. I asked HTC for clarification, but the company wouldn’t confirm whether the U24 Pro was made in-house or contracted out.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that Trump Mobile, or its manufacturing partner, is simply ripping off the design of a little-known HTC device. But I think the most likely answer here is a more mundane one: HTC probably worked with some unnamed ODM to design and manufacture the U24 Pro, and Trump Mobile just happened to work with the same company. That manufacturer may have either dug out its old designs for HTC when developing the T1 Phone, or perhaps gave new life to old, unused components from HTC’s production run. Without knowing the hypothetical ODM involved, it’s hard to say for sure. Trump Mobile has previously confirmed that it’s working with a partner or partners to manufacture its phones outside the US, before their “final assembly” in Miami, but executive Don Hendrickson wouldn’t tell me the name of its manufacturer or where it’s based. I reached out to the company again for comment on this story, and received no reply.\n\nSo no, I don’t think that HTC made the Trump phone. But it does look likely that it is based, more or less, on one of that company’s phones. It remains to be seen how the T1 Phone will differ in its details, but the fact that its origins seem so closely tied to an unpopular midranger from two years ago doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the T1 Phone’s flagship credentials.\n\nGot inside information on Trump Mobile or the Trump phone?

            "content": "Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.\n\nThe blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.\n\nThe Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.\n\nAccess to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.\n\nWe understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase.

Supabase continues to follow up through all available channels to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nWe continue to advise affected customers… — Supabase (@supabase) February 27, 2026\n\nAn Indian founder, who asked not to be named to avoid potential repercussions, told TechCrunch they had stopped seeing new user sign-ups from India over the past two to three days. A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.\n\nWhile Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.\n\nAt the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nA screenshot showing Supabase’s access blocked on ACT Fibernet Image Credits:Screenshot / Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\n\nNotably, Supabase’s main website remained accessible in India — but its underlying developer infrastructure did not.\n\nIndia is Supabase’s fourth-largest source of traffic, accounting for about 9% of global visits, according to data from Similarweb, highlighting the potential fallout for the country’s developer ecosystem. The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.\n\nThe incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.\n\n“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.”\n\nIndia has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted access to developer platform GitHub, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also reported that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.\n\nFounded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has gained traction amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its valuation to $5 billion.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond."

The employee used confidential OpenAI information in connection with the trades made, the company alleges.\n\nOpenAI didn’t release the name of the employee. However, a spokesperson said that such actions violated a company policy that bans workers from using inside information for personal gain, including on prediction markets.\n\nPrediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi allow people to make wagers on the outcomes of real-world events. For instance, on Polymarket, there are wagers being made around the kind of products OpenAI will announce in 2026 and when the company will go public. They can cover any event, and some eye-popping money can be made. As we recently reported, an accountant won a $470,300 jackpot on Kalshi by betting against DOGE believers.\n\nPrediction markets insist they are not gambling sites, preferring to label themselves as financial platforms. Kalshi is a regulated exchange and, in fact, it fined and banned a MrBeast editor for similar alleged insider trading earlier this week. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment."

The president allowed for a six-month phase-out period for departments using the products, but emphasized that Anthropic was no longer welcome as a federal contractor.\n\n“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again,” the president wrote in the post.\n\nNotably, the president’s post did not mention any plans to designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk, as had been previously mentioned as a consequence. However, a subsequent tweet from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made good on the threat.\n\n“In conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security,” Secretary Hegseth wrote. “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\n\nThe Pentagon dispute centered on Anthropic’s refusal to allow its AI models to be used to power either mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, which Secretary Hegseth found unduly restrictive.\n\nCEO Dario Amodei reiterated his stance in a public post on Thursday, refusing to compromise on the two points.\n\n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters — with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei wrote at the time. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Per the BBC, CEO Sam Altman sent a memo to staff on Thursday saying he shared the same “red lines” and that any OpenAI-related defense contracts would also reject uses that were “unlawful or unsuited to cloud deployments, such as domestic surveillance and autonomous offensive weapons.”\n\nOpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who very publicly fell out with Altman in November 2023 and has since co-founded his own AI company, also waded into the conversation on Friday, writing on X: “It’s extremely good that Anthropic has not backed down, and it’s significant that OpenAI has taken a similar stance.”\n\nBut within hours of the Trump administration ordering federal agencies to cut ties with Anthropic, OpenAI moved to fill the void, announcing a deal with the Pentagon that Altman said preserved the same core principles Anthropic had fought for — prohibitions on domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, OpenAI and the government began meeting about a potential tie-up on Wednesday of this week.\n\nSurely, there will be more twists to come.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI and Google each received contract awards from the U.S. Defense Department last July. While some Google employees have come out in support of Anthropic, Google and its parent company have yet to comment.\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\n\nStill, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more."

Stuart is about as affable a person as you could wish to meet, and we have skied together three or four times. Now, however, he doesn't want anything to do with me. I haven't upset him, we are on good terms—but he hates what I've got on my head. By the end of the week, so do I.\n\nThe intimidating headgear I'm wearing is the Ruroc RG2. It is, according to Ruroc, the world’s only full-face snowsports helmet—and now I can fully understand why, despite initially thinking it looked like the ideal lid to replace my aging POC. On paper, the RG2 should be a winner, despite a starting price of $379 (making it more expensive than nearly all of WIRED's picks in our ski helmet guide). Only when you wear it do the drawbacks become abundantly clear.\n\nThe RG2 is actually an ISPO Award-winning helmet. It has a built-in Twiceme NFC chip, so you can store critical medical information that can be easily accessed by first responders in emergencies. To protect your noggin, it's lined with Rheon, a breathable, energy-absorbing polymer (originally conceived from a NASA project looking at space shuttle foam replacements) that's flexible in its natural state but instantly stiffens on impact.\n\nFor even more outlay, there's an optional JBL-powered Cardo Communication System that lets you stream music, take calls, connect with a GoPro, and chat with up to 15 other equally intimidating Ruroc users on a mesh network.\n\nThe big boon of the RG2 over the original RG1, however, comes down to a simple tweak in this updated design. In the RG1, you secured the lower face plate using plastic clips that slid—usually unwillingly—into place. It worked, but any supposed cool factor for wearers was immediately ruined as others watched them attempt to wrestle those clips into place with no helpful mirrors on hand outside your average ski lift or mountain restaurant. The solution? Magnets. Ruroc finally made that call after sifting through “15 years of direct feedback.\"\n\nSloping off: The RG2's full-face setup proved to be a look not conducive to social skiing.

Putting the darn thing on was the issue. Still, this new magnetic system is definitely easier, but it's by no means foolproof, and you will still likely have to take two or three stabs at getting it locked in each time you want to add it to the helmet."

            "content": "United States and Israeli forces have launched military strikes against Iran, with President Donald Trump calling the attacks a “major combat operation” against the Iranian regime.\n\nExplosions within Iran were first recorded in the early hours of Saturday morning ET, with smoke rising above the capital city Tehran. Shortly after the first reports of the attacks emerged, both the US and Israel claimed responsibility for the strikes.\n\nIn an eight-minute video posted to Truth Social and X, Trump said the operation’s objective was to “defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement confirming the military operation and said Israel was aiming to “remove the existential threat posed” by Iran.\n\nShortly after confirming launching the attacks, the Israel Defense Forces also said it had “identified” Iranian missiles being launched towards Israel.\n\nThe US and Iran have participated in three recent rounds of mediated diplomatic negotiations billed as an effort to forge an agreement on Iran's nuclear program and avert armed conflict. Reports out of meetings in Geneva on Thursday seemed lukewarm, with negotiators sharing vaguely positive reactions with journalists and on social media. For example, Oman’s foreign minister Badr Albusaidi wrote in a post on X that there had been \"significant progress\" and that technical teams would meet for further discussion next week in Vienna.\n\nIn a follow up on Friday, he posted that he had met with US Vice President JD Vance and that he expected \"further and decisive progress in the coming days.\" He added, \"Peace is within our reach.\" However, also on Friday, US officials told embassy staff in Israel to leave the country."

            "content": "US secretary of defense Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon to designate Anthropic a “supply-chain risk” on Friday, sending shock waves through Silicon Valley and leaving many companies scrambling to understand whether they can keep using one of the industry’s most popular AI models.\n\n“Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic,” Hegseth wrote in a social media post.\n\nThe designation comes after weeks of tense negotiations between the Pentagon and Anthropic over how the US military could use the startup’s AI models. In a blog post this week, Anthropic argued its contracts with the Pentagon should not allow for its technology to be used for mass domestic surveillance of Americans or fully autonomous weapons. The Pentagon asked that Anthropic agree to let the US military apply its AI to “all lawful uses” with no specific exceptions.\n\nA supply-chain-risk designation allows the Pentagon to restrict or exclude certain vendors from defense contracts if they’re deemed to pose security vulnerabilities, such as risks related to foreign ownership, control, or influence. It is intended to protect sensitive military systems and data from potential compromise.\n\nAnthropic responded in another blog post on Friday evening, saying it would “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court,” and that such a designation would “set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government.”\n\nAnthropic added that it hadn’t received any direct communication from the Department of Defense or the White House regarding negotiations over the use of its AI models."

            "content": "Other Wireless Chargers We Tested\n\nThere are a lot of wireless chargers. Here are a few more we like, but for one reason or another don't warrant a place above.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nKrafted Couch Wireless Charger for $52: I thought this wireless charger that’s designed to be draped over the arm of your couch was a great idea when I saw it, but the ridges failed to keep it in place on my velvety couch, so it kept slipping down the side. The silicone finish with the Krafted logo is also a bit ugly. It's just a silicone mat with a magnetic charger inside, though there is a fairly generous 6.6-foot (2-meter) cable, and it is Qi2 rated. If you’re always rooting around for a charger and one of the colors blends well with your furniture, it might be a good solution for you.\n\nEinova Eggtronic Charging Stone for $70: Made with 100 percent solid marble or stone—you can choose from a variety. Every single pick in this guide looks very much like a wireless charger, but I've had visiting friends ask if this one is a drink coaster. (I'm still figuring out whether that's a good or bad thing.) It has zero LEDs, perfect for bedrooms; just try to hide the cable to truly make it blend into your home. We recommend putting a case on your phone when using it with this charger, as there's a risk of scuffing up the back with these harder surfaces.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nBaseus Nomos 5-in-1 Charging Station for $100: If you liked the PicoGo W2 above but need more gadget-charging power, this 5-in-1 could be worth a look. It also has a tilting pad and retractable USB-C cable, but adds two more USB-C ports and one USB-A, along with a stats-filled display. It’s perfect for your desktop. I also tried and quite liked the Baseus Nomos 8-in-1 Magnetic Charging Station ($70), which combines a similar folding Qi2 pad with three US AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one USB-A.\n\nRapport London Formula Wireless Charging Tray for $475: Yes, this is an obscene price for a Qi wireless charger. You can probably make a version for a fraction of the cost. But Rapport's build quality is quite nice, with a lacquered grey box and a soft-touch fabric to keep your watches and phone scratch-free. It reliably recharged several Android phones without making them too warm, all while offering storage for a few watches. It's attractive, but you have to have cash to burn at this price.\n\niOttie iOS Wireless Duo for $50: This dual-charging system looks pretty—I like the fabric-wrapped stand—and you can charge another device on the rubberized charging pad next to it. The stand can be used in portrait or landscape, though in the latter orientation it'll block the pad. I use the pad to top up my wireless earbuds, but I wouldn't use this iOttie on a nightstand, because the LED on the front can be glaring. A cable and adapter are included, which makes it a good value. It can charge Pixel phones at up to 15 watts, iPhones at 7.5 watts, and other Android phones at 10 watts.\n\nJourney Alti Play Performance Desk Mat for $120: This is a desk mat that doubles as a wireless charging pad. On the left side is a plasticky rectangle with a Qi2 magnetic puck for your smartphone. Above it is a little area to charge wireless earbuds (5 watts). Naturally, there's RGB all over, and there are two buttons you can press to cycle through patterns and colors. It's a smart-looking system, though the quality of the actual mat leaves a bit to be desired. I didn't have issues gliding my mouse on it, and it stays put thanks to the rubber underside, but I just didn't like the look and feel of the Lycra surface. Journey has some other versions of this mat that use different materials, so take a look if you like the overall aesthetic.\n\nCourant Catch:2 Essentials for $75: Wireless chargers should look nice. You shouldn't settle for anything less! This Courant dual charger oozes luxury with its Belgian linen-wrapped surface (especially in the camel color). I've used it by my front door to recharge my partner's and my wireless earbuds for two years. The rubber feet prevent it from shifting around, but even if there are five coils in this pad, you should try to be precise when you put your device down to charge and make sure the LED lights up to double-check. It comes with a color-matching USB-C cable.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nZens Liberty Wireless Charger for $150: I tested the Glass Edition of this wireless charging pad, and it looks stunning with the 16 overlapping copper coils on display (the standard version has a woolen fabric top). It can charge two devices simultaneously at up to 15 watts apiece, and there’s an optional Apple Watch add-on ($19). As stylish as it is, the price is too high. Because you can see the coils, placement is never an issue, but it’s a bulky charger; the fan is audible at times, and while I had no problem charging my iPhone or AirPods, my Pixel 6 Pro got very warm on this pad.\n\nXiaomi Mi 80-W Wireless Charging Stand for $50: By far the fastest wireless charger we have tested, this stand is only worth considering for Xiaomi phones (it seems to charge most other phones at 10 watts or below). I tested with the Xiaomi 13 Ultra, which tops out at 50 watts (some Xiaomi models can go higher). The unusual sail shape combines a white triangular section with a clear acrylic base that has a subtle groove to hold your phone in place and a gap underneath for the exhaust grill from the noisy fan. The USB-C port and LED indicator are on the back.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

            "content": "The snow is melting, the days are getting longer, and I can almost smell the springtime ahead. Soon, we'll be cruising around town on ebikes and electric scooters instead of burning fossil fuels. For now, the weather hasn't quite caught up, which is great for markdowns. Many of the best electric scooters are still seeing significant discounts. If you've been thinking about buying one, now's the best time: prices are low, and sunny commuting days are just ahead.\n\nGear editor Julian Chokkattu has spent five years testing more than 45 electric scooters. These are his top picks that are also on sale right now.\n\nApollo Go for $849 ($450 Off)\n\nThis is Gear editor Julian Chokkattu's favorite scooter. The riding experience is powerful and smooth, thanks to its dual 350-watt motors and solid front and rear suspensions. The speed maxes out at 28 miles per hour (mph), which doesn't make it the fastest scooter on the market, but it has a good range. (Chokkattu is a very tall man and was able to travel 15 miles on a single charge at 15 mph.) Other Apollo features he appreciates: turn signals, a dot display, a bell, along with a headlight and an LED strip for extra visibility.\n\nApollo Phantom 2.0 for $2099 ($900 Off)\n\nThe Apollo Phantom 2.0 maxes out at 44 mph, with plenty of power from its dual 1,750-watt motors. It's a gorgeous scooter, designed with 11-inch self-healing tubeless tires and a dual-spring suspension system for a smooth riding experience. But with great power comes great weight. At 102 pounds, the Phantom 2.0 is the heaviest electric scooter Chokkattu has tested, so I would only recommend this purchase if you don't live in a walkup and/or have a garage.\n\nMore Discounted Electric Scooters"

            "content": "US President Donald Trump announced Friday that he was instructing every federal agency to “immediately cease” use of Anthropic’s AI tools. The move comes after Anthropic and top officials clashed for weeks over military applications of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump said that there would be a “six month phase out period” for agencies using Anthropic, which could allow time for further negotiations between the government and the AI startup.\n\nThe Pentagon and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nShortly after the President’s announcement, defense secretary Pete Hegseth said that Anthropic would also be designated a “supply chain risk,” a move normally reserved for foreign businesses considered a danger to American national security. The designation will bar the US military and its contractors and suppliers from working with the AI company.\n\nHegseth also lashed out at Anthropic and its CEO, Dario Amodei, over the company's refusal to agree to its demands. “Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of ‘effective altruism,' they have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission—a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives,” Hegseth wrote on X.\n\nThe Department of Defense has sought to change the terms of a deal struck with Anthropic and other companies last July to eliminate restrictions on how AI can be deployed and instead permit “all lawful use” of the technology. Anthropic objected to the change, claiming that it could allow AI to be used to fully control lethal autonomous weapons or to conduct mass surveillance on US citizens."

            "content": "Looking for an upgraded Roku that's a great match for your new 4K TV? Right now, both Amazon and Best Buy have the 2024 Roku Ultra discounted to $80, a $20 break from the usual price. It sports dual-band Wi-Fi and Ethernet for a more consistent connection, support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and the remote has a headphone port.\n\nWhile there are a ton of great Roku streaming devices to choose from, the Ultra stands out for a few reasons. Streaming in 4K requires a huge amount of bandwidth, and some wireless networks just aren't up to the task, particularly if your TV isn't near your router. A true dual-band Wi-Fi setup in the Roku Ultra helps ensure a stutter-free experience on all of your favorite streaming services. If you really hate buffering and dropped connections, there's an Ethernet port around back for a wired hookup, something most other streaming devices can't claim.\n\nAnother nice upgrade you get with your Roku Ultra kit is the remote, which includes a built-in 3.5-mm headphone jack. That's perfect if you like to sneak in a few episodes of your favorite show after everyone's gone to bed, or want to catch a movie without waking a sleeping baby. The Roku Ultra even includes a pair of earbuds you can use right out of the box, which are surprisingly good for what they are, and they include extra ear tips for getting the fit right.\n\nLike some of the other premium Roku streaming devices, the hands-free voice controls make it super easy to find what you're looking for. Rather than dig through all of your apps and services looking for a movie, you can just say the title into the remote and let Roku go and find it for you.\n\nIf you're ready to take your 4K streaming to the next level, both Best Buy and Amazon have the Roku Ultra marked down to $80. We also have a great guide that breaks down the differences between all of the available Roku streamers, and a roundup of our favorite media streamers, in case you're wondering what the Roku alternatives look like."

            "content": "A few months ago, a family came into Pasadena Cyclery in Pasadena, California, for a repair on what they thought was their teenager’s ebike. “I can’t fix that here,’ Daniel Purnell, a store manager and technician, remembers telling them. “That’s a motorcycle.” The mother got upset. She didn’t realize that what she thought was an ebike could go much faster, perhaps up to 55 miles per hour.\n\n“There’s definitely an education problem,” Purnell says. In California, bike advocates are pushing a new bill designed to clear up that confusion around what counts as an electric bicycle—and what doesn’t.\n\nIt’s a tricky balance. On one hand, backers want to allow riders access to new, faster, and more affordable non-car transportation options, ones that don’t require licenses and are emission-free. On the other hand, people, and especially kids, seem to be getting hurt. Ebike-related injuries jumped more than 1,020 percent nationwide between 2020 and 2024, according to hospital data, though it’s not clear if the stats-keepers can routinely distinguish between ebikes and their faster, “e-moto” cousins. (Moped and powered-assisted cycle injuries jumped 67 percent in that same period.)\n\n“We’re overdue to have better ebike regulation,” says California state senator Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat who sponsored the bill and represents parts of North County in San Diego. “This has been an ongoing and growing issue for years.”\n\nSenate Bill 1167 would make it illegal for retailers to label higher-powered, electric-powered vehicles as ebikes. It would clarify that ebikes have fully operative pedals and electric motors that don’t exceed 750 watts, enough to hit top speeds between 20 and 28 mph.\n\n“We’re not against these devices,” says Kendra Ramsey, the executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition, which represents riders and is promoting the legislation. “People think they’re ebikes and they're not really ebikes.”\n\nBill backers say they hope the fix, if it passes, makes a difference, especially for teenagers, who love the freedom that electric motors give them but can get into trouble if something goes wrong at higher speeds. Kids 17 and younger accounted for 20 percent of US ebike injuries from 2020 to 2024, about in line with the share of the total population. But headlines—and the laws that follow them—have focused on teen injuries and even deaths.\n\nThere are no national laws governing ebike riding. But bike backers spent years moving between states to pass laws that put ebikes into three classes: Class 1, which have pedal-assist that only works when they’re actually pedaled, and goes up to 20 mph; Class 2, which have throttles that work without pedaling but still only reach 20 mph; and Class 3, which use pedal-assist to move up to 28 mph. Plenty of states and cities restrict the most powerful Class 3 bikes to people older than 16. (In a complicated twist, some ebikes have different “modes,” allowing riders to toggle between Class 2 and Class 3.)\n\nLast year, researchers visited 19 San Francisco Bay Area middle and high schools and found that 88 percent of the electric two-wheeled devices parked there were so high-powered and high-speed that they didn’t comply with the three-class system at all.\n\nEbikes have clearly struck a chord with state policymakers: at least 10 bills introduced this year deal with ebikes, according to Ramsey.\n\nSome bike advocates believe injuries have less to do with ebikes than “e-motos,” a category that’s less likely to appear in retail stores or the sort of social media ads attracting teens to the tech. These have more powerful motors and can travel in excess of 30 mph. Vehicles, like the Surron Ultra Bee, which can hit top speeds of 55 mph, or Tuttio ICT, which can hit 50, are often marketed by retailers as \"electric bikes.” Because so many sales happen online, it can be hard for people, and especially parents, to know what they’re getting into."

            "content": "Every year, the moment we witness the very earliest signs of spring, CNET takes its cue to decamp to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress.\n\nThis is the world's most important mobile show, and one of the most exciting events in the tech calendar. This year, we're sending a bigger team to bring you all the news from the show as it happens.\n\nIt's set to be a bonanza of new phones and wearables, with the odd robot thrown in for good measure. Sure, some of the fun tech we see at MWC never makes it out into the wider world, but we've also seen some of our most beloved tech debut at the show over the years -- so expect a little of both.\n\nBig themes are set to include AI and 6G, and with keynotes from SpaceX and Qualcomm, we'll no doubt get a solid glimpse of the future of mobile. With Gemini in everything and satellite dominance on the horizon, it's an exciting time for the industry.\n\nHere's more of what we expect to see.\n\nWhat are the key dates for MWC?\n\nMWC 2026 is set to run from March 2 to 5, although we'll be in town a couple of days beforehand to report on some of the big launch events scheduled for this weekend. Don't miss Xiaomi's launch event on Feb. 28 and Honor's event on March 1.\n\nHow to watch along\n\nNo matter how far away you live from Spain, there's no need to feel like you're missing out. The best place for all the latest MWC news is on our CNET live blog.\n\nWe've been attending this show for decades (this is MWC's 20th year in Barcelona, by the way), and we have a team of experienced reporters and reviewers on the ground.\n\nWe'll show you everything we deem interesting and important, and we're not just admiring new products from afar. We're touching, tinkering with and trying not to drop them, so be sure to follow us across Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, X and YouTube, too.\n\nWhat phones to expect at MWC 2026\n\nFor the past few years, Chinese phone-makers have dominated MWC, and 2026 looks to be no different.\n\nThe first big phone launch event is scheduled for 6 a.m. PT Saturday, Feb. 28, when we expect Xiaomi to unveil its latest camera-focused flagship. We loved the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and the 14 Ultra before it, so we're excited to see what the company has in store for us. A teaser image hints at its partnership with premium camera brand Leica and promises a \"new wave of imagery.\"\n\nThe Honor Magic V6 will be available in red. Honor\n\nNext up, we have Honor on Sunday, March 1, when the company has said it will unveil its Magic V6 phone, alongside the MagicPad 4 and MagicBook Pro 14. Perhaps more exciting still, Honor has said it will give us a first glimpse of a working version of its Robot Phone, and will also unveil a humanoid robot at its event.\n\nFor other phone-makers, MWC is likely to serve as more of a victory lap for its existing devices -- particularly Samsung, which held its own event in San Francisco this week to unveil the flagship S26 series. Motorola will be in town, likely showing off its Razr, which just like the Samsung Galaxy TriFold, has yet to be seen much in Europe.\n\nOn the whole, MWC 2026 is likely to be a big show for foldable phones, which, according to Ben Wood, CMO and chief analyst at CCS Insight, \"is now becoming quite a mature category.\"\n\nAnother major trend in the phone space is likely to be a focus on batteries, particularly silicon carbon-based tech, Wood said in an MWC preview session. \"We're expecting to see phones with some of the biggest batteries we've seen for a long time, [with] fast charging -- perhaps 300-watt charging -- being introduced,\" he added.\n\nWhat other tech to expect at MWC 2026\n\nAfter the early flops that were the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1, we're seeing more companies moving to jump on the wearable AI bandwagon. We expect to see a number of devices and demos pop up at MWC -- perhaps trying to beat OpenAI and Jony Ive to the punch.\n\nThis will include AI- and AR-based glasses, said CCS Insight analyst Ben Hatton during the firm's briefing session. \"We are expecting to see a huge number of glasses on show this year, not just from Meta, but also from the smaller players, [like] TCL and Oppo, looking to take a slice of the pie,\" he said.\n\nOne of the key challenges for these companies will be differentiation, Hatton said. \"Ultimately, there's still a long way to go before these become generally mass market products,\" he added, pointing out that at this stage, compelling use cases are still a bit thin on the ground.\n\nIt's been two years since Samsung launched the Galaxy Ring at MWC, and smart rings have been fairly thin on the ground ever since -- although Oura CEO Tom Hale is slated to speak at the show. We're not necessarily expecting to see any new rings this year, but there's always an outside chance.\n\nMuch more likely to show up are a slew of new laptops and tablets. They rarely get top billing at MWC, but we'll keep an eye out for the most exciting launches. There's also likely to be some intriguing concepts on show from the likes of Lenovo and Samsung Display, which is responsible for the tech behind the new Galaxy S26 Ultra's scene-stealing Privacy Display.\n\nThe big themes: AI, 6G and beyond\n\nNo surprises here that AI will, of course, be a major theme at MWC. For the past few years, Google has dominated the AI conversation at the event by showcasing Gemini's capabilities and its widespread integration. Will this year be any different? Probably not, but that doesn't mean the AI conversation has stalled.\n\nWe expect to see more sophisticated AI agents that are more deeply integrated into wearables, offering live translation, more actionable health insights and more personalized experiences. Some of the biggest players in the AI game will be present, including Nvidia and Qualcomm, on the hardware side. They'll likely have saved some juicy announcements for the show and, hopefully, have some exciting demos we can try out.\n\nWind the clock back a decade, and everyone was talking about 5G and what a dramatic difference it was going to make to our lives. Now that 5G is old news, we're looking forward to 6G. Most discussions about 6G so far have focused on its impact on the industry, but that doesn't mean there's nothing to be excited about.\n\nAt the Web Summit in November, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told me that 6G will make our phones faster than ever and connect us to an \"always-sensing network.\" This could include wearables, smart devices, cars and even robots. No doubt, Amon will expound on this subject further during his MWC keynote, which is all about 6G and AI.\n\nAnother theme likely to be prevalent at the show is the role of satellites in enhancing network connectivity. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell will be on stage to talk about Starlink, and all the world's biggest carriers will have their own booths where they'll show us what they're doing to tap into the latest network technologies."

            "content": "Sick of your smart ring's battery not holding up? Ultrahuman's new $479 Ring Pro smart ring, unveiled on Friday, offers up to 15 days of battery life on a single charge. The Ring Pro joins the company's $349 Ring Air, which boosts health tracking, thanks to longer battery life, increased data storage, improved speed and accuracy and a new heart-rate sensing architecture. The ring works in conjunction with the latest Pro charging case.\n\nUltrahuman also launched its Jade AI, which can act as an agent based on analysis of current and historical health data. Jade can synthesize data from across the company's products and is compatible with its Rings.\n\n\"With industry-leading hardware paired with Jade biointelligence AI, users can now take real-time actionable interventions towards their health than ever before,\" said Mohit Kumar, CEO of Ultrahuman.\n\nNo US sales\n\nThat hardware isn't available in the US, though, thanks to the ongoing ban on Ultrahuman's Rings sales here, stemming from a patent dispute with its competitor, Oura Ring. It's available for preorder now everywhere else and is slated to ship in March. Jade's available globally.\n\nUltrahuman says the Ring Pro boosts battery life to about 15 days in Chill mode -- up to 12 days in Turbo -- compared to a maximum of six days for the Air. The Pro charger's battery stores enough for another 45 days, which you top off with Qi-compatible wireless charging. In addition, the case incorporates locator technology via the app and a speaker, as well as usability features such as haptic notifications and a power LED.\n\nThe ring can also retain up to 250 days of data versus less than a week for the cheaper model. Ultrahuman redesigned the heart-rate sensor for better signal quality. An upgraded processor improves the accuracy of the local machine learning and overall speed.\n\nIt's offered in gold, silver, black and titanium finishes, with available sizes ranging from 5 to 14.\n\nJade's Deep Research Mode is the cross-ecosystem analysis feature, which aggregates data from Ring and Blood Vision and the company's subscription services, Home and M1 CGM, to provide historical trends, offer current recommendations and flag potential issues, as well as trigger activities such as A-fib detection. Ultrahuman plans to expand its capabilities to include health-adjacent activities, such as ordering food.\n\nSome new apps are also available for the company's PowerPlug add-on platform, including capabilities such as tracking GLP-1 effects, snoring and respiratory analysis and migraine management tools."
