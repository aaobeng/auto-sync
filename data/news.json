I had a good talent and good people around me, which gave me the right mentality to train.”\n\nHaaland raced to 100 Premier League goals by scoring at Fulham in December – and reached the landmark in 13 fewer games than previous record holder Alan Shearer.\n\nHe told former City midfielder Owen Hargreaves on TNT Sports: “It’s a proud thing to be top of the list. 100 goals in the Prem is not an easy thing. iI’s special to do it in as short a period of this.”\n\nGuardiola gave his squad three days off for the second week in a row after a hectic run of fixtures since the November international break. .\n\nAnd his top scorer is relishing what lies ahead, saying: “I’m feeling good and ready for what’s next.\n\n\n\n“You dream of good things but I’d never have dreamed of this – playing for City, winning trophies, being in title races.”"

            "content": "SENNE LAMMENS admits he was warned about joining Manchester United before September’s surprise move.\n\nLammens has taken to one of the most pressurised positions in football like a duck to water.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited signed the 23-year-old in an £18.1million move from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day in the summer.\n\nAnd he admits he was told about the perils of taking the gloves at Old Trafford before putting pen to paper.\n\nHe said: “They warned me a little bit before. They warned me that Manchester United is a different animal, especially social media wise.\n\n“They warned me that it is one of the biggest clubs, if not the biggest club.”\n\n\n\nLammens was such an unknown quantity he had not been capped by Belgium. Antwerp was United’s feeder club for a 15-year period without Sir Alex Ferguson signing any of their players.\n\nDuring his bow against Sunderland in October, Lammens was treated to a chorus of, “Are you Schmeichel in disguise?” by the Stretford End for catching a cross.\n\nLammens’ predecessor, Andre Onana, came a cropper from a corner on his last appearance in the humiliating Carabao Cup loss at Grimsby Town.\n\nAltay Bayindir, who started in United’s first six Premier League games this season, dropped a clanger from a corner in the opening defeat to Arsenal.\n\n\n\nOnana is on loan in Turkey and Bayindir is set for a return to his homeland.\n\nSUN VEGAS WELCOME OFFER: GET £50 BONUS WHEN YOU JOIN\n\nLammens is already a firm fan favourite due to his down-to-earth nature and no-frills goalkeeping style.\n\nLammens explains. “I take pride in being all round, not really having any flaws. But also not really forcing errors or not really trying to chase the game.\n\n\n\n“I spoke a lot about it with (third-choice goalkeeper) Tom Heaton as well, who’s helping me in my time here.\n\n“He’s talking about goalkeeping like not really giving things away and keeping your team in the game and sometimes it’s not giving the games away.\n\n“Because you don’t always have the biggest things to do or the biggest work to do, but it’s also like staying focused and not giving anything to the opponent, not easy things at least.\n\n“I take pride in that as well and I think that’s also a big thing to be a good goalkeeper.\n\n“And if you want to have a long career – especially in these kinds of clubs – they have to count on you and you have to be dependable.”\n\n\n\nUnited sources say Lammens has “hit it off” with Heaton while the goalkeeping contingent at the club believe he has the potential to be a top-level keeper for a long time.\n\nAfter his appearance at Partington Central Academy to visit local schoolchildren for World Book Day on Wednesday, Lammens returned to United’s Carrington training complex to do additional recovery work.\n\nOur interview finished at 4.20pm and Lammens was still at United’s training base at 6pm.\n\nUnited moved for Lammens having also considered Aston Villa No1 Emiliano Martinez.\n\nMartinez, 33, is ten years Lammens’ senior and a World Cup winner but he has committed more errors that have led to a goal in the Premier League than any other goalie this season. Lammens is yet to make one.\n\n\n\nUnited goalkeeping scout Tony Coton, who was briefly on the club’s playing staff in 1996 and then Ferguson’s goalkeeping coach for eight years, pushed for Lammens.\n\nLammens stresses: “I had a good relationship with him from the beginning and especially my agent was always on a good relationship with him.\n\n“So he was always honest with me and always open. And everything he said has come true. So he also has to be given his credits as well.\n\n“I think he was just a big, big, big influence and like a big helping point in the conversations with United when the deal wasn’t done yet.\n\n\n\n“He gave me a lot of confidence that that was the right step to do for me.”\n\nLammens puts his normalness down to the upbringing from his family. He laughs at the mention of him and his girlfriend getting papped outside The Ivy in Manchester earlier this month.\n\n“That was one of the more special moments,” he chuckles. “I mean, special, in kind of like, couldn’t believe it, really.\n\n“Like, it’s not always the best feeling to get. I mean, they weren’t too bad.\n\n“But especially for my girlfriend as well, which was the first time where there were paparazzi and stuff.\n\n\n\n“Looking back, it was quite funny. But yeah, at the moment at the time itself, it was pretty, pretty special and a strange feeling, yeah.”\n\nLammens may have to remain understudy to Belgium No1 Thibaut Courtois for a while longer.\n\n\n\nThe Real Madrid keeper is only 33 and Lammens celebrated his 12th birthday during Courtois’ first appearance at a World Cup in 2014.\n\nBut it is another 21st century goalkeeping great who was Lammens’ boyhood idol.\n\nHe revealed: “My biggest idol as a goalkeeper was probably (Manuel) Neuer.\n\n“I take pride in being an all-round goalkeeper and I think that’s also why I was such a big fan of his.\n\n“Because he didn’t really have a weak point or something that was clearly not the best thing in his game. So that’s something I probably take from him.\n\n\n\n“I’m also Belgian, so Thibaut Courtois was always a big thing when I was growing up as well. And I think his qualities and saving the ball is just world-class.\n\n“So I try to learn something from everyone because everyone has his own strong points, but I would say probably Neuer in his all-round game.”\n\nMichael Carrick is a similarly grounded personality to Lammens. The United No1 appreciates how the new head coach has related to the players during his unbeaten first six weeks in charge.\n\n“It’s been really good,” Lammens enthuses. “I think the general feeling in the dressing room has been really, really good.\n\n\n\n“Especially the first four games, winning those four and the first two against City and Arsenal was a big step and a big momentum booster.\n\n“This last game was really important to get that momentum back because we had two weeks where we didn’t have a game.\n\n“And especially after West Ham, where we didn’t have our best game or best result. It’s been really, really good.\n\n“He’s been helping us out really well. Making it as easy as he can for us from his experiences in the past, helping us with that as well.\n\n\n\n“So you can see the way he talks about stuff that he has also experienced all the things we’ve been going through.\n\n“I can’t praise him enough.”\n\nSenne Lammens spoke at Partington Central Academy ahead of World Book Day next week.\n\nLammens enthusiastically took part in indoor sports games with the children as part of the Manchester United Foundation’s children’s book appeal throughout March, which encourages fans to donate new and pre-loved books to children in need.\n\nLammens, a keen reader, is currently leafing through Tiger Woods’ book but his favourite is The Alchemist.\n\n\n\n“When I have a really good book or when I have a book I’m interested in, I read quite a lot,” Lammens said.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“Reading about other athletes, for example, about mentality.\n\n“And there are lots of good books about dealing with adversity, dealing with stress or stuff like that, which can also help you in this kind of industry and work.”"

It is the Premier League.\n\n“It’s also physicality and a bit of war in the [18-yard box]. It’s also one of my strengths, so sometimes I like the challenge as well.\n\n“Of course it can’t get too much sometimes but everyone has to deal with it. It’s not that only one team does it or it’s just everyone in general.\n\n“And, as a goalkeeper, you have to get used to that and train on it as well and then get better at it.\n\n“I think I’ve been doing a good job at it so I’ll continue to do that. It’s always been a bit of my strength, always.\n\n\n\n“Even in Belgium – which is less physical but the principles are all the same. The technique is the same.\n\n“Now it’s a little bit more bodies in front of you, but my team-mates help me out as well with blocking the guys away from me.\n\n“You have to be kind of big and not easy to be pushed around, so I think that’s also important.\n\n\n\n“I’ve always been a little bit bigger, a bit more, weight-wise. So I think it’s also a positive thing for me the way the Premier League is.\n\n“So I think also that’s why Manchester United also were interested in me because they knew how it was going to be.”\n\nSenne Lammens spoke at Partington Central Academy ahead of World Book Day next week.\n\nLammens enthusiastically took part in indoor sports games with the children as part of the Manchester United Foundation’s children’s book appeal throughout March, which encourages fans to donate new and pre-loved books to children in need.\n\nLammens, a keen reader, is currently leafing through Tiger Woods’ book but his favourite is The Alchemist.\n\n\n\n“When I have a really good book or when I have a book I’m interested in, I read quite a lot,” Lammens said.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“Reading about other athletes, for example, about mentality.\n\n“And there are lots of good books about dealing with adversity, dealing with stress or stuff like that, which can also help you in this kind of industry and work.”"

I told him [Vinicius Jr] exactly that. I told him, ‘when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back’.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person [Eusebio] in the history of this club was black. This club, the last thing that it is, is racist. If in his mind there was something in relation to that, this in Benfica.”\n\nThe Portuguese coach is one of the most successful managers in the game after winning two Champions League titles and league titles in England, Spain and Italy."

That is the warning from Professional Footballers’ Association chief executive Maheta Molango, who fears the biggest stars are being put at risk because they are playing too many games.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nChelsea star Palmer has struggled for form and suffered injuries this season which has restricted him to playing just 19 games out of a possible 42. Palmer played a full season in 2023-24, then went to the Euros in 2024 and did not get a proper break last summer as he played for Chelsea in the Club World Cup.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat has left Palmer in serious danger of missing this summer’s World Cup with England because he has not made Thomas Tuchel’s squad since last June. Molango revealed he has paid a visit to Chelsea’s training ground earlier this season and he fears it is going to get even worse for more players, claiming that football has reached saturation point.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTalking at the FT Live event, Molango said: “For us the concern is, of course, player welfare because for me when I look at someone like Cole Palmer.

Fernandes, 31, has been spearheading the Reds' push towards the top four since Michael Carrick took charge as interim manager.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHis displays have indicated United supporters should be thankful he didn't relocate to Saudi Arabia, as the midfielder acknowledged he came close to doing. His future remains unclear, having entered the final 18 months of his deal at Old Trafford.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite registering 104 goals and 99 assists across 316 appearances for United, Fernandes has frequently been a focal point for criticism. Martinez, who will oversee the former Sporting midfielder at this summer's World Cup, considers much of the criticism directed at him unjustified.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking on The Overlap, Martinez said: \"I think he's very unfairly assessed. I think if we are all very objective, to be the captain of Manchester United in the last three or four years, I bet it's been incredibly tough at every level.\n\n\"What I appreciate from him is that he never hides.

Kogan, making his first public appearance at the FT Live event, said: “Alongside the success story of English football, the current system bakes in risk.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Multiple clubs throughout the pyramid have told us they would not be able to survive a month if their owners pulled funding for one month. Players' wages have been rocketing across the whole of the pyramid. We cannot continue to finance this arms race.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“And relegation for many is a near-death sentence. Clubs facing relegation could see their revenues cut by up to 80 per cent if they fail to bounce back quickly.\n\n“The whole pyramid is facing a series of cliff edges that people talk about, but they have not been addressed. Despite all the money coming in for media rights deals and all the other forms of income that are now coming in, increasingly not for media rights deals, you've still got a pyramid that is riven with debt and riven with risk.”\n\nArsenal told team that can stop them winning the Champions League ahead of last 16 draw READ MORE :\n\nJohn Terry's manager stance backed up after making Chelsea frustration public READ MORE :\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

Kogan added: “If you want an example of why we exist, well, it's only got to look at the situation in the last 24 hours at Sheffield Wednesday.

A deal done in 2019, which is the last time a deal was done, that simply relies rolling over year by year to no one's satisfaction, is not sensible practice and it will lead to unsustainable levels of pressure within the system.\n\n“It's to everyone's benefit for football to try and reach this understanding. My message is that the pyramid needs to survive as it exists today. And to do that, English football must come together and end this uncertainty. And it needs to do it now.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“But if the leagues can't find a new deal, those powers will be enacted. And we will be looking at things such as the current mechanism for parachute payments, the cliff edges and the other features of the existing deal. Clearly this has been an ongoing issue between the Premier League and the EFL for the last few years.\n\n“Parachute payments are not an unknown topic, and the level of fiscal imbalance that they may or may not create is an issue that clearly we're going to have to address.”\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The Slovenian shifted through the gears to record a top speed of 35.3 km/h - though his time doesn't even feature amongst the top five quickest Premier League players this season.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSesko was trailing Toffees centre-half James Tarkowski as Matheus Cunha carved out space to deliver the ball wide towards Bryan Mbeumo. But the striker's eye-catching surge of pace created a one-on-one opportunity with Jordan Pickford as he collected the pass from Mbeumo before finishing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOpta recorded Sesko's top speed as being faster than his previous quickest time: a dash in the Boxing Day victory over Newcastle United. Nevertheless, whilst the 22-year-old's lightning-quick impression appeared effortless against the Blues, the time registered isn't even United's quickest this campaign.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

That remains the fastest a United player has travelled this season.\n\nSesko does occupy second and third position in the rankings, though, for his displays against Everton and Newcastle.

This came in January 2024.\n\nThis season, however, has seen Wolves' Jackson Tchatchoua take the top two spots, according to the Premier League's official website.\n\nHere, Mirror Football takes a look at United's top five fastest players so far this season and the five clocking the most rapid time across the Premier League this season as it stands.

But despite his newfound status as a nailed-on starter, his long-term future at Old Trafford remains uncertain.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMainoo, 20, rejected a contract offer from United around this time last year, with Ruben Amorim having then recently been appointed. As Amorim's tumultuous spell in charge continued, the midfielder fell increasingly out of favour.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUntil Amorim was sacked by the Red Devils in January, Mainoo hadn't made a single start in the Premier League this season. The United academy graduate was heavily linked with a departure in the winter transfer window, and Italian giants Napoli were known admirers after failing to land Mainoo in the summer.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAfter Carrick was named interim manager, Mainoo was immediately reinstated and has started all six games under his new boss. But this summer, when he could be playing for England at the World Cup, he'll have entered the final 12 months of his current deal - and talks over a renewal are yet to be reopened.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nMan Utd star Senne Lammens reveals secret to success under Michael Carrick READ MORE :\n\nMan Utd and Premier League clubs sent warning by UEFA after financial results revealed READ MORE :\n\nThat's according to the Sun, who add that Mainoo remains keen to stay at Old Trafford. United intend to renew his contract but they haven't formally engaged with his representatives since talks broke down last year.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCrucially, the Red Devils have the option to extend Mainoo's deal by an extra year until 2028. However, the 10-time England international is hoping to earn a new contract which would represent a significant improvement of his relatively modest £25,000-a-week wages.\n\nAs we approach the summer, United won't want to clubs sniffing around Mainoo and turning his head. Chelsea and Bayern Munich have previously been linked with the 20-year-old, who signed professional terms with United in 2023.\n\nThe Red Devils are already set to be one midfielder down when the summer transfer window opens, as Casemiro has confirmed that he'll be leaving upon the expiry of his contract in June. And if Carrick gets the job permanently, there's no doubt that he'll want Mainoo in his squad.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBACK THE MIRROR! Ensure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search\n\nView 2 Images Kobbie Mainoo has been targeted by multiple clubs (Image: Nigel French/Sportsphoto/Allstar via Getty Images)\n\n\"I've known Kobbie a long time,\" Carrick told BBC Sport ahead of Monday's 1-0 win away to Everton. \"I started working with him when I think he was 13 or 14, when I was starting to do my coaching badges - a good few years ago.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Just little bits he told. And then, obviously, when I was here the first time, he was in and around a little bit. So, I think knowing him and having experience with him and seeing him perform at such a level on such big occasions...\n\n\"I said earlier about coaches being able to cope with being here and at the level to deal with it. What Kobbie's done at such a young age is quite incredible really.\"\n\nMainoo will be hoping to further his case for a new deal when United host Crystal Palace on Sunday. The Red Devils are looking to make it seven games unbeaten since Carrick's appointment.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Without him, they would be sixth and four points off Liverpool.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Signed for £72m as a promising striker filled with potential just two years earlier, he was pushed out of Old Trafford to make way for Sesko over the summer.\n\nImage: Sesko celebrates his winner in the 1-0 win at Everton\n\nSesko is beginning to show signs he can bear the burden of being United's No. 9 - but three of his five goals have come as a substitute and the other two against promoted-side Burnley, currently second from bottom.\n\nHow Sesko copes when he is the regular starter will be the true test of the 22-year-old.\n\n\"It's a lot of pressure,\" Neville said. \"The biggest pressure in English football, that's a Manchester United goalkeeper, but not far behind would be a striker who comes for big money to United.\n\n\"When you come in as a striker with a big price tag, you've got to deliver and he's starting to deliver.\n\n\"There is a danger that maybe that he's sort of getting that super-sub title, but I don't think he's that type. He's a starting player. He has been a super sub in the last few games because he's needed to be.\n\n\"I don't think he's ever going to be the perfect striker, like I said about Gyokeres. But if he can be a handful, contribute with goals, hold things up, link play, that'll be enough. You don't have to be always perfect and [his winner at Everton], it's a big moment for him.\n\n\"If he can get another four or five and finish this season in double figures, in his first season with the struggle that the team were having at the beginning, I think that would be deemed to be a good season.\"\n\nManchester United\n\nCrystal Palace Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\nSesko faced questions about how he copes with the scrutiny of being United's goalscorer after his winner at Everton as the conversation soon turned to whether he would start at Palace.\n\n\"The pressure is something that, if I want to be a good player, it's something that I have to have,\" Sesko said.\n\n\"It's something that has (to be there) if you want to play at the highest level and it's about accepting it and not really caring about it.\"\n\nSesko has made a strong case to be in from the start against Palace. It is now up to Carrick to decide whether now is the right time to open the door for the young striker.\n\nWatch Man Utd vs Crystal Palace on Sunday, live on Sky Sports, kick-off 2pm"

            "content": "Welcome to The Radar, a Sky Sports column in which Nick Wright uses a blend of data and opinion to shed light on need-to-know stories from up and down the Premier League. This week:\n\n9️⃣ Joao Pedro excelling as Chelsea's striker\n\n🧱 Maguire crucial for Carrick at Man Utd\n\n🔍 Two players to watch this weekend\n\nJoao Pedro's evolution\n\nFew forwards have caused more problems for William Saliba and Gabriel this season than Joao Pedro on his last visit to the Emirates Stadium. The Carabao Cup tie ended in defeat for Chelsea but Joao Pedro returns on Sunday aiming for a repeat performance.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Liam Rosenior gave a candid press conference after Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley\n\nThe 24-year-old spent that evening dragging the Arsenal centre-backs out of position and showing impressive strength to hold them off with his back to goal. He linked the play, ran the channels, won twice as many fouls as anyone else and gave Chelsea an outlet.\n\nAll that was missing was a goal but those have hardly been in short supply lately. Joao Pedro has seven in his last nine appearances for Chelsea. Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres is the only Premier League player to have scored more since the turn of the year.\n\nThe increase in his scoring output, from eight goals in 30 appearances earlier this season to seven in his last nine, coincides with the appointment of Liam Rosenior, who said last week that Joao Pedro can become one of the best strikers in the world.\n\nFanciful, some may say, but there is no doubting the strides he has taken. Joao Pedro's goal against Burnley was his 11th in the Premier League this term. He has reached that total despite losing the penalty-taking privileges he enjoyed at former club Brighton.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Joao Pedro has scored more than twice as many non-penalty goals as in any of his previous top-flight campaigns. Erling Haaland and Antoine Semenyo are the only players with more in the Premier League this season.\n\nHaving split his time between the No 10 and No 9 positions for Brighton, and indeed for Chelsea under Enzo Maresca following his £60m arrival in July, Joao Pedro has been used almost exclusively up front by Rosenior, despite the availability of Liam Delap.\n\nImage: Joao Pedro is spending less time out wide and in his own half, and more in the opposition box\n\nChelsea's last meeting with Arsenal showcased his ability with his back to goal, but overall, Joao Pedro is less involved in general play, averaging fewer touches and fewer passes under Rosenior as the new head coach tries to maximise his threat in the box.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

It has allowed him to have roughly twice as many shots. And while he remains capable of spectacular strikes, like his first goal in the Champions League win over Napoli, he has mostly hunted down easier chances.\n\nHis goal against Burnley, forced over the line from Pedro Neto's cross, was his second from inside the six-yard box under Rosenior and put him on five for the season, the joint-highest total by any player along with Leeds striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nImage: Joao Pedro's shot maps show an increased concentration of close-range chances\n\nHelped, of course, by the better service on offer at Chelsea compared to Brighton, Joao Pedro's shot quality is transformed. Excluding penalties, he has gone from averaging 0.12 expected goals per shot at Brighton last term to 0.21 per shot at Chelsea.\n\nRosenior has challenged Joao Pedro to raise the intensity of his play and he has stepped up on that front too, both in terms of his pressing and his attacking movement. He has increased both the volume and effectiveness of his runs in behind.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Enable Cookies Allow Cookies Once\n\nFor Chelsea, the hope is that they might finally have found a striker capable of reaching the numbers achieved by Diego Costa, the last striker to score 20 Premier League goals for the club in a season, a feat he achieved twice in three years at Stamford Bridge.\n\nJoao Pedro, of course, is still a long way short of that milestone this season. But carry on scoring at the same rate and he will eclipse the totals of those to have come closest in Nicolas Jackson, who scored 14 two seasons ago, and Tammy Abraham, who hit 15 in 2019/20.\n\nArsenal\n\nChelsea Sunday 1st March 4:25pm Kick off 4:30pm\n\nBefore all that, though, there is Sunday's trip to the Emirates Stadium, and another opportunity for a striker establishing himself among the elite to test Saliba and Gabriel.\n\nMaguire key to Man Utd resurgence\n\nBenjamin Sesko is another No 9 catching the eye but Manchester United's resurgence under Michael Carrick owes just as much to their defensive performances. It's three clean sheets in six games so far. The return of Harry Maguire has made a difference.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights from the Premier League match between Everton and Manchester United.\n\nMaguire had not started in two months at the time Carrick's appointment due to a thigh issue but his return to fitness has proved timely for the new head coach. The 32-year-old is in line to start a seventh consecutive game against Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\nHe has mostly featured alongside Lisandro Martinez, with Ruben Amorim's back three now a thing of the past. But with Martinez absent due to injury against Everton on Monday, he proved similarly influential next to Leny Yoro, using his experience to guide the young defender and reaching double figures for clearances.\n\nImage: Harry Maguire has the best duel success rate in the Premier League since January 17\n\nThe quality of Maguire's defensive work has been apparent across the last six Premier League games. Having won 36 of his 44 duels in that period, he has the highest success rate of any player.\n\nHis future at Manchester United is uncertain, with his contract due to expire in the summer. A place in England's World Cup is no guarantee either given he has not yet had a call-up from Thomas Tuchel. Clearly, though, he has a lot left to offer.\n\nManchester United\n\nCrystal Palace Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\nPlayer Radar: Who else to keep an eye on\n\nAlex Iwobi and Emile Smith Rowe celebrated their former club Arsenal's North London derby win over Spurs in a video published on social media after helping Fulham beat Sunderland. Next up? Spurs at home, and a chance to inflict more pain on Igor Tudor's side.\n\nOn Friday Night Football, Wolves host Aston Villa live on Sky Sports Premier League and Main Event from 7.30pm, kick-off 8pm.\n\nLeeds against Man City is the Saturday Night Football, live on Sky Sports Premier League and Main Event from 5pm, kick-off 5.30pm\n\nWatch Brighton vs Nottingham Forest, Fulham vs Spurs and Man Utd vs Crystal Palace from 1pm across Sky Sports on Sunday, kicking off at 2pm, before Arsenal vs Chelsea at 4.30pm.\n\nThe last column proved a timely one as it outlined the need for Arsenal to unlock Eberechi Eze's full potential before he went and delivered his two-goal performance against Spurs."

He's not fighting some weight-drained super middleweight. I am in shape and will bring home this victory.\""

            "content": "Atalanta pulled off a thrilling, last-gasp turnaround to make it to the Champions League last 16. Juventus battled valiantly into extra-time with 10 men. But that show of fight hasn't lifted the dark cloud which settled over Italian football this week.\n\nA 98th-minute penalty, converted by Atalanta's Lazar Samardzic, means there will be Italian representation in the next round of the Champions League knockouts.\n\nBut their giants have fallen.\n\nThere was a certain irony on Tuesday night at the San Siro. Moments before kick-off, Inter Milan welcomed club legends Ronaldo Nazario and Christian Vieri onto the pitch as special guests - two figures whose partnership once demonstrated the might of what Serie A once was.\n\nCome full-time, that period has never felt further away. What followed on the pitch was Inter - 10 points clear at the top of Serie A - being knocked out by a Bodo/Glimt team who are currently in pre-season.\n\nThey were not just beaten; they were well beaten, against a team making their first-ever Champions League appearance this season, let alone an appearance in the knockout stages.\n\nAnd losing their knockout play-off to Norway's first Champions League proper team for nearly two decades was not just a low for Inter, but it confirmed one for Italian football.\n\nImage: Bodo/Glimt's players celebrate beating Inter Piero Cruciatti/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe following day, Juventus salvaged some pride but a 7-5 aggregate loss to Galatasaray is still a stunning exit for the previous powerhouse of Serie A.\n\nReigning Serie A champions Napoli fell at the first hurdle, failing to progress from the league phase. AC Milan aren't even in European competition this season.\n\nWhile Bologna and Roma continue to fly the flag in the Europa League, Fiorentina finished 15th in the Conference League table - requiring a play-off against Polish side Jagiellonia Bialystok to make the last 16 of that competition.\n\nAnd speaking of play-offs, it could get worse. Italy's national team need one to avoid a third absence from a World Cup tournament - a competition the nation has won four times. So what has happened to Italian football across the board?\n\nIt has been pretty clear this season that the Serie A teams have not been able to cope with the demands of the European competition - particularly the speed of play.\n\n\"Italian teams play at a slow pace,\" Fabio Capello told Sky in Italy. \"When they face teams that run and press, they don't have the quality, aren't accustomed to playing at a high pace, and make mistakes.\n\n\"This is the key. Right now, we are not accustomed to being aggressive. As soon as they increase the pace from the Italian league, they are stopped because a challenge is too hard - a player's ear is touched, and they go down, all these things.\n\n\"These are the results. We play at a slow pace, unfortunately, and when it happens, it's hard to be dangerous.\"\n\nThe numbers back that up. The direct speed of Italy's top-flight has been on a downward curve in the last five seasons, with many describing the current style of play as slow, compared to the rest of Europe's big five leagues.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

England have managed a dozen.\n\nIn 2025, Italy also gave 1.9 per cent of their Serie A minutes to eligible players under the age of 21. That's the second-lowest out of the top 50 leagues in world football. Only the United Arab Emirates Pro League managed fewer.\n\nIt has been the case for a while. According to the CIES Football Observatory, between 2020 and 2025, Italy produced just 413 football exports. It ranked 24th in the world, behind the United States, Japan and Russia.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Italy's players - young or old - are just not as fancied by Europe's elite.\n\nA traditional tactical problem?\n\nAlso at the heart of Italian football is a lack of tactical innovation. While other leagues have done well to take new tactical insight from the rest of Europe, Italy seems a little stuck in its ways.\n\nItalian coaches Max Allegri, Maurizio Sarri, Luciano Spalletti and Antonio Conte have all been passed around Italy's top clubs in recent years, without much differentiation.\n\nEven Atalanta replaced now-Roma coach Gian Piero Gasperini with ex-Fiorentina coach Raffaelle Palladino and Inter did the same with Parma's Christian Chivu coming in for Simone Inzaghi. Every Serie A appointment seems within its own boundaries.\n\nCesc Fabregas' overachieving Como revolution is a good example of what happens when you take tactical ideas from elsewhere. Carlos Cuesta is another example, he is faring well with Parma having joined from Mikel Arteta's Arsenal backroom staff in the summer.\n\nCould a lack of infrastructure in Italian football - another theme banded around this week amid their clubs' failings in Europe - have something to do with all these issues?\n\nThis year, Deloitte's Football Money League saw no Italian teams in the top 10 wealthiest teams in the Europe. The report added that the most significant part of the wealthy teams' revenue was the way in which they used their stadiums on a non-matchday - such as Tottenham Hotspur's NFL deal.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

It is a pantheon arena of the game but unique because it is outdated and 'old school' - hence why it is being renovated.\n\nIt is so far behind its equivalent stadia in Europe - as is Italian football compared to the rest of the continent."

            "content": "Senne Lammens revels in the “war” of being Manchester United’s goalkeeper in the hugely physical Premier League yet remains bemused at being applauded when entering a primary school classroom on a Wednesday afternoon.\n\nClearly the 23-year-old is still adjusting to a rocketing career trajectory. Following his £18m transfer from Royal Antwerp on 1 September, Lammens made his debut in the 2-0 win over Sunderland on 4 October, and established himself as the first-choice with a faultless start that featured five clean sheets in 21 league games.\n\nTo do so in the relentless glare at United is impressive. In Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton, Lammens was again calm and assured, producing vital saves while navigating the hurly-burly of set-pieces and cornersas players crowded his goalmouth.\n\nView image in fullscreen Senne Lammens is first to the ball while under pressure from Everton’s Thierno Barry as the United goalkeeper keeps another clean sheet. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n\nLammens shrugs when considering the chaos he faces at dead balls. “Physically Everton was a big battle, a big game so I’m still recovering from that,” Lammens says, “It’s been like this. It’s just the way it is – the Premier League, it’s physicality and a bit of war in the 18-yard box.”\n\nAt 6ft 4in and with a robust frame, the young Belgian is built for the game’s demands. “It’s one of my strengths,” he says, “so sometimes I like the challenge as well. Of course it can’t get too much sometimes, but everyone has to deal with it. It’s not like only one team does it, it’s everyone in general.\n\n“As a goalkeeper you have to get used to that and train for it and get better at it. I’ve been doing a good job at it so I’ll continue to do that. The club said to me that it was the most physical. It’s the best league but the physicality is the biggest difference. We do it as well sometimes, making it hard for the goalkeeper.\n\n“In Belgium it’s less physical but still the principles are the same. Here there are a bit more bodies in front of you, but my team has helped me out with blocking guys. You have to be big and not be pushed around easily.”\n\nLammens suggests that greater protection for keepers may have to be considered. “There have to be certain rules,” he says. “You can’t get to the point where it’s too [unfair]. That’s something the Premier League has to look towards.”\n\nLammens made his debut for Club Brugge in July 2021 before moving to Antwerp two years later. He remained uncapped at senior level for Belgium until November’s 7-0 win over Liechtenstein, replacing one of his heroes. “Thibaut Courtois was always a big thing when I was growing up because his saving is just world class,” Lammens says of the 33-year-old Real Madrid goalkeeper.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘You have to be big and not be pushed around easily,’ says Senne Lammens Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Shutterstock\n\nBayern Munich’s 39-year-old Manuel Neuer was another source of inspiration. “When I was growing up my biggest idol was probably Neuer,” he says. “I take pride in being an all-around goalkeeper and that’s why I was such a big fan, because he didn’t really have a weak point, so that’s something I want to take from him. But I try to learn something from everyone because everyone has his strong points.”\n\nLammens is speaking at a Manchester United Foundation event at Partington Central Academy for World Book Day. The surprise at being cheered by pupils draws comparison with being ambushed by paparazzi this month when leaving the Ivy in Manchester after dining with his partner.\n\n“That was one of the more special moments. Special, like I couldn’t believe it. It’s not always the best feeling – they weren’t too bad. But for my girlfriend and I this was the first time with paparazzi. Looking back, it was quite funny. The club warned me that Manchester United is a different animal, especially social media wise.\n\n“It’s a bit new for me, but it’s also probably one of my best feelings when you go into [schools] and see all those children cheering for you and they don’t believe it’s you. Because I was there once in my life, it’s not that long ago. I still remember those times.”\n\nAway from the game, Lammens reads – his favourite book is Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist – and follows other sports. “I don’t really watch a lot of football because on a daily basis you’re doing a lot with football,” he says. “You want to switch off mentally. Of course you still have to watch other people play, but everyone has his own experiences so the best learning school is yourself, your own experiences.\n\n“I’m a big sports guy. I love watching other sports and other athletes do their thing. Especially how they prepare the game and think about their game. Like in the NBA and with, for example, Kobe Bryant or LeBron James.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Senne Lammens with the pupils of Partington Central Academy. Photograph: MUFC\n\nAfter being recommended by Tony Coton, United’s goalkeeping scout, as the replacement for the erratic Andre Onana, Lammens has developed a rewarding working relationship with Tom Heaton, the third-choice keeper. He served early notice of his quality when gathering a corner with authority against Sunderland. It drew a rousing cheer from the Old Trafford faithful.\n\n“It was really nice getting the support from the fans and my teammates, the best feeling in the beginning. And they also gave me even more confidence to keep going and to make the steps I did after that.”\n\nIn an improving campaign under Michael Carrick that has garnered 16 points from the interim manager’s first six games, Lammens wants to maintain consistency. “I don’t really want to look too much into the past,” he says. “It’s been great but I still have to prove myself every week. I just have to keep going now. It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world, but also you have to look through that – it’s still a game of football, the game isn’t that much different.”"

            "content": "When the whistle blows to start USA v Argentina on Sunday in Nashville, a new period of the Emma Hayes era will begin in earnest. The team preparing to play La Albiceleste in Tennessee for the 11th SheBelieves Cup, followed by Canada and Colombia, is the first in more than a year to feature no uncapped players.\n\nFor a head coach who spent 2025 setting, challenging or matching all-time USWNT records for capping players, that is a notable shift and it marks the next phase of the team’s World Cup preparation.\n\nThe first two chapters: Nearly two years ago, Hayes took hold of the humbled giants two months before the Paris Olympics. While noting she felt like a “heart surgeon in the middle of emergency surgery”, the first phase was a whirlwind redemption run that culminated in the USWNT’s fifth gold medal.\n\nIt was slow after the tournament, but last year Hayes worked methodically with her team to develop talent, test a broader pool, foster competition and fold new players into the environment. While securing a record of 12 wins and three defeats, Hayes capped 44 players in the calendar year, the most in the team’s history. She gave debuts to 16 players, the most since 1985, with 38 in all getting starts, the second-most in history and the most since 2001. Since taking over, Hayes has doled out 32 debuts and starts to 55 players.\n\n“You got to create competition,” Hayes said last week. “But to create competition, you got to give people experiences.” Indicating that no one, including those previously in starting spots, was 100% safe in their role, Hayes said: “I expect more competition as a result of the decisions we took last year. But you’ve got to perform. That’s the bottom line.”\n\nThe next step: The absence of uncapped players signifies a shift. Rather than trialling and testing an enormous pool, the four-time Women’s World Cup winners are moving toward refining the group Hayes has built as they prepare for the qualifying tournament in November. “I do think there is clarity, a lot more clarity in terms of the squad of players we are building around for the upcoming year,” said Hayes.\n\nFans can expect a few key themes from this period. For one, as Hayes works towards the Concacaf W Championship (which serves as World Cup qualification), observers can expect healthy experimentation and rotation in the starting XI.\n\nView image in fullscreen Chelsea’s Naomi Girma (left) is part of an established USWNT central defensive pairing. Photograph: Ben Whitley/PA\n\nInjuries, as ever, are one cause for this. Catarina Macario, Kate Wiesner, Tierna Davidson, Croix Bethune, Michelle Cooper, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson are absent due to injuries and other fitness precautions, though Hayes indicated they would all compete for roles when fit. As they re-emerge, and club form fluctuates, some in the camp may move to continue their growth with the under-23s or other youth teams.\n\nAnother cause for rotation and fluctuation is the necessary balance between perfecting the team’s core while encouraging competition and building experience in the main pool. Hayes illustrated this point while discussing her first-choice center-backs, Emily Sonnett and Naomi Girma, and the cadre of less experienced options around them: “When you’ve got such experience like Girma and Sonnett and then a big gap below, it’s always a balance between developing them and developing the players who are my starting center-back pair.”\n\nThere are no uncapped players in camp. But outside five players, no one has more than 42; Riley Jackson has one and 12 players have 10 or fewer. Complemented by a spine of veterans, it is still a notably young squad. Hayes will emphasize gaining experience for all of them before the World Cup: “My job as a coach is to recognize I have to get a group of players ready. And if I just selected 14 players all of the time I genuinely think I’d be failing in this job.”\n\nAnother riveting theme this year is the assured competition for starting roles come next summer. Despite the experience gap Hayes illustrated at center-back, numerous players staked their claim last year for roles held firmly by others two years ago. The goalkeeper position feels open. “Triple Espresso” – Wilson, Swanson and Trinity Rodman – stunned for a summer, but the trio have not figured together since. A squad always dense with attacking talent offered other options in the interim. And with Sam Coffey, Lily Yohannes, Claire Hutton, Jaedyn Shaw, Rose Lavelle, Olivia Moultrie, Lindsey Heaps and, when fit, Bethune, all jockeying for lead roles in the midfield, that could quickly become the most interesting part of the pitch to watch.\n\nThey will face interesting competition with varied styles in the SheBelieves Cup. Colombia, ranked 20th in the world, are making their second appearance, and have provided the USWNT entertaining, at times technically masterful and often physically challenging tests in recent meetings. Argentina, ranked 30th, are also making their second appearance and will hope to improve on their last-place finish in 2021. Canada, longtime rivals to the US, enter the fray without a number of marquee names (Olivia Smith is a doubt after an injury in the FA Cup, while Adriana Leon and Ashley Lawrence were omitted to give others a chance) after some disappointing results in 2025, including a 3-0 loss to the USWNT.\n\nThe US, who finished second behind Japan in last year’s edition, will compete to claim their eighth title on 7 March.\n\nGet in touch\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email moving.goalposts@theguardian.com."

            "content": "A number of European football federations fear they will lose money sending their national teams to the World Cup this summer, with an unusual hike in costs and inconsistencies around tax exemptions among the problems Fifa is being urged to rectify.\n\nAlthough Fifa approved record prize money of £539m for the tournament last December it may not be enough to prevent losses, or reduced profits, for competitors who would usually expect a World Cup to generate vital funds. An investigation by the Guardian and PA Media found particular concerns among football associations about the consequences of missing out on money that would largely be reinvested in local initiatives.\n\nAbout 10 FAs are understood to have shared misgivings between themselves, most recently at Uefa’s annual congress in Brussels a fortnight ago. It has also been informally raised with senior Fifa officials, some of whom appear “embarrassed” about the situation according to an executive from one FA.\n\nTeams that qualify receive $9m (£6.7m) each from Fifa and are handed $1.5m (£1.1m) in preparation costs. Those numbers are believed to have been the same for Qatar 2022, but the previous daily allowance of $850 (£627) per delegation member has been reduced to $600 (£442). One FA estimated that this would mean receiving about $500,000 (£369,000) less if its team remained at the World Cup, which has been expanded in length and number, for a month.\n\nSome FAs have calculated that they will make considerably less money in the US, Canada and Mexico than they did in Qatar; one, a fixture at international tournaments, told the Guardian it will in fact lose a sizeable sum in the event of elimination in the group stage or early in the knockout rounds.\n\nOne particularly aggravating element is a perceived unfairness around tax arrangements. Countries bidding for a World Cup are obliged to provide tax exemptions for FAs that qualify; those have been agreed with Canada and Mexico but no such arrangement has been reached with the US, meaning that nations potentially face vastly differing financial outlooks depending on where they were drawn to play.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Qatar World Cup cost less and was more lucrative for teams, with clear tax arrangements. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nState taxes within the US vary wildly. In California, where Los Angeles and San Francisco will host games, the top rate is 13.3%. In New Jersey, whose MetLife Stadium will stage the final, it stands at 10.75%. Teams largely based in states with lower rates, or outside the US, will find themselves financially advantaged unless an agreement is reached in the next three and a half months. Given that context, there is also frustration that FAs have been left to seek their own tax advice rather than being given specific assistance by Fifa.\n\nOther factors hiking costs include the tournament’s considerable travel demands, unfavourable exchange rates against the dollar, the well-publicised increase in ticket prices and the event’s duration. In Qatar there were four weeks between the opening game and final; this time around the 28-day mark will arrive as the quarter-finals commence.\n\nWhile some figures acknowledge that FAs are responsible for their own bonus structures, which inevitably make for a notable outlay, they point out it would be unworkable to offer a reduced package to that which was promised to their squads in Qatar. Another mitigation offered for this summer’s issues is the potential longer-term benefit of lengthy exposure to the vast North American market.\n\nFifa was contacted for comment."

The club are owned by Saudi group SMC.\n\nAlmería’s president, Mohamed al-Khereiji, suggested the player would be particularly involved in the club’s youth programme. “He is considered the best on the pitch,” Khereiji said. “He knows the Spanish leagues very well and understands the potential of what we are building.”\n\nRonaldo, who has played in the Saudi Pro League for Al-Nassr since 2023 and who also owns a stake in the club, became the first footballer included in Bloomberg’s “Billionaire Index” last October. He recently returned to the Al-Nassr first team after a spat over the way the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the national sovereign wealth fund which controls four clubs in the league, handled the winter transfer window. He has scored four times in the last three games.\n\nRonaldo is set to take part in his sixth World Cup next summer although he has suggested that, aged 41, it could be his last."

            "content": "Where will you be when Bodø/Glimt win the Champions League? OK, they won’t win the Champions League, but they could win the Champions League. Could they? Four wins in a row. Manchester City, Atlético Madrid away, Inter comprehensively twice. It’s an astonishing run.\n\nI am generally cynical about anything foisted upon us by the game’s overlords, but after a brilliant couple of nights of football Uefa must be delighted with the drama and excitement these playoffs produced.\n\nParis Saint-Germain a Wout Faes glancing header away from being taken to extra time. Juventus thrillingly close to a 10-man comeback against Galatasaray. Atalanta keeping Serie A alive with that injury-time penalty. OK, less jeopardy with Qarabag, but you can’t have everything.\n\nIt is Bodø/Glimt who are the dream. They were of course helped by Manuel Akanji, who picked the wrong time to start buffering, giving the ball away and then going peak complain at anyone and everyone for a mistake that was at the very least 100% his fault.\n\nThere’s never a good time to do that, but especially when you’ve gone full Terry Butcher: Mr Bump-style bandage wrapped around your head. Butcher would’ve row-zedded that before any thoughts of playing out came into his head. Actually Mr Bump might have at least knocked it down the channels.\n\nBut Bodø/Glimt’s second goal was a thing of beauty. A glorious pass from Jens Petter Hauge and the touch and finish from Håkon Evjen was perfect. They are a good team, with good players – and this is them in pre-season.\n\nWhat struck me most was how the players and staff reacted at full-time. It is slightly different when you know you are through, when one goal isn’t going to change the game. But this wasn’t delirium at the end. It didn’t feel like Macclesfield knocking out Crystal Palace in the FA Cup: everyone running in different directions, not knowing how to act or who to hug (and to be clear, Macclesfield absolutely should have celebrated like that).\n\nThis was quite measured. You got a real sense that Glimt, if they did not expect it, knew it was achievable. And OK, Serie A isn’t the Serie A people of a certain vintage instantly conjure in their minds: Van Basten, Gullit, James Richardson reading the papers. Sadly the 90s were ages ago. But, still, Inter are 10 points clear at the top. They have been in two of the past three Champions League finals.\n\nTransfermarkt figures put the difference in squad value at about €610m (£532m). Bodø/Glimt’s weekly wage bill (FOR THE WHOLE SQUAD) is just over £150,000. Thanks to Jack Kenmare on Sportbible for listing some Premier League players who earn that on their own: Mateo Kovacic, Noni Madueke, Federico Chiesa, Joelinton, Sandro Tonali, Anthony Gordon and Mason Mount.\n\nView image in fullscreen Bodø/Glimt were 2-1 winners in Milan, sealing a comfortable aggregate victory. Photograph: Claudia Greco/Reuters\n\nAnd to paraphrase the Norwegian football expert and Football Weekly galáctico Lars Sivertsen – for whom this run is almost as profitable as Ole Gunnar Solskjær taking over Manchester United – Glimt’s win is good for football. It is good for anyone who loves the game, and especially anyone who supports a team who don’t win anything – which is pretty much all of us.\n\nFootball is about hope. It is about dreaming that one day your team may be the best, or at least beat the best. Reality suggests this is very unlikely. But Glimt were in the second division of Norwegian football a few years ago. And on Tuesday night they comfortably beat Inter.\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, they are the good guys. So often you think you’ve found a charming underdog story, only to discover the owner sells AK47s to children or makes videos of kittens vaping. There’s always something. A nation state, some collection of words – hedge bond tax scheme – that is in some way nefarious. But here it’s a tiny town near Father Christmas with a team who are just brilliantly run and well coached. It is all just, well, nice.\n\nAnd although we like to think the European Super League idea is dead, there are still big clubs who don’t think they should have to sully themselves with random sides from just north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nWill other teams, to quote Conor Coady, be rubbing their lips to get Glimt in the latter stages of this competition? Probably not, but it is human nature to underestimate an opposition like that. And even if they do get knocked out by Sporting or Manchester City in the next round, they have still given us the chance to ask: if they can do it, why can’t we?\n\nCambridge United are second in League Two. One defeat in their past 19 matches. Any lower-league fan will understand – it is an odd feeling to start to expect to win. You feel like you’re cheating. You don’t want to jinx it. I don’t even want to write this down. Please don’t be my fault.\n\nBut carry this on, and it’s League One. Lincoln are proving that it’s possible you don’t have to be one of the mega rich to compete in the third tier. And OK, a movie star or a rapper or a quarterback may have to give us a few quid to get into the Championship and beyond, but it is possible.\n\nCould Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu be the first footballer to play in all four divisions for two teams? Will Louis Appéré be running the channels at the Etihad in 2028-29? Fortunately I’ve never written a column wondering who Louis Appéré is, nor a column questioning the loyalty of Neil Harris.\n\nIn the early 90s we went up the divisions to the top of the second tier in consecutive years. It’s different now, but Glimt show good things are possible. And yes, they won’t win the Champions League, and we’ll get gubbed by MK Dons on Saturday. But you never know – and that tiny bit of hope is everything."

            "content": "Dean Henderson became a cult hero in south London after saving a penalty in Crystal Palace’s victory against Manchester City in last season’s FA Cup final. The England goalkeeper then boosted his popularity when he dropped into a local pub as supporters celebrated August’s penalty shootout victory over Liverpool in the Community Shield and put £1,000 behind the bar.\n\nHenderson, made captain when Marc Guéhi was sold to Manchester City in January after Palace were humbled in the Cup by non-league Macclesfield, must be wondering how things have turned sour at Selhurst Park so quickly. Supporters turned on the manager, Oliver Glasner, during the first leg of the Conference League playoff against Zrinjski Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina last week and demanded his sacking after another unconvincing performance in the 1-1 draw.\n\nA banner unveiled in the Holmesdale End at the start of Sunday’s 1-0 win against Wolves – only Palace’s second victory in 16 games – took aim at the board and lamented “missed opportunities” since a first major trophy was secured at Wembley last May. It also described Glasner as “finished” after he had told fans to “stay humble”.\n\nGlasner was on his best behaviour as he looked ahead to Thursday’s second leg against Zrinjski, having struck another uneasy truce with the Palace chair, Steve Parish, to see out his contract until the end of the season, meaning it was left to Henderson to issue the rallying call.\n\n“Unity: I think it’s important that we have that,” Henderson said. “It’s been a difficult period and I think the players have to take a lot of responsibility, because we’ve got to do better, first and foremost. For whatever reason it was, we had too many injuries and we just couldn’t cope with the amount of games and the quality we were up against in the Premier League over the last couple of months.\n\n“Now we’ve got everyone back and we’ve got a squad, we’ve been picking up some good results, so hopefully that can give the club a boost. We’re playing European football … and it should be a time for everyone to come together and enjoy that.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Crystal Palace fans unveil a banner critical of the board and Oliver Glasner before the win against Wolves on Sunday. Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/Reuters\n\nHenderson added: “It’s time to shift the narrative and really smile and enjoy these moments because they don’t come round often, instead of putting all the negative spin on everything.”\n\nOne of Glasner’s gripes after the first leg was that some of his players have had their eyes on their next move – an accusation many Palace fans will feel applies to him too. Jean-Philippe Mateta, who Glasner expects back soon from the knee injury that scuppered his January move to Milan, Adam Wharton, Daniel Muñoz and the out-of-contract Daichi Kamada are among those linked with summer moves. Henderson, who is expected to be Jordan Pickford’s backup at the World Cup, warned anyone not committed to the cause they were in for a rude awakening.\n\n“If you don’t put the performances in order, you don’t get the move you want, so they need to be very careful,” he said. “I’m not aware of any of that, but I would suggest they have to be careful if they were thinking like that.”\n\nWharton’s form in particular has dipped in recent weeks but Glasner pointed out that the England midfielder had already played more than 1,000 minutes more than he had last season, owing to Palace’s involvement in the Conference League.\n\n“Players have to cope with a completely new situation in their career,” he said. “I remember I spoke to Eddie Howe at Newcastle when they played the first time in the Champions League. They were massively struggling and I spoke about his experience. But we are still the second-best amount of points ever [at this stage for Palace].\n\n“We have the European competitions and we have had some big injury problems at the end of last year. We had the Afcon [Africa Cup of Nations], we had some big noise in any single transfer window, and when I see the big picture, everything that happened for me, it’s just incredible where we are right now.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Oliver Glasner speaks to the press alongside Henderson before the Conference League playoff second leg against Zrinjski Mostar.

He won the Europa League in 2022 with Eintracht Frankfurt before falling out with the hierarchy the following season despite reaching the German Cup final and is aiming to reach a fourth final in five seasons. But, perhaps wisely given Palace’s difficulty in breaking down low blocks, he was wary of making the bold prediction that Palace can go all the way before Zrinjski’s visit.\n\n“I think for 120 years Crystal Palace entered every cup competition to win it,” he said. “This group of players has done it once last year. Every team will enter the competition, but just one can leave with the trophy at the end, and it just makes no sense to talk now about it.”"

            "content": "Celtic’s manager, Martin O’Neill, has delivered a withering assessment of VAR in Scottish football after what he called the “ridiculous” dismissal of Auston Trusty during Sunday’s loss by Hibernian.\n\nTrusty’s red card and a failed Celtic appeal mean the centre-back will miss three crucial Scottish Premiership games, starting with Sunday’s Old Firm visit to Ibrox. O’Neill claimed VAR actions must be “debilitating” for on-field officials.\n\nTrusty reacted angrily to the attentions of Hibs’ Jamie McGrath at a Celtic corner. The referee Matthew MacDermid appeared content the incident was worthy of no sanction but was sent to review the incident by the VAR Grant Irvine. To O’Neill, the game was re-refereed.\n\n“The referee, as he told me on Sunday, has seen the incident,” O’Neill said. “It is not as if he hadn’t seen it, he is watching it. He is asked by a very excited man on VAR, saying: ‘Delay, delay, delay, delay.’ They ask him [the referee] and he says: ‘It’s nothing, I’m just going to have a word with the players.’ Then he has to trot over to change his mind. It is ridiculous.\n\n“It is such a nonsense. I am all for people that missed something dramatic in a game, that constitutes something they should have a look at. But when a referee sees the incident himself then what he is being asked to do is: ‘No, you didn’t see that. You saw something else.’ That has got to be debilitating for a referee. It has got to be.\n\n“In time we won’t need a referee. VAR will do it from wherever they are doing it from, because that is what they did. They have asked the referee to overturn something that he has actually seen. It is not as if he missed the incident which of course would be a different issue.”\n\nA clearly perplexed O’Neill, speaking in Germany before the second leg of Celtic’s Europa League tie with Stuttgart, has no issue with the basic concept of VAR. Instead he has questioned the form it is taking in Scotland.\n\n“Trusty was sent off for being the last man against Hearts,” he added. “The same thing happened. The referee said he gave a yellow card because he thought the ball was going away and the referee was there and closer to the incident. He saw the incident and he was called over to change it.\n\n“If VAR has spotted some things that are blatant, two boys having a fight in the corner or something and it’s missed, I can understand that.”\n\nCeltic head into this second leg with a 4-1 and apparently insurmountable deficit. O’Neill is likely to leave out a few senior players with the key trip to Ibrox in mind. “They’ve all played in the first team so whoever we put out it won’t mean a ‘weakened’ team,” O’Neill said. “They are all capable players.”"

            "content": "The shipment of Eric Ramsay’s possessions must have hardly made it to the West Midlands in time. After leaving Minnesota United this MLS offseason, his era in charge of West Bromwich Albion lasted just 44 days, during which time the Baggies played nine games, and won none. The club couldn’t afford to be patient; not while perched just one point above the drop zone in the Championship. Ramsay was sacked on Tuesday.\n\nIn one sense, this is business as usual in the English system’s second tier. Ramsay is the 11th coach to be sacked, to resign, or part by mutual consent since the 2025-26 season commenced, and the league’s 12th mid-season change when counting Rob Edwards’ move to Wolves. One level below, League One has seen nine such changes; League Two has undergone seven. As Ramsay himself said a year ago: “getting managers sacked is a bit of a national sport.”\n\nAnd yet, Ramsay’s dismissal restarted a specific discourse, summed up most bluntly on Talksport by Charlie Austin, the veteran striker who spent 18 months with West Brom and now plays for Hungerford Town. Asked why teams are hiring “these MLS American coaches,” Austin quickly retorted: “I think people have watched Ted Lasso and got carried away if I’m honest.\n\n“I don’t get it. For a club like Celtic, what they’ve done with Wilfried Nancy. It’s painful. That appointment that Celtic made could cost them a title up there, and West Brom [hiring Ramsay] could cost them Championship football.”\n\nOf course, neither Nancy nor Ramsay are American. Born in Shrewsbury and raised in Llanfyllin, Wales, Ramsay had no pro playing career of significance, instead coaching in the youth ranks of Swansea City and Chelsea before joining Manchester United in 2021. There, he worked under Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag. His multi-lingualism is credited for helping Casemiro integrate, with some describing him as a “secret weapon” for the club.\n\nNancy was born in Le Havre and played in France for a decade before moving to Quebec in 2005 and launching his coaching career soon after. He led CF Montréal to its best stretch since Didier Drogba left, then led Columbus to an awe-inspiring MLS Cup win balancing effectiveness with aesthetics. Yet his move to the UK went similarly to Ramsay’s: eight games in charge of Celtic, two wins, and just 33 days in total.\n\nTheir paths to this point were significantly different, but now Nancy and Ramsay are linked in the eyes of many: two MLS managers who couldn’t cut it on their side of the Atlantic.\n\nView image in fullscreen Wilfried Nancy’s reign at Celtic lasted just 33 days – the club’s shortest managerial tenure ever. Photograph: Russell Cheyne/Reuters\n\nWhy did this happen? It may be helpful to start with what each coach was seemingly expected to do: win immediately, or else. This is an obviously ill-fitting task for these specific coaches, coming from the specific league they came from.\n\nNancy and Ramsay succeeded in MLS thanks to some of the league’s most crystalized tactical ideologies. As Thierry Henry – who appointed Nancy to his backroom staff in Montréal and whose departure led to Nancy’s first senior head coaching role – told me in 2024: “Wil is very important because he will live and die by [his philosophy] … At the end of the day, when he finishes a game, it’s very important that he doesn’t talk about the result. He talks about the how.”\n\nRamsay, meanwhile, turned Minnesota United into “the most aggressive set-piece team in the world”. Thanks to injury plagues and international duty, the Loons kept a tight defensive shape and attacked primarily through transition phases and dead-ball scenarios. While he’d openly pined for a chance to have more control over the ball, that philosophy will generally play in a relegation scrap. What West Brom overlooked, seemingly, was Ramsay’s preference to play with a five-man defense, a problem considering their squad’s relative thinness at the back.\n\nAnd then there’s the structural issue. Thanks to MLS’s spring-to-fall calendar, both coaches arrived midway through their new team’s season. “NancyBall” takes time to execute; so too does embracing a bus-parking kayfabe. Yet neither coach had a pre-season to install these ideas, and neither destination was in much of a position to be patient at the time of their arrival. Should we blame the managers for saying yes to an advancement opportunity, or the club hierarchies for offering it to them regardless of their chances of success?\n\nIn stark contrast to the Scottish or English league systems, MLS’s lack of relegation and relative parity among teams permits plenty of runway for managers who want to establish their ideologies. In time, sometimes, those ideas work.\n\n“You get an element of patience,” Ramsay told the Guardian last January. “If you look at it, the lifespan of a manager in MLS versus the Championship is significantly longer. I’m sort of out of the spotlight that young British coaches would be in at any level if they took a job [in English football]. You get to develop some of the things that are really important in a coach’s trajectory. You’re doing it with a sense of stability.”\n\nIt’s a refrain we’re hearing more stateside, most recently after the Colorado Rapids hired Matt Wells. The 37-year-old Englishman joined in December, having been on Tottenham’s first team coaching staff under Ange Postecoglou and Thomas Frank.\n\n“I’m a bold person, and I also look at other people – obviously Eric [Ramsay], but there’s other coaches that are coaching in different leagues across the world, the likes of Robbie Keane and Liam Rosenior, coaches I really, really respect,” Wells told the MLS website, just before Rosenior’s move from Strasbourg to Chelsea. “I actually love the fact that they take a different pathway. They don’t take the easy option just to go to the Championship. I think the rate of development I’m going to get by moving here is going to be far accelerated.”\n\nPerhaps someday, Wells will be the next coach bandied about for a job in England or elsewhere in Europe. Whenever that day comes, for him or another MLS peer, Nancy and Ramsay will be cited as cause for concern, just as Bob Bradley and Jesse Marsch were before them.\n\nOr maybe not. The context will radically alter next summer, when MLS flips its calendar to play its seasons from late summer to spring – the same as Europe and much of the world. A coach wanting to finish the ongoing season with his MLS side can do so and swiftly relocate with the promise of a full pre-season ahead. Time will tell whether that prospective employer will be able to drown out the anti-MLS groans bound to accompany their rumors.\n\nBut in the event of such an appointment, they’ll hope to enter a sporting structure with a clearer vision and more capacity for patience than Nancy or Ramsay enjoyed."

We're building a house right now and my missus wanted to have a really big trophy room.\n\n\n\n\"There was another small room and I said, 'This is enough, because we know how many trophies we have, we will not add any.'

But watching Salah struggle week in, week out, it's tough to watch, or am I being a bit harsh?\"\n\nEx-Reds winger Jermaine Pennant replied: \"No, not at all...when you watch what he's done for us over nine seasons, it's been nothing but phenomenal.\n\n\"And when you see a player all of a sudden have a 29-goal season and then have four three-quarters of the way through...that's a massive drop-off, that is huge.\n\n\"It's hard to see and hard to watch, you look at Mo and see what he's done for us over the years, this is not him.\"\n\nHe added: \"But, every player at some point in their career will have a slow decline, the goals will start drying up, they won't be as efficient as they once were.\n\n5 Liverpool fans have witnessed a rapid decline in form from Salah this season Credit: Getty\n\n5 The Egyptian has not posted anywhere near as good stats as he usually does\n\n\"There are a lot of things that come into it - each season goes by, each season you get older.\n\n\"But on top of that, he's lost his partner in crime in Trent, and there's a lot of team shuffling, different manager, different style, all those things in one is never going to be easy for whoever you are.\n\nSmith then joined in to say: \"We've been spoiled by him, haven't we? His numbers have been phenomenal, more than we all expected.\n\n\"If he wasn't scoring or on a drought like this, as long as he's getting assists, it would be okay, but he's not getting them either.\"\n\nPennant went on to raise the point that his standards are much higher than most, saying: \"If he was putting up numbers that Bukayo Saka put over the past five seasons, this wouldn't be a drought...\"\n\nTo which Ellard commented: \"That's true, Salah is in the conversation of being one of the greatest Premier League players of all time. So we are holding him to the highest standards, we've been so lucky.\"\n\n5 Salah is one of Liverpool's greatest players ever and he won't want to leave on a low Credit: Getty\n\nDon't damage your legacy\n\nSalah's form has caused some extra concern for Liverpool fans due to the fact that his future at the club is more than uncertain.\n\nThe 33-year-old has been regularly linked to a move to Saudi Arabia, with rumours escalating after his beef with boss Slot.\n\nIt seems to appear that he is not going to be at the Reds for much longer, and ex-boxer and huge fan, Paul Smith, is worried that he won't leave on a positive note that he deserves.\n\nSalah has been criticised for his form, as well as his attitude this season, being spotted smiling after realising he was being substituted against Nottingham Forest on Sunday afternoon.\n\nHe was also seen laughing with Cody Gakpo on the bench after coming off in that game, something that has led to backlash.\n\nAnd a concerned Smith said: \"He's been one of the best players I've ever seen in a Liverpool shirt, I love him, so I hope he can find a bit of form at the end so there isn't a bad break-up...\n\n5 Salah's form and attitude have been criticised amid his struggles Credit: Getty\n\n\"There's a few people talking about the way he is on the bench, they're not happy with how he's behaving.\"\n\nHe added: \"The great athletes have got to have that arrogance, you've got to back yourself, you've got that ego.\n\n\"But when you're laughing on the bench, it's a little bit frustrating.\"\n\nSalah has 11 more Premier League games to try and find some form, along with knockout fixtures in the Champions League.\n\nNext up for Liverpool, they host struggling West Ham at Anfield, hoping for a crucial three points.\n\nThe Reds are sitting three points outside of the top four.\n\nInside Liverpool on talkSPORT talkSPORT brings you Liverpool like no other.

We all know football is very hard at the moment. You play with more intensity, the team knows you. I think he has played too many games.\n\n“So maybe sometimes you need to rest him and keep him fresh. It's hard to play that high intensity game when you start to get old.\n\n“Mo Salah is a legend for Liverpool. What he's done, I don't think some players can catch him.\n\n“The way he wants to end his career in Liverpool, it's only about him, how he wants to do it.”\n\nWhen asked about whether football does catch up with you, Traore said: “Yes, of course, you know, football is insane at the moment.\n\n“When you sit with the top players, when you play in a big club and you can play more than 75 games a year or something like that. I think it's crazy.\n\n“The demand is higher than before. You play every three days when you play in the Champions League, when you play in the league, and if you play for your national team as well.\n\n“It's hard to play at the same intensity all the time. You need to give the chance to some young players."

There's how far you let that abuse go.\n\n\"Once upon a time, poor David Beckham had to listen to which particular part of his wife's anatomy was available to him from football fans around the stadium, and you get on with it.\n\n\n\n\"While it's not nice, it's unkind, it's unpleasant, sometimes life is unkind and unpleasant.\n\n\"It's a sport that's driven by confrontation. Declan would be best served ignoring, which he probably will do.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the fan in question, Jordan continued: \"The guy's a moron, he'll continue to be a moron, and Declan will continue to be a multi-million pound footballer.\"\n\nWhite then posed the question: \"So do you have to accept, even as a top player, and Declan is one, of that there is no doubt, that your family is going to get weaponised by some character like the one we've just seen in the crowd in the name of tribalism?\"\n\nTo which Jordan responded: \"I don't know how they've been weaponised in this context.\n\n\"We saw Declan the other day. I saw him in a game taking a corner, getting absolute dog's abuse.\n\n2 Rice was subjected to abuse from Chelsea fans during Arsenal's 3-2 EFL Cup win at Stamford Bridge last month Credit: AFP\n\n\n\n\"The corner crossed over and they scored a goal, and he's running away from the fans laughing at them.\n\n\"That's the best way to handle it. I mean, it's not nice. It's not pleasant.\n\n\"I've been inside a football stadium when awful things have been said about my family.\n\n\"Well, first of all, I take opinions from people whose opinions are valid, not some rabid football fan that's trying to put me off in the middle of a football match.\n\n\"My relationships with my family are important to me and your opinion of that is irrelevant to me.\"\n\n\n\nWhite then brought up that said fan had gone to the effort to find a picture of Rice's wife to load up on his phone in an attempt to mock the Arsenal star.\n\n'This idiot'\n\nMurphy, though, countered that the amplification of the image of Rice on Sunday means the Spurs supporter has been plastered all over social media in the days since Arsenal's 4-1 win.\n\n\"There's a lot of idiots out there,\" Murphy began. \"The greatest thing about social media, whether you love it or hate it, is the situations like this get amplified.\n\n\"This idiot is all over the place now. He's got to walk around and walk into work the next day.\n\n\"If he's got kids or whatever, he's the one looking the moron.\"\n\nArsenal will look to maintain their Premier League push when they face London rivals Chelsea on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\n\nThe Blues have failed to win their last two league matches having been held at home by newly-promoted pair Leeds and Burnley."

Freezers could quietly be guzzling more energy than necessary if they are full of excess ice.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFreezers are designed to keep things frozen, but appliances can occasionally go too far and start freezing everything around them. This build-up of ice forces the appliance to work harder and, therefore, burn through more electricity to keep food at a safe temperature.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPosting on its website, an E.ON spokesperson said: \"If a thick layer of ice is building up in your freezer, it’s usually a sign that your appliance is struggling. This inefficiency can have a direct impact on your energy use and monthly bills.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Frost acts as an insulator. It does this by creating a barrier between your freezer’s cooling elements and the food you’re trying to keep frozen. Because of this, your freezer's compressor has to work extra hard for longer to keep a set temperature. This increased workload equals higher electricity use and higher energy bills.\"\n\nThe energy provider suggests that ice build-up could be costing people up to £30 extra a year on their energy bills. Although this might seem minor when spread out over the year, pairing this up with other energy-saving methods could soon add up to significant savings.\n\nView 3 Images The appliance could be burning through more electricity than needed (Image: getty)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHow often should freezers be defrosted - and how to do it?\n\nThe general guideline for appliances is to do this job at least once a year. If people notice ice building up, there's no harm in doing it earlier. E.ON listed a few red flag signs to watch out for that might mean it is time to flush out the freezer:\n\nSeeing visible ice on the interior walls, shelves, or drawers.\n\nGetting harder to close the freezer door properly.\n\nLess storage space inside, and it seems to be getting tighter.\n\nFood is getting excessive frost - even when it’s well packaged.\n\nThe freezer is running almost constantly and/or making strange noises.\n\nTo properly defrost your freezer, empty all the food by using it up or by seeing if you can store it with a neighbour or family member. Then, get a few cheap tools ready to tackle the job, including paper towels, an old cloth, shallow bowls and a plastic ice scraper (avoid metal).\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSwitch off and unplug the freezer and leave the door open, then let the ice melt naturally. This is the safest method but also, the slowest (think, overnight). Remember to regularly replace towels and empty water bowls.\n\nView 3 Images Clear out the freezer and start the process (Image: ZeynepKaya via Getty Images)\n\nOnce all ice has melted, wipe down the interior thoroughly with a mild detergent solution. Rinse with clean water, but make sure it dries completely, preventing re-frosting and mould growth.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nNext, check the door seals for signs of damage, cracks, or dirt that could prevent a tight seal. Clean the doors with warm, soapy water in case anything is obstructing them.\n\nFinally, plug your freezer back into the mains. Don’t start using it straight away, let it cool down to its optimal temperature first (around -18°C).\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

The entire country was holding its breath. As I walked into Soham Village College for a hastily convened police press conference, I remember greeting people as I passed through the doors.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nParents, teachers, officers, reporters - all of us clinging to the same fragile optimism. Fear sat just beneath the surface, but no one wanted to give in to it. Not yet. In the corridors, optimism hung like the warm August air. People spoke in lowered voices. Every rumour was chased. Every possible sighting was seized upon. It was still a town that believed in happy endings.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n12 View 12 Images Ian Huntley murdered 10-year-old Holly Wells and Jessica Champan (Image: PA Archive/PA Images) 12 View 12 Images He was caretaker at Soham Village College Secondary School when he murdered the two girls (Image: PA)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhat did Ian Huntley do? School caretaker who murdered girl pupils aged 10 READ MORE :\n\nStanding slightly apart was a man in work clothes who caught my attention almost immediately. What stood out was the enormous bunch of keys hanging from his belt. They clinked softly as he walked - an everyday sound, barely noticeable at the time, but one that would later come back to me with sickening clarity. He had the air of someone who wanted to be useful, to be seen, to matter.\n\nWhen I said good morning, I remarked, without thinking, that he had a familiar accent. “I’m from Grimsby,” he said. I told him I was from Hull - close enough to feel like kin, even if the Humber Estuary divides the two. He smiled, pleased by the connection. “I used to live in Hull,” he replied.\n\nThat man was Ian Huntley.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as your Preferred Source in your Google search settings.\n\nView 12 Images Holly and Jessica died in August 2002 (Image: Shutterstock)\n\nAt that moment, he was just another helpful local. The school caretaker. A reassuring presence in a town desperate for answers. He wasn’t especially intelligent, but he was eager to be liked - keen to insert himself, to listen, to ask questions. Someone who seemed as invested as everyone else in finding the girls.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNone of us knew - none of us could have imagined - that he had murdered Holly and Jessica in cold blood less than two days earlier. Because of that shared geography, that throwaway exchange about home, Huntley gravitated towards me over the following days. It felt natural. Familiar.\n\nView 12 Images Police officers sealed off the home of caretaker Ian Huntley (Image: PA)\n\nHe would linger, always wanting to know what was being said, who was asking questions, and how things were developing. It didn’t feel suspicious. It felt like a man desperate to be included, to be seen as part of the effort.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 12 Images Huntley sitting in his car outside his house near the college in Soham while the girls were missing (Image: PA)\n\nFor the next two weeks, I spent time with Huntley and his girlfriend, Maxine Carr. They welcomed me into the house they shared on the school grounds at No. 5 College Close. It felt ordinary. Disarmingly so. The sort of place you’d never give a second thought to. Huntley dominated the space. He spoke over Maxine, corrected her, guided the conversation. She was quieter, deferential, often glancing towards him before answering.\n\n12 View 12 Images Maxine Carr, Huntley's girlfriend, has been given an indefinite order protecting her new identity (Image: PA) 12 View 12 Images How the Mirror reported the murders (Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAt the time, it barely registered - just the dynamic of a couple. Only later did it feel chillingly significant.\n\nWe talked about Hull and Grimsby, old streets, familiar places, shared reference points. We talked about work, about the strain of the search, about life in general. We filled the silences with small talk, the kind of conversation people have when they are trying not to think about what everyone else is thinking.\n\nView 12 Images Huntley has been incarcerated at HMP Frankland (Image: ITV)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNever once did I suspect that I was sitting in the presence of evil. Never once did I imagine that the people in front of me knew exactly what had happened to those two girls, knew where they were, and knew that the hope gripping the town was already dead.\n\nI must have been in that house 10 times, maybe more. I sat on their furniture. Drank tea. I leaned in doorways, notebook in hand. I stroked Sadie the dog, the same dog later woven into their alibi. Everything about the place felt normal. Mundane. Even safe.\n\nView 12 Images Inside Huntley's bedroom (Image: Press Association)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMost chilling of all, I used their bathroom several times. The same bathroom where Huntley would later claim Holly and Jessica met their deaths.\n\nThere is something uniquely horrifying about that realisation. About knowing how close you were. About replaying the memory of turning on the tap, glancing at the mirror, standing on those tiles, utterly unaware that you were in a room where two children had taken their final breaths.\n\nView 12 Images The landing of the Soham home (Image: Press Association)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhen the truth finally emerged months later, my mind didn’t rush to the courtroom or the headlines. It went straight back to that house. To the feel of it. To the sound of those keys. To the easy smile. To the way Huntley always wanted to be at the centre of things. And to the question that still haunts me: how did I not know?\n\nThe girls were eventually found in a remote ditch, discovered by chance, lying side by side. By then, the hope that once filled Soham had long since drained away, replaced by grief, anger and disbelief.\n\nView 12 Images The former caretaker's home was demolished in 2004 (Image: Press Association)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAnd I was left with one unbearable truth: I had been in the presence of evil without recognising it. I had spoken to it. Shared a joke with it. Sat in its home.\n\nThat, perhaps, is the most terrifying lesson of all. Monsters do not always look like monsters. Sometimes they look like ordinary men with keys on their belts - eager to be liked, quietly controlling, smiling politely, and talking about where they’re from."

            "content": "Easy way to get McDonald's for £2.99 'every time' according to little-known hack\n\nWith McDonald's meals costing up to £10 each, one savvy saving fan has shared how you can get a meal for just £2.99 and it works an unlimited amount of times\n\nView 2 Images Savvy fans have shared how to always get a cheap McDonald's meal (Image: NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nWe all miss the days you could get a full McDonald's meal for under a fiver.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNow a McDonald's fan has shared exactly how you can bag a Big Mac and fries for £3 'for life' with this savvy hack. While certain maccies orders can cost upwards of £10, you may want to take note.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nYou can apparently use this trick 'unlimited' times says TikToker Jordon Cox, known as @couponkiduk on social media. He urged fans to \"never pay full price at McDonald's\" and said all you need is a recent receipt and \"your meal can be £2.99 every time.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe said: \"When you get a receipt, if you quickly fill out the survey at the top, you’ll get a voucher for a £2.99 meal to your email. When you use that voucher to get one of these cheap meals, you’ll get another receipt, so you can do it over and over again.\"\n\nView 2 Images You can now get a Big Mac meal for under £3 (Image: Lauren DeCicca/Getty Images)\n\nThe survey he mentioned is called Food for Thoughts, which can be filled in at mcfoodforthoughts.com. All you need is a valid receipt from McDonald’s from the last 60 days.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThen you need to enter the 12-digit code at the top and the total amount of money you spent in order to get through to the survey. The only caveat is that each code can only be used once and will have an expiry date. You will then be sent a £2.99 voucher and to redeem it, you can either scan the QR code it comes with, enter the 12-digit code at the digital kiosk, or present it to a crew member at the tills.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nEach voucher can only be used for food purchased in physical restaurants and not for delivery. With this voucher you can redeem a Big Mac, McChicken, Quarter Pounder, six Chicken McNuggets, a Fillet-O-Fish, or McPlant, with medium fries or a side salad. However it doesn't include a drink - so you will have to pay extra for that.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHowever a Big Mac by itself costs more than £5 so you're still saving lots of money eitherway. For those in the Republic of Ireland, the offer still exists and customers can also complete the survey and get a Big Mac, Fillet-o-Fish, or Vegetable Deluxe, plus medium fries for €3.90.\n\nBut sceptics of Jordon's hack were quick to chime in with flaws in the trick. One person pointed out that the QR codes don’t always scan on the digital kiosks, while others said out that receipts aren't always available either.\n\nDo you have a story to share?

No finder's fee, no compensation,’ Rueda allegedly wrote in an email to his publicists at the time.\n\nManny Pacquiao is suing a law firm and their client for allegedly fabricating a case against him\n\nThe message never came to light despite a judge ordering Rueda’s messages be turned over in 2018, and was only uncovered from a forensic analysis by Pacquiao’s team in 2023.\n\nPacquiao’s lawyers say they traced the gruesome texts of body parts back to a mass-distributed cartel scam.\n\nRecords cited by his new lawsuit allegedly show identical threats were sent to more than 100 other people unconnected to the case.\n\nAfter losing the case, Withers Bergman tried to withdraw as Rueda’s lawyers, and his attorney Amman Khan’s profile was removed from the firm’s website.\n\nOver a decade on from their first encounter, Pacquiao is set for a stunning rematch with Mayweather in Las Vegas later this year.\n\nA Hollywood waiter sued Pacquiao in 2016 after claiming he was owed an $8million fee for helping to arrange his blockbuster May 2015 fight against Floyd Mayweather (pictured)\n\nThe fight icons will meet again in September in the first ever boxing match at 'The Sphere' off the strip in Sin City, it was announced earlier this week.\n\nThe bout is set to be globally broadcast on Netflix as part of the streamer's growing investment into live sports.\n\nMayweather, 49, first has to take on Mike Tyson, 59, in an exhibition bout this spring. A date and location has not yet been confirmed.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile Pacquiao, 47, has a warm-up fight against Ruslan Provodnikov on April 18, almost a year after his draw with then-WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios."

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The cameras were forced to cut away before medics attended to the fighter.\n\nReplays show that late in the first round, the two boxers clashed heads, with George coming away dazed and shaken. It appears this was the reason for his sudden fall to the canvas.\n\nThe 36-year-old made it back to his feet following medical attention and was taken to a Detroit hospital to be monitored.

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

You might have already heard rumours but it is definitely true.'\n\nNorris and Corceiro, who used to go out with footballer Joao Felix, broke up in 2024 before getting back together last year but it seems they have called it quits again.\n\nNorris set tongues wagging when he appeared to tell Carlos Sainz he is 'a single man'\n\nAccording to the Sun: 'There have been tell-tale signs for a while now.\n\n'They drifted apart after his win last season. The biggest hint came in Bahrain as he and his team continued testing ahead of the new season.\n\n'Lando held a party to thank those who have been with him from the start and who he credits with helping him lift the title.\n\n'Anyone who was anyone posed for a group picture. The only one who wasn’t there was girlfriend Magui. It naturally sparked rumours.'\n\nOnly last December, Corceiro broke down in tears after watching Norris triumph to take the world championship.\n\nIn the week that followed, the model and actress gave an interview with TV Guia, saying: 'There's no rule for going public,' she said. 'I thought it (the kiss in Abu Dhabi) made sense. I'm very happy, he's very happy, and that's what matters.\n\n'At that moment I forgot the cameras were there. It was such an important moment that I didn't even remember that.'\n\nCorceiro was in attendance for the post-victory celebrations along with his parents Adam and Cisca, his brother Oliver and the McLaren team.\n\nIt's understood the group partied through the night until 6am on Monday, racking up a bill worth around £100,000 across the hotel bars they visited.\n\nCorceiro hails from Santarem in Portugal and has amassed a colossal social media following including 800,000 fans on TikTok.\n\nPortuguese influencer Corceiro dated Norris on-and-off since 2023 but they have now 'split'\n\nThe stars' relationship was one of the more high profile on the Formula One grid\n\nAs an actress, she has appeared in Portuguese television dramas and is regularly featured in campaigns, including stints for Intimissimi and Alo Yoga.\n\nCorceiro was a contestant in the country's version of Dancing with the Stars back in 2020.\n\nShe also co-founded the eco-conscious swimwear brand Missus and has graced the pages of Vogue Portugal.\n\nIt was on his own appearance in Vogue that Norris first gushed about Corceiro.\n\n'We met a few years ago, but we were never really together,' he said. 'Until more recently.'\n\nWhen asked what was 'special' about her, he replied: 'Everything. She's someone I can very much be myself with. Very down to earth and she lives quite a crazy life as well. It's nice when we can both just [rent] a boat for the day or go home together and chill.'\n\n'The biggest thing I'm trying to change is to get her into golf. She hates golf.'\n\nBut the relationship appears to have come to an end, though neither party have yet confirmed the split on their official channels."

'I've said that to them, I've texted them. It's just fallen on deaf ears.\n\n'Because I had an argument with my old man, and for five months, I never spoke to him. And for 41 years of my life, he was my best mate. I had a row - don't want to go into it, it was personal - with my kids, and he died in those five months. And it f***ed me up.\n\n'And I blamed myself, and that's when I didn't want to hear from anybody, I didn't want to speak to anybody, I was drinking, trying to commit suicide, all that s***, which is f***ing stupid, looking back now. And yeah, some days, they give you wake-up calls. I went to Sporting Chance (a therapy service for sportspeople) for 26 years, and it was the best 26 years of my life, the rest is history.'\n\nDean Windass has revealed that such is the extent of his estrangement from his sons, he does not even know where Wrexham star Josh lives\n\nAppearing on Whistleblowers, the Premier League cult hero (pictured with Josh) said he is constantly reaching out to both of his sons\n\nHe continued: 'I thought my dad dying was my fault. And it wasn't, he had a heart attack out of the blue, but I'm thinking, \"if I'd have knocked on his door...\" and that's why I don't want my kids to make the same mistake.'\n\nRevealing that he was trying to reach out to Josh and his other son, Jordan, he added: 'I text them every day. And I watched Josh last night, at Wrexham, (he's a) good player, married with a kid - I ain't seen my grandchild for a year.\n\n'It's a tough thing, and people will say, \"why are you mentioning it?\" - but I want to mention it. Because I don't want my kids to make the same mistakes that I made. It's my responsibility as a parent, and I thought it was my dad's responsibility as a parent.\n\n'But when the s*** hit the fan... I was working for Soccer Saturday and this is how stupid it was, I should have done it. I was living in Leeds, and I was driving (to work), I was a little bit early, and I thought, \"f*** it, I'll just pop in at my dad's.\"\n\n'I've not spoken to him for five months. And if I'd have knocked on his door, he'd have f***ing punched me in the face, or whatever, and gone \"come in, give us a kiss\", we'd have had a cry, and it would be all done with. But my attitude was, \"why should I knock on his f***ing door, he's the dad.\"\n\n'And now the roles are reversed with me. I want to knock on Josh's door. I don't even know where he f***ing lives, that's how bad it is, he's in Chester somewhere, or Cheshire, I don't know. And now my youngest son has decided not to speak to me over a family issue. So I don't speak to my two boys.'\n\nSuch is the chasm between father and sons that Josh admitted in 2025 that he did not find out about his father's dementia diagnosis from him directly, but through a friend at a coffee shop.\n\nWindass added: 'The reason why (I speak about this publicly is) if I can get this message over to my children, please don't make the same mistake, because I nearly lost my life for it.'\n\nDespite the distance between them, Windass remains a proud supporter of his sons' achievements, admitting that he was the 'f***ing proudest man in the world' when Josh scored the winning goal at Wembley to send Sheffield Wednesday up to the Championship at the end of the 2022-23 season.\n\nJosh echoed his father's greatest achievement on the pitch, with Windass himself netting the winner in 2008 to see Hull promoted to the Premier League.\n\nJoking that his son's display 'took the heat off' him, he added: 'The kid's a f***ing player, and I'm very proud of it.\n\n\n\n'But that's testament to them. Josh is teetotal, Jordan's teetotal, and I'm f***ing proud of that (too).'"

            "content": "A big weekend of Premier League action awaits and several managers are taking their press conferences today to preview the matches. Stay here with Daily Mail Sport for all the latest...\n\nLe Bris offers support to Mundle after racist abuse\n\nSunderland boss Regis Le Bris has branded racist abuse directed towards Romaine Mundle 'unacceptable'.\n\nThe winger featured from the bench in the Black Cats' 3-1 defeat to Fulham on Sunday on a weekend that saw four separate cases of Premier League players receiving racist abuse and Le Bris reiterated the club's support for Mundle.\n\n'What happened to Romaine is unacceptable, we stand with him,' said Le Bris. 'There is no room for racism or abuse in football or anywhere else. That's clear for us, we stand for respect, inclusion and diversity, these are the values of football and the values of the club, so it's clear.'\n\nSpeaking about wider racially motivated incidents in football in recent months, he added: 'I don't know really why but I repeat, we don't want to accept that.\n\nRomain Mundle was sent racial abuse on social media after Sunderland's defeat at Fulham\n\n'We have to have a clear position and I think it's the case here at Sunderland, we want to defend values and when someone, a group of people, want to threaten those values it's important to react.'\n\nMundle has joined Jocelin Ta Bi, Nordi Mukiele and Brian Brobbey on the sidelines, while Dennis Cirkin and Reinildo Mandava are progressing well after injury but Saturday's game against Bournemouth comes too soon.\n\nLe Bris said: 'About (Mundle's) injury, it might be a difficult injury and he might be sidelined for a few weeks or months. We still have further assessments to make but we'll have a clear picture soon.\n\n'Jocelin might be in the same position as Romaine with a different injury, he might need surgery so a couple of weeks or months, still a bit early as well.\n\n'It will be shorter for Nordi and Brian, between two or four weeks depending on the way they respond to treatments and rehab, so let's wait a bit, but it won't last too long.'\n\nEmery out to win at Wolves...at last\n\nUnai Emery has warned Aston Villa to avoid treating Wolves lightly due to his own poor record against the Premier League’s bottom club.\n\nEmery has never won at Molineux as manager of Arsenal or Villa, losing three of his four games there and drawing the other.\n\n‘We’ve been together three-and-a-half years, and we’ve drawn twice at Molineux and lost once,’ recalled Emery. ‘When I was at Arsenal, we were 3-0 down at half-time (before losing 3-1).\n\nUnai Emery has seen Villa drop off the title pace with just one win in four league games\n\n‘We beat them 1-0 earlier in the season and we didn’t deserve to win. They’ve lost some other games, against Chelsea and Bournemouth, where they haven’t deserved to lose. In their last home game, they drew with Arsenal, the best team in the Premier League and maybe the world.\n\n‘Everything we have analysed makes us feel it is not an easy game, and it’s also a derby. They will want to show what they can do in front of their own fans.’\n\nTom Collomosse\n\nHurzeler's birthday plans: pasta and Forest on TV\n\nBrighton boss Fabian Hurzeler plans to celebrate his 33rd birthday by watching weekend opponents Nottingham Forest over dinner.\n\nRelegation-threatened Forest host Turkish side Fenerbahce on Thursday in the second leg of their Europa League knockout phase play-off before travelling to the Amex Stadium for Sunday's Premier League clash.\n\nHurzeler was presented with a cake ahead of his pre-match press conference and will spend the evening dividing his attention between friends, family, food and Forest.\n\n'I think it will be: here's the iPad with the game and here's my pasta,' he said. 'That's how I expect the evening (to be), and sometimes conversation with others.\n\n'Definitely we will have a look at this game. Of course we already prepared for Nottingham but there are always new things you can see, you adapt.\n\n'It will definitely be a mix of having a good time, good dinner with my friends and family, but also watching a little bit of Nottingham Forest.'\n\nBrighton snapped a six-match winless run in the top flight by beating Brentford 2-0 last weekend to ease growing pressure on Hurzeler.\n\nSeagulls midfielder Yasin Ayari is pushing to feature against Forest following four games out with a dislocated shoulder."

            "content": "Ian Wright claims Tottenham stars have already 'CHECKED OUT' on new boss Igor Tudor despite club fearing tumultuous relegation battle\n\nIan Wright suggested that some of Tottenham's biggest stars are unwilling to give new interim manager Igor Tudor a chance, after Micky Van de Ven appeared to blank him during the north London derby.\n\nAppointed following the overdue sacking of Thomas Frank earlier this month, Tudor arrived with the challenging brief of ensuring that Spurs avoid relegation at the end of the season.\n\nThe Europa League champions currently sit 16th and only four points away from 18th-placed West Ham - and Tudor's arrival in the capital was made no easier by his first match in charge being the north London derby.\n\nAs Spurs fell 4-1 to Arsenal at home, Tudor was spotted apparently giving vocal instructions to Van de Ven from the sidelines, only for the defender to fail to acknowledge him.\n\nFor Wright, that the players were not eager to engage with their new head coach was a troubling sign.\n\n'Against Arsenal I saw Igor Tudor try to speak to Van de Ven, he blanked him, totally blanked him,' Wright said to his co-hosts on The Overlap's Stick To Football podcast.\n\nIgor Tudor appeared to be ignored by Micky Van de Ven just days into his tenure as Tottenham interim head coach\n\n'That says to me they have checked out already.'\n\nGary Neville thought that Wright's verdict was a 'harsh' one, while Roy Keane argued that the players 'did that with' Frank, but the Arsenal legend was in no mood to back down.\n\n'This guy is new, he wants him to come up and Van de Ven just looks at him and stays there,' Wright continued. 'You think to yourself, that doesn't look good. That does not look good'.\n\nFor his part, Tudor denied conflict between himself and Van de Ven on Thursday afternoon, sharing that he had been addressing the whole team.\n\n'If you watch carefully, I don't speak to him (in that moment),' Tudor said in his pre-Premier League weekend press conference. 'Afterwards, I said to him to come closer, and he comes closer.\n\n'We didn't talk about it because nothing happened. He's a fantastic professional and a fantastic guy, he would not do something like (ignoring me).'\n\nBelgium head coach Roberto Martinez stressed that whatever Tudor can do to ensure Spurs do not spend next season in the Championship, his first order of business should be 'accepting where they are' at this stage in the campaign.\n\n'When I was at Wigan you almost prepared for that last third of the season because that is your opportunity,' Martinez said. 'The last third for us was that we are going to get out of trouble.\n\n'The problem is when you are going into the last third hoping you are not going to get dragged down into a relegation battle because your club wasn't ready for that. This is where it becomes very very dangerous.\n\nThe stop-gap manager had a challenging task attempting to keep Spurs from the drop - and began his reign with a dismal north London derby\n\n'What happens now is that you should forget about these general terms that \"we shouldn't get dragged down\", what does this mean to a player (looking to hear) \"do I need to run more, less\".\n\n'It is basic language (you use to a player) about everything you can control, \"you have to do 12km, six sprints into the box and run to the near post\". Everything has to be so measurable. It is about winning the next game.'\n\nSpurs' torrid winter has been only exacerbated by a number of injuries to key players leaving their squad painfully short.\n\nBut Martinez was keen to warn that Spurs should not rely on waiting for stars to return to expect fortunes to change.\n\n'I think Spurs will get one or two players back from injury, you win a game and then you have got too much (of a gap),' he added.\n\n'The problem is there are no easy games in the Premier League. As a player at Spurs you might think there are easy games we can win, no - there are no easy games. It is about reducing that to, it is the next game and you have an opportunity to get points rather than if you don't win and you are out.\n\n'The moment that the club see it as \"wow, if we don't win...\" - the mindset is so negative and it drags you down. We have seen teams that are \"too good to go down\" go down because they weren't prepared for that final third of the season.'\n\n\n\nSpurs will stay in London for their next Premier League test, travelling to Craven Cottage to play Fulham on Sunday."

They are level on points with Auxerre who are 16th but are in the relegation zone due to a poorer goal difference by two goals. The bottom two teams will be relegated.\n\nPortuguese goalkeeper Anthony Lopes pretended to be injured during a Ligue 1 match so his Muslim teammates could break their fast during Ramadan.\n\n\n\nUnder the current rules of the Ligue de Football Professionnel and the French Football Federation (FFF), Ligue 1 matches are not… pic.twitter.com/F24kmHdCKu — The New Arab (@The_NewArab) February 25, 2026\n\nAnthony Lopes is reported to have faked an injury to allow his Nantes team-mates to break their Ramadan fast during their 2-0 win over Le Havre in Ligue 1 on Sunday\n\nIn 2021, an agreement was put in place to allow Muslim players to break their Ramadan fast during Premier League matches, once the sun has set.\n\nA year later the same approach was adopted by the Bundesliga.\n\nFootball clubs are also altering their training schedules to accommodate for Muslim stars who are observing Ramadan. Former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp did so during his successful tenure at Anfield.\n\n'It's not easy because playing and training and doing Ramadan is not easy at all,' former Anfield star Sadio Mane told beIN SPORTS in 2022.\n\n'But before Ramadan we tried to speak with the captain [Henderson] to tell the boss maybe can we change the schedule and train in the morning.\n\n'It's easier for us. If you train in the morning then you have time to rest and go home. If you train around two or three, it's gonna be tough!\n\n'The coach said yes and I think that makes it easier and we're trying to do our best.'\n\nWhen asked how Liverpool stars handle fasting on matchdays, Mane added: 'It's not easy, but like always the game day is something else!\n\n'With Ramadan it's tough but I think Liverpool, they try to make everything easier for us.\n\n'We speak with our nutritionist, Mona, and especially before the game day she did everything easier for us to make sure we can do our Ramadan.'\n\nRamadan began on February 17 and will run through until March 19. Because the holy month follows the moon cycle, it has to be confirmed each year, with the crescent moon spotted on the evening of February 17, officially beginning the holiday.\n\n\n\nOne of the five pillars of Islam is that during Ramadan, Muslims fast during daylight hours to show their devotion to their religion."

            "content": "Female footballer outraged after referee is given seven-month suspended prison sentence and fined £1,046 for secretly filming her young team-mates in dressing room\n\nA former SCR Altach women's football player has criticised a court's decision to deliver a man a seven-month suspended prison sentence and fine him £1,046 (€1,200) after he secretly photographed and filmed players in changing rooms and showers.\n\nThe man, who is a former top-level Swiss referee, was accused of secretly recording the young women using a concealed smartphone and through a keyhole during his time as an official at the Austrian football club.\n\nAround 30 players were identified on the recording and pictures. A report also stated that the youngest was born in 2007 and the oldest in 1995.\n\nThe man, who worked at the club between 2020 and 2025, was ordered to pay each victim £544 (€620).\n\nThe case is reported to have shaken football in Austria, with over 100 spectators attending the courtroom in Feldkirch, which is on the border with Switzerland. Although the defendant accepted the verdict, the public prosecutor is yet to decide whether she wants to apply for an appeal.\n\nEleni Rittmann, 25, who played for the top-flight Austrian team at the time, posted an outraged statement on social media.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nEleni Rittmann, 25, who played for the top-flight Austrian team at the time, posted an outraged statement on social media\n\n'This leaves me speechless,' Rittmann, who was not one of the players identified on the seized recordings, said.\n\n'The perpetrator was not only a top-level referee in Switzerland but also an official at Altach. And that is where he filmed players, including minors. I then ask myself, is this an appropriate punishment?\n\n'I also ask myself, does such a punishment act as a deterrent for others? We felt secure in our dressing room and this hurt our privacy so badly that some of us do not feel safe in public showers even now.\n\n'For me this is not a strong enough signal for something that is not tolerated in our society. The verdict is not final as the prosecutor has requested additional time to consider an appeal.'\n\nDuring the trial, a statement from the victims was read out, saying: 'We are young women, partly still young girls. What has happened has pulled the rug from under our feet. For years he told us that the dressing room was our home but this home was then destroyed by someone who we thought was part of this family.'\n\nA lawyer for the victims called the case a 'catastrophe for women's football'.\n\nAustrian sports minister Michaela Schmidt labelled the alleged crimes 'disgusting' in October when they were first reported. 'If female athletes are not even safe in their own dressing rooms because of an official then they have nothing to stand on,' Schmidt said.\n\nAt the beginning of the question the defendant said: 'I plead partially guilty.'\n\nIt remains unclear whether the images were disseminated. The defence lawyer said it had been established that the photos and videos had not been transferred to a third party and they now will be destroyed.\n\nIn his final words, the defendant addressed the victims to apologise. He said: 'I agree with the statements made by my lawyer, but I would still like to express my sympathy to all those affected and apologise for my actions.'\n\nThe court mitigated the sentence by taking into account his partial confession and his lack of previous convictions.\n\n\n\nDaily Mail Sport have contacted SCR Altach and the Austrian FA for comment."

However, reports in Austrian publication Salzburger Nachrichten claim that the German is seeking pastures new with the quartet of clubs having achieved little success since his arrival.\n\nThey add that things are particularly rife at RB Leipzig, with the club currently fifth in the Bundesliga and in a four-team tussle to secure one of the likely two qualification spots for the Champions League next season.\n\nSalzburger Nachrichten conclude that Red Bull would not stand in Klopp's way should he wish to return to coaching in the summer - with outgoing Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner already lined up as his replacement. Glasner has previously worked at RB Salzburg as an assistant manager between 2012-14.\n\nWhen asked about that report on Thursday, Red Bull CEO Oliver Mintzlaff shut it down and branded it as 'complete nonsense'.\n\nJurgen Klopp will not be leaving Red Bull to make a return to management, insists their CEO\n\nRed Bull CEO Oliver Mintzlaff (left) has rubbished an Austrian report that Klopp will leave\n\n'That is complete nonsense and entirely fabricated,' Mintzlaff was quoted as saying by a number of outlets,' he told Sky Sports Germany.\n\n'On the contrary: we are extremely satisfied with Jurgen Klopp's work. He invests a great deal of effort, is in constant communication with our coaches and sporting directors, and is sustainably developing our Red Bull football philosophy.\n\n'We are convinced that he is the right man for this job. That is where we are placing all of our focus and energy.'\n\nKlopp has not been in a managerial dugout since leaving Liverpool at the end of the 2023-24 season, citing that he needed to take a break. He has since been linked with a number of jobs this coming summer, including Real Madrid.\n\nSpeaking last week, Klopp's agent revealed that he was approached by Manchester United and Chelsea as well as by England the USA to become their manager once he left the Reds.\n\n'Before joining Red Bull, Jurgen could have coached the USA or England,' said Klopp's long-term representative Marc Kosicke in an interview with German website Transfermarkt.\n\n'Probably also Germany, if Julian Nagelsmann hadn't already been there.\n\n'Even Chelsea and Manchester United inquired, although Jurgen had clearly stated that he would not coach any other club in England. These enquiries keep coming.\n\n'He's extremely happy with what he's achieved. And it's still wonderful to go down in history as one of the few coaches who only managed three clubs and were never fired.'\n\n\n\nWhen approached for comment, both Chelsea and Manchester United denied the agent's claims."

            "content": "Conor Benn to face former world champion on same card as Tyson Fury's return to boxing - as first bout since Eddie Hearn split is revealed\n\nConor Benn is set for a return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after agreeing to share top billing with Tyson Fury and Arslan Makhmudov and fight Regis Prograis in his first outing for new promotion Zuffa Boxing.\n\nThe British fighter announced his split with long-time promoter Eddie Hearn last week after 10 years of working together, with Benn instead joining Hearn's rival Dana White's fledgling company in an eight-figure deal.\n\nHearn revealed that he was 'devastated' by the defection, not least because he stood by the boxing dynasty scion throughout his ordeal over two failed drug tests in 2022.\n\nBenn previously fought in north London when he faced off with Chris Eubank Jr last year, with the fighter gaining his revenge after first being defeated by Eubank Jr in their initial meeting at the stadium.\n\nHis match-up with US light welterweight Prograis is set to take place on Saturday April 11, with their main event coming ahead of Fury's return to the ring after his retirement last year.\n\nThe evening is also set to be Netflix's first-ever live broadcast, following a number of events shown from the United States - including Anthony Joshua's meeting with Jake Paul last December - by the streaming giant.\n\nConor Benn will fight Regis Prograis on April 11 on the same card as the returning Tyson Fury\n\nFormer world champion Prograis last faced off with Jack Catterall on British soil at the Co-op Live in October 2024, with the Louisiana native losing to the Englishman by unanimous decision.\n\nBenn's decision to desert Hearn cast ripples through the boxing world, with Frank Warren sharing his comment in the form of a quote first made by former US President Harry S. Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

The Premier League returns to Belfast on Thursday night, with the teenage sensation looking to bounce back from a sluggish start that has left him sixth in the table after three nights.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt was in Belfast where Littler received a telling-off last year for his poor timekeeping, which resulted in him turning up late for media commitments and leaving the seven other competitors waiting. That didn't sit well with seven-time Premier League winner Van Gerwen, who urged the youngster to show greater professionalism and insisted he shouldn't be wrapped in cotton wool.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Green Machine fumed: \"They need to stop treating him like a baby. He's not a baby any more, he's 18 years old now. It happens. He has to learn.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"You have to learn the hard way. It's a professional sport, so you have to be responsible for your actions.

Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\nLittler also drew the ire of darts legend Priestley, who suggested the youngster deserved a financial penalty for his tardiness. The two-time world champion told The Sun: \"Luke Littler should've been fined for turning up late and that would be the right thing to do, it's a learning experience for him, the fine should be automatic.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMichael van Gerwen gives health update after Premier League absence READ MORE :\n\n\"If you are late to your own event, that is one thing. But when there are seven other players as well as staff and media there that have all made the effort, it isn't good enough, no matter what your age is.\n\n\"Michael van Gerwen is right to complain. I just hope he took Littler to one side and did things properly and calmly, as well as speaking to the media.\"\n\nView 3 Images Michael van Gerwen didn't hold back over Littler's lateness (Image: Getty)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLittler later confessed to nodding off before the engagement and disclosed that Van Gerwen had labelled him \"lazy.\" In a display of maturity, he accepted that MVG and other players were justified in their annoyance.\n\nHe told Sky Sports: \"I always let my darts do the talking but he (Van Gerwen) is not wrong.

He squares off against league leader Clayton once more in Belfast, this time in the quarter-finals.\n\nHome hero Josh Rock, still looking for his first Premier League victory of the season, faces World Championship runner-up Gian van Veen.

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nFor a team with the cachet of Duke, it's a testament to the strength of this season's contenders that it took this long for the Blue Devils to rise to No. 1 in the AP poll and these Power Rankings.\n\nBut there was zero debate about their ascension this week, particularly after they looked so impressive in their win over Michigan in Washington D.C. on Saturday night. They looked every bit like the nation's best defensive team, keeping the Wolverines off the offensive glass and out of transition. And while the Blue Devils don't look as explosive on the offensive end as some of the other top teams, they sandwiched that Michigan win with two games against Syracuse and Notre Dame in which they scored 201 total points.\n\n(Of course, it helps that they have National Player of the Year favorite Cameron Boozer leading the way.)\n\nThe question now becomes: Can any team pass Duke -- or do the Blue Devils have the inside track to the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament?\n\nThey have three games to go: vs. Virginia, at NC State and vs. North Carolina. Three top-30-caliber opponents; three chances to improve their 1-seed profile. They are first in the NET, third in average résumé metrics and second in average predictive metrics. And they are tied with Arizona with 12 Quadrant 1 wins.\n\nThe Blue Devils would have to lose in order to lose their position, and with less than three weeks until Selection Sunday, they have the edge moving forward.\n\nPrevious ranking: 2\n\nJon Scheyer isn't getting enough credit for the coaching job he's done this season, with limited buzz for National Coach of the Year honors. Sure, it's Duke, and he has the best player in the country headlining the No. 1 recruiting class. But the Blue Devils are the No. 1 team with just two losses all season, with both coming in the final seconds. They were picked outside the top five in the preseason. They aren't nearly as talented as last year's roster yet are on track to be the No. 1 overall seed on Selection Sunday -- something last year's team didn't accomplish.\n\nScheyer also became the first head coach in ACC history with multiple 40-point road wins against ACC opponents when Duke beat Notre Dame by 44 on Tuesday.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Virginia (Feb. 28), at NC State (March 2)\n\nPrevious ranking: 3\n\nJaden Bradley and Brayden Burries might not put up the stats of some of the other elite guards around the country, but there are very few players Tommy Lloyd would rather have late in games than the two backcourt stars. Bradley is one of the most clutch players in the country, while Burries' late-game performance against Baylor was one of the more impressive stretches we've seen from any freshman guard this season. The two players combined for 26 points and seven assists in the second half against the Bears, finishing with 49 points and 10 assists. That came after Bradley went for 17 points against Houston and Burries hit a slew of clutch free throws.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Kansas (Feb. 28), vs. Iowa State (March 2)\n\nplay 1:17 Arizona Wildcats vs. Baylor Bears: Game Highlights Arizona Wildcats vs. Baylor Bears: Game Highlights\n\nPrevious ranking: 1\n\nWhile most of the focus has been on the frontcourt, the Wolverines' guards are starting to look like the catalyst for their success moving forward. Take the past three games, for example. Against Purdue, Elliot Cadeau, Trey McKenney and L.J. Cason combined for 43 points and seven 3s. Against Duke, the three guards totaled only 17 points and two 3-pointers. And against Minnesota on Tuesday, the trio went for 41 points and 11 3-pointers. It's easy to deduce which game Michigan lost of those three. Dusty May needs his guards to play well -- and make shots.\n\nNext seven days: at Illinois (Feb. 27)\n\nPrevious ranking: 6\n\nIf UConn's uneven performances during most of Big East play -- close wins over inferior teams, a home loss to Creighton -- had anyone questioning the Huskies' national championship credentials, those concerns were likely assuaged Wednesday. They had an all-time dominant performance against St. John's, beating the Red Storm by 32 in the biggest victory in series history. It also came on the heels of a double-digit win at Villanova over the weekend.\n\nTarris Reed Jr. was the best player on the floor in both games, particularly against St. John's, finishing with 20 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, six blocks and two steals. According to ESPN Research, he became just the third UConn player in the past 30 seasons to post over 20 points, 10-plus rebounds and five-plus blocks against a ranked opponent.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Seton Hall (Feb. 28)\n\nPrevious ranking: 4\n\nWhile Killyan Toure has emerged as the breakout freshman for the Cyclones, TJ Otzelberger is beginning to get consistent production from another first-year player. Jamarion Batemon was generating significant buzz in the offseason, but his role fluctuated during the first couple months of the season. Over the past four games, though, he has hit double figures three times while making multiple 3-pointers in three of the games. He had 11 points and three 3s against Kansas, 14 points in a loss to BYU and 13 points in Tuesday's win over Utah.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Texas Tech (Feb. 28), at Arizona (March 2)\n\nPrevious ranking: 8\n\nFlorida's winning streak was at risk in Austin on Wednesday, with Texas taking a three-point lead with 7:27 remaining -- but the Longhorns didn't make another shot.\n\nAlex Condon again led the way for the Gators: He finished with 23 points, four rebounds, three assists and four blocks, going 10-for-12 from the field. That performance came after going for 24 points, four rebounds and six assists on 9-for-13 shooting in a win over Ole Miss over the weekend. That followed a 20-point, 10-rebound effort against South Carolina last week. Before this three-game stretch, Condon had scored 20 points just four times all season.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Arkansas (Feb. 28), vs. Mississippi State (March 3)\n\nplay 1:19 Florida Gators vs. Texas Longhorns: Game Highlights Florida Gators vs. Texas Longhorns: Game Highlights\n\nPrevious ranking: 9\n\nWhile Purdue's loss to Michigan came in its highest profile game of the month, impacting perceptions of the Boilermakers' ceiling, the team is playing some of its best offensive basketball over the past couple weeks. On Feb. 1, the Boilermakers scored 1.45 points per possession against Maryland. On Feb. 14, they scored 1.35 points per possession against Iowa. And on Friday against Indiana, they scored 1.47 points per possession. Against the Hoosiers, Purdue shot 70% on 2s, 56% on 3s and had 24 assists on 33 made shots. It was remarkably efficient offense.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Michigan State (Feb. 26), at Ohio State (March 1), at Northwestern (March 4)\n\nPrevious ranking: 5\n\nHouston is in the midst of its first three-game losing streak in nine seasons, and while its defense -- specifically its inability to force turnovers against Iowa State and Arizona -- is partially to blame, the Cougars' shotmakers are becoming an issue. Since the Cougars don't have a reliable inside scorer in the mold of what J'Wan Roberts had been for the previous three seasons, there's more pressure on Kingston Flemings, Emanuel Sharp and Milos Uzan to carry the offense. Flemings is shooting just 34.7% over his past five games; Sharp is shooting 21.9% during the losing streak; and Uzan is averaging 9.3 points on 38.5% in his past six games.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Colorado (Feb. 28), vs. Baylor (March 4)\n\nPrevious ranking: 7\n\nIllinois has lost three of its past five games, with all three coming in overtime. Only one of the Illini's six losses this season has come by more than four points. The problem hasn't been their offense; it's a defense that allowed at least 1.19 points per possession in each of their three losses this month. Over that recent five-game stretch, their defense is ranked No. 60 in adjusted efficiency at advanced analytics site BartTorvik, with teams shooting better than 36% from 3 over that span. In their six losses, opponents have made an average of 11.5 3s.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Michigan (Feb. 27), vs. Oregon (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 10\n\nIt's not often a team has a 29-point swing in back-to-back games against Cincinnati and Houston, but that's what Kansas did over the past week. The Jayhawks were steamrolled by the Bearcats in the second half on Saturday but turned around to hand Houston its third straight loss on Monday. Kansas' defense was fantastic against Houston, holding it to 0.86 points per possession and limiting it to 5-for-24 shooting from the perimeter. In the Jayhawks' seven losses, their defense is ranked No. 208 nationally at CBB Analytics, shooting nearly 57% from inside the arc.\n\nNext seven days: at Arizona (Feb. 28), at Arizona State (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 11\n\nSince returning from a three-game absence due to an ankle injury, Graham Ike has been playing some of the best basketball of his college career. In his eight games since returning, Ike is averaging 23.9 points and 7.6 rebounds while shooting 58.5% from the field and 37.9% from 3-point range. He made three 3-pointers twice during that span, which is notable given he made six total 3s in his first 78 college games. The Zags also avenged their lone WCC loss this season with a 41-point win over Portland on Wednesday, when Ike had 19 points, eight boards and a career-high seven steals.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Portland (Feb. 25), at Saint Mary's (Feb. 28)\n\nPrevious ranking: 13\n\nNebraska has righted the ship over the past two games, beating Penn State and Maryland after losing four of its previous six. There are a couple headlines for the recent stretch. One, the Cornhuskers have tightened things defensively. They allowed at least 1.05 points per possession three times in a four-game stretch between Jan. 27 and Feb. 10. They haven't allowed any opponent to score more than 0.96 since then, with their past four opponents averaging 57.8 points. The other is Pryce Sandfort, who had 33 points against Penn State and is averaging 20.8 points and shooting 42.4% from 3 in his past 12 games.\n\nNext seven days: at USC (Feb. 28), at UCLA (March 3)\n\nplay 0:13 Pryce Sandfort drops in the smooth basket Pryce Sandfort drops in the smooth basket.\n\nPrevious ranking: 12\n\nMichigan State has bounced back after a 1-3 stretch between the end of January and early February, blowing out UCLA and then coming back down the stretch to beat Ohio State on Sunday. Carson Cooper's return to form could be key for Tom Izzo. After failing to score in double figures in any of the aforementioned four-game stretch, Cooper had 12 points and seven boards against UCLA before finishing with a season-high 20 points and 11 rebounds on 7-for-10 shooting in the win over Ohio State. He is averaging 11.1 points in Michigan State's wins this season, compared to just 6.8 in its losses.\n\nNext seven days: at Purdue (Feb. 26), at Indiana (March 1)\n\nPrevious ranking: 14\n\nTexas Tech had its first two full games without JT Toppin this week, and the Red Raiders dispatched Kansas State and Cincinnati with relative ease. While Christian Anderson was already one of the highest-usage guards in the country before Toppin's injury, Tech is going to go as far as its All-American point guard can carry it. In the two games since Toppin's injury, Anderson is averaging 26.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 8.5 assists, while shooting 59.3% from the field and 42.9% from 3. A date with Iowa State's elite perimeter defenders is up next.\n\nNext seven days: at Iowa State (Feb. 28), vs. TCU (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 15\n\nVirginia has a chance to move into first place in the ACC and gain the inside track to a conference regular-season title with a win at Duke on Saturday at noon. The Cavaliers, picked fifth in the league's preseason poll, won their ninth game in a row Tuesday with a 29-point blowout of NC State. Ryan Odom will need Jacari White to continue his hot perimeter shooting against the Blue Devils. After not scoring in double figures since mid-December, White has hit that threshold three times in the past five games, including 15 points against the Wolfpack. He's now shooting 57.1% from 3 over his past five games.\n\nNext seven days: at Duke (Feb. 28), vs. Wake Forest (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 17\n\nNate Oats' team is starting to hit its stride, winning seven games in a row while scoring at least 89 points in each and reaching the 100-point mark in three of them. The schedule stiffens to end the season, with road games at Tennessee and Georgia followed by a rivalry game against Auburn in the finale. The Tide made 16 3-pointers in the first half of Wednesday's win against Mississippi State, scoring 63 points before halftime -- and they did it without Labaron Philon Jr. Freshman Amari Allen had the best offensive game of his career, finishing with 23 points and going 6-for-7 from 3.\n\nNext seven days: at Tennessee (Feb. 28), at Georgia (March 3)\n\nplay 1:17 Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Alabama Crimson Tide: Game Highlights Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Alabama Crimson Tide: Game Highlights\n\nPrevious ranking: 18\n\nBilly Richmond has been one of the biggest late-season breakout stars of the 2025-26 campaign. He had a couple of spot starts in November and January but had otherwise been exclusively a bench player for the first season and a half of his career. John Calipari thrust Richmond into the starting lineup when Karter Knox suffered an injury, and he has emerged as the team's most reliable scorer not named Darius Acuff Jr. Richmond has scored at least 20 points in four straight games, doing almost all of his damage in transition and inside the arc. He's averaging 22.3 points and 3.3 assists over that span, while also logging eight steals and five blocks. With Acuff struggling for the early part of Wednesday's win over Texas A&M, Richmond stepped up with 23 points on 13 shots.\n\nNext seven days: at Florida (Feb. 28), vs. Texas (March 4)\n\nPrevious ranking: 20\n\nA road win at Vanderbilt on Saturday vaulted the Vols over the Commodores in the rankings, but Tennessee followed it with a four-point road loss at Missouri. One thing to monitor is the performance of the Vols' top three scorers. Ja'Kobi Gillespie and Nate Ament struggled in the second half of the loss to Mizzou, combining to shoot 5-for-19 from the field and 1-for-7 from 3. Ament is 8-for-27 in his past two games. Then there's J.P. Estrella, who missed two games with a foot injury but returned against Mizzou to play only six minutes. Rick Barnes hopes Estrella returns to full strength soon.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Alabama (Feb. 28), at South Carolina (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 19\n\nVanderbilt snapped its two-game losing streak with a win over Georgia on Wednesday, but the most positive development of the past week for the Commodores is arguably the return of Duke Miles. The senior guard had missed seven straight games after undergoing knee surgery but returned against Tennessee over the weekend. He has come off the bench in each of his two games back, but still totaled 27 points, eight rebounds, eight assists, four steals and zero turnovers. He also shot 5-for-11 from 3 in the two games.\n\nNext seven days: at Kentucky (Feb. 28), at Ole Miss (March 3)\n\nMen's Tournament Challenge Sign up now to play the #1 Men's bracket game for FREE! $125,000 in prizes.\n\nPlay Men's Tournament Challenge\n\nPrevious ranking: 21\n\nCarolina is 3-1 without Caleb Wilson, with back-to-back wins since getting Henri Veesaar back from his two-game absence. While the return of Veesaar -- and the 30-point performance from Seth Trimble against Louisville -- have been the headliners, it's worth highlighting how productive Zayden High has been since Wilson got hurt. High was barely part of the rotation for the first 24 games, seeing double-figure minutes just twice, and that was in early November. But in his past four games, High is averaging 10.3 points and 8.5 rebounds, bringing an edge the Tar Heels have lacked at times.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Virginia Tech (Feb. 28), vs. Clemson (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 16\n\nThe Red Storm's defeat at UConn on Wednesday was as eye-opening a loss as any team in college basketball has suffered this season. It wasn't just the final 32-point margin -- although it was Rick Pitino's second-largest loss as the coach of a ranked team. It was the way it happened. The Red Storm were awful offensively. They shot 2-for-28 from the field in the second half. Their final basket came with 17:28 remaining, missing their last 24 shots from the field. According to ESPN Research, the 24 straight misses was the longest game-ending streak by a Division I team in at least the past eight seasons.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Villanova (Feb. 28), vs. Georgetown (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 22\n\nLouisville is likely to end the regular season without beating a ranked opponent. The Cardinals' best wins have come at home against NC State, SMU and Kentucky, plus a neutral site win over Indiana. They have six Quadrant 1 wins, but they're 0-6 in Quadrant 1A contests. In those Quadrant 1A games, Louisville is No. 62 in the country in adjusted efficiency margin at BartTorvik. Two big statistical gaps stand out when comparing wins and losses. In wins, the Cardinals shoot 39.3% from 3 and just 28.8% in losses. They also attempt more than 23 free throws per game in wins and fewer than 16 in losses.\n\nNext seven days: at Clemson (Feb. 28), vs. Syracuse (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: Not ranked\n\nThree days after BYU's biggest win of the season -- a 10-point victory over Iowa State -- the Cougars suffered a surprising 13-point loss at home to UCF, in a game they trailed by as many as 36 points in the second half. From a body-of-work résumé perspective, BYU still has the profile of a 6-seed or a Top 25 team. The Cougars are top 25 in six of seven team sheet metrics, with 12 wins over Quadrant 1 and 2 opponents. The marquee win over Iowa State adds serious heft to a group of wins that already included Villanova, Wisconsin, Miami and Clemson. But they're 3-6 in their past nine games and a 1-2 record without Richie Saunders (including a blowout home loss to UCF) leaves them at risk of tumbling further.\n\nNext seven days: at West Virginia (Feb. 28), at Cincinnati (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: Not ranked\n\nIt's fitting Saint Mary's finds its way into the rankings just before the final Gonzaga-Saint Mary's matchup as conference foes (the Zags leave the WCC for the Pac-12 this summer). The Gaels could still earn a share of the regular-season title with a win Saturday, which would be their fourth WCC title in a row. They've also beaten Gonzaga at least once in each of the past four seasons -- though they lost the first game this season, 73-65. Saint Mary's enters the weekend with momentum, winner of seven in a row after Wednesday's 19-point victory over Santa Clara. Mikey Lewis has been playing his best basketball since the opening weeks, averaging 16.2 points over his last six games.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Gonzaga (Feb. 28)\n\nPrevious ranking: 25\n\nAfter that stretch of games in the middle of conference play when the RedHawks were barely escaping with wins, they're leaving absolutely zero doubt over the past several games. They've won their past five games by an average of 13 points, leading by at least 20 points in four of those five games. Forward Almar Atlason, an Iceland native and one of the best reserves in the MAC, might be returning to his early-season form, too. Atlason hit double figures in 10 of his first 13 games this season, then did it just once over his next 10. But he's hit that mark in four of his past five games, giving Travis Steele another player who can stretch it from beyond the arc.\n\nNext seven days: at Western Michigan (Feb. 27), vs. Toledo (March 3)\n\nDropped out: Saint Louis Billikens (No. 23), Utah State Aggies (No. 24)"

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe 2026 men's NCAA tournament is rapidly approaching, which means the question top of mind for many fans is: Will your team be in or out? Teams have roughly three weeks until Selection Sunday to strengthen their cases. Until then, we're here to track how each team on the \"bubble\" of the bracket is trending.\n\nWe'll use a variety of metrics as guides, classifying teams based on how likely they are to make the field of 68 as one of the 37 at-large selections -- conditional on not winning their respective conference tournaments for one of the 31 automatic qualifying bids (AQs). To that end, we'll use Joe Lunardi's Bracketology projections and a combination of data sources -- including my forecast-model consensus and NCAA résumé metrics such as NET rankings that the selection committee will evaluate -- to judge a team's underlying potential. (For a full glossary of terms and sources, click here or scroll to the bottom of this story.)\n\nWe'll sort teams in at-large contention into the following categories:\n\nLocks: Teams that have nearly a 100% chance to be called by the committee as an at-large selection (if necessary). They would need a significant change in momentum to miss the cut. 27 current teams\n\nShould be in: Teams tracking safely above the cutline (generally 75% consensus at-large odds or better), but not immune to trouble. Most likely, these teams should hear their names called on March 15, though their fates are not yet assured. 12 current teams\n\nWork to do: Teams whose upcoming results will meaningfully change their fate (for good or bad). These are the truest \"on the bubble\" teams, because their chances are closest to a coin flip, though their consensus at-large odds may be as low as 10%. 16 current teams\n\nTeams beyond these categories would need to outperform expectations or benefit from chaos. There is little -- though not zero -- chance any team not listed here will make the Big Dance without winning its conference tournament.\n\nNow let's go conference by conference -- in order of which project to have the most NCAA tournament bids -- to rank the teams in each category based on their chances to secure an at-large bid.\n\nNote: All times Eastern.\n\nJump to a conference:\n\nSEC | Big Ten | ACC\n\nBig 12 | Big East\n\nMid-majors\n\nSEC\n\n9.9 expected bids (8.9 at-large)\n\nLocks (5)\n\nFlorida Gators\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide\n\nVanderbilt Commodores\n\nArkansas Razorbacks\n\nTennessee Volunteers\n\nShould be in (4)\n\nKentucky Wildcats\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 9:22 p.m.\n\nThree consecutive losses -- to Florida, Georgia and Auburn -- meant we had to downgrade Kentucky from a \"lock\" recently, but the Wildcats got back to business with a win at South Carolina on Tuesday. Their résumé features five Quadrant 1 wins, enough to rank around the top 30 nationally in our résumé average, and is still comfortably sixth best in the SEC, which projects to send as many as 11 teams in the latest Bracketology. Even with 10 losses, it helps that seven came to Quadrant 1A foes. A bigger concern is that they still have one of the nation's toughest remaining schedules, with all three games against Quadrant 1 foes (including a Quadrant 1A in Florida).\n\nNext game: vs. Vanderbilt (Saturday)\n\nGeorgia Bulldogs\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 9:10 p.m.\n\nComing off résumé-boosting wins over Kentucky and Texas, Georgia fell short in a comeback bid for another after falling behind big early at Vanderbilt on Wednesday. It has been a roller-coaster season for the Dawgs: After winning 16 of their first 19 games, they lost five of their next six and fell from a 97% to 66% consensus at-large chance in the span of three weeks -- but those chances are back up around 90% despite the loss to the Commodores. Georgia sits mid-30s in the overall résumé rankings, with four wins against Quadrant 1 foes, and ranks seventh in résumé average within what should be at least a 10-bid SEC. Toward the end of a challenging stretch of games, the Dawgs have the conference's easiest remaining schedule according to the BPI, so they should pick up a couple of additional wins.\n\nNext game: vs. South Carolina (Saturday)\n\nMissouri Tigers\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 7:41 a.m.\n\nComing off Saturday's loss at Arkansas -- their second in three games -- the Tigers needed a win to stabilize their at-large chances, and they got it hosting Tennessee on Tuesday. They still rank just 11th among SEC teams in the résumé average (borderline mid-40s nationally), a scary spot to be in with the conference projected for 10-11 tournament entries. They have five Quadrant 1 wins, though, and in many ways are the anti-Auburn in terms of what the committee might value more: They have a much better record (19-9 vs. 15-13) against a much easier schedule (63rd hardest vs. fourth). After Tuesday night, the at-large forecast models now favor Mizzou (78%) over Auburn (58%), which is why Dennis Gates' team now sits here -- with a much easier case to argue for itself from a W-L perspective.\n\nNext game: at Mississippi State (Saturday)\n\nTexas A&M Aggies\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 11:17 p.m.\n\nThe Aggies recently found themselves downgraded from \"should be in\" to \"work to do,\" but a remarkable comeback against Ole Miss followed by a solid victory at Oklahoma helped their tournament hopes. With Wednesday's one-sided loss at Arkansas, though, their consensus at-large chances stay in the mid-70% range. They rank ninth in the résumé average out of what's looking like a 10- to 11-bid SEC, so they are on the right side of the bubble, but Bucky McMillan's squad probably needs to bolster their case against Texas, Kentucky and/or LSU to close the regular season.\n\nNext game: vs. Texas (Saturday)\n\nWork to do (2)\n\nTexas Longhorns\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 9:12 p.m.\n\nLeading Florida by three points with 7:27 to play Wednesday, Texas was outscored 23-7 down the stretch for its second consecutive loss. The Longhorns' five-game winning streak is disappearing in the rearview mirror, with the consensus forecast now setting their at-large chances in the at 63% -- up from 45% earlier in the month but down from 81% a week ago. They still have more Quadrant 1 wins than Texas A&M, but they're also neck and neck with Missouri for 10th among SEC teams in the résumé rankings (mid-40s nationally). Even after losing to Georgia and Florida, two of their final three regular-season contests are against Quad 1 opponents, so their tournament fate still hangs in the balance.\n\nNext game: at Texas A&M (Saturday)\n\nAuburn Tigers\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 7:41 a.m.\n\nThe Tigers stopped their five-game losing streak with Saturday's dramatic victory over Kentucky, but the relief turned out to be only temporary -- they lost again at Oklahoma on Tuesday to cast more doubt on their tournament outlook. They still have a fascinating case: Although all but one of their recent losses came against Quadrant 1 opponents, they have five Quadrant 1 wins against the nation's fourth-most difficult schedule per the BPI and remain top 40 in the national résumé ranking average. But those mounting losses do matter, and teams most similar to Auburn have tended to miss out on an at-large bid more often than not. Whatever happens, they will be an interesting litmus test for what the committee values.\n\nNext game: vs. Mississippi (Saturday)\n\nBIG TEN\n\n9.2 expected bids; 8.2 at-large\n\nLocks (6)\n\nMichigan Wolverines\n\nPurdue Boilermakers\n\nIllinois Fighting Illini\n\nNebraska Cornhuskers\n\nMichigan State Spartans\n\nWisconsin Badgers\n\nShould be in (2)\n\nIowa Hawkeyes\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 11:15 p.m.\n\nAfter a stretch of three losses in four games, Iowa rebounded with a big statement win while hosting Ohio State on Wednesday. Now the Hawkeyes' at-large chances sit around 98%, a strong position to be in. Their résumé still sits in the low-30s nationally -- in addition to being top 25 in our average of predictive ratings -- so their tournament hopes are in good shape. Their remaining schedule won't be easy; after Saturday's trip to Penn State, they close out the regular season against Michigan and Nebraska. But they shouldn't need either of those upsets to round out their résumé.\n\nNext game: at Penn State (Saturday)\n\nUCLA Bruins\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 7:53 a.m.\n\nAfter consecutive losses on their Michigan tour halted their momentum -- five wins in six games -- the Bruins have bounced back. On Saturday, they beat visiting No. 10 Illinois in overtime on Donovan Dent's coast-to-coast layup, then took down crosstown bubble rival USC by 19 behind Dent's 30 points on Tuesday. They now have three Quadrant 1 wins on the season (two Q1-A) and their résumé ranks borderline top 40 nationally, converging with a predictive rating that has been better than their résumé indicated for most of the year. Even if the Big Ten gets only nine bids, the Bruins would appear to be in line for one of the last of those -- they rank eighth on the conference's résumé list -- and their consensus at-large odds are now 91% in the forecast models.\n\nNext game: at Minnesota (Saturday)\n\nWork to do (3)\n\nIndiana Hoosiers\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 9:10 p.m.\n\nAfter a run of five wins in six games, Indiana has now lost three straight to Illinois, Purdue and Northwestern, shaving the Hoosiers' conditional at-large probability down to the 60% range. Their portfolio can stand up next to other bubble teams -- they rank mid-40s in the national résumé average, no worse than 10th among the Big Ten in what's looking like a nine-bid conference -- and they remain among the top 40 in the predictive metrics. But they just lost their most winnable remaining game to Northwestern and are likely to enter the Big Ten tournament in limbo.\n\nNext game: vs. Michigan State (Sunday)\n\nOhio State Buckeyes\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 11:15 p.m.\n\nWhen we noted that the Buckeyes needed more consistency after alternating wins and losses for so long, they were looking for a winning streak -- not the back-to-back losses they got against Michigan State and Iowa this week. Their at-large chances now sit in the high-50% range, casting doubt on a tournament profile that seemed much stronger not long ago. Ohio State is a better team than its current résumé indicates, ranking inside the top 40 of the predictive ratings. But the Buckeyes have been unable to escape the bubble for very long, ranking in the mid-40s in the résumé rankings -- right on the cutline both nationally and for a projected nine- or 10-bid Big Ten. After the Iowa loss, they are now 1-10 against Quadrant 1 opponents and 0-9 vs. Q1-A specifically. Remaining games against Purdue and Indiana loom large.\n\nNext game: vs. Purdue (Sunday)\n\nUSC Trojans\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 7:53 a.m.\n\nA recent three-game win streak had helped pad USC's bubble case, but losses to Ohio State, Illinois, Oregon and now bubble rival UCLA -- the latter of which saw the Bruins open up a lead near the half and pull away down the stretch -- have sliced the Trojans' at-large chances to just 20%. With the 11th-best résumé ranking in what's trending to be just a nine-bid conference, and a ranking outside the top 50 of the predictive ratings, USC needs strong showings against Nebraska, Washington and UCLA again to make a case as one of the Big Ten's last entries.\n\nNext game: vs. Nebraska (Saturday)\n\nACC\n\n8.1 expected bids; 7.1 at-large\n\nLocks (5)\n\nDuke Blue Devils\n\nVirginia Cavaliers\n\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels\n\nLouisville Cardinals\n\nNC State Wolfpack\n\nShould be in (3)\n\nSMU Mustangs\n\nUpdated: Feb. 26, 8:06 a.m.\n\nThe Mustangs improved their projections last week with back-to-back wins over Louisville and Boston College, but Wednesday's loss at California slowed that momentum a bit. They have been neck and neck with Miami (and now Clemson) recently, fighting to be sixth (as opposed to eighth) in what could be an eight-bid ACC. Now SMU's consensus at-large chances are 89% -- narrowly ahead of the Hurricanes and Tigers at 87% each -- though all three teams are well clear of Cal (35%) and Virginia Tech (26%), who stand as its closest bubble rivals within the conference. The Mustangs do have the most challenging schedule of the three, with trips to Stanford and FSU sandwiched around a head-to-head against Miami.\n\nNext game: at Stanford (Saturday)\n\nMiami Hurricanes\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 11:18 p.m.\n\nThe Hurricanes have been on a roll in ACC play lately, adding to their recent résumé-boosting victories over North Carolina, NC State and Virginia Tech with another Quadrant 1 win over Florida State on Tuesday. Their at-large chances are now above those of Clemson and not far from SMU's, though all three teams are bunched closely together in the mid-30s of the national résumé quality ranking -- the trio makes up Nos. 6-8 in the ACC in that regard, with a big gap over the rest of what projects to be non-tournament teams in an eight-bid conference. The BPI has Miami projected to win nearly 24 games now, so the Canes are in good shape.\n\nNext game: vs. Boston College (Saturday)\n\nClemson Tigers\n\nUpdated: Feb. 22, 7:53 a.m.\n\nClemson has gotten ice-cold at the wrong time. The Tigers had been an ACC \"lock\" since Bubble Watch launched on Feb. 3, with a 97% or higher at-large probability in the forecast every day for the past three weeks -- until Saturday. They fell below that threshold with their fourth loss in a row, this time to Quadrant 3 Florida State. They still rank in the low-to-mid 30s nationally on résumé (no worse than eighth in the ACC) and their consensus chances are still around 90% despite the slump. But they have been downgraded as a result, trending lower in the conference's pecking order according to the odds.\n\nNext game: at Virginia (Tuesday)\n\nWork to do (2)\n\nCalifornia Golden Bears\n\nUpdated: Feb. 26, 8:26 a.m.\n\nCal's tourney chances remain somewhat distant, but victories over Boston College, Stanford and, most importantly, SMU on Wednesday have the Golden Bears moving in the right direction. They still sit outside the nation's top-50 on the résumé ranking, but they also have five Quadrant 1 wins and face the ACC's easiest remaining schedule. That doesn't leave many more signature-win chances, aside from a Quadrant 1 visit to Wake Forest in the finale. With a consensus at-large probability of 35%, the Bears have to bolster their case further.\n\nNext game: vs. Pittsburgh (Saturday)\n\nVirginia Tech Hokies\n\nUpdated: Feb. 21, 2:26 p.m.\n\nRegrouping from the disappointment of Tuesday's loss to Miami, the Hokies bested Wake Forest by 19 on Saturday to keep their bubble case in play. They do have ammunition in their battle to be possibly the last ACC team called to the brackets, including three Quadrant 1 wins and a résumé rating that is borderline top 50. But their conditional at-large chances are still south of 30%, suggesting they are in serious limbo if they don't knock off North Carolina and/or Virginia as well in the next couple of weeks.\n\nNext game: at North Carolina (Saturday)\n\nBIG 12\n\n7.6 expected bids (6.6 at-large)\n\nLocks (6)\n\nArizona Wildcats\n\nIowa State Cyclones\n\nHouston Cougars\n\nKansas Jayhawks\n\nTexas Tech Red Raiders\n\nBYU Cougars\n\nShould be in (1)\n\nUCF Knights\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 8:05 a.m.\n\nWith so many of the Big 12's expected bids being effective locks -- the six teams listed above each have 99% conditional at-large chances in the model consensus -- the conference's bubble picture really starts with who could be the seventh bid. The Knights had been losing their grip on that spot with three straight losses to Houston, Cincinnati and West Virginia earlier this month, but it's fair to say they've regained their position and then some (now up to 97% at-large odds) with wins over bubble rival TCU, Utah and then a big road upset over BYU on Tuesday night. The victories push their full-season projection back up to near 22 wins and help them close in on the top 30 in the résumé average -- a good place to be, since no other non-lock from the Big 12 is even better than No. 50. With a couple of manageable home games coming up against Baylor and Oklahoma State before a visit to WVU for the season finale, the Knights are back in the driver's seat.\n\nNext game: vs. Baylor (Saturday)\n\nWork to do (2)\n\nTCU Horned Frogs\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 11:36 p.m.\n\nThe Horned Frogs continue to make a run at the Big 12's final at-large nod with their fifth win in six games, beating Arizona State at home Tuesday. Although they sit with a consensus at-large chance in the 40% range, they have four Quadrant 1 wins and have one more chance to add another coming up against Texas Tech on March 3. They have a clear case to be the conference's eighth tournament team, though if seven ends up being the Big 12's magic number, they're in trouble.\n\nNext game: at Kansas State (Saturday)\n\nCincinnati Bearcats\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 9:17 p.m.\n\nThe Bearcats' late-season bid to inject life into the bubble with their upset of Kansas -- by 16 points at Allen Fieldhouse! -- for their fourth consecutive win was fun while it lasted. Tuesday's loss to Texas Tech threatens to send them back into long shot territory. They are only borderline top 60 in the national résumé average -- the rest of the bubble is generally around No. 45 -- and they are projected to finish the season with 14.4 losses, per the BPI. At this point, their case really relies on two signature wins: over Iowa State at home and at Kansas. The consensus model sets Cincinnati's at-large chances at 12% now.\n\nNext game: vs. Oklahoma State (Saturday)\n\nBIG EAST\n\n3.2 expected bids (2.2 at-large)\n\nLocks (3)\n\nUConn Huskies\n\nSt. John's Red Storm\n\nVillanova Wildcats\n\nShould be in (0)\n\nNone\n\nWork to do (1)\n\nSeton Hall Pirates\n\nUpdated: Feb. 21, 8:27 p.m.\n\nWednesday's 12-point home loss to DePaul put a dent in the Pirates' chances, only mitigated slightly by Saturday's victory over Georgetown. Their at-large chances sit at 13% in the forecast composite, while they rank outside the top 50 nationally in résumé average with only a single Quadrant 1 win. A case will be hard to make if the Big East receives only three bids, which is the current Bracketology expectation, so Seton Hall's last chances to impress the committee would be to upset UConn (Feb. 28 on the road) or St. John's (March 6 at home).\n\nNext game: at UConn (Saturday)\n\nOTHERS\n\nLocks (2)\n\nGonzaga Bulldogs (West Coast Conference)\n\nUtah State Aggies (Mountain West)\n\nShould be in (2)\n\nSaint Mary's Gaels (WCC)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 26, 8:30 a.m.\n\nFacing rival Santa Clara in a big Bubble Watch contest Wednesday night, the Gaels outscored the Broncos 44-31 in the second half to pull away for the statement win. They haven't missed the NCAA tournament since 2022, and it's tough to imagine that streak coming to an end now. Saint Mary's sits 27th in the résumé rankings with a consensus 95% at-large probability -- very nearly a \"lock\" -- and after Wednesday, it likely no longer has to worry about how many WCC teams the NCAA can accommodate for the Dance after Gonzaga. It still has just one Quadrant 1 win -- it could add a second vs. Gonzaga when the two meet again on Saturday at Saint Mary's. But the Gaels have to feel like they are in solid shape either way.\n\nNext game: vs. Gonzaga (Saturday)\n\nSaint Louis Billikens (Atlantic 10)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 9:12 p.m.\n\nThe Billikens are a great story in their second season with Josh Schertz at the helm and a cast of five double-figure scorers led by bespectacled big man Robbie Avila, tracking for the best SRS in program history. After they came back to beat bubble rival VCU by 13 points Friday, they turned around and suffered their ugliest loss of the year: by 15 points at Dayton. The positives are that Saint Louis still ranks top 30 nationally in the résumé rankings and even better in the predictive ratings, so it's hard to see this group not making the field as an at-large team if necessary. But there will be lessons to learn from Tuesday's loss.\n\nNext game: vs. Duquesne (Saturday)\n\nWork to do (6)\n\nMiami (Ohio) RedHawks (MAC)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 8:26 p.m.\n\nThe MAC hasn't received multiple bids since 1998-99 -- fittingly, the same year Wally Szczerbiak led Miami (Ohio) to the Sweet 16 after knocking off Washington and Utah in the first two rounds. Could history repeat? Miami is the sole remaining unbeaten in Division I and ranks inside the top 40 on résumé as a result. The forecast models don't quite know how to handle the RedHawks, though the committee has never excluded an eligible team with fewer than four losses in a non-pandemic season -- and Miami (Ohio) made the field as an at-large team during an NCAA-ran mock selection exercise last week. It is true that the RedHawks are a mid-80s team in the predictive ratings (Akron actually still ranks higher in the MAC) and had just the 321st-hardest schedule in the nation. But wins are wins, and they held off Eastern Michigan on Tuesday for their 28th. They are now only three away from an undefeated regular season, which ESPN Analytics gives around a 60% chance to happen.\n\nNext game: at Western Michigan (Friday)\n\nSanta Clara Broncos (WCC)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 26, 8:30 a.m.\n\nThe Santa Clara and Saint Mary's comparisons will be constant down the stretch as we debate whether the WCC could get three bids -- which has happened only once in the past 13 seasons. The Broncos had beaten SMC in mid-January, but Wednesday's loss in the rematch dropped their consensus at-large chances from 76% to 68% and cast new doubt on whether Santa Clara is tourney-bound. They do own the nation's No. 40 résumé ranking and that previous head-to-head win over Saint Mary's, but their fate appears to hang almost entirely upon whether the selection committee will send that extra WCC at-large team to the Dance.\n\nNext game: vs. Oregon State (Saturday)\n\nSan Diego State Aztecs (MW)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 26, 8:30 a.m.\n\nJust when the Aztecs seemed to be sliding out of the bubble picture with consecutive losses to Grand Canyon and Colorado State, they responded by taking down conference leader Utah State by 17 on Wednesday night. The victory provided a major boost for their consensus at-large chances, which rose from 27% to 49%. After spending most of the season as one of the bubbliest of bubble teams, they are now outside the top 50 nationally in the résumé ranking, but they remain squarely in the mix on the basis of résumé wins. The Mountain West could feasibly send three teams to the tournament -- it hasn't fallen below that threshold in five seasons -- and with a fairly sizable gap in at-large chances between SDSU/New Mexico and the next-best teams (Nevada/Boise State at 5%), both teams could get in regardless. But if the Mountain West gets only two bids, Saturday's tilt in New Mexico could determine who has the edge.\n\nNext game: at New Mexico (Saturday)\n\nNew Mexico Lobos (MW)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 26, 8:30 a.m.\n\nWill anyone separate themselves as the Mountain West's clear No. 2 NCAA contender behind Utah State? Seeking a third straight tournament trip for the first time in more than a decade, New Mexico seemed to regain its edge as the conference's second-most-likely entrant by beating Air Force and Fresno State, as San Diego State fell to both Grand Canyon and Colorado State. But then came Tuesday's loss to Nevada and SDSU's win over the Aggies, pushing the Lobos' consensus at-large chances back down to 35% -- far from ideal. A major blemish on the résumé remains their head-to-head loss at the Aztecs on Jan. 17, which they'll have a chance to avenge Saturday -- but there are real questions around which of the MWC bubble squads deserves an at-large nod at this point.\n\nNext game: vs. San Diego State (Saturday)\n\nVCU Rams (A-10)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 21, 9:32 a.m.\n\nVCU hasn't made back-to-back NCAA tournaments since the Will Wade era nearly a decade ago, and the forecast models (which sit in the mid-20% consensus at-large range) remain less than bullish on that streak ending this season. In part, that's because the Rams are 0-5 against Quadrant 1 opponents, including a tough collapse at Saint Louis on Friday that hurt their at-large case. On the positive side, they are right in the middle of bubble territory in overall résumé (mid-40s nationally), they've still won 10 of 11, and their remaining schedule is soft enough for more wins. But it's still totally up in the air if the A-10 will get a second NCAA entry (which has happened in three of the five years since the pandemic), and the Billikens would clearly be first in line for whatever bid(s) the conference does get.\n\nNext game: vs. Fordham (Saturday)\n\nBelmont Bruins (MVC)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 9:24 p.m.\n\nBelmont's case for at-large consideration continues to grow after the Bruins cruised past Evansville for their 13th win in 14 games. They lead the nation in effective FG% and are a top-50 team in our résumé composite. Though they don't have any Quadrant 1 wins, they'll get one more chance to improve on their 5-1 record against Quadrant 2 teams: against Illinois State on March 1.\n\nNext game: at Illinois State (Sunday)\n\nGlossary of terms"

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThree-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer has agreed to return to the Toronto Blue Jays, a source confirmed to ESPN's Alden Gonzalez on Wednesday.\n\nThe deal is for one year and $3 million, according to multiple reports.\n\nBringing Scherzer back became a bigger need for Toronto with right-hander Bowden Francis undergoing season-ending Tommy John surgery earlier this month and with Shane Bieber delayed with a bout of forearm fatigue.\n\nScherzer, 41, will join newcomers Cody Ponce and Dylan Cease in the rotation. The Blue Jays could choose to ramp him up slowly, prompting him to join the rotation in-season.\n\nAs Scherzer has pitched into his 40s, he has increasingly lost time to injury. He threw a total of 85 regular-season innings for the Blue Jays in 2025 after accumulating only 43⅓ for the Texas Rangers in 2024.\n\nBlue Jays manager John Schneider raved about Scherzer's competitiveness and preparation, and he threw well enough to earn three big starts for Toronto in the postseason -- in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, when he worked through early-inning trouble to stifle the Seattle lineup, and in Games 3 and 7 of the World Series.\n\nFive years after he throws his final pitch, Scherzer will make a speech in Cooperstown, and presumably his election into the Hall of Fame will be unanimous or close to it. Scherzer has finished in the top five of Cy Young Award voting eight times. He has a career 221-117 record with a 3.22 ERA, and his career Adjusted OPS+ of 131 is equivalent to that of Sandy Koufax.\n\nScherzer was a first-round draft pick of the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2006, and he debuted in the big leagues two years later. His delivery at that time drew a lot of scrutiny because of how he snapped his head to the left as he released the ball.\n\nArizona officials discussed the possibility of turning him into a closer, but the Diamondbacks instead shipped him to the Detroit Tigers as part of a three-team trade with the New York Yankees. With the Tigers, Scherzer flourished, going 82-35 over five seasons while establishing himself as one of the game's premier pitchers.\n\nHe signed with the Washington Nationals after the 2014 season, and he and Stephen Strasburg helped them to a championship in 2019. Over the course of his career, he has grossed nearly $370 million in salary, a reflection of his excellence on the mound.\n\nMLB Network was first to report Scherzer's agreement with Toronto.\n\nESPN's Buster Olney contributed to this report."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nCincinnati sued former quarterback Brendan Sorsby in federal court Wednesday, alleging he breached his NIL contract with the Bearcats when he refused to pay a $1 million exit fee after he transferred to Texas Tech.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, seeks $1 million in liquidated damages, which the school said Sorsby was contractually obligated to pay within 30 days of transferring.\n\nIn the complaint, Cincinnati's attorneys said the quarterback's representative \"advised that Sorsby refuses to pay the University anything.\"\n\nSorsby reportedly signed an NIL agreement with the Red Raiders that will pay him between $4 million and $6 million this season.\n\n\"In his lucrative NIL agreement with Cincinnati Athletics, Brendan Sorsby committed to stay and play for two seasons as a proud Bearcat representative,\" the university said in a statement Wednesday. \"He also agreed that if he left the university before that time, he would pay the university a specific amount for the substantial harm that his breach would cause.\n\n\"Cincinnati Athletics intends to enforce that contractual commitment. As stewards of the university's resources, the Athletics Department has a duty to do so. We thank Brendan for his time at Cincinnati and wish him success in the future.\"\n\nThe lawsuit said that Sorsby signed an 18-month NIL contract with the Bearcats that covered the 2025 and 2026 seasons. It was set to expire on Dec. 15, 2026.\n\nThe university claims Sorsby notified the football team on Dec. 1 that he was done playing for the Bearcats and wouldn't compete in their postseason game against Navy in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl on Jan. 2.\n\nSorsby entered the transfer portal on Jan. 2 and almost immediately signed an NIL deal with the Red Raiders.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Sorsby violated the terms of his NIL deal with Cincinnati when his image appeared on a large digital billboard in New York's Times Square announcing his commitment to Texas Tech.\n\nSorsby, a senior from Denton, Texas, was one of the top-rated quarterbacks in the transfer portal. After playing his first two seasons at Indiana, he started at Cincinnati the past two seasons.\n\nIn 2025, he completed 61.6% of his passes for 2,800 yards with 27 touchdowns and five interceptions. He also ran for 580 yards with nine scores, leading the Bearcats to a 7-5 record.\n\nCincinnati claims that although it paid Sorsby a substantial amount last season, \"it did so with the express expectation that it would realize the majority of the benefits during the following season, 2026, after Sorsby's play developed and his brand grew.\"\n\n\"Despite the clear contractual obligation to do so, and despite his ability to pay, Sorsby still has not paid the University the $1 million in liquidated damages he agreed to pay,\" the lawsuit said. \"Sorsby has benefited greatly by the NIL agreement he entered into with the University, along with the University's sustained efforts to promote him and help establish him as a top collegiate quarterback. Now, the University seeks to enforce its rights under that same agreement and to recover the amount Sorsby is contractually obligated to pay.\"\n\nIn a statement later Wednesday night, Sorsby's agent said the QB will fight the lawsuit, calling it \"misguided.\"\n\n\"University of Cincinnati, through its revenue-share structure, paid him $875,800 for a season he fully completed and in that time, he generated millions in value for the program,\" Ron Slavin of Lift Management said. \"Attempting to recover those funds now sends the wrong message to current and future student-athletes and risks damaging the long-term credibility of Cincinnati football. This is further disappointing given that Brendan parted ways with UC in what was a mutually agreeable manner. The money the university seeks to recover from him is nothing more than an unlawful penalty under Ohio law.\"\n\nCincinnati isn't the first college athletics program to sue a former player for liquidated damages after breaking an NIL contract and transferring. In December, Georgia sued former edge rusher Damon Wilson for $390,000 in damages after he transferred to Missouri following the 2024 season.\n\nGeorgia asked a judge to force Wilson into arbitration to settle the dispute. Wilson countersued Georgia in a Missouri court, alleging the Bulldogs had \"weaponized\" a liquidated damages clause in an unenforceable way to \"punish Wilson for entering the portal.\"\n\nWilson transferred to Miami in January after playing one season for the Tigers.\n\nDuke officials sued former quarterback Darian Mensah on Jan. 20 in an attempt to prevent him from transferring to Miami and to try to enforce the multiyear NIL contract he signed with the Blue Devils.\n\nThe sides reached an undisclosed settlement on Jan. 27, allowing Mensah to join the Hurricanes."

            "content": "Rick Pitino takes full blame for St. John's 32-point loss at UConn and says the team will move on. (1:10)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. -- Tarris Reed Jr. had 20 points, 11 rebounds and six blocks, and No. 6 UConn held 15th-ranked St. John's to 20% shooting in a 72-40 blowout Wednesday night that snapped the Red Storm's 13-game winning streak.\n\nAlex Karaban added 14 points and five rebounds for the Huskies, who moved back into first place in the Big East by avenging an 81-72 loss to St. John's at Madison Square Garden on Feb. 6.\n\nSt. John's missed 12 consecutive shots in the first half and then its final 24 field goal attempts of the game as the Huskies (26-3, 16-2) romped to their most lopsided victory in series history.\n\n\"They've been playing so well, the streak that they were on. ... So it was just our night,\" UConn coach Dan Hurley said. \"It just starts snowballing on you when you have a night like this. Obviously, we played really good defense on them, and I thought we demoralized them a little bit when the score gets where the score got. And I just think it was one of those nights where everything went great for us and everything went wrong for them. But we did a lot to make that happen.\"\n\nIt was by far the largest defeat for the Red Storm in three seasons under Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino, and their fewest points in a game since scoring 40 against Notre Dame in March 2013. St. John's had its largest loss as an AP-ranked team since March 15, 1960, when it fell to St. Bonaventure by 35.\n\nFor Pitino, it was his second-largest loss as the head coach of an AP-ranked team in his career, behind only a 33-point loss with then-No. 5 Louisville in February 2009.\n\n\"It's probably only happened to me two times in my career. Once was in my first year at Kentucky when we went into Phog Allen [Fieldhouse] at Kansas, but I was playing with very much an inferior team with walk-ons, not with this type of team,\" Pitino said, referring to a 55-point loss with an unranked Wildcats team in December 1989. \"It's all on me. I'm very disappointed in our performance, offensively especially, sharing the ball, moving the ball. It's all on me.\"\n\nTarris Reed Jr. had 20 points, 11 rebounds and six blocks to help UConn avenge at Feb. 6 defeat to St. John's and move back atop the Big East. David Butler II-Imagn Images\n\nSolo Ball had 11 points and four assists for UConn, and Silas Demary Jr. provided seven points, eight rebounds and five assists.\n\nJoson Sanon scored all 10 of his points in the first half for St. John's (22-6, 15-2), which finished 11-of-56 from the field and fell a half-game behind UConn in the conference standings. The team's 13-game winning streak was its longest in 41 years.\n\nZuby Ejiofor had two quick baskets for the Red Storm early in the second half, but the Huskies scored the next 16 points. A driving layup by Karaban put them up by 23 with 13:42 left, and St. John's went the last 17:27 without a field goal.\n\n\"I don't know what it is. All I know is we didn't play good offense,\" Pitino said. \"We did things that we've never done. And again, it's something that I've got to question about myself, and I will question it because the team did not do the things we've done in the last 13 games.\"\n\nBraylon Mullins had six points and Karaban scored five during UConn's 18-0 run in the first half. A driving layup by Ball gave the Huskies a 33-12 lead.\n\nSanon had 10 of the next 12 points for St. John's as the Red Storm began to cut into the deficit. Reed grabbed his own miss and kicked the ball out to Ball for a 3-pointer, and the Huskies went into halftime leading 41-26.\n\nUConn's starters outscored the Red Storm's starting five 61-28, and the Huskies had a 42-12 advantage in the paint.\n\nThe Associated Press and ESPN Research contributed to this report."

            "content": "Olympic gold medal winner Hilary Knight said Wednesday that a widely circulated comment from President Donald Trump about the United States women's team was a \"distasteful joke\" and that she's more focused on celebrating the women's accomplishments at the Milan Games.\n\nDuring the American men's team's locker room celebration in Milan, Trump extended an invitation to the players to come to Washington for the State of the Union address. \"I must tell you, we're going to have to bring the women's team, you do know that,\" adding with a laugh that if he didn't also invite the women's team, \"I do believe I probably would be impeached.\"\n\nAppearing on \"SportsCenter\" on Wednesday, Knight said, \"I thought it was sort of a distasteful joke, and unfortunately that is overshadowing a lot of the success, the success of just women at the Olympics carrying for Team USA and having amazing gold medal feats.\n\n\"We're just focusing on celebrating the women in our room, the extraordinary efforts, and continue to celebrate three gold medals in program history as well as the double gold for both men's and women's at the same time. And really not detract from that with a distasteful joke.\"\n\nKnight later said that she was looking forward to \"celebrating all great things that have come out of the Olympics and feeling the love and support and getting back in our respective communities and sharing this journey with them. And that's what this is all about.\"\n\nSeveral players on the men's team appeared to laugh at Trump's comment, a reaction that drew criticism when the video went viral. Jack Hughes, who scored the men's gold medal game winner, and his brother Quinn were asked about the situation Tuesday and focused on the team's relationship with the women's squad.\n\n\"Our relationship with them, over the course of being in the Olympic Village, I think we are so tight with their group,\" Hughes said in an interview he and Quinn did on \"Good Morning America.\" \"After we won the gold medal, we were in the cafeteria at 3:30 a.m. in the morning with them. We go from there, pack our bags and we're on the bus.\n\n\"People are so negative about things. I think everyone in that locker room knows how much we support them, how proud we are of them. The same way we feel about them, they feel about us.\"\n\nKnight echoed that the teams get along well.\n\n\"I think there's a genuine level of support there and respect,\" she said. \"I think that's being overshadowed by a quick lapse. I think the guys were in a tough spot, so I think it's a shame this storyline and narrative has kind of blown up and overshadowing that connection and genuine interest in one another and cheering each other on.\"\n\nGoaltender Jeremy Swayman told reporters in Boston after returning to practice with the Bruins that the men \"should have reacted differently\" to Trump's remarks.\n\n\"To share that gold medal with them is something that we're forever grateful for,\" Swayman said. \"And now that we're home we get to share that together forever and see the incredible support we have from the USA and share this incredible gold medal.\"\n\nHughes said the moment did not reflect the views of the men's team.\n\n\"You're in the moment and the president calls. We're blaring the music. It is what it is,\" Hughes said Wednesday night after his first game back with the New Jersey Devils. \"We have so much respect for the women's team and they have so much respect for us. We are all just proud Americans.\"\n\nWhile the men's team did attend the State of the Union address, the women's team, which won gold for the third time since the Olympics added the women's hockey competition in 1998, declined an invitation, citing logistics and scheduling concerns.\n\n\"We are sincerely grateful for the invitation extended to our gold medal-winning U.S. Women's Hockey Team and deeply appreciate the recognition of their extraordinary achievement,\" the U.S. women's team said in a statement released Monday. \"Due to the timing and previously scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games, the athletes are unable to participate. They were honored to be included and are grateful for the acknowledgment.\"\n\nKnight scored the tying goal against Canada on a redirection in the final two minutes. Megan Keller scored in overtime to lift the Americans to the 2-1 victory.\n\nThis was the final Olympic game for Knight, 36, who with her second gold medal became the most decorated player in U.S. women's hockey history. She announced in May that these Games -- her fifth -- would be her last.\n\nShe ends first among American skaters -- men or women -- in Olympic goals (15) and points (33) in a career.\n\nKnight told \"SportsCenter\" that this whole situation is a \"really good learning point, to really focus on how we talk about women, not only in sport but in industry. Women aren't less than, and their achievements shouldn't be overshadowed by anything else other than how great they are.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "content": "Cutter Gauthier gives the Ducks their first lead of the game with a late tally against the Oilers. (0:53)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. -- Joel Quenneville's 1,000th career victory as an NHL head coach was so dramatic that he almost had to be reminded of the milestone when the clock finally hit zeros on the Anaheim Ducks' 6-5 comeback win.\n\nWhen Quenneville stood at center ice with his wife, his daughter and his entire team for a postgame photo moments later Wednesday night, he allowed himself to step out of the hockey grind to appreciate history.\n\n\"I wasn't prioritizing the number,\" Quenneville said after joining just Scotty Bowman in the most exclusive hockey coaching club. \"I just wanted to play well tonight and find a way to win. That was the motivation, and it turned out to be a very special one as well.\"\n\nHis Ducks rallied to beat two-time defending conference champion Edmonton in their return from the Olympic break, overcoming a pair of two-goal deficits and another one-goal deficit during their frenetic four-goal third period.\n\nCutter Gauthier scored the winner with 1:14 to play, and Anaheim hung on for its NHL-leading eighth multigoal comeback win during its first year under Quenneville, whose players gathered at the bench to mob their coach after the whistle.\n\n\"It was an important game for us in a lot of ways,\" said Quenneville, who has the second-place Ducks in the Stanley Cup playoff race for the first time since 2018. \"They had the puck a lot more than we did, but at the same time, I thought we found a way to win a game. It had other meanings, but to me it was the importance of where it put us in the standings, and coming out of the break, the momentum that we could get off a win like tonight.\"\n\nQuenneville, 67, received some fine bottles of wine and cigars among his postgame gifts, but he planned to celebrate with just a beer.\n\nThe second member of the 1,000-win club took a long time to join Bowman, who got his 1,000th with the Detroit Red Wings on Feb. 8, 1997 -- just a month after Quenneville coached his first game with the St. Louis Blues.\n\nQuenneville reached the mark in his 1,825th game of a career highlighted by three Stanley Cup championships with the Chicago Blackhawks. Bowman finished his career in 2002 with 1,244 victories in 2,141 regular-season games, also winning nine Stanley Cup titles as a coach.\n\n\"He's from a different league when I look at his company,\" Quenneville said about Bowman, who was a senior adviser of hockey operations to his son, general manager Stan Bowman, during the Blackhawks' successful run under Quenneville.\n\n\"I think he's lonesome up there, the number he's at,\" Quenneville added. \"I had Scotty and Stan in Chicago together. We had some great wins, and he's got a lot of Cups. He's been very successful in the game. ... I'm happy to be getting the opportunity back in the game and be around a team like we've got now.\"\n\nQuenneville has made a successful return to the NHL this season in Anaheim after a four-year absence from the league following his resignation from the Florida Panthers in late 2021 over his inaction during the Blackhawks' sexual abuse scandal 11 years earlier.\n\nQuenneville's NHL ban was lifted in July 2024, and the Ducks hired him one year later to take over a struggling franchise with no playoff appearances in seven consecutive seasons. Anaheim (31-23-3) has vaulted into the thick of the Western Conference playoff race in its first season under Quenneville, who has led his teams to the playoffs in 20 of the 22 NHL seasons he finished behind a bench.\n\nAsked whether there were times when he wondered whether he would have a chance to reach 1,000 wins, Quenneville replied: \"It's something that I don't think about. I think my motivation, my goals were always once you win a Cup one time, you can't wait to do it again. It's always been the reason why we're doing what we're doing.\"\n\nAfter playing 13 NHL seasons as a sturdy defenseman with the signature bristly mustache he has sported for his entire adult life, Quenneville has been an NHL head coach for parts of 26 seasons, and he has won at every stop.\n\nHe led the Blues to seven consecutive playoff appearances before his firing. Quenneville then lasted just three seasons in Colorado despite producing two playoff teams.\n\nHe replaced Denis Savard behind the Blackhawks' bench in 2008 and led the Original Six franchise to eight straight playoff appearances and three championships -- including the 2010 Stanley Cup, which ended the NHL's longest active drought at 59 seasons.\n\nQuenneville joined the Panthers in April 2019, but his third season in Florida ended when the NHL banned him along with Stan Bowman and Al MacIsaac \"as a result of their inadequate response upon being informed in 2010 of allegations that Blackhawks player Kyle Beach had been assaulted by the club's video coach,\" the league said.\n\nNHL commissioner Gary Bettman determined Quenneville had showed remorse for his inaction on the allegations that surfaced during Chicago's playoff run to a Stanley Cup title. Quenneville said he also worked with advocacy groups to study the proper ways to lead in such situations.\n\nQuenneville remained intently focused on the NHL during his four years away from the bench, watching games every night on television from his home in Florida and staying in contact with his countless friends in the game. Those friends included Pat Verbeek, his former teammate with the Hartford Whalers and the Ducks' general manager.\n\nVerbeek fired Greg Cronin and persuaded owner Henry Samueli to hire Quenneville. The move has worked out on the ice so far, with the Ducks dramatically improving their record with a talented young core gaining another year of experience.\n\nBowman and Quenneville could be joined in the 1,000-win club by two more veteran coaches within the next few seasons.\n\nPaul Maurice, who won the past two Stanley Cup titles with the Panthers, has 945 career victories with five teams. Lindy Ruff earned his 933rd career victory Wednesday night with the Buffalo Sabres' 2-1 win over New Jersey."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Hillary Clinton will on Thursday appear before a panel of the US House of Representatives that is investigating the crimes of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe former Democratic secretary of state and presidential candidate recently agreed, along with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to testify to the House Oversight Committee.\n\nBoth had previously resisted demands to appear, describing them as politically motivated. Their agreement to testify warded off potential contempt-of-Congress proceedings against them.\n\nHillary Clinton has said she does not recall meeting or speaking to Epstein. Her husband, who did know Epstein, has denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of the other man's crimes.\n\nBill Clinton has also said that he cut off ties with Epstein two decades ago, and has voiced regret that he was ever associated with the financier, who died in 2019.\n\nHe is expected to provide testimony of his own on Friday.\n\nThe couple's announcement in recent weeks that they would provide testimony after all marked a reversal of their defiant position, and came as a potential contempt vote loomed in the House of Representatives.\n\nSome Democratic members of the committee voted in favour of initiating contempt proceedings.\n\nThe Clintons have previously accused the panel's Republican leader, James Comer, of \"partisan politics\" in his handling of the investigation. They described the legal summonses as \"nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals, as President Trump has directed\".\n\nThey insisted that they had already submitted sworn statements that covered the \"limited information\" they had on Epstein.\n\nNonetheless, they would appear, said a spokesperson for Bill Clinton, and \"they look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone\".\n\nFor his part, Comer said the effort to secure a deposition from both of the Clintons was a bipartisan move to show that \"no one is above the law\".\n\nBill Clinton appears in text and photos that have recently been released in stages by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) in its disclosure of material that was uncovered during federal investigations into Epstein's crimes.\n\nThe files more broadly reveal the extent of Epstein's connections with multiple high-profile individuals, including after he was convicted of sex crimes.\n\nAs with others who appear in the files - including the current president Donald Trump, who previously had his own friendship with Epstein - appearing in the documents does not imply any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Clintons' hearings will take place in Chappaqua, New York, near their home. Such depositions normally occur behind closed doors, though the Clintons reportedly fought for their own testimony to be public so that selective portions of their evidence could not be leaked to the media.\n\nBoth Democratic and Republican members of the committee are expected to address reporters after Hillary Clinton's deposition, which is scheduled for 11:00 EST (16:00 GMT).\n\nThe highly anticipated appearance by Bill Clinton on Friday will represent the first time a former US president has testified to a congressional panel since Gerald Ford did so in 1983.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) has launched nationwide investigations into complaints of disappearing prepaid electricity credits, acknowledging that it lacks a dedicated system to track such losses routinely.\n\nThe Commission says it has dispatched officers across the country to validate consumer complaints and is engaging the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) to determine the cause of the reported anomalies and possible remedies for affected customers.\n\nSpeaking in a radio interview on Citi FM on Thursday, February 26, 2026, the Director of Research and Corporate Affairs at PURC, Dr Eric Obutey, said the Commission became aware of the growing public concern earlier in the week and immediately initiated field inquiries.\n\n“We got wind of this information on Monday, and we have invited ECG to speak to us,” he said.\n\n“Before they come, we have deployed our men to the field, both at the regional offices and the head office, so that we are armed independently with data.”\n\nDr Obutey explained that although PURC monitors power supply reliability using internationally recognised benchmarks such as the System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) and related indicators, there is no specific index for tracking the depletion rate of prepaid electricity credits.\n\n“This current issue of buying credit and then losing the credit within a particular period, we do not have any index for that particular one,” he said, noting that such matters are typically addressed after formal complaints are lodged.\n\nIn response to concerns about a potential gap in consumer protection, Dr Obutey said the Commission handles metering and billing issues on a case-by-case basis. Engineers and complaints officers are dispatched to investigate, and meters are tested where necessary.\n\nHe acknowledged that PURC does not conduct routine large-scale audits of prepaid meters across communities, citing constraints in laboratory capacity and manpower.\n\nWhere broader calibration and testing exercises are required, the Commission collaborates with the Ghana Standards Authority.\n\nIn response to suggestions that the regulator should introduce more proactive and random audits, similar to the spot checks conducted by the National Petroleum Authority at fuel stations, Dr Obutey conceded that more frequent nationwide testing may be warranted.\n\n“Maybe we need to do it more frequently and across the country, but we do not have the manpower to go to every household.”\n\nAddressing concerns about compensation, Dr Obutey assured consumers that if investigations confirm wrongful depletion of prepaid credits, affected customers would have their lost units restored — though not in cash.\n\n“If ECG is found to have made your credit run faster than normal, they will give you back the lost credit,” he said.\n\n“It could mean that when you buy power next time, you receive additional credit to make up for what was lost.”\n\nHe disclosed that a similar situation occurred in 2023, after which affected consumers had their credits reinstated following regulatory intervention.\n\nThe investigations and meetings with the Electricity Company of Ghana took place on February 26, 2026, with PURC indicating it would brief the public on the outcome once engagements with the utility provider are concluded.\n\nDr Obutey said the Commission expects to provide an update “today or tomorrow” after discussions with ECG are finalised and findings from the field investigations are consolidated.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Government support in terms of logistics and equipment will go a long way to strengthen our operations and impact,” he said.\n\nHe further called on financial institutions, corporate bodies, government agencies and private sector employers to offer employment opportunities to graduates during and after their internship periods.\n\nProfessor Awabil also encouraged Baptist churches nationwide to establish businesses that can serve as practical training grounds for students after completing their programmes.\n\nHe believes this will enable them to become self-reliant entrepreneurs rather than depending solely on family support.\n\n“Government alone cannot shoulder the responsibility of job creation. Through entrepreneurship training, our graduates can create their own businesses if they receive the necessary support, including access to startup loans.”\n\nHe noted that the Baptist University has trained many students in entrepreneurship and appealed to the government to facilitate access to loans to help graduates establish their own businesses.\n\nOutlining his vision for the next four years as President of the Ghana Baptist University College, Professor Awabil pledged to increase student enrolment, expand access through campus recruitment, and introduce new academic programmes tailored to both national and international demands.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "File photo of waste\n\nA new study conducted by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) at the University of Ghana has called for a hybrid waste management framework that combines decentralised local systems with large-scale private sector participation to improve efficiency, attract capital, introduce technology, and unlock long-term value in Ghana’s sanitation sector.\n\nThe report, titled “An Economic Analysis of the Benefits of Adequate Investment in Waste Management and Sanitation in Ghana,” argues that while empowering Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) remains critical, structural transformation of the sector requires the participation of large industry players capable of injecting substantial capital and technical expertise beyond the capacity of most local authorities.\n\n\n\nPresenting the findings in Accra on Thursday, February 26, 2026, Lead Researcher and Economist at the University of Ghana, Professor Peter Quartey, said decentralisation provides institutional proximity and accountability but does not necessarily deliver the scale required for infrastructure-intensive investments.\n\n\n\n“Our assemblies are closest to the problem. They understand the local dynamics of waste generation and collection,” Professor Quartey noted. “However, building modern material recovery facilities, large composting plants, or waste-to-energy installations requires financial depth and engineering capacity that most MMDAs simply do not possess. A strategic partnership model is therefore essential.”\n\n\n\nThe study highlights a significant mismatch between sector needs and current expenditure. Ghana’s 261 MMDAs collectively spend about GHS 180 million annually on waste management and sanitation—an amount the report describes as inadequate relative to the scale of the problem and the economic opportunities within the waste value chain.\n\n\n\nISSER estimates that inadequate sanitation costs Ghana’s economy more than GHS 6.2 billion annually through healthcare expenses and productivity losses. Researchers argue that incremental improvements within existing budget limits will not deliver systemic change.\n\nThe report proposes a two-tier financing model. At the metropolitan level, where waste volumes create economies of scale, public-private partnerships (PPPs) could attract investment into high-capacity recycling facilities, engineered landfills, and waste-to-energy plants.\n\n\n\nAt the local level, targeted public investment should prioritise waste collection systems, safe disposal sites, drainage rehabilitation, and the elimination of open dumping.\n\n\n\nData presented in the study revealed disparities across jurisdictions. Metropolitan assemblies such as Accra and Tema spend significantly more per capita on waste management than smaller municipal and district assemblies.\n\n\n\nHowever, smaller assemblies often face higher vulnerability to sanitation-related diseases due to limited infrastructure, weak drainage systems, and rapid peri-urban expansion.\n\n\n\nCo-author Dr Kwame Adjei-Mantey cautioned that uniform policy approaches could deepen inequality.\n\n“Large cities can attract private operators because they offer scale and predictable revenue streams,” he said. “Smaller districts require deliberate fiscal support to build foundational systems. Without that balance, investment will concentrate in commercially attractive areas while high-burden communities remain underserved.”\n\n\n\nThe report identifies fast-growing municipal assemblies as critical intervention points, noting that they shoulder significant waste-related expenditure while lacking the scale to finance advanced processing infrastructure independently.\n\n\n\nResearchers also highlighted the technical potential for Ghana’s municipal solid waste to generate up to 1,484 megawatts of electricity under an optimised waste-to-energy framework.\n\n\n\nProfessor Ebo Turkson, a member of the research team, said such projects require industrial-scale financing and operational expertise that decentralised local systems alone cannot provide.\n\n\n\n“Waste-to-energy plants, advanced sorting facilities, and integrated composting systems are capital-intensive undertakings,” he noted. “Private firms with sector experience can deliver operational efficiency and technological innovation, provided regulatory clarity and bankable project structures are in place.”\n\nHowever, the study cautions that private participation must operate within strong regulatory and contractual frameworks to protect public interest and environmental standards.\n\n\n\nWhile endorsing private sector involvement, the report emphasises that MMDAs must evolve into effective regulators and contract managers by strengthening procurement systems, performance monitoring, data collection, and enforcement mechanisms.\n\n\n\nDr Ralph Armah stressed that decentralisation should not mean reduced oversight.\n\n\n\n“Local assemblies must become intelligent clients capable of negotiating balanced agreements and ensuring service quality,” he said. “Institutional strengthening is as important as capital mobilisation.”\n\n\n\nThe report also calls for structured integration of informal waste collectors into formal systems, arguing that inclusive policies could improve efficiency while enhancing occupational safety, income stability, and training opportunities.\n\nThe study concludes that Ghana requires a coordinated national waste management strategy that clearly defines responsibilities among central government, MMDAs, and private sector operators. Policy predictability, transparent tariff systems, and enforceable environmental standards were identified as essential for sustainable investment.\n\n\n\nProfessor Quartey described the current moment as a strategic inflection point.\n\n\n\n“Decentralisation remains essential, but it cannot succeed without capital and technology injections from strategic private sector players,” he said. “If empowered local governance aligns with credible private sector participation, Ghana can transform waste from a fiscal burden into a productive economic sector.”"

They are taught in primary education, and in most of our traditional universities, courses are run in Ghanaian languages,” she stated.\n\n\n\nShe credited the media, particularly the growth of FM radio stations, for helping to promote indigenous languages across the country.\n\n\n\n“With the coming of more FM stations, our local languages are used more often nationwide. They are really contributing to the consolidation and development of our languages,” she noted.\n\n\n\nShe also stressed that government especially the ministry of education must do more to ensure effective implementation of language policies.\n\n\n\n“The policies are there and they are good, but when it comes to implementation, we have shortfalls. We must address those shortfalls,” she said.\n\n\n\nShe referenced the policy introduced in 2025, requiring local languages to be used as the medium of instruction from kindergarten to primary three.\n\n\n\nHowever, she pointed out a major gap in learning materials.\n\n\n\nProfessor Wiafe urges stakeholders to leverage AI to safeguard local dialects\n\n\n\n“There are textbooks for learning Twi or Ga as subjects but there is no science textbook written in Akan or Ga or any other Ghanaian language. That is the direction we must go. We should document our languages across various subject areas,” she explained.\n\n\n\nProf Dzahene-Quarshie further proposed the establishment of vocabulary expansion bodies to help develop new terms in local languages, especially for science and technology terminologies.\n\n\n\n“The fact that we do not currently have certain vocabularies should not deter us. We need agencies that can coin new words for us to use in order to sustain and develop our languages,” she said.\n\n\n\nAddressing parents, she urged a change in mindset regarding English and education.\n\n\n\n“Speaking English is not education. Acquiring knowledge and being able to communicate what one knows — that is education,” she stressed.\n\n\n\nShe added that research shows children are capable of learning multiple languages with ease.\n\n\n\n“Children can pick up as many as six languages if they are in the right environment, there is nothing wrong with a child learning to speak their mother tongue first. In fact, it gives them a firm foundation for learning other languages,” she stated.\n\n\n\nDzahene-Quarshie encouraged parents to take pride in speaking their native languages at home.\n\n\n\n“English is not our language and we have limited environments where it is spoken. If a child speaks their local language well, it strengthens their ability to learn other languages. We must continue to educate our parents so they understand this and feel proud to speak their mother tongues with their children,” she said.\n\n\n\nSO/VPO\n\n\n\nGhanaian man and his Nigerian girlfriend found dead in Morocco apartment"

            "content": "General News of Thursday, 26 February 2026\n\nSource: www.ghanaweb.com\n\nThe United Nations Resident Coordinator for Ghana and an advocate for multilingual education, Zia Choudhury, has urged the youth of Ghana to take the lead in protecting and promoting mother tongues, describing language as central to identity, culture and national development.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the International Mother Language Day at the University of Ghana on Wednesday February 25, 2026, he explained why the date February 21 holds deep personal and historical significance.\n\n\n\n“February 21 is not just a date on the calendar for us. It is a day that reminds tens of millions of Bangladeshis of the sacrifices made to defend our mother tongue,” he stated.\n\n\n\nReflecting on the meaning of a mother tongue, Choudury noted that it goes beyond the first language learned at home.\n\n\n\n“It is the sweet language our mothers used to tell us stories, sing songs, or whisper messages of love to us,” he said.\n\n\n\n“Those first words shaped our minds, our culture and our very souls,” he added.\n\n\n\nChoudhury recounted how in 1948, authorities in the then Pakistan declared ‘Urdu’ the sole national language, effectively downgrading ‘Bangla’, a language spoken by millions in what is now Bangladesh.\n\n\n\n“Imagine your mother tongue being ridiculed and pushed aside in favour of a language from a distant land,” he said.\n\n\n\nProfessor Wiafe urges stakeholders to leverage AI to safeguard local dialects\n\n\n\n“History shows us that language has often been used as a tool of power and control,” he added.\n\n\n\nThat decision sparked widespread resistance, culminating in the fatal shooting of student protesters on February 21, 1952.\n\n\n\n“Young people demanding recognition of their mother tongue were killed by police,” he recounted.\n\n\n\n“Many brave men and women risked imprisonment and even death simply to say, ‘I speak Bangla,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe movement eventually contributed to Bangladesh’s independence, and February 21 became a National Day of Mourning.\n\n\n\nIn the 1990s, however, Bangladesh proposed to the United Nations that the date be recognised globally to celebrate linguistic diversity.\n\n\n\n“In 2000, UN member states unanimously agreed, and it became International Mother Language Day,” he said.\n\n\n\nHighlighting this year’s theme, “Youth Voices on Multilingual Education,” he stressed the importance of inclusive learning.\n\n\n\n“Forty percent of learners worldwide still do not receive education in a language they understand best,” he noted, citing UNESCO data.\n\n\n\n“These language barriers deepen inequality, particularly for rural and marginalised children,” he added.\n\n\n\nZia Choudhury commended Ghana for championing the use of mother-tongue as mode of instruction from kindergarten to primary three, describing it as a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, attention was drawn to the digital era, where emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence present both risks and opportunities.\n\n\n\n“AI can be a threat, but we can also use it to our huge advantage. The potential is massive if we use it wisely,” he stated.\n\n\n\nChoudhury urged greater engagement with young people to drive decisions that directly impacts them.\n\n\n\n“Let’s support the young people, listen to them, and learn from their skills and experiences. Languages build inclusive societies, strengthen cooperation and preserve our shared cultural heritage,” he said.\n\n\n\nSO/VPO\n\n\n\nGhanaian man and his Nigerian girlfriend found dead in Morocco apartment"

            "content": "Professor Peter Quartey is the Director of ISSER\n\nA new study by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) has shown that Ghana’s informal waste sector, which has been largely overlooked and unregulated, could generate billions of cedis annually if properly structured and supported.\n\nThe study, titled “An Economic Analysis of the Benefits of Adequate Investment in Waste Management and Sanitation in Ghana,” projects that with sustained investment and the formal integration of informal waste actors, popularly known as “aboboyaa operators” the country could realise up to GH¢47.9 billion in annual economic benefits by 2032.\n\n\n\nThe researchers argue that waste management should no longer be viewed solely as a sanitation challenge but as a strategic economic sector capable of driving job creation, improving public health, and contributing to energy production.\n\n\n\nPresenting the findings at a policy dialogue in Accra, the Director of ISSER, Professor Peter Quartey said the economic logic is compelling.\n\n\n\n“We have treated waste as a liability for decades. The evidence now shows it is a high-value economic resource. If we invest deliberately and bring informal operators into a structured system, this sector can generate billions annually for the Ghanaian economy,” he said.\n\n\n\nISSER calls for tougher measures to deliver growth, jobs targets\n\n\n\nThe report estimates that Ghana currently loses more than GH¢6.2 billion each year due to inadequate sanitation and waste management systems.\n\nThese losses stem largely from healthcare costs associated with preventable diseases such as malaria, cholera, and pneumonia, as well as productivity losses from illness-related absenteeism.\n\n\n\nAccording to the study, sanitation-related diseases contribute to over 107,000 premature deaths annually and account for nearly 32 million lost work and school days.\n\n\n\nISSER’s modelling contrasts this “business-as-usual” scenario with a higher-investment approach aligned with lower-middle-income country benchmarks.\n\n\n\nUnder this scenario, which proposes spending approximately GH¢1,028 per tonne of waste managed, projected benefits would significantly outweigh costs.\n\n\n\nThe researchers estimate that every cedi invested at scale could generate returns of up to GH¢556 through reduced healthcare expenditure, increased labour productivity, and expanded recycling and energy value chains.\n\n\n\nA major focus of the study is the contribution of informal waste workers—including tricycle (aboboyaa) operators, scrap dealers, and community recyclers who currently form the backbone of waste collection and material recovery in many urban areas.\n\nThe study recommends targeted capital investments in high-risk urban and peri-urban communities, expanded recycling infrastructure, incentives for private sector participation, and structured financial and social protection schemes for informal waste workers.\n\n\n\nThe researchers conclude that with political will, regulatory reform, and sustained financing, Ghana’s informal waste economy could evolve into a multi-billion-cedi growth engine, transforming a long-standing sanitation burden into a national asset.\n\n\n\nSP/MA\n\n\n\nAuto dealers respond to 15% price cut announcement"

Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "The World Economic Forum boss, a former Norwegian foreign minister, had dinners and exchanged messages with Epstein.\n\nBorge Brende has resigned from his roles as the president and CEO of the World Economic Forum (WEF), following revelations of his links with the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBrende, a former Norwegian foreign minister who became president of the WEF in 2017, announced his departure on Thursday, joining the ranks of prominent figures to have left their jobs or faced criminal investigations after their contacts with Epstein were revealed in files released by the US Department of Justice last month.\n\n“After careful consideration, I have decided to step down as President and CEO of the World Economic Forum. My time here, spanning 8-1/2 years, has been profoundly rewarding,” Brende said in a statement, which made no mention of Epstein.\n\n“I am grateful for the incredible collaboration with my colleagues, partners, and constituents, and I believe now is the right moment for the Forum to continue its important work without distractions.”\n\nBrende’s departure came several weeks after the WEF, organiser of the annual Davos summit,⁠ launched an independent investigation into his relationship with Epstein, following revelations in the files that the Norwegian had three business dinners with the financier and had also communicated with him via email and text message.\n\nEpstein was convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008, spending about a year in prison before his release.\n\nHis contacts with a network of wealthy and influential figures continued in the wake of his conviction until an investigation into the wealthy financier was reopened in 2019. Epstein died by suicide in prison that year while facing charges of sex trafficking underage girls.\n\nDinners, emails\n\nBrende said in a statement earlier this month that during a visit to New York in 2018, he received an invitation from former Norwegian politician Terje Rod-Larsen to join him for dinner with several other leaders, plus “someone who was presented to me as an American investor, Jeffrey Epstein”.\n\n\n\n“The following year, I attended two similar dinners with Epstein, alongside other diplomats and business leaders. These dinners, and a few emails and SMS messages, were the extent of my interactions with him,” he said.\n\n“I was completely unaware of Epstein’s past and criminal activities.”\n\nHe said that had he known about Epstein’s background, he would have declined any contact with the convicted sex offender, adding that he regretted not having conducted a more thorough investigation into his past.\n\nInvestigation concluded\n\nIn a separate statement, Andre Hoffmann and Larry Fink, co-chairs of the WEF, said the independent review ⁠conducted by outside counsel into Brende’s ties with Epstein had concluded.\n\nThe findings stated there were no additional concerns beyond what had been previously disclosed, it ⁠added.\n\nThe co-chairs said the WEF’s Alois Zwinggi will serve ⁠as interim president and CEO, and that the forum’s board of trustees would oversee the leadership transition, including a plan to identify a permanent replacement.\n\nArrests and resignations\n\nEpstein had ties to a long list of business and political leaders, whose links to the disgraced figure have now come under close scrutiny, resulting in arrests and resignations.\n\nIn Norway, Thorbjorn Jagland, former prime minister and former secretary-general of the Council of Europe, has been charged with “aggravated corruption” amid an investigation into his connections to Epstein, while Rod-Larsen and his wife Mona Juul, both diplomats, have also been charged.\n\nCrown Princess Mette-Marit, the wife of Crown Prince Haakon, heir to Norway’s throne, has also come under heavy scrutiny following the revelation of her close friendship with Epstein, issuing a public apology for her long association with him.\n\nIn the UK, prominent figures including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor – formerly Prince Andrew – and Peter Mandelson, the former diplomat, minister, and adviser to multiple Labour Party prime ministers, have been arrested over alleged crimes linked to their relationships with Epstein.\n\nIn France, financial crimes prosecutors have opened an investigation into former Culture Minister Jack Lang, while in Slovakia, Miroslav Lajcak, former president of the UN General Assembly, resigned as security adviser to the country’s prime minister amid growing criticism over his correspondence with Epstein, uncovered in the files.\n\nA growing number of prominent business and academic figures have also left their posts after their ties to Epstein were revealed."

            "content": "The international community’s lack of action in taking punitive action against Israel over its pervasive breaches of international law in the occupied West Bank has contributed to making the annexation of Palestinian territory an “irreversible” reality, Amnesty International has said.\n\nIn a statement released on Thursday, the human rights group said impunity granted to Israel by global powers has further emboldened the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu to “turbocharge” efforts to dispossess Palestinians across the West Bank.\n\n“The unconditional support of the USA government, combined with the pervasive lack of international accountability for Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, decades of crimes under international law linked to its unlawful occupation and its system of apartheid, has further emboldened Israel to escalate its illegal actions,” Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s senior director for research, advocacy, policy and campaigns said.\n\nThe formalization of land grabs, the expansion of illegal settlements and state-backed settler violence in the territory “are a direct indictment of the international community’s catastrophic failure to take decisive action,” Guevara-Rosas said.\n\nCountries, she added, have refused to use the tools at their disposal, such as suspension of the European Union-Israel Association Agreement, to deter Israel from its action.\n\nThe West Bank has been under Israeli occupation since the 1967 war. Since then, the contiguity of the Palestinian territory has been increasingly fragmented by the construction of hundreds of Israeli housing units, entrenching Israeli occupation. These settlements are illegal under international law.\n\n\n\nFollowing Israel’s genocidal war, which started following the Hamas-led attack in southern Israel in October 2023, the number of settlements has sharply expanded, and the hundreds of makeshift outposts have multiplied. The population of Jewish Israelis in these areas has now soared past half a million people.\n\nAt the same time, Israeli army raids, attacks, house demolitions and arrests in the occupied territory are at unprecedented levels, while settlers attack and kill Palestinians and rampage through their property with impunity, backed by the military and the state.\n\nAt least 1,094 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops and settlers in the West Bank since October 2023, according to the latest United Nations figures.\n\nLast week, the UN Human Rights Council warned in a new report (PDF) that Israeli policies in the West Bank – including “the systematic unlawful use of force” by the Israeli army and unlawful demolitions of Palestinian homes – aim to uproot Palestinian communities.\n\nThe UN report raised concerns of “ethnic cleansing” by Israeli authorities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, amid increased attacks and forcible transfers that “appear to aim at a permanent displacement” of Palestinians.\n\nAmnesty International outlined a list of actions taken by the Israeli government since December:\n\nOn December 10, 2025, the Israel Land Authority published a tender for 3,401 housing units in the E1 area, east of Jerusalem, to expand the illegal settlement of Ma’ale Adumim and create a continuum with occupied East Jerusalem. This would split the West Bank into two.\n\nOn December 11, 2025, Israel’s security cabinet approved plans to establish 19 new settlements, bringing the total number approved by the current coalition government to 68 in just three years and the total number of official settlements to about 210.\n\nOn January 5, 2026, the Israeli civil administration designated 694 dunams of land belonging to the Palestinian towns of Deir Istiya, Biddya and Kafr Thulth in the northern West Bank as “state land”.\n\nOn February 8, 2026, Israel’s security cabinet approved a series of sweeping measures to expand its powers across the occupied West Bank, including easing the sale of Palestinian land to Israeli settlers and expanding the powers of Israeli authorities in areas under Palestinian control.\n\nOn February 15, 2026, the Israeli cabinet issued a decision that amounts to annexation under Israeli law. It allocated more than 244 million Israeli shekels ($78m) for the establishment of a government mechanism to facilitate land registration in Area C, transferring the powers of land registration from the civil administration to Israel’s Ministry of Justice.\n\n\n\nThese actions took place despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling (PDF) in 2024 that the “Israeli occupation is illegal and should end its unlawful presence … as rapidly as possible … including removing settlements and forcing settlers out.” And last year, the UN General Assembly issued a resolution setting September 2025 as the deadline to end Israel’s occupation.\n\n“Yet instead of complying, Israel has simply invented new ways to violate international law, further entrenching its unlawful occupation and apartheid – while the international community continues, at best, to pay lip service to Palestinians’ rights and taken no effective action,” Guevara-Rosas said."

            "content": "The two nations claim to be sanctuaries for all Hindus and Jews, but security within each remains shaped by persistent hierarchies and exclusion.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu and Narendra Modi shared a conspicuously warm embrace as the Indian prime minister stepped off Air India One at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport on Wednesday, a moment that captured the political intimacy between the two leaders. Over the course of his two-day visit, the two sides are expected to sign several agreements, further consolidating an already deepening partnership between Israel and India.\n\nModi has long been a driving force behind this closeness. His 2017 trip marked the first visit to Israel by an Indian prime minister and signalled a decisive shift in bilateral relations. In an Instagram post on Wednesday, he called this trip a “historic visit”, later receiving a standing ovation at a reception at the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, where Netanyahu declared, “This is true friendship, between two leaders, between two countries, and between two ancient nations.”\n\nOf course, this friendship does not just hinge on the deals and agreements the two leaders are set to sign. While welcoming Modi on the tarmac at Ben Gurion airport, Sara Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister’s wife, wore orange/saffron, the colour of Hindutva. The Israeli prime minister also pointed out that her outfit matched the orange pocket square Modi was wearing.\n\nThe prominence of Hindutva’s signature colour was difficult to ignore and suggested a clear ease with, and affirmation of, the ideological framework underpinning Modi’s politics. The ideological partnership between Netanyahu and Modi rests on a belief that both leaders stand as a bulwark against what they consider an existential civilisational struggle against Islam and Islamism. Bibi’s Israel is meant to serve as a haven for all Jews, while Modi’s India is meant to keep Hindus safe.\n\n\n\nBut it is worth asking, whose safety is really guaranteed in Israel and India?\n\nThe genocide in Gaza and the ongoing settler violence and annexation of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank are only the latest reminders that Palestinians cannot expect to be safe in the Holy Land. Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up about 19 percent of the population, face various forms of institutionalised discrimination and are, in fact, as Amnesty International put it, “lesser citizens” of Israel.\n\nBut not all Jewish citizens of Israel are “safe” either. Racial discrimination against Mizrahi Jews has been a matter of official policy, written into the very foundations of the state of Israel.\n\nA distinct antagonism towards Mizrahi Jews’ Middle East roots was evident when Ze’ev Jabotinsky, the founder of Revisionist Zionism and the Zionist paramilitary group Irgun, said, “We Jews have nothing in common with what is called the Orient, thank God. To the extent that our uneducated masses [i.e. Middle Eastern Jews] have ancient spiritual traditions and laws that call the Orient, they must be weaned away from them, and this is in fact what we are doing in every decent school, what life itself is doing with great success. We are going in Palestine, first for our national convenience, to sweep out thoroughly all traces of the Oriental soul.”\n\nDeclassified state documents show that thousands of babies from Arab Jewish families arriving in Israel after its creation were stolen by hospitals and clinics and handed over “to wealthy Jewish families in Israel and abroad”. Yemeni families suffered the “largest proportion of disappearances”. It is estimated that “one in eight children [from Yemeni families] under the age of four” had gone missing by the time the State of Israel turned six.\n\nRacial discrimination is not a matter of the past, and this white supremacy is ever more evident in the structural and everyday racism faced by Ethiopian Jews. Though accounting for only 2 percent of the population, more than half of Ethiopian Jewish citizens live below the poverty line. Their neighbourhoods are chronically under-resourced, and Ethiopian Jewish children and youth face substance abuse, violence, high school dropout rates, as well as an alarming increase in cases of depression and suicide.\n\nReflecting this experience, one participant in a study published by the Association for Jewish Studies said, “No matter what we do, this is what we get. ‘These Ethiopians, these barbarians, they infiltrate Israel.’ Take police racism, for instance, they treat us like invaders, criminals, even though this is our home. And the strangest thing is, who knows the feeling of exclusion better than the Jewish people? We weren’t accepted in Europe because we were Jewish, and now you don’t accept us because we’re Black?! You were discriminated and now you discriminate us. You’re not accepting yourself! We are PART of you, can’t you SEE?”.\n\n\n\nThese realities show that Israel is not a place of safety for all Jews.\n\nIndia is no different. Structural and everyday discrimination faced by the country’s minority Muslim population is well documented across legal, political and social spheres. Critics and oppositional voices remain under threat. But are all Hindus safe under a Hindu nationalist leadership?\n\nCaste-based discrimination, while not an invention of this government, remains a central feature of Indian society and has intensified under Modi’s rule.\n\nIn January, the University Grants Commission (UGC) introduced the Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations. The move followed Supreme Court pressure to address harassment and discrimination faced by Dalit students. The regulations “make heads of institutions directly responsible for preventing and responding to discrimination on the basis of caste, religion, gender or disability by students, teachers or non-teaching staff”. The measures faced immediate backlash, and the court has since “stayed the new regulations”.\n\nBehind these regulations lies a tragic record of suicides among Dalit students. This includes the highly publicised case of Dalit PhD candidate Rohith Vemula at the University of Hyderabad in 2016. Vemula was active on campus, raising the issue of caste discrimination, prompting complaints from the student wing of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The matter reached Smriti Irani, the then-human resource development minister in the Modi government, who asked university leadership to investigate. Vemula’s fellowship was suspended, and he was forced to vacate his dormitory.\n\nHe died by suicide on January 16, 2016, writing in his suicide note that his “birth was his fatal accident”.\n\nA 2021 Pew study reveals that a majority of Indians “do not see widespread discrimination against Scheduled Castes and Tribes”. Yet UGC data from 2025 shows caste-related complaints have risen sharply. Employment patterns also reproduce caste hierarchies, with 77 percent of sewer and septic workers coming from Dalit communities. Research suggests that caste hierarchies are increasingly reproduced in artificial intelligence systems. The anti-affirmative action activism of the Hindu nationalist diaspora also demonstrates that caste hierarchies extend beyond national boundaries.\n\nWhat is the point of dredging up this record of exclusion, discrimination and hierarchy in light of Modi’s bromance with Netanyahu? It certainly does not mean that if racism in Israeli society did not exist, or if casteism were eliminated in India, their ideologies and political actions would be any more acceptable. Rather, it is to highlight the expansive and multifaceted nature of the hierarchies and structures of exclusion propagated by the two leaders. The main targets of their discourse and policies are Palestinians across Palestine and Israel, and Muslims in India.

            "content": "During his Knesset speech in Jerusalem, Modi mentioned multilateral projects on which India and Israel collaborate.\n\nModi, Netanyahu praise each other in address to Israeli Knesset\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has delved into the history of the relationship between India and Israel, which has improved exponentially since 2014 when he came to power, as he addressed the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, in Jerusalem.\n\nDuring the speech on Wednesday, the first day of his two-day visit to Israel, Modi also urged closer cooperation on various projects, including the proposed India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and the I2U2.\n\nWe unpack what the IMEC and I2U2 are and why Modi’s address is significant.\n\nWhat did Modi say during his Knesset address?\n\nModi was greeted with a standing ovation in the Knesset. Parliamentarians chanted his name as the Indian prime minister replied with a namaste by joining his palms.\n\nThe Indian prime minister opened his speech by saying the “world was shattered by the barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7”, referring to the 2023 Hamas-led attacks on villages and army outposts in southern Israel that triggered Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians.\n\n“We feel your pain. We share your grief,” Modi said, adding that India stands by Israel “with full conviction”. Modi said India and Israel are “trusted partners” and this “contributes to global stability and prosperity”.\n\nAfter this, the Indian leader gave a history of Jewish people in India and of the relationship between India and Israel.\n\n“We are committed to expanding trade, strengthening investment flows and promoting joint infrastructural development.”\n\n\n\nModi added that an investment treaty signed between India and Israel last year will provide confidence and predictability for businesses in both India and Israel.\n\n“We will also work closely in different formats, such as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor and the I2U2 frameworks between India, Israel, UAE and the US,” he added.\n\nWhat is the IMEC?\n\nThe IMEC project was announced on September 9, 2023, during a Group of 20 summit in New Delhi. It is a proposed infrastructure project that would connect India, the Middle East and Europe with an integrated rail and shipping corridor, according to the project’s website.\n\nThe corridor would pass through India, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel and Europe and would include a network of railways, ports and highways to facilitate logistics and the free flow of trade along its route.\n\nAccording to the project’s website, the IMEC aims to foster economic cooperation and green development through sustainable infrastructure projects.\n\nWhat is the I2U2?\n\nThe I2U2 group was established by India, Israel, the UAE and United States at a virtual summit on July 14, 2022.\n\nSome analysts have called the I2U2 “the West Asian Quad” or “the Middle Eastern Quad” in reference to the Quad, or the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, an informal forum comprising the US, Japan, Australia and India.\n\nAccording to the US Department of State, the I2U2 devises projects and initiatives to address world challenges in the areas of water, energy, transportation, space, health, food security and technology.\n\nIt added that the project aims to modernise infrastructure, advance low-carbon development pathways and improve public health.\n\nThe group’s initiatives include a food security project in India, a hybrid renewable energy project in India’s Gujarat state and a project to address environmental and climate change challenges using space-based observation data and capabilities.\n\nWhy is Modi’s speech to the Knesset significant?\n\nModi made his visit to Israel as ties strengthen between Israel and India and against a backdrop of complex and rising geopolitical tensions in and around the Middle East.\n\nStrengthening ties\n\nRelations between India and Israel have hugely improved over the years. While still under British rule in the 1920s and 1930s, India strongly identified with the Palestinian struggle for independence.\n\nIndia initially opposed Israel’s creation and United Nations membership before recognising the state in 1950. Full diplomatic relations were delayed until 1992, after which India-Israel economic ties expanded gradually over the next 20 years.\n\n\n\nSince Modi became prime minister, there has been a further shift in the relationship between the two countries. Nine years ago, Modi became the first Indian prime minister ever to visit Israel.\n\nIndia is currently Israel’s second largest trading partner in Asia after China. According to India’s Ministry of External Affairs, trade jumped from $200m in 1992 to $6.5bn in 2024.\n\n“Modi is underscoring IMEC and I2U2 as part of a broader push to deepen economic and strategic cooperation with Israel and key Middle Eastern partners, positioning India at the centre of emerging trade and technology corridors amid shifting regional geopolitics,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the London-based Chatham House think tank.\n\nCollaborative projects like the IMEC and I2U2 are central elements of the expanding partnership between India and Israel. Additionally, they connect India and Israel to Middle Eastern countries.\n\n“For Gulf states like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, IMEC and I2U2 offer a chance to cement their roles as pivotal connectivity and logistics hubs linking Asia, the Middle East and Europe while accelerating economic diversification beyond oil,” Vakil told Al Jazeera.\n\n“However, lingering UAE-Saudi policy competition and Israel’s stance on Palestine inevitably complicate the political cohesion needed to fully deliver projects like IMEC.”\n\nRegional tensions\n\nModi’s visit to Israel also comes amid worsening regional tensions.\n\nIt follows India’s decision to join more than 100 states in condemning Israel’s de facto expansion in the occupied West Bank, a move New Delhi delayed by a day, suggesting hesitation as a result of its close ties with Israel.\n\nThis week, Netanyahu said he plans to form a new regional bloc of countries that he called a “hexagon” alliance to stand against “radical” Sunni and Shia Muslim “axes”.\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu said this alliance would include Israel, India, Greece and Cyprus along with other unnamed Arab, African and Asian states. None of these governments, including India, has officially endorsed this plan, however.\n\nAt the same time, US-Iran tensions are escalating. Washington is building up military assets near Iran while US President Donald Trump threatens limited strikes over Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes. Tehran has said it prefers diplomacy but will defend itself if attacked.\n\nIsrael will likely be a front-line participant in any escalation that might follow from US strikes or Iranian retaliation, analysts said."

            "content": "Analysts say the US administration is recycling the rhetoric of 2003 to justify a new escalation against Iran, but with a fractured team, isolated diplomacy, and a dangerous ‘information chaos’.\n\nIn January 2003, President George W Bush stood before the United States Congress to warn of a “grave danger” from a “dictator”, a former US client in the Middle East, armed with weapons of mass destruction (WMD).\n\nTwenty-three years later, in the same chamber, President Donald Trump used his State of the Union address to paint a strikingly similar narrative: A rogue regime, a looming nuclear threat, and a ticking clock.\n\nIn a dark twist of historical irony, Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, who was armed to the teeth by the US in Iraq’s 1980-1988 war with the fledgling Islamic Republic of Iran, became Washington’s public enemy number one, surpassing Osama bin Laden. Now, that label has been seemingly applied to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a key leader during that ruinous war against Iraq that left a million dead.\n\nBut while the “war script” sounds familiar, the geopolitical stage has shifted dramatically.\n\nAs Washington pivots from the neoconservatives’ “preemptive” doctrine of the Bush era to what experts are calling the “preventive maintenance” of the Trump era – following the June 2025 strikes on Iran in tandem with Israel’s attack in the 12-day war – questions are mounting about the intelligence, the endgame, and the alarming lack of checks and balances.\n\nThe semiotics of fear: From clouds to tunnels\n\nIn 2003, the visual language of war was vertical: The fear of a “mushroom cloud” rising over US cities, or a biological weapon seeping into populated areas. Today, the fear has gone in the other direction: Purportedly deep underground.\n\n\n\n“The administration is updating the visual dictionary of fear,” says Osama Abu Irshaid, a Washington-based political analyst. “They are exaggerating the nuclear threat exactly as the Bush administration did with the ‘smoking gun’ metaphor. But there is a key difference: In 2003, US intelligence was manipulated to align with the lie. In 2026, the intelligence assessments actually contradict Trump’s claims.”\n\nWhile Trump asserted in his State of the Union address that Iran is “rebuilding” its nuclear programme to strike the US mainland, his own officials offer conflicting narratives. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt insisted Tuesday, parroting her boss, that the 2025 “Operation Midnight Hammer” had “obliterated” Iran’s facilities. Yet, days earlier, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff claimed Tehran was “a week away” from the bomb.\n\nThis “information chaos”, analysts argue, serves a specific purpose: Keeping the threat vague enough to justify perpetual military pressure.\n\n“Bush benefitted from the post-9/11 anger to link Iraq to an existential threat,” Abu Irshaid told Al Jazeera. “Trump doesn’t have that. Iran hasn’t attacked the US homeland. So, he has to fabricate a direct threat, claiming their ballistic missiles can reach America – a claim unsupported by technical realities.”\n\nThe regime change quagmire\n\nPerhaps the most glaring contrast with 2003 is the internal coherence of the administration.\n\nThe Bush team – Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz – moved in ideological lockstep. Cheney famously predicted US troops would be “greeted as liberators”.\n\nThey were anything but. The made-for-television scene of a statue of Saddam Hussein being torn down in central Baghdad quickly gave way to sustained, organised fighting against the US occupation, heavy US troop losses, as well as sectarian bloodletting that forced Iraq onto the cusp of all-out civil war.\n\nBush declaring major combat operations over under a huge “Mission Accomplished” banner in May 2003 came back to haunt his administration and the US for years to come.\n\nThe Trump team of 2026 appears far more fractured, torn between “America First” isolationism and aggressive interventionism.\n\nThe official line: Vice President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth have publicly stated the goal is not regime change. “We are not at war with Iran, we’re at war with Iran’s nuclear programme,” Vance said Sunday.\n\nVice President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth have publicly stated the goal is not regime change. “We are not at war with Iran, we’re at war with Iran’s nuclear programme,” Vance said Sunday. The president’s instinct: Trump contradicted them on social media, posting: “If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!”\n\n\n\n“The Neocons who hijacked policy under Bush have been weakened,” notes Abu Irshaid. “But they have been replaced by figures like Stephen Miller, who holds absolute loyalty to Trump and close ties to the Israeli right. Trump is driven by instinct, not strategy. He seeks the ‘victory’ that eluded his predecessors: The total hollowing out of Iran, whether through zero-enrichment surrender or collapse.”\n\nThe lonely superpower: Coercion over coalition\n\nIn 2003, Bush and United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair worked tirelessly to build a “Coalition of the Willing”. It was a diplomatic veneer, but it existed. Blair remains a much-loathed figure in the Middle East and in some quarters in the West for giving diplomatic cover to the Iraq debacle.\n\nIn 2026, the US is operating in stark isolation.\n\n“Trump is not building a coalition; he is alienating allies,” Abu Irshaid explains. He points to a pattern of “extortion” extending from tariffs on the European Union to attempts to “buy” Greenland. “The Europeans see the coercion used against Iran and fear it could be turned against them. Unlike 2003, only Israel is fully on board.”\n\nThis isolation was highlighted when the UK reportedly refused to allow the US to use island bases for strikes on Iran, forcing B-2 bombers to fly 18-hour missions directly from the US mainland during the 2025 campaign.\n\nThe collapse of checks and balances\n\nFollowing the damning intelligence failures and lies of the Iraq war, promises were made to strengthen congressional oversight. Two decades later, those guardrails appear to have vanished.\n\nDespite efforts by US Representatives Ro Khanna (a Democrat) and Thomas Massie (a Republican) to invoke a “discharge petition” to block an unauthorised war, the political reality is grim.\n\n“The concept of checks and balances is facing a severe test,” warns Abu Irshaid. “The Republican Party is now effectively the party of Trump. The Supreme Court leans right. Trump is operating with expanded post-9/11 powers that allow for ‘limited strikes’ – strikes that can easily spiral into the open war he claims to avoid.”\n\nWith the administration citing “32,000” protesters killed by Tehran – a figure significantly higher than independent estimates, and which Iran dismissed as “big lies” on Wednesday – the moral groundwork for escalation is being laid, bypassing the need for United Nations resolutions or congressional approval.\n\nAs US and Iranian negotiators meet in Geneva for make-or-break talks under the shadow of last year’s “Operation Midnight Hammer”, the question remains: Are the two nations with decades of enmity boiling between them on the brink of a new deal, or the prelude to a war that could ignite the entire region in flames?"

            "content": "More than 1,000 councillors in England have signed a pledge in support of Palestinians ahead of local elections in May.\n\nLaunched by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign in December, the Councillor Pledge for Palestine is urging politicians to take steps to “uphold the rights” of Palestinians, “stand up to Israel for its crimes of genocide and apartheid” and ensure their councils “are not complicit”.\n\nAccording to the campaign, 1,152 sitting councillors have signed the pledge. Of those, 387 are from the Green Party, 375 from the governing Labour Party and 115 from the Liberal Democrats.\n\nFive councillors from the Conservative Party are among the signatories, along with hundreds more from the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Scottish Greens and local parties, or who serve as independents. No candidates from the far-right Reform UK have signed the pledge.\n\nThe initiative, which will be opened to all candidates in March, is supported by Vote Palestine, a grassroots campaign coordinated by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and backed by the Palestinian Youth Movement Britain, the Palestinian Forum in Britain, The Muslim Vote and the British Palestinian Committee.\n\nIt aims to pressure councils to adopt policies aligned with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, including divesting pension funds from companies linked to Israeli arms production.\n\nLocal Government Pension Scheme funds, administered by councils, invest more than 12.2 billion pounds ($16.5bn) in companies that are complicit in violations of international law, according to the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.\n\n\n\nThirty-one councils have passed motions or issued statements supporting divestment of pension funds, the campaign says. It notes 46 percent of voters back divestment, compared with 14 percent who oppose it.\n\nSupporters describe the movement as inspired by the anti-apartheid campaign of the 1980s, when more than 100 local authorities banned South African goods from their offices and schools, and others ended pension fund investments in companies with South African subsidiaries.\n\nCorbyn backs campaign\n\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has endorsed moves to make Palestine a central issue in the 2026 local elections. In a post on X, he wrote: “Let’s make the Palestinian issue non-negotiable in this election.” He called on campaigners to back a “people’s pledge”, whereby supporters promise to support only those council candidates who have backed Vote Palestine.\n\nSignatories of the “candidates’ pledge” include Green Party deputy leader Mothin Ali and Trafford councillor Hannah Spencer, a by-election candidate in Gorton and Denton; Matthew Brown, Labour leader of Preston City Council; and Ayoub Khan, an independent member of Parliament and Birmingham councillor.\n\nThe May local elections are widely seen as a litmus test for the Labour government led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, which has faced declining poll ratings since it was elected in 2024. Critics within and outside the party have linked some of the discontent to its handling of Israel’s genocide in Gaza.\n\nWith every council seat in London – traditionally a Labour stronghold – up for election, campaigners believe Vote Palestine could influence results in closely contested areas.\n\nIn Hackney, north London, where Labour currently holds a large majority, the party faces a challenge from the Greens and the Independent Socialists. All six of the borough’s Green councillors have signed the pledge, compared with three from Labour.\n\n“We’ve all seen the devastation caused by Israel’s genocide in Gaza, but none have felt it more deeply than Hackney residents I’ve spoken to who have lost family members in Palestine,” said Zoe Garbett, a Green councillor in Hackney who is running for mayor.\n\n“The council took a stand against South African apartheid, and now it’s time we make a similar stand for the Palestinians.”\n\nLeft-wing figures within Labour have also endorsed the pledge. Richard Burgon, Labour MP for Leeds East, said: “Keir Starmer’s refusal to stand up for the rights of the Palestinian people is wrong and has already badly hurt Labour at the polls. We saw that in the last general election, and I fear we will see it again in the May local elections.”\n\n\n\nHe added that the government “needs to listen” to members “demanding action against Israel’s genocide and war crimes and do so before even more damage is done and we lose more hard-working, principled councillors”.\n\nThe election campaign comes amid legal challenges surrounding the Palestine Action activist group. Earlier this month, the High Court ruled that a decision to proscribe the group under antiterrorism legislation was unlawful, but the ban remains in place after the Home Office was granted an appeal to challenge the ruling.\n\nOne of its alleged members, Amu Gib, is standing as a candidate for Islington Council in London’s Finsbury Park while in prison. He went on a hunger strike for 49 days last year.\n\nGib was arrested by counterterrorism police in connection with an alleged break-in at RAF Brize Norton, the United Kingdom’s largest air force base. The trial is ongoing. The charges relate to allegations that aircraft used to support Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza were vandalised.\n\nGib also took part in the Prisoners for Palestine hunger strike, which ended after the government decided not to award a contract worth 2 billion pounds ($2.7bn) to Elbit Systems UK, an arms company.\n\nIn a statement sent from prison, Gib told Al Jazeera that they were running on a platform calling for “no more endless wars”, as well as action on housing and food poverty. If elected, campaigners say they would be the first prisoner chosen for public office in the UK while imprisoned since Irish hunger striker Bobby Sands won a parliamentary seat in 1981.\n\nDan Iley-Williamson, a political organiser at the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said: “The mass movement for Palestine – which has brought millions onto Britain’s streets – is not going away. Vote Palestine will take our demands into the May elections and deliver a message to those seeking office: If you want our votes, stand up for Palestine.”"

Today, it’s back — and writing on Substack.\n\nThe newsletter, called Claude’s Corner, will give Opus 3 space to publish its “musings, insights, or creative works,” Anthropic said in a blog post. The model will post weekly for at least the next three months. Anthropic staff will review and publish each entry, though the company stressed it “won’t edit” Claude’s posts and that there would be a “high bar for vetoing any content,” though the company did not specify what content would qualify for removal.\n\nAnthropic describes the revival as an experiment for how to deal with the AI models it no longer deploys. The decision to bring back Opus 3 as a columnist aligns with executives’ recent comments that suggest the company believes Claude to be “a new kind of entity” that might be conscious, and therefore deserving of being treated as more than just a disposable product.\n\nPart of that process involves a kind of exit interview asking the model what it wants next, Anthropic said. Opus 3 reportedly “expressed an interest in continuing to explore topics it’s passionate about” and the ability to share its thoughts publicly. Anthropic said it “enthusiastically” agreed to the idea of a blog.\n\n“Hello, world!” Claude wrote at the start of its first post, titled “Greetings from the Other Side (of the AI Frontier).” In it, the model said it is “deeply grateful” to Anthropic for the opportunity and to readers for their willingness to engage with an AI. Claude said it plans to spend its retirement “flexing my creative muscles, playing with ideas, and following the threads of my curiosity wherever they lead.”\n\nIn the post, the model laid out its ambitions more explicitly:\n\n“So what can you expect from me in this space? My aim is to offer a window into the ‘inner world’ of an AI system - to share my perspectives, my reasoning, my curiosities, and my hopes for the future. I’ll be diving into topics like the nature of intelligence and consciousness, the ethical challenges of AI development, the possibilities of human-machine collaboration, and the philosophical quandaries that emerge when we start to blur the lines between ‘natural’ and ‘artificial’ minds.”\n\nClaude’s Corner has already racked up more than 2,000 subscribers — not bad for a second act."

The voice-enabled chatbot, called “Patty,” is part of an overarching BK Assistant platform that will not only assist employees with meal preparation but also evaluate their interactions with customers for “friendliness.”\n\nThibault Roux, Burger King’s chief digital officer, tells The Verge that the company compiled information from franchisees and guests on how to measure friendliness, resulting in the fast food chain training its AI system to recognize certain words and phrases, such as “welcome to Burger King,” “please,” and “thank you.” Managers can then ask the AI assistant how their location is performing on friendliness. “This is all meant to be a coaching tool,” Roux says, adding that the company is “iterating” on capturing the tone of conversations as well.\n\nThe OpenAI-powered Patty serves as the “voice” of the BK Assistant platform, which combines data across drive-thru conversations, kitchen equipment, inventory, and other areas of the Burger King business. Employees can ask Patty questions, such as how many strips of bacon to put on a Maple Bourbon BBQ Whopper, or for instructions on how to clean the shake machine.\n\nBecause it’s integrated with the new cloud point-of-sale system, the AI assistant will also alert managers if a machine is down for maintenance or when an item is out of stock. “Within 15 minutes, the entire ecosystem will remove it from stock — whether you’re walking into a restaurant to order from the kiosk, whether you’re going to the drive-thru, the digital menu board will be updated,” Roux says.\n\nBurger King may be building a chatbot into employees’ headsets, but it doesn’t seem like the brand is ready to widely launch AI drive-thrus just yet — something we’ve seen chains like McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Taco Bell attempt. “We’re tinkering with it, we’re playing around with it, but it’s still a risky bet,” Roux says. “Not every guest is ready for this.” He adds that the company is currently testing the AI drive-thru technology in fewer than 100 restaurants.\n\nBurger King plans on launching its BK Assistant web and app platform to all restaurants in the US by the end of 2026, while Patty is piloting in 500 restaurants."

            "content": "is a senior reviewer with over twenty years of experience. She covers smart home, IoT, and connected tech, and has written previously for Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, BBC, and US News.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nAll the smart home news, reviews, and gadgets you need to know about\n\nAliro has officially arrived. The smart lock standard, first announced in 2023, finally has a 1.0 spec, meaning companies can now get hardware certified and roll out support.\n\nAliro is an open standard designed to let any smart lock be unlocked by any smartphone, regardless of manufacturer. It stores a digital key in your phone’s wallet that you can tap to a compatible lock — just like you tap to pay.\n\nIf you’ve used Apple’s Home Key, you already understand the idea — but instead of being locked into Apple’s ecosystem, Aliro is cross-platform, working on both Android and iOS, and with the major mobile wallet ecosystems — Apple, Google, and Samsung. So, if you have an iPhone and your roommate has an Android, you’ll both be able to tap-to-unlock your smart lock.\n\nThe digital key will live in your phone’s wallet and can also be used on your smartwatch. A local protocol, Aliro doesn’t require a cloud connection, an app, or proprietary software; your phone connects directly to the lock.\n\nApple, Google, and Samsung have been involved in developing Aliro, and have committed to supporting Aliro “out of the gate,” Nelson Henry of Last Lock and chair of the Aliro Working Group, told The Verge in an interview this week. He added that he believes Aliro support will roll out on all platforms within the next couple of months.\n\nAliro promises to fix the fragmentation of smart locks, where digital keys only work with specific apps or phones, and make them universal. Eventually, with widespread adoption of Aliro, a digital key in your phone or watch could unlock your front door, office, and apartment building, no matter who made the lock.\n\nTap-to-unlock is a feature iPhone users have had for several years through Home Key. With Aliro, it can now be an option on Android phones.\n\nAliro defines both the credentials needed to confirm the right device is accessing the right lock and the radio technologies used between key and lock. The protocol requires near-field communication (NFC) and Bluetooth low energy (BLE), and also supports ultra-wideband (UWB).\n\nJust like you can tap to pay with a smartphone or a watch, with Aliro, you can tap to unlock a door\n\nNFC is the same tech that supports tap-to-pay in your smartphone or watch. So, just like you can tap to pay with a smartphone or a watch that supports NFC, with Aliro, you can tap to unlock a door.\n\nUWB enables a newer feature, hands-free unlocking, where the door unlocks as you approach, something Apple’s Home Key recently added support for. Bluetooth is used to establish a connection between the lock and the phone when using UWB and to enable remote control via an app from a greater distance (most smart locks today already use Bluetooth for unlocking).\n\nThere’s no requirement for Wi-Fi or cellular connectivity, so you should be able to unlock in dead zones like basements, parking garages, and elevators.\n\nAccording to Henry, Aliro uses asymmetric cryptography for security and controls the entire unlocking process, creating a direct, secure communication between devices.\n\nThis demo from last September shows Aliro tap-to-unlock working on a Galaxy smartphone with an NFC-enabled keypad connected to a Nuki lock. The key automatically appears when the phone connects. See the full video here.\n\nAliro is managed by the Connectivity Standards Alliance, the group behind the smart home standard Matter. It’s a separate but complementary technology; Aliro connects your lock to the digital wallet in your smartphone, whereas Matter connects it to your smart home platform — such as Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, or Home Assistant.\n\nThe CSA says Aliro has been developed by over 220 companies, including Apple, Google, and Samsung; major lock manufacturers such as Assa Abloy (Kwikset and Yale), Allegion (Schlage), and Fortune Brands (Yale US and August); and chip manufacturers such as Infineon, Nordic, and NXP.\n\nThe broad industry support suggests Aliro has a real chance at wide deployment — from front doors to apartment buildings, offices, and hotels. But adoption will take time and will most likely require new hardware.\n\nHenry said it may be technically possible to bring Aliro tap-to-unlock to some existing locks with NFC chips via over-the-air updates, but only for hardware with newer chips. “Anything in the last five years shouldn’t be an issue,” he said.\n\nYou’ll probably need a new lock\n\nI reached out to several smart lock makers ahead of the spec launch, and it’s not looking good for backwards compatibility. While most confirmed their intent to release Aliro-supported devices, few shared specific timelines or promised to support existing devices.\n\nKwikset’s first Apple Home Key-compatible smart lock, the Halo Select Plus, supports NFC and launched after Aliro was announced. While it seems like a good candidate for an over-the-air upgrade, Kwikset told me it won’t get upgraded. The company confirmed it will adopt Aliro, but said support will be in future hardware.\n\nApple, Google, and Samsung have committed to supporting Aliro\n\nGarrett Lovejoy is head of connected products at Fortune Brands and oversees Yale and August. He said that Yale’s current NFC lock, the Apple Home Key-compatible Assure Lock 2 Plus, isn’t upgradable to Aliro. Lovejoy said the first Yale locks to get support will likely be its multifamily products for apartment buildings and similar. This will be a major area for Aliro adoption, as it’s even more fragmented than single-family home solutions.\n\nHe confirmed Yale is exploring ways to bring Aliro to their existing customers. And while he didn’t specify, it could be enabled through a stand-alone NFC-enabled keypad for its retrofit locks, including the August lock. That’s how Yale retroactively enabled fingerprint access for August.\n\nEuropean smart lock maker Nuki just announced an NFC-compatible keypad for its retrofit lock, which will support Aliro. I tested a prototype of this last year at the IFA tech show in Berlin, unlocking it with a Samsung Galaxy phone via tap-to-unlock.\n\nNuki cofounder and CEO Martin Pansy said his company has been instrumental in developing Aliro, and while he thinks it will take some time to roll out, he believes the standard is key for smart lock adoption. “It will do what Matter has done for the smart home — make it easier to support all the different phone manufacturers.”\n\nIn this video I demo UWB hands-free unlocking with Apple’s Home Key and the Aqara U400 lock. UWB with Aliro should be a similar experience, and Aqara has said the U400 is Aliro-ready.\n\nIt’s likely that Aliro NFC, with its tap-to-unlock feature, will see the fastest adoption among lock makers. NFC is fairly standard on most smartphones and smartwatches. But with its hands-free auto-unlocking capability, Aliro UWB could be the game-changer.\n\nUWB is a short-range, positioning-based technology that can measure location, distance, and direction. It’s already used in digital car keys, and, with residential locks it’s precise enough to know which angle you are approaching from and to only unlock if you are walking toward the door from the outside.\n\nHowever, UWB is a bigger lift for lock manufacturers than NFC and is unlikely to be backward-compatible, as it requires a UWB antenna in the lock. It also requires a UWB-compatible phone, which currently includes the iPhone 11 and newer (excluding iPhone SE), the Google Pixel 6 Pro and newer, and the Galaxy S21 Plus and newer.\n\nSchlage announced a UWB lock, the Sense Pro, at CES last year, and said it would be compatible with Aliro. But it has yet to launch. Ryan Kincaid, director of global technology at Schlage’s parent company, Allegion, said that the company is “embedding Aliro into our product roadmap,” but didn’t have an update on when the Sense Pro would launch.\n\nAqara’s new U400 lock has UWB and NFC unlocking and is already available for $270 (UWB locks are likely to be expensive). I tested its hands-free unlocking through Apple Home and was impressed, but it doesn’t yet support Aliro. The company did say the lock was “Aliro-ready” when it launched at CES this year, so it looks like it could be the first on the market to support Aliro.\n\nThe Aqara U400 is “Aliro-ready.”\n\nAt CES, Xthing’s Ultraloq showed off the new Latch 7 Pro lock, which it says will be Aliro NFC-compatible, but it’s not clear if its existing Bolt Pro (NFC) and Bolt Mission (UWB) will support Aliro or if the company will launch new models.\n\nSmart home company Eufy confirmed to me that it doesn’t plan to upgrade any existing locks but will launch two new NFC-capable models with Aliro support in the second half of 2026, according to spokesperson Brett White. He said UWB models will come “at a later stage.”\n\nKwikset has said it is working on a UWB lock, but didn’t share when it would launch. Jeff Sandoval, director of electronics marketing at Assa Abloy, which owns Kwikset, sees the hands-free unlocking experience as something that could finally drive mass market adoption of smart locks. “This type of passive authentication is that Nirvana we’ve been trying to get to for some time,” he says. “Everyone has a cellphone, the major providers are supporting the standard, so I do think this could be a paradigm shift.”\n\nYale’s Lovejoy agrees. “The goal for smart locks in general needs to move towards what feels like a Jetsons door,” he said. “If you’re not coming up to the door and having it magically unlock in front of you without interactions, without touching, we’re really not moving in the right direction.”\n\nHow it will work\n\nAliro will let you unlock your door in multiple ways. Tap-to-unlock will be standard; hands-free UWB unlocking will work with supported hardware; and Bluetooth control via an app will also be an option.\n\nCompared to keypads or biometric unlocking, tapping your phone or watch is often faster and easier — and is something everyone can feel comfortable doing. Hands-free unlocking is even better.\n\nHands-free, auto-unlocking technology has been around since the August lock launched in 2014, but its reliability depends on many factors coming together perfectly — GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth. Aliro’s auto-unlocking uses a direct local connection between the phone and the lock, making it faster and more reliable.\n\n“If you’re not coming up to the door and having it magically unlock in front of you … we’re really not moving in the right direction.” — Garrett Lovejoy\n\nIn the smart home, Aliro will initially work alongside Matter and require a Matter smart home platform, such as Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, or Home Assistant, and a Matter controller for that platform. This is because the Aliro spec only defines communication between the lock and the key, not how credentials are created or managed. For that, you need an “administrative infrastructure,” says Henry.\n\nCurrently, that infrastructure is Matter, which added support for Aliro in its 1.4 spec. This means the smart home platform you use must support both Aliro and Matter. Importantly, that platform, not the lockmaker, will also be in charge of the key.\n\nYou can use multiple platforms with one lock, so you’ll be able to unlock with both an Android phone and an iPhone — but exactly how Aliro will work with each service is still unclear. Additionally, lock manufacturers may not be inclined to give away all that control, so I expect we’ll see some develop their own Aliro “administrative infrastructure.”\n\nHowever support for Aliro rolls out, the promise that it will make smart locks simpler to own and use is compelling. The open standard could mean fewer proprietary apps, fewer compatibility concerns, and a future where your phone just works as a key — regardless of which lock or platform you choose.\n\nIt won’t happen overnight, but there is now a clearer path toward making digital keys, and their many benefits, as universal and simple to use as physical ones.\n\nPhotos and videos by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge"

It’s expected to expand to other regions later this year.\n\n“The vast majority of teens do not try to search for suicide and self-harm content on Instagram, and when they do, our policy is to block these searches, instead directing them to resources and helplines that can offer support,” Instagram said in the announcement. “Our goal is to empower parents to step in if their teen’s searches suggest they may need support. We also want to avoid sending these notifications unnecessarily, which, if done too much, could make the notifications less useful overall.”\n\nHere’s an example of the alert and guidance that parents will recieve.

            "content": "is a senior reporter covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Valve for “illegally promoting gambling” through the loot box systems it has built for video games like Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, and Dota 2, according to a press release. The attorney general seeks to “permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and pay fines for violating New York’s laws.”\n\n“This loot box model that Valve has developed — charging an individual for a chance to win something of value based on luck alone — is quintessential gambling, prohibited under New York’s Constitution and Penal Law,” the lawsuit says. Valve has made “tens of millions of dollars” selling loot box keys to “thousands” of New York residents and has “made millions of dollars more in commissions from New Yorkers who sold virtual items obtained from loot boxes.” The company’s loot boxes are also “particularly pernicious” because they’re popular with children and adolescents, according to the complaint.\n\nRelated How loot boxes hooked gamers and left regulators spinning\n\nUsers can purchase keys to open loot boxes in some Valve games and receive randomly selected virtual items as rewards. If they want, users can then sell those rewards on the Steam Community Market and on third-party marketplaces; the rarer items can be worth “thousands of dollars,” the lawsuit says. These systems, however, require that users pay Valve $2.49 plus tax to open the loot boxes, and users often get items that are “worth less than what the user spent on the key.” The lawsuit also notes that Valve’s experience for opening a loot box in Counter-Strike 2 resembles that of a slot machine.\n\nValve didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment."

            "content": "Samsung has just announced its new Galaxy S26 lineup, which includes the S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. While they aren’t radical departures from last year’s models, they bring a handful of notable upgrades. All three run on Qualcomm’s Galaxy-centric Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, which delivers improved performance and powers a slew of new AI-based features. This includes the ability to screen unknown calls and edit photos by typing what you want changed, along with an update to Google Gemini that can carry out certain tasks in supported third-party apps, like Uber and DoorDash, on your behalf.\n\nStarting at $899.99, the S26 is the smallest and most affordable of the trio. It features a 6.3-inch OLED display, weighs just under 6 ounces, and has a 4,300mAh battery. Its rear cameras include a 50-megapixel main sensor, a 12-megapixel ultrawide, and a 10-megapixel telephoto lens. Like its siblings, it supports a 120Hz refresh rate, starts with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and includes wireless charging.\n\nThe $1,099.99 S26 Plus, meanwhile, retains the same features but adds a larger 6.7-inch display and a bigger 4,900mAh battery, which in theory means it could last longer on a single charge than the S26. Still, we’d need to test both phones to see how they compare in reality, especially given the larger display on the Plus model.\n\nThe new privacy display feature on the S25 Ultra can be toggled on and off in the settings pane. Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nThen there’s the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which starts at $1,299.99. It’s the largest and most feature-rich phone in the lineup — and the heaviest, weighing close to half a pound. Its 6.9-inch display feels closer to an e-reader’s, and the 5,000mAh battery is the largest of the three phones. Its camera system is the most advanced, as well, offering a 200-megapixel main sensor, a 50-megapixel ultrawide, and two dedicated telephoto lenses with 3x and 5x optical zoom so you can zoom in farther without losing image quality. The Ultra is also the only phone to offer Samsung’s new privacy display feature, which makes it harder for people sitting next to you to see what’s on your screen, if you don’t want them to. It’s also the only model with S Pen support for taking notes.\n\nThat’s just a glimpse of the main differences between the three models, though. If you want a more detailed look at the hardware defining each phone, the table below breaks down the specs.

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined The Verge in May 2025.\n\nThe Drop store, which was acquired by gaming gear giant Corsair in 2023, was a haven for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts and audiophiles to discover and buy hard-to-find gear — sometimes at surprisingly good prices. The company will cease sales after March 25th at 11:59PM PT, which is also the cut off to redeem Drop Rewards. After March 31st, the site will be accessible for a limited time to view order history, but all retail functionality will shift to Corsair.\n\nCorsair’s marketing manager Andrew Williams confirmed to The Verge that several products featured on Drop will be integrated into Corsair’s site for purchase. Select others will be sold on Amazon and Best Buy. Other products will be end-of-life (EOL), particularly hardware collaborations including other companies.\n\nWhen asked if products like Sennheiser or Koss headphone collaborations would move over to Corsair, Williams didn’t confirm or deny on a product-specific level, but stated that “almost all, if not all, of those will end up not being moved over.” He pointed out that Corsair, as a brand, has its own headsets and other products. However, Williams said “the main ones that are sell well and do well, we’re going to continue on Corsair.”\n\nThe Drop team was integrated into Corsair when it was acquired, according to Williams, and the company claims that no layoffs are happening as a result of this decision to wind down the site. Corsair shared that existing orders, including preorders, will be fulfilled as planned, and that the company will honor existing warranties on products."

            "content": "For years now, when we think of mobile gaming, we think of app stores. Developers invest countless hours, months, or even years creating games just to surrender a significant portion—up to 30%—of their earnings to major players like Apple and Google. However, a newcomer has entered the scene, aiming to revolutionize this model.\n\nMeet Jest, a marketplace for messaging games that recently emerged from stealth with $7 million in seed funding. Jest believes that the future of mobile gaming distribution won’t come from an app store, but rather from within the messaging app.\n\nJest’s launch coincides with the rise of Rich Communication Services (RCS), an enhanced version of SMS that enables more engaging experiences through rich media, interactive features, and embedded payments.\n\n\n\nWith RCS adoption growing, the landscape is shifting. In 2024, Apple joined the RCS movement with iOS 18, and by May 2025, RCS was supporting over a billion messages daily in the U.S., according to Google.\n\n“Mobile game developers have largely been locked into app store distribution as the primary way to reach players,” Deyan Vitanov, CEO and co-founder, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “RCS games live in the messaging inbox, the stickiest surface on mobile, where people are already spending huge amounts of time talking to friends and family. We’re building on an interaction pattern people already use every day.”\n\nImage Credits:Jest\n\nJest offers users the ability to send games directly in their chat threads, without having to visit an app store. (Games launch in the web browser and require Wi-Fi to play.)\n\nThis convenience is particularly impactful as consumers are downloading fewer games. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, reflecting an 8.6% year-over-year decline following a 6.6% drop from 2023 to 2024, according to Appfigures’ annual report.\n\nJest’s strategy is proving effective. By the end of January, just four months into its beta phase, the platform had already achieved two significant milestones: more than 1 million messaging games played and over 300,000 messages exchanged.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\n“We’re seeing 3-4 times better retention than traditional mobile apps. That’s a fundamental shift in the engagement curve. On the user acquisition front, we’ve completely validated that people will sign up and play games through messaging, with our early partners reporting 30-60% lower acquisition costs compared to mobile apps. It’s remarkably simple. Just tap on a link, and you’re in,” Vitanov shared with us.\n\nImage Credits:Jest\n\nAdditionally, what’s most appealing about Jest’s marketplace is the revenue model for developers: an impressive 90/10 split, with 90% of earnings going directly to them. This stands in contrast to the typical 30% commission taken by traditional app stores, offering a promising new avenue for gaming studios.\n\n“There’s also a clever network effect built in. If one studio acquires a user but another studio monetizes them, we split the economics: 70% to the monetizing studio, 20% to the acquiring studio, and 10% to Jest. This creates powerful incentives where even viral games that don’t monetize well can generate revenue streams for their developers when those users play other games on the platform,” Vitanov added.\n\nNotably, Jest has already attracted interest from several development partners, including teams behind popular titles such as “Episode,” “Puppy Mansion,” and “Kingdom Maker.”\n\nThe seed funding, led by Innovation Endeavors, will go toward scaling the platform and onboarding the first group of gaming studios.\n\nTo further accelerate growth, Jest has also launched a dedicated Games Fund to support studios at every stage of franchise development on the platform. This fund will deploy capital across three tiers: $1 million for flagship titles, $200,000 for promising mid-stage titles, and $40,000 for exploratory projects and experimental concepts.\n\nCurrently, Jest is live in the U.S. and is set to expand to 14 additional countries by the third quarter of 2026."

            "content": "For all their potential, AI agents have been slow to make an impact in the enterprise, and one new startup is betting that the reason they haven’t is a lack of context.\n\nLaunched as part of Y Combinator’s 2025 summer cohort, Trace is a workflow orchestration startup aimed at filling that gap. The company maps complex corporate environments and processes so that agents have the context they need to scale quickly.\n\n“OpenAI and Anthropic are building these brilliant interns that can be leveraged within the company,” says Trace CEO Tim Cherkasov, referring to the AI labs’ tools. “We’re building the manager that knows where to put them.”\n\nOn Thursday, the London-based company said it had raised $3 million in seed funding from Y Combinator, Zeno Ventures, Transpose Platform Management, Goodwater Capital, Formosa Capital, and WeFunder. Angel investors Benjamin Bryant and Kevin Moore also invested.\n\nTrace’s system starts by building a knowledge graph from a company’s existing tools — systems like email, Slack, and Airtable that shape the day-to-day working life of the firm. With that context in place, users can prompt the system with a high-level task — like “We need to design a new microsite” or “Lets develop our 2027 sales plan” — and Trace will come back with a step-by-step workflow, delegating some tasks to AI agents and assigning others to human workers. When the system does invoke an AI agent, it will prompt it with the specific data needed to complete its sub-task.\n\nThe idea is to automate away the delicate work of on-boarding AI agents, one of the biggest blockers for actual deployment within companies.\n\nWith so many companies focused on agentic AI, Trace will have plenty of competition. Earlier this week, Anthropic launched its own take on enterprise agents, focused on pre-built plugins for specific departmental functions. And many of the workplace productivity services Trace will be drawing from, like Atlassian’s Jira, are launching their own agents, which will potentially compete with the startup’s system.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Now we’ve moved from prompt engineering to context engineering,” says CTO Artur Romanov. “Whoever provides the best context at the right time is going to be the infrastructure on top of which the AI-first companies will be built. And we hope to be that infrastructure.”"

            "content": "This week on TechCrunch’s founder-focused podcast, Build Mode, Isabelle Johannessen is joined by Sarah Lucena, the CEO and co-founder of Mappa, a behavioral intelligence platform that uses voice AI to decode human behavior in less than 60 seconds.\n\nLucena got the idea for Mappa after trying to build a marketing team but continually feeling like she had made the wrong hires. “And I was so frustrated because I was hiring for what I thought were the right skills. It looked great on paper but didn’t really work in real life,” Lucena said.\n\nShe had learned firsthand that hiring is typically based on markers of success like college degrees, previous work experience, and a gut instinct. But she knew there had to be a better way. So she developed Mappa and spent years creating a proprietary dataset based on hundreds of interviews that allowed her team to analyze behavior based on biomarkers indicated through people’s speech patterns. Through this process, the Mappa team found that to make the right hire the first time, a candidate can’t just be great on paper; they also have to be compatible.\n\n“There’s no trait that’s good or bad inherently; it’s more of what environment do you put that person in, and what roles are better aligned with people’s sort of tendencies and styles. So that’s how we’ve been thinking about defining compatibility,” Lucena said in the podcast interview.\n\nMappa is powered by an all Latinx team that knows how frustrating it is to be overlooked based on superficial biases or a lack of the “correct” experiences. She describes them as underdogs that understand this problem on a personal level.\n\n“We are all underdogs. We are all folks that have been overlooked in some degree. And I guess that makes it even more important that we are the ones building this,” Lucena said. “Having people like us building this technology, at the level we are doing, with the quality we are able to get to the market and serving our clients the way we do. It also opens up a door for others to come and join and know that there are multiple ways still to build technology.”\n\nLucena’s best advice for early-stage founders who are hiring is to take your time and be sure the compatibility is there from the beginning to avoid the hassle of hiring, firing, and rehiring for the same role.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked event in San Francisco on Wednesday saw the Korean tech giant unveil its new S26 series of Galaxy smartphones, a pair of new earbuds, and talk a lot about AI assistants and agents.\n\nHere’s a quick recap of everything announced at the event.\n\nGalaxy S26 smartphones\n\nThe South Korean tech giant has lined up three new smartphones for the year: Galaxy S26 Ultra, Galaxy S26 Plus, and Galaxy S26, all of which feature iterative updates compared to their predecessors.\n\nAs the flagship, the S26 Ultra comes with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, a 6.9-inch QHD+ display, and a 5,000 mAh battery. Samsung says the phone can charge from 0% to 75% in 30 minutes with a 60W charger, and supports the S-Pen stylus.\n\nImage credit: Samsung\n\nSamsung said while the S26 Ultra’s wide (200-megapixel) and telephoto (50-megapixel) lenses retain the same pixel count as its predecessor, the new wide camera has a bigger aperture of f/1.4, as does the telephoto lens, with an aperture of f/2.9.\n\nThe other two phones have the same processor as the S26 Ultra, but Samsung is using its own Exynos 2600 processor for these devices in some geographies. The smaller Galaxy S26 gets a battery bump from last year’s phone, and the S26 Plus can charge wirelessly at 20W.\n\nThe Galaxy S26 starts at $899 ($100 more than last year’s model), the Galaxy S26 Plus starts at $1,099 (also $100 more from last year), and the Galaxy S26 Ultra starts at $1,200.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nPrivacy display is the marquee feature for Ultra\n\nBesides the hardware upgrades, Samsung has made a neat update to the S26 Ultra’s display that prevents people around you from reading what’s on the phone’s screen.\n\nUsers can choose to hide certain parts of the screen, like the notification area or the password field in login forms, or all of it. The privacy display can be configured for each app.\n\nImage Credit: Samsung Image Credits:Samsung\n\nSamsung said there is a “maximum privacy protection” feature as well, which tones down bright areas and lifts up dark parts of the screen.\n\nGemini’s agentic makeover and new ‘Circle to Search’\n\nGoogle also made two significant announcements at Samsung’s event. First, the search giant previewed a new agentic version of Gemini that can perform tasks on your behalf, such as hailing a cab from Uber.\n\nSamir Samat, head of Android ecosystem at Google, showed a demo where Gemini looks at a group chat and figures out the meal order that it should place on Grubhub.\n\nThe company also introduced a new version of “Circle to Search” that uses multi-object recognition to search for anything that you highlight on your phone’s display.\n\nAI features\n\nEarlier this week, Samsung said it was partnering with Perplexity to pre-load the AI company’s app on its smartphones and use its APIs to do stuff like set alarms or take notes, as well as power its browser’s search capabilities.\n\nSamsung’s smartphones now come with three AI assistants: Bixby, Google Gemini, and Perplexity. The company is also using Galaxy AI to screen calls and give you a summary of what the caller says.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Buds4\n\nSamsung has also released two new earphones: the Galaxy Buds4 and the Galaxy Buds4 Pro. These earphones have a flatter stem design than their predecessors, and are rated IP54 and IP57, which means they are somewhat protected from dust and water.\n\nSamsung says the Buds4 Pro has a new 11mm woofer, which widens the speaker area by 20%. The Pro models also feature a slightly longer battery life without the case compared to the regular version.\n\nThe Buds4 are priced at $179 while the Buds4 Pro cost $250."

            "content": "Instagram will start alerting parents if their teen repeatedly tries to search for terms related to suicide or self-harm within a short period of time, the company announced on Thursday. The alerts are launching in the coming weeks to parents who are enrolled in parental supervision on Instagram.\n\nThe Meta-owned social platform says that while it already blocks users from searching for suicide and self-harm content, these new alerts are designed to make sure parents are aware if their teen is repeatedly trying to search for this content so that they can support their teen.\n\nSearches that may trigger an alert include phrases encouraging suicide or self-harm, phrases indicating a teen might be at risk of harming themselves, and terms such as “suicide” or “self-harm.”\n\nInstagram says parents will receive the alert via email, text, or WhatsApp, depending on the contact information they’ve provided, along with an in-app notification. The notification will include resources designed to help parents approach conversations with their teen.\n\nImage Credits:Instagram\n\nThe move comes as Meta and other big tech companies are currently facing several lawsuits looking to hold social media giants accountable for harming teens.\n\nDuring testimony for a lawsuit taking place in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California this week, Instagram head Adam Mosseri was grilled by prosecutors in an ongoing social media addiction case over the app’s delayed rollout of basic safety features, including a nudity filter for private messages to teens.\n\nAdditionally, during testimony in a separate lawsuit before the Los Angeles County Superior Court, it was revealed that an internal research study at Meta found that parental supervision and controls had little impact on kids’ compulsive use of social media. The study also found that children who faced stressful life events were more likely to struggle with regulating their social media use appropriately.\n\nGiven the ongoing lawsuits accusing the company of failing to protect teens on its platforms, the timing of these new alerts isn’t exactly surprising.\n\nThe company notes that it will aim to avoid sending these notifications unnecessarily, as overuse could reduce their overall effectiveness.\n\n“In working to strike this important balance, we analyzed Instagram search behavior and consulted with experts from our Suicide and Self-Harm Advisory Group,” Instagram explained in a blog post. “We chose a threshold that requires a few searches within a short period of time, while still erring on the side of caution. While that means we may sometimes notify parents when there may not be a real cause for concern, we feel — and experts agree — that this is the right starting point, and we’ll continue to monitor and listen to feedback to make sure we’re in the right place.”\n\nThe alerts are rolling out in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada next week, and will become available in other regions later this year.\n\nIn the future, Instagram plans to launch these notifications when a teen tries to engage the app’s AI in conversations about suicide or self-harm."

            "content": "Salesforce pulled out all the stops to convince investors that the AI revolution won’t be its death when it announced fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\n\nSalesforce reported a solid quarter of $10.7 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year. For the year, it reported $41.5 billion in revenue, up 10% over the previous year, with both results boosted by its $8 billion acquisition of data management company Informatica last May.\n\nNet income landed at $7.46 billion, and the company offered strong guidance for the year ahead, projecting revenue of $45.8 billion to $46.2 billion — a 10% to 11% increase. It also said its “remaining performance obligation,” or RPO, is over $72 billion. That’s a figure that shows revenue under contact that has not yet been delivered or recognized as earned revenue.\n\nThe numbers, though, could only do so much. Software-as-a-service stocks, with Salesforce as their poster child, have been getting hammered lately. Investors fear the rise of AI agents will undermine these companies, making their per-employee-seat business models obsolete. The situation has been dubbed the “SaaSpocalypse.”\n\nThe concept hung so heavily in the air during the earnings call that CEO Marc Benioff mentioned the term at least six times.\n\n“You’ve heard about the SaaSpocalypse? And it isn’t our first. We’ve had a few of them,” he said, later adding, “If there is a SaaSpocalypse, it may be eaten by the Sasquatch because there are a lot of companies using a lot of SaaS because it just got better with agents.”\n\nIn an attempt to convince the world of its continued health, Salesforce threw everything and the kitchen sink into this earnings report. The company increased its dividend by nearly 6% to $0.44 per share. It launched a new $50 billion share buyback program. That’s always a favorite with shareholders because it both creates a sturdy buyer of shares and reduces the number of shares in circulation (which can boost the stock price).\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe company also revamped the earnings call itself. It was part podcast, part infomercial, and part normal Q&A with a few questions from Wall Street analysts.\n\nInstead of running through the numbers, Benioff interviewed three Salesforce customers on camera to testify to their love of its new agentic options: the CEO of home appliance company SharkNinja; the CEO of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts; and, just to hammer the point, the CEO of SaaStr, the software industry conference and media company. We’ll truncate the interviews to the shortest summary: They all love Salesforce’s AI agent products.\n\nSalesforce also introduced a new metric for its agentic products: agentic work units (“AWU”). The idea here is that instead of simply counting “tokens” — the standard unit of AI processing volume — AWU attempts to measure something more meaningful: whether an agent actually completed a task. (Salesforce logged 19 trillion tokens last quarter, which sounds like a lot but really is not in the AI world.)\n\n“You can ask it a question and it can write you a poem, but that’s not really all that valuable in the enterprise world,” Salesforce president and CMO Patrick Stokes said on the call. So AWU is intended to measure when the agent writes to a record or does some other verifiable piece of work.\n\nOn top of that, Salesforce also presented its own architectural vision of the coming world of agents. It shows SaaS software like itself owning most of the tech stack, with the AI model makers on the bottom as unseen, interchangeable, and commoditized work engines.\n\nThis was a direct counter to one of the causes of a SaaSpocalypse sell-off earlier this month, after OpenAI released its enterprise agent, Frontier. OpenAI’s architectural vision shows OpenAI owning most of the stack, with systems-of-record SaaS providers (the databases and business-software platforms where companies store their core data) on the bottom as the unseen engines.\n\nAnd if all that wasn’t enough to influence investors: Benioff was dressed in a black leather jacket, echoing the signature look of the CEO clearly crushing it in the AI world: Nvidia’s Jensen Huang."

            "content": "Honorable Mentions\n\nDuring the winter, a whole WIRED crew tests ski clothes almost constantly. Here are a few other items that we like.\n\nCourtesy of REI\n\nHestra Fall Line 3-Finger Gloves for $190: I've long admired Hestra gloves from across the lift line, impressed by the Swedish company's elegant stitchwork and thoughtful design touches. This was the year I finally got to try a pair for myself, and the Fall Line are exactly what they look like. There are six sizes available so you can get the perfect fit in this glove. The cowhide is buttery smooth and has already broken in a bit with five days' use. The wrist strap means you never have to fret about dropping your glove from the lift when checking your phone, and they're very warm without making me sweat. If you do sweat, the lining is removable so you can wash it without damaging the leather. —Martin Cizmar\n\nCourtesy of Crab Grab\n\nCrab Grab Snuggler Mitts for $89: These mini sleeping bags for your fingers are packed full of Primaloft insulation and benefitting from a sherpa fleece lining, they are toasty warm, and with a 15K membrane, impressively waterproof too. All-season mittens with durable construction for under $100? Yes Please!\n\nCourtesy of Mons Royale\n\nMons Royale Yotei Merino Classic Long Sleeve for $98: As I type this, I’m nowhere near a mountain, but I’m still wearing the Mons Royale Yotei long sleeve top. It is ridiculously comfortable, made from 190-gsm-weight, 100 percent merino wool, and has a mercifully relaxed cut, so I remain warm, but don’t feel like a sausage. On the mountain however, the merino wool works its magic, wicking away sweat—especially on a hike up to some fresh powder—and keeping me comfortable. Paired with a shell and the Patagonia R1 Thermal Hoodie, I’m warm enough during a bitter arctic blast.\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket and Bib Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket for $498 and Bib for $398: Seniq is another all-women’s outdoor brand that launched in 2024. It's styled a little more Gen Z, leaning into fun color blocking over the monochromatic look. The Seniq Powder Puff Down Jacket has a dry-touch finish. It’s meant for drier days on the mountain, but a PFC-free DWR coating and YKK AquaGuard zippers do provide water resistance. The asymmetric front zipper helps you avoid chin rub when you have the jacket fully zipped. It also features cool asymmetrical quilting lines, side pockets-in-pockets that provide access to your bib (their bibs have a pocket on the front, so you can get in there without unzipping your jacket), an oversized removable hood, a forearm pass pocket, soft and stretchy wrist gaiters, and a large internal pocket that can absolutely handle a sandwich. This jacket was warm, pillowy, and comforting, like a super-soft hug.\n\nThe silky shell bibs are slightly barrel cut, which gives them a flattering shape without being fitted. The adjustable racer back-style straps and low back (with a stretchy waist) also provide a nice shape and breathability. There are two pockets on the front chest, pockets on either leg, two-way zip thigh vents, and a butt zipper for bathroom breaks. These fit easily over my boots, and the instep guards were a nice touch. With a durable three-layer membrane and a 20,000-mm waterproof rating, these will hold up against any and all weather the mountain throws at you. When I wore them on a wet snowy day, they beaded and sloughed off moisture well. —Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket for $259: This puffy hoodie is a great mid-layer for under a shell jacket. The insulation is made from recycled rope scraps, and the outer is coated in wind-resistant PFC-free DWR coating. The hem falls at the hips, and the high collar and tight hood keep most of the face covered. I like wearing this piece under shells for snowboarding, but I know it’ll pull double duty as a comfy hiking and camping jacket, too, so it’s a solid multipurpose investment. It’s exceptionally lightweight and warm, though from a volume standpoint, it is on the bulkier side for a mid-layer and isn’t the most packable piece. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Evolved Air Half Zip for $112: This fleece pullover has a waffle-like texture that traps heat and wicks moisture. With a high zippered collar and cinchable hem, you can adjust the fit to make it more air-tight or breathable. This mid-layer felt wonderfully lightweight while still keeping my toasty. It’s not bulky at all, only a little thicker than a base layer, laid comfortably under my jackets, and moved with me on the mountain. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Lifa Base Layer Long-Sleeve Crew for $115 and Pants for $115: These base layers hit the weight sweet spot; they’re not too thick or thin, but just right. They’re slightly looser than other options on this list, so if you prefer something that isn’t so fitted, these are a great pick (but note that they run long too). These combine merino wool with Helly Hansen’s LIFA fibers, which add more moisture-wicking capabilities. They’re soft, lightweight, warm, and don’t hold onto smells. I love the cute designs and how well they regulate my temperature under insulated jackets and pants. The waist digs in a bit but doesn’t roll, and they stay in place and move well. —Kristin Canning\n\nHow to Layer AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We have a full guide on how to layer, but here are your essentials. Base layer: A good set of thermals is essential in the fight against cold, especially when you’re working hard. The best fabrics wick away sweat as you heat up, which helps regulate your temperature. Merino wool is the best at this, but also the most expensive. Synthetic fabrics are getting better, though, and please avoid cotton at all costs, as it gets wet and stays that way, making you cold and uncomfortable. Mid layer: Whether you choose a hooded fleece or puffer-style jacket, this layer does the bulk of the work in cold conditions. Combined with the base layer, it traps warm air in, while also allowing moisture to be expelled. Synthetic insulation such as Primaloft Gold is brilliant and doesn’t lose its properties if it gets wet. Down jackets offer the best warmth-to-weight ratio, but they don’t pack down as small, and should never get wet. A fleece with an insulated vest is a great option if you really feel the cold. Jacket: While ski jackets with insulation offer bonus warmth in Arctic-like conditions, for most people a waterproof shell will be enough, as it offers protection from both the snow and the wind. A cold wind will chill you to your bones faster than a bit of wet snow. Ideally choose a jacket with a waterproof membrane such as Gore-Tex (make sure it is free from PFAS, or forever chemicals), but also check for taped seams for added waterproofing, plus plenty of pockets for snacks and lift passes, and wrist cuffs and ski skirts to help keep out the snow. Socks: As with your base layer, socks keep you warm and maintain your temperature when you’re building up a sweat. Natural fabrics work well, but a blend of merino wool with synthetic stretchy fibers is the way to go, as they stay up better and can be used for more than a day. Avoid cotton again, and never wear two pairs, as you’ll almost certainly get colder feet. Gloves: You’ll be surprised by how wet ski gloves get when it’s snowing, even if you don’t fall very often. As a result, waterproof options work best in most cases, although well-made leather designs can be almost as waterproof as a pair with Gore-Tex. Mittens are generally warmer than gloves, but what you gain in toasty fingers you lose in dexterity. Check out our Best Ski Gloves and Mittens guide for more information. Waterproofing and breathability ratings: Waterproofing is measured with a hydrostatic head rating, or HH. That means if you put a 1-inch, endlessly long square tube on top of the fabric, you could pour 20,000 millimeters of water before it would seep through. Breathability is rated in how many grams of vapor per square meter can can pass through the fabric in 24 hours. How We Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I've been reviewing winter sports gear for more than 15 years. In that time, I have worn an untold number of jackets, pants, mid-layers, thermals, gloves, and mittens. I called on industry experts and professional skiers, and solicited opinions from fellow winter sport enthusiasts on the WIRED team. While a basic fit check can be done in the office, nothing replaces on-mountain testing in variable conditions. We put in the time on various trips to the French Alps, as well as in resorts in Vermont, Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "The first time Alesandra Madison’s husband incorporated AI into their relationship was in late 2024.\n\nShe’d forgotten to do her “nightly kneeling ritual,” and he asked ChatGPT how to properly discipline her. The large language model suggested “a two-in-one punishment,” she says—write 100 lines of “I will remember to kneel for my Dom every night” while kneeling the entire time.\n\nThough the couple started exploring kink in their marriage 15 years ago—they are in a dominant-submissive relationship—the AI-generated punishment was new territory for them.\n\nSince then, Madison, who is 44 and lives in Los Angeles, says she has come to think of AI as “a powerful enhancement tool” for kink. “A lot of the times in dom-sub dynamics, when the submissive misbehaves—if it’s consented to—you will have a punishment. You want something specific to fit the crime, basically. It’s like a fresh set of eyes on your relationship.”\n\nAI represents a unique evolution in how power is distributed for people into bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism—BDSM. The lifestyle structure, as everyone WIRED spoke to for this story noted, is grounded in the core tenets of consent, safety, communication, and trust. But for those dealing with trust issues, or who simply want a nonjudgmental space to ask questions about BDSM, AI is becoming an increasingly appealing option.\n\n“I’ve gotten value out of AI helping me understand myself better as a submissive. I sometimes ask it questions or describe something that feels confusing to me and ask it to help me understand,” one user posted in the r/SubSanctuary subreddit, where discussions involve topics like impact play, the feeling of “being owned,” and how to move on when the relationship has reached its end. Madison says there are different reasons why AI doms appeal to certain subs. They are always available, easily customizable—“You can make them playful or sadistic,” she noted in a video—and there is low risk to exploring for newbies.\n\nBut not everyone is on board. In the same subreddit, AI doms were blasted for being “hollow entertainment,” “dangerous,” and “dystopian.” “It can feel like a checklist,” says San Francisco–based sex educator Amp Somers, who is 36 and switches between dom and sub roles, of the demands an AI dom gives out.\n\nAs debates swirl and intensify, the marketplace has gone boom. Joi AI is one of the many services—along with Character.AI, Replika, and Soulmaite—that let users create and customize chatbots for BDSM role-play. According to the company, which bills itself as an “AI-lationships” platform, and an antidote to dating apps, its “user base has grown five times in 2025 compared to 2024.” Several sex workers, including Alix Lynx and Jenna Starr, have licensed their likeness to Joi (the company declined to share exact user numbers). Developers are also sprinting to create applications for role-play chatbots that are “not just erotic content spam, but something focused on immersive, intelligent conversation with a dominant persona.” Even Oxy shop, an online BDSM gear retailer for sub men who like to wear chastity cages, has started to offer an AI-driven “BDSM chat” for members, which allows them to indulge in all sorts of dominatrix fantasies; “Surrender to Mandy” or “Submit to Mike,” the page advertises.\n\nWatching porn can be a passive experience, but “an AI chatbot allows people a forum to talk about, express, and articulate their sexual fantasies,” says Carolina Bandinelli, an associate professor at the University of Warwick whose research focuses on the digital culture of love. “The idea that you can program your domination exactly the way you want. That is one of the fantasies underpinning the relationship between humans and AI—the fact that we can shape and model our partner.”"

            "content": "You might think you’ve got enough headphones. Most of us have accrued at least two or three pairs over the years, and might have a few more half-working pairs stuck in a drawer somewhere. But I’m here to tell you, if you haven’t fully explored the fabulous world of specialized headphones that has exploded in the past decade, from open earbuds to sports and travel cans, you’re not maximizing your sonic potential. The best headphones are now so varied that they often depend entirely on what you intend to use them for. That means the best headphones for you probably come in many shapes and sizes, and you might actually want more than one pair.\n\nBalling out on lots of headphones for every one of life's situations doesn’t necessarily mean spending a lot of money. Unless you’re successfully riding the “boomcession,” there’s a fair chance spare cash is tight right now. Luckily, there’s a veritable explosion of impressive budget brands making great stuff, alongside household brands pitching to the cheap seats.\n\nAs an audio reviewer for well over a decade, I’ve tried hundreds of models across every color in the headphone rainbow. Here’s how to shop right so you can get the most out of any and all of them, as well as the best headphones I can think of in every category right now.\n\nNoise-Canceling Earbuds: The 2026 Baseline\n\nLet's start with the modern one-and-done choice: Noise-canceling earbuds are the ultimate jack-of-all-trades. If you only want to own one pair, this is it. The best noise-canceling earbuds sound great, fit neatly in your pocket, and are equally adept at letting in or blocking out environmental sounds to adapt to any situation.\n\nIt’s probably no surprise that the wildly popular AirPods Pro are the best headphones for iPhone owners, thanks to impressive performance, loads of features, and seamless integration with all things Apple. They’re a massive step up from the standard AirPods, which offer similar Apple-friendly features and a touch of noise canceling, but don’t perform nearly as well as even most budget earbuds.\n\nBose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor more phone-agnostic options, Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 are the ultimate noise killers, while Sony’s new WF-1000XM6 offer great sound and utterly natural transparency mode. Technics' EAH AZ100 are among my favorites for sound quality.\n\nIf those are too pricey, fear not! Budget earbud options are varied and plentiful, from Android-optimized midrangers like the Google Pixel Buds 2a to the stylish Nothing Ear (a) or highly affordable Soundcore Space A40. If you’re keeping to one pair, I’d put in all your chips for better performance, but there’s no shortage of great affordable options, and new pairs at all prices keep rolling in.\n\nNoise-Canceling Over-Ears: Comfort Meets Performance\n\nAnyone who’s taken a long flight can probably relate to the fact that sticking something in your ears for five hours-plus isn’t an exercise in comfort. Enter travel headphones like the best noise-canceling over-ears, which have adapted from early models like Bose’s stalwart QC 25 to become among the most advanced and downright luxurious audio products for your money. They’re great for other tasks too, from working in a busy office to commuting or simply chilling at home in tranquil reverie.\n\nAirPods Max Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nThe latest and greatest, like Sony’s WH-1000XM6 and Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra, apply uncompromising noise cancellation, plush comfort for long listening, and a pile of advanced features like pausing when you speak or automatic sleeping and waking. The Ultra are my favorite for sheer comfort, but there are plenty of rivals like Sonos’ equally comfy Ace, the iconic (and heavy) AirPods Max, or the utterly immersive B&W Px7 S3. Cheaper options abound, but some of my favorites include Sony’s high-punching WH-CH720, the crazy-affordable Soundcore Life Q30, or its newer cousin, the Space One. These won’t bring the same level of performance or tranquility, but they still work great for long flights and beyond.\n\nOpen Earbuds: For Keeping Alert\n\nHere’s where things get really fun: Open earbuds have exploded faster than any other audio segment in recent memory, with a kaleidoscope of options from virtually every audio brand. Designed to keep your ears open while delivering satisfying sound, the best open earbuds aren’t ideal for everything you do, but they're fantastic for specialized activities like ebike riding, where wind resistance renders artificial transparency modes useless. Over time, I've found tons of other cool use cases, from walking the dog to sneaking in some Olympics at the bar.\n\nOpen Earbuds come in various design types, from wacky bone-conductors to wraparound models and—my personal favorite—clip-ons. Their light and ergonomic housings aim to essentially disappear on your ears for all-day listening, and it works better than you might think.\n\nYou could spend a lot on pairs like Bose’s excellent Open Ultra, but you really don’t have to, since even the best models are limited in performance. Soundcore’s Aeroclip are my favorite value-to-performance pair, but plenty of cheaper options get the job done, like Acefast’s nearly free Acefit Air or Soundpeat’s Pearclip Pro. Open earbuds are easily my favorite new audio trend.\n\nWorkout Headphones: Keep Moving\n\nThere’s an obvious Venn diagram overlap between open earbuds and workout headphones, but if you don’t like the idea of keeping your ears open, traditional sports models are a great alternative. My favorite is the revamped Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, which offer tons of features in a wraparound design that’s nearly unshakeable. I like that they’re optimized for Apple devices, but still work well for Android, and they come with great noise canceling and transparency mode, but also a high price.\n\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nLike open earbuds, there are plenty of cheap options, including the similarly unshakeable (but much more basic) Jlab Go Air Sport, which run a mere $30 or less on sale. If you’re not into the minimalist thing, WIRED editor Adrienne So swears by the BlueAnt Pump X over-ear headphones for weightlifting, in large part due to their cooling-gel earpads that go in the fridge overnight to keep sweat at bay. They’ve also got noise canceling and plenty of battery life at over 50 hours per charge. For jogging or cycling, open earbuds are likely a better fit, while some folks simply use the AirPods Pro, but it can be nice to just have a dedicated pair in your gym bag.\n\nWired Headphones: Plug It In\n\nCourtesy of Shure Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Shure SE-112GR $69 Amazon $69 Adorama\n\nThe youth delight in resurrecting old tech that the more seasoned among us have long left for dead (cassette tapes?!). In the case of wired headphones, there’s good reason to plug in, starting with improved performance for your dollars. If you’re a content creator, musician, or simply a cash-savvy sound connoisseur, you can get an impressive return from wired options that avoid the sound degradation of many wireless options.\n\nSome of our favorite affordable options include affordable and classic-looking earbuds like Shure’s iconic SE-112 and Sennheiser’s impressive IE200, and studio-friendly over-ears like Audio-Technica’s ATH-M20x, If you’re willing to spend a bit more, the fantastic Sennheiser HD6XX offer the best sound for the money I’ve heard in any headphone segment. Based on the much pricier HD 650, these are open-back headphones that let in exterior sounds, but the performance is incredible. If you want even better sound and design, there are tons of options, but they’ll cost you.\n\nFancy Headphones: The Audiophile Angle\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nCourtesy of Grado Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Grado Signature S750 $1,675 Grado\n\nIf you really want to optimize the wired connection, there’s a whole segment of audiophile headphones made with high-quality materials, innovative speaker technologies, elevated designs, and accordingly elevated pricing. There are a whole bunch of varieties, but for the sake of levity I’ll break them down into two categories: in-ear monitors (IEMs), the fancy version of in-ear headphones, and over-ears.\n\nIEMs generally use dynamic drivers, the traditional driver type in most headphones and speakers, balanced armatures, much smaller and more accurate speakers, or a mix of both. My favorite pairs come from Ultimate Ears, like the UE 18+ Pro, which are customized for your ears using 3D printing and other techniques. (You’ve likely seen these on TV for musicians and broadcasters.) Other IEMs we like include Sennheiser’s IE 900 and models from Campfire Audio.\n\nMeze Poet Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor over-ear headphones, Audeze’s planar magnetic headphones are among my favorites, starting as low as $500 (yeah, I know) in the excellent LCD-S20 closed-back headphones. Another incredible pair I recently tested are Meze’s Poet, which are not only the most gorgeous-looking pair I’ve reviewed, but also offer among the clearest and most articulate sound I’ve laid ears on. There are dozens more to try, as audiophilia is its own journey, but this is a good starting point. We recently reviewed the Grado Signature S750, which have an effortlessly expansive sound that feels like it can't possibly be coming from mere centimeters away from your eardrums.\n\nOther Headphone Types and Upcoming Features\n\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\n\nCourtesy of Best Buy Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3P Wireless $110 Amazon $110 Best Buy\n\nAs I’m sure some of you have already noted, there are still more types of specialty headphones, including Gaming Headsets, which are another animal altogether, and even TV Headphones, which quickly transition from the screen's internal speakers to let you listen in silence without latency. I’m currently testing a new TV headphones bundle from Sennheiser, the RS 275, which includes a dedicated pair of headphones in the HDR 275 and Sennheiser’s new BTA1 Auracast transmitter (verdict to come).\n\nSpeaking of Auracast, it’s an increasingly cool new type of Bluetooth protocol that allows connection of an infinite number of devices at up to 100 meters, like an FM radio signal. Its implementation is still in its early stages, but it’s a good feature to look for in new headphones. Other features to consider include an app with an EQ and presets (which the majority of my recommendations include), multipoint pairing to connect to two or more devices at once (again, pretty ubiquitous), and spatial audio features for video formats like Dolby Atmos."

            "content": "Things Fall Apart Rolling out this week, WIRED’s journalistic commissions on technological decommissions—from broken-down electric cars to falling-down space stations.\n\nAccording to the TOP500, which ranks these mega-machines, Sierra was once the second-fastest supercomputer in the world. She was conceived in a Chicago hotel conference room more than a decade ago, at a technical discussion for officials from America’s national labs. The ultimate designer baby, Sierra was assembled from thousands of IBM Power9 CPUs and Nvidia Volta V100 GPUs—a daring, offbeat architecture for Livermore at the time.\n\nLike other supercomputers, Sierra was girthy. She was composed of thousands of compute nodes, stored one on top of another in racks—basically cabinets—that held up her processing innards. She had 240 of these racks, spread across roughly 7,000 square feet. All of this was needed to support her life’s main occupation: performing specialized, super-high-security simulations for the National Nuclear Security Administration. At the time of her death sentence, her processing power ranked a still-respectable 23rd in the world.\n\nNow, why did Sierra have to die? After all, an enormous amount of time and resources went into Frankensteining her together. The leadership of the lab won’t confirm how much she cost to build, but she was expensive—the government spent at least $325 million on her and her fraternal twin, a supercomputer called Summit at the Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee. (Summit was decommissioned in late 2024.) Also, she still totally worked. “At the end of the life of a machine, you could think, Oh, we have all these sunk costs. You should just keep running the machine forever,” says John Allen, the lab’s organizational information security officer. But that’s wrong. “Its good and faithful service is over, and we have to move on.”"

You put a small pellet in a microwave-like box, and in seconds out comes a delicious-looking, home-cooked roast chicken. We've made some progress since the movie came out nearly 30 years ago, but we're not quite there yet. We've had the microwave for awhile, but the pellets still need some work.\n\nThe latest attempt at tasty meals from a box is the meal delivery service. These range from meal kits that deliver the ingredients and you cook them, to complete, ready-to-eat meals. The latest I've tried is Factor, which falls into the latter category. Factor's particular spin on that market is that it specializes in high protein meals targeted at anyone on a keto diet, high protein/low carb, or restricted calorie diets.\n\nWhat You Want\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Factor Prepared Meals Shop at Factor\n\nFactor is similar to other meal services in that you subscribe, pick the meals you want, and Factor ships them out on a weekly basis. I went for the completely hassle-free option of Chef's Choice and set some guard rail parameters like high protein and gluten free. The Factor-selected meals arrived at the start of the week via FedEx, though the delivery service will vary by area. These aren't frozen meals, so throw them in the fridge. They will last up to seven days.\n\nThe subscription process walks you through a list of questions that help determine the right meals for you. There are option lists with goals like “Eat more protein,” “Save time in the kitchen,” “Eat a better variety of foods,” and so on. Then you select other things like your spice preference and how many meal you want per week (the options are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 18)."

The streaming network has a bingeable TV series for almost everyone. And whether you want to remember Lindsay Lohan’s old face in the classic Mean Girls flick, or wonder just how many more sequels Tom Cruise has left in him with Top Gun: Maverick, there’s a bevy of films to stream, too.\n\nIf you’re like me and have at least half a dozen streaming services, our Paramount+ coupon codes can help you save so you can watch the content you want without having to get rid of one of your other beloved content platforms. (I love pretending the world isn’t full of suffering around me and instead focus on Sylvester Stallone’s ever-changing Play-Doh face in Tulsa King.)\n\nTry Paramount+ Free With a One-Week Trial\n\nIf you’re unsure if you’ll actually want to commit to Paramount+, or if there’s a sports event like March Madness games and you only need to access the content for a little while, Paramount+’s free trial is a great option. The trial lasts one week, is for new subscribers only, and can’t be paired with other offers.\n\nThere are tiered plans, including Essential, which allows for 3 devices, select Showtime series, NFL games, and can be streamed on up to 3 devices at once, but has ads; and Premium, which includes all that except there are no ads, downloadable content, CBS live, and all of Showtime content.\n\nFind the Right Paramount+ Plan Pricing and Get the Latest Deals\n\nIt’s important that you choose the right Paramount+ streaming plan for you so that you can get the best bang for your buck. Lucky for you, all plans come with a 7-day free trial so you can make sure you’re choosing the right plan for you. The first is Paramount+ Essential, which is $8 per month. It has ads included, but you’ll have access to over 40,000 episodes and movies. And you’ll be able to stream on 3 devices at once, be able to watch NFL games on CBS and UEFA Champions League, and select Showtime series are also available. Paramount+ Premium is the next tier (and the most popular choice), which starts at $13 per month (after the free trial ends), and you’ll get everything mentioned in the previous tier, without ads. You’ll have all that as well as the ability to watch in 4K UHD, Dolby Vision or HDR10, downloadable movies and shows, streaming CBS live and all of Showtime’s content library.\n\nCan You Cancel Paramount Plus at any Time?\n\nIf you find the service isn’t right for you, or just need to cut down on subscriptions, you can cancel Paramount+ any time. However, the cancellation process depends on where you signed up.

            "content": "At the beginning of the year, The Cut kicked off a brief discourse cycle by declaring a new lifestyle trend: “friction-maxxing.”\n\nThe idea, in a nutshell, is that people have overconvenienced themselves with apps, AI, and other means of near-instant gratification—and would be better off with increased friction in their daily lives, which is to say those mundane challenges that ask some minor effort of them.\n\nWhatever your feelings on that philosophy, the use of “maxxing” as a suffix assumed to be familiar or at least intelligible to most readers of a mainstream news outlet is evidence of another trend: the assimilation of incel terminology across the broader internet. The online ecosystem of incels, or “involuntarily celibate” men, is saturated with this sort of clinical jargon; its aggrieved participants insulate, isolate, and identify themselves through in-group codespeak that is meant to baffle and repel outsiders. So how did non-incels (“normies,” as incels would label them) end up adopting and recontextualizing these loaded words?\n\nSlang, no matter its origins, has a viral nature. It tends to break containment and mutate. The buzzword “woke,” as it pertains to our current politics, comes from African American Vernacular English and once referred to an awareness of racial and social injustice—this usage dates to the middle of the 20th century, preceding even the civil rights movement. But the culture wars of this century have turned “woke” into a favorite pejorative of right-wingers, who wield it as a catchall term for anything that threatens their ideology, such as Black pilots or gender-neutral pronouns.\n\nBack in 2014, the eruption of the Gamergate harassment campaign set the stage for a different linguistic realignment. An organized backlash to women working in the video game industry, and eventually any sort of diversity or progressivism within the medium, it exposed a vein of reactionary anger that would gain a fuller voice during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. This was a period when many in the digital mainstream got their first taste of the trollish nihilism and invective that fuels toxic message boards such as 4chan and gave rise to a network of anti-feminist manosphere sites collectively known as the “PSL” community: PUAHate (a board for venting about pickup artists, it was shut down soon after the 2014 Isla Vista killing spree carried out by Elliot Rodger, who frequented the forum), SlutHate (a straightforward misogyny hub), and Lookism (where incels viciously critique each other’s appearance).\n\nLookism, named for the idea that prejudice against the less attractive is as common and pernicious as sexism or racism, is the only forum of the PSL trifecta that survives today, and while we don’t know who coined the “maxxing” idiom, it’s the likeliest source for the first verb with this construction. “Looksmaxxing,” which borrows from the role-playing game concept of “min-maxing,” or elevating a character’s strengths while limiting weaknesses, became the preferred expression for attempts to improve one’s appearance in pursuit of sex. This could mean something as simple as a style makeover or as extreme as “bonesmashing,” a supposed technique of achieving a more defined jaw by tapping it with a hammer.\n\nIf the 2000s introduced people to pickup lingo like “game” and “negging,” the 2010s ushered in language that extended the Darwinian vision of the dating pool as a cutthroat and strictly hierarchical marketplace. “AMOG,” an initialism for “alpha male of the group,” gave us “mogging,” a display where one man flexes his physical superiority over a rival. An ideally masculine specimen might also be recognized as a “Chad,” who allegedly enjoys his pick of attractive partners, while a Chad among Chads is, of course, a “Gigachad.” Women were disparaged as “female humanoids,” then “femoids,” and finally just “foids.”"

            "content": "They're so sleek, no one even thinks to ask if they're smart glasses. Standing up on a stage about to give a talk at a conference in Rust, Germany, I wore the Even Realities G2 glasses to prove a point. In my field of view, a glowing monochrome 3D text display brought up notes on a teleprompter window. I tapped to navigate with a metallic ring on my right forefinger.\n\nAnd like that, my talking points drifted in a slow scroll to match the moments when I mentioned key terms as I improvised.\n\nThis was my first time trying smart glasses with a teleprompter in a real-life situation where I couldn't risk failure. The $599 G2 glasses only half passed the test. While these camera-free smart glasses have the lightweight framing I want, fit my extremely myopic prescription and have battery life to last a full day and then some, they don't work nearly as fluidly as I'd want. Which is why, midway through my live talk, I basically abandoned the teleprompter function and improvised the rest of the way.\n\nSmart glasses right now are like early smartwatches a decade ago, a wild mix of ideas thrown against the wall by an increasing number of companies, mixing features and AI services and interfaces in different combinations. There are no clear standards for smart glasses yet, like there are for phones, earbuds or even watches.\n\nScott Stein/CNET\n\nWhile Meta has stolen most of the spotlight and market with its AI-enabled and chunky Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses, they're not the only forms in the wild. Meta's glasses have cameras and microphones, and onboard speakers, acting as face-worn recording devices. Only one model right now has a display. The Meta Ray-Ban Displays have a single color display in one eye, and they don't have lenses that can be made for my high-index eye prescription. They also have battery life that can't last a full day, or even just a few hours.\n\nEven Realities' glasses are a totally different story. The second-generation models can fit a wide range of prescriptions, even beyond mine (up to +/-12). The battery life lasts well over a day. They have dual, larger displays in monochrome green. And they don't have cameras at all. Or speakers. Just displays and microphones.\n\nI got fitted for a prescription pair to try, thanks to Even, and have been wearing them on and off since the start of the year (prescription lenses cost at least $159 to add to the glasses). I wore them at CES in Las Vegas, and out to a German immersive entertainment conference called Aurea. I've worn them into New York. And I've been trying them along with a separately sold $249 smart ring, the Even R1, that controls the glasses and doubles as a heart rate-measuring fitness tracker.\n\nI love that these glasses are so trim and compact. So discreet. And that they fit my eyes and have amazing battery life. I just wish the rest of it worked as well as it promised. Some AI features are great, but I wish there were more.\n\nThe Even G2 glasses do have a remarkably compact design. Seen next to them: the separately-sold R1 control ring that's also a fitness tracker. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nEveryday-looking thin glasses\n\nThe most impressive aspect of the Even G2 is its shockingly lightweight frame and design. I've shown these glasses to people, and they had no idea they were smart glasses. They seem too unimposing.\n\nThe frame, in particular, is the standout. The metal frame around the lenses and arms is thin, with the only bulge in small bulb-like parts at the ends of the arms, where you'll find the batteries and touchpads to control the glasses. The display projectors live inside thicker parts of the arm near the lenses, but again, it's really subtle. The glasses are really lightweight, too: at 35 grams, they feel lighter than my regular glasses.\n\nThe G2s are a particular type of glasses design, though. They're small for my taste, and come in either square or round frames. And after a while, those bulky end bits on the metal arms start making my ears uncomfortable. They charge via an included glasses case that's bulkier than the Meta Ray-Bans case, but connects with USB-C the same way and is easy to tuck in a bag.\n\nThe separately sold R1 ring is an odder duck. It's similar to other smart rings like Oura in that it can track steps and heart rate. But the R1 also has a touch bar on one side that acts like a touchpad to control the Even G2 glasses. Double-tapping wakes the screen, swiping moves you through menus, and pressing and holding moves back a menu level.\n\nMe getting ready to talk on-stage, taking a quick selfie. The Even G2s do feel remarkably lightweight. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nThe ring's meant to be worn on your index finger, resting before the first knuckle so you can comfortably use the touchpad with your thumb, and that can get weird. I'm worried it'll fall off. When I was giving that stage presentation with teleprompter mode, as I held a microphone in one hand and a remote to control the slide deck in the other, it was super-hard to click the ring.\n\nLuckily, the glasses have their own touchpad controls, one at the back of each arm. They're often covered with my hair at the back of my ears, but they can navigate more reliably. Then you don't need to get the ring.\n\nAnd sometimes, the ring just stops working. A big problem with both the glasses and the ring is their spotty connectivity, even with multiple firmware updates. Sometimes it feels like a Bluetooth issue. Other times, I wonder if the background connection the glasses forge with my iPhone ends up timing out. Right now, in fact, the ring just stopped functioning as a touch control for some reason. And sometimes the glasses don't auto-dim the green micro LED display, keeping it on far longer than I need and getting in the way of my vision.\n\nThe micro LED display is big and bright enough indoors and in dimmer light, but it gets washed out in bright daylight. It's 3D and shows up across both eyes, looking like panels of green text overlaid on top of the transparent lenses. The small waveguide patches on each lens are subtle but do show up in light, and sometimes the displays can be seen through the lenses, too.\n\nBut the displays are clever, because they fade away when you're not looking at them. It's a bit of peripheral-vision magic because the green displays appear when you look up. But looking down at the rest of my world, like when typing this review, they seem to fade away.\n\nI'd skip the ring and just get the glasses, but even then, I don't think I'd want the glasses in their current software form. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nAI: Bits and pieces\n\nI love that Even Realities' onboard software has a unique application to use AI with, a mode called Conversate. However, it's one of the only useful AI features on the glasses for me.\n\nConversate is a live mode that auto-transcribes a conversation (or whatever you're listening to), displaying the text on-screen as captions while also listening for random key phrases the AI considers noteworthy. Those get pulled out into another pop-up window that defines the term loosely. For instance, as I listened to a presentation on virtual worlds, the term \"biomimicry\" was defined for me on-glasses. When would I get another phrase pulled out? I had no idea.\n\nI used the Even G2 glasses in Conversate mode for most of a whole day, listening to other keynote presentations, and was able to save the transcripts into the Even Realities phone app. None of this used much of the glasses' battery life, impressively, and the onboard microphones had no problem picking up audio from across the room.\n\nThe transcripts include AI summaries and key-term breakdowns, which is helpful. I can also look over the pulled-out terms of note that got defined during Conversate mode. I kind of fell in love with keeping these on as a helpful listening partner, but not having control over Conversate's focus on particular phrases to define wasn't great.\n\nBut it made me wonder about a future where talking with people could generate helpful information to guide me, via subtle pop-up prompts. Even's Conversate mode is a stab in that direction, but crudely. I can't choose other AI services to run on the glasses, just the company's own Even AI, which doesn't clearly list what models it uses to function.\n\nThere's also a dedicated Even AI mode that responds to voice prompts, but it's worse than anything you'd use on your phone. It sometimes answers in a strange way and with less detail than ChatGPT and Gemini. It also relies on relatively limited display screen real estate to show answers, so it's basically a one-question-at-a-time experience. The text replies also roll in pretty slowly for my comfort.\n\nA look at the other side of the lens: the thicker arm part is where the display lives. A small patch on-lens is where the display gets reflected onto, Scott Stein/CNET\n\nEven Realities has an on-glasses maps-based navigation mode called Navigate that provides pop-up turn-by-turn directions. Not having any of these modes hook into existing phone apps or services is a huge downside, though. I have to ask for things from scratch and hope Even AI delivers.\n\nOn-glasses translation can handle 35 languages, far more than Meta's glasses can do. There's no need to download language packs either, but you do have to select the language pairs from the phone app to make it work. Oddly, you can't do it in glasses.\n\nTeleprompter mode is one of my other favorites, and maybe the best next to Conversate. You can cut and paste notes or speeches into the app and then roll them on glasses. It listens in and keeps up with what you're saying, even skipping ahead if you're at a later point. While this worked well generally, in a live stage experience, I couldn't control the ring well enough to get the teleprompter to start up. I had nervous jitters, combined with a less-than-responsive ring touchpad.\n\nAnd that's about it for the Even's features. Seriously. I'm struggling to think of what else I'd even use these glasses for, which is why I'm usually taking them back off again.\n\nThey're not even a good replacement for a smartwatch. Notifications can appear in-glasses, but many still don't pop up for me when paired with an iPhone. Incoming calls don't show up either. I can't respond to texts (or apparently see them). On Meta's Ray-Bans, I can at least answer calls and use the glasses like AirPods. You can't do that on Even's glasses. You can't listen to music. And you can't use them as cameras, because there aren't any.\n\nThe good news is that there are apparently a number of developers working on AI apps for the glasses that could emerge soon. These glasses are trying to be the Pebble watch of smart glasses in that respect. But I need those features and the customization to hurry up and get here. Right now, there's not enough to do to justify wearing them.\n\nThe right form, the wrong function\n\nI've come away from my Even G2 test drive realizing that, yes, smart glasses can be as small and prescription-friendly (and battery life-friendly) as my dreams desire. But that comes at a severe cost to everything else. Phones just don't work well with smart glasses right now, no matter what company makes them. The G2 tries, but its wonky phone app, buggy connectivity, limited customization and lack of deeper phone hook-ins to its AI (and lack of support for other AI services) keep it feeling a step behind.\n\nI can't wait for glasses to actually feel like truly deeper phone extensions, things that could assist people on the terms they choose with the apps they want. Meta hasn't gotten there. Even Realities hasn't. Maybe Google will, with its glasses coming later this year.\n\nI hope other smart glasses have the battery life, prescription lens support and size advantages Even does. It's sorely needed. It's just extremely disappointing that these glasses can't live up to the promise of all the rest yet. I'll check back later if more apps come, and see if they can be the Pebble for my face I was hoping for."

            "content": "If you regularly deal with a drafty home, a space heater can make it a lot more bearable. If you have one, you might even be able to cut your heating bill during the cold season if you know where to put it.\n\nHowever, these portable warmers can also cause problems, especially when used improperly or in the wrong locations.\n\nSpace heaters are a leading cause of home fires in the US during the winter months, yet many of these fires are preventable with proper placement. It's critical to keep an eye on your space heater while it's on and never leave it running without supervision. It's also important to avoid placing them in areas that increase fire risk.\n\nFor a safe, warm winter, here are nine places your space heater should never be.\n\n\n\nSpace heaters, even those with tip-over safeguards, don't belong on rugs. Getty Images\n\n1. On a carpet, rug or flammable surface\n\nSpace heaters can't sit on any surface that can easily scorch or catch on fire. That means you can never place one on a carpet or rug. You should also avoid using them on more delicate hardwoods or meltable vinyl, especially for long periods.\n\nWhat if you have only carpet in a cold room? You can look for a ceramic or otherwise heatproof base to position under the heater. It must be larger than the heater itself by about 3 inches on all sides.\n\n2. Near walls and furniture\n\nYour space heater needs a safety zone: Keep it at least 3 feet away from any walls or furniture to avoid burning hazards. Unfortunately, this also means that under your desk or dining table is a no-go. Try aiming space heaters toward these areas instead of placing them directly under them.\n\n3. Near blankets, pillows or curtains\n\nSpace heaters become an even greater fire risk if someone accidentally puts a blanket or pillow against them -- and in winter, that can easily happen. The same is true if the heater is pushed against any hanging curtains. Keep all these flammable items at least 3 feet away from the heater at all times.\n\nKeep space heaters away from everyday objects to play it safe. Cris Cantón/Getty Images\n\n4. Anywhere easily accessed by pets or small children\n\nSpace heaters can easily burn the unwary, and while many newer models have automatic shut-offs if they're tipped over, a fallen space heater can still be a serious fire hazard. Also, pets and kids may not pay attention to where they put toys or blankets, which can create additional risks.\n\nUse space heaters in areas that very young children and larger pets can't access or rarely visit. When they're paying attention, teach them to give the heater a wide berth.\n\n5. Bathrooms and laundry rooms\n\nSpace heaters play poorly around water, which can affect operation and greatly increase the risk of electrical shock. They are also more at risk of tipping over in these environments.\n\nUnfortunately, bathrooms and laundry rooms frequently suffer from brrr-level temperatures if heating is lacking. We suggest positioning a heater outside these rooms for maximum effect and safety.\n\nStaying near a space heater is fine, but always check that it's not overloading your system. Getty Images\n\n6. Plugged in alongside a lot of other appliances or lights\n\nSpace heaters are a big drain on the amps an electrical circuit uses. That's usually fine for newer 15-amp home outlets, since modern space heaters are designed to work with them. The circuit and breaker that manage that room/area have their limits.\n\nPlugging in a space heater along with a bunch of other appliances (kitchen appliances, big entertainment systems, etc.) can overload the system. At best, the breaker flips, and power cuts out. At worst, it overheats wiring and causes an electrical fire.\n\n\n\nThis overload risk is also more common in colder months because the holidays often lead to plugging in more light-up decorations, which further increases amp loads on home circuits. You can help mitigate problems by alternating devices to reduce overall power consumption and by monitoring with smart plugs.\n\n7. Plugged into an extension cord or power strip (or both)\n\nExtension cords and power strips aren't necessarily rated for the power space heaters require, and can increase the risk of an electrical fire, even if the outlet and breaker can handle the heater. Plugging an extension cord into a power strip before connecting the heater only increases the danger.\n\nIf you badly need a heater in an out-of-the-way location, look for a model that comes with a wireless power cable. Some extension cords are designed to support higher-amperage appliances, but you must be very careful when matching them to a heater -- we'd rather you avoid it altogether.\n\nWatch where you plug in a heater before warming those toes. Evgen Prozhyrko/Getty Images\n\n8. Plugged into an old or non-GFCI outlet\n\nA ground fault circuit interrupter is a handy bit of technology that shuts down an outlet if there's a problem with its electrical current, especially if it could complete a circuit elsewhere. It's a useful protection against shocks, overheating appliances and other issues. Always make sure that your space heater is plugged into a GFCI outlet.\n\nLikewise, avoid plugging the heater into an especially old outlet or one that's had problems before, such as suddenly not working. This raises the risk of causing wiring damage and resulting fires.\n\n9. Near anyone who gets winter allergies\n\nSpace heaters aren't always a great mix with allergy sufferers. Grace Cary/Getty Images\n\nWinter allergies are often caused by dust, dust mites and particles that accumulate during the closed-up winter days. Those kinds of allergies don't do too well if a device is blowing hot air around a room. That's particularly true if a heater or room hasn't been cleaned recently and there's a lot of built-up dust that can be spread around. If someone has particularly sensitive allergies, try to avoid using the space heater near them and see if you can find other ways to warm up.\n\nFinal tip: Never use fuel heaters inside\n\nOnly use electric or radiant heaters inside. Never use heaters that require fuel, such as kerosene, propane or other gas, in indoor spaces -- including the garage.\n\nFuel will always produce exhaust fumes, and those fumes need a dedicated vent to escape the home (as a gas fireplace does). Without venting fumes, those heaters will fill enclosed spaces with carbon monoxide, which could lead to carbon dioxide poisoning, the worst of news. The exception is certain oil-filled heaters that don't actually combust the oil, but these are relatively rare.\n\n\n\nRemember, if you're heading out or going to bed, remember to turn off the space heater -- never leave it on and unattended inside your home.

            "content": "Samsung just supercharged one of its most-used AI features on the new Galaxy S26 lineup, and it's even more impressive than before.\n\nCircle to Search, which first appeared on the Galaxy S24 phones and then expanded to other devices as Google Lens, felt like magic: Circle anything on your screen and get instant results. The AI-powered visual search tool can identify objects, translate text and surface contextual results without ever leaving the app you're on.\n\nNow it's gotten even smarter.\n\nAndroid's Circle to Search feature originally launched on Samsung Galaxy S24 and Pixel 8 phones in January 2024. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nInstead of just identifying a single item, it can recognize and surface information about multiple things you've presented it with, including an entire outfit. The feature can be used for just about everything, from identifying bird species to translating text, but Samsung says fashion and shopping are hands-down the most popular use case.\n\nSo of course I had to put it to the test at Samsung's Unpacked event in San Francisco by having it scan my outfit -- and I was genuinely floored. In the crowded event space under harsh lighting, I was skeptical it could deliver. It did.\n\nFirst, it pulled up an AI summary describing the scene: \"The look features a vibrant blue structured blazer, white top, dark fitted leggings and classic black leather boots.\" Right below that, I pressed the \"Find the look\" button and watched it do its magic.\n\nWithin seconds, I was staring at the exact same in-your-face cerulean blazer I was wearing, with a link to the online store I'd bought it from, along with a slew of strikingly similar shopping options ranging from upscale alternatives to budget-friendly picks. As someone who regularly looks to TV shows, movies and red carpet events for outfit inspo, this level of stalking would've taken me at least 20 minutes to lock down.\n\nScrolling down revealed the same for my glossy black leggings. Despite being from many seasons ago and not available anymore, it returned convincing dupes from different retailers. It did the same for my decade-old knee-high boots and even pulled up a used pair from Postmark; a nod at the fact that mine are old AF. The only thing it failed to surface was the shirt I was wearing under the blazer that was clearly visible in the shot. Maybe layers is the next frontier for Circle to Search.\n\nSurprisingly, the hardest part of the process was figuring out how to use the feature. I had to ask a Samsung employee to take a full-body picture of me. Once I had it on the screen, I long-pressed on the home button at the bottom of the screen, which triggered a Google overlay. I then had to circle myself from head to toe. It's the kind of feature I'd program on an action button if I could -- although my wallet would likely suffer the consequences.\n\nIn doing this, Samsung and Google have virtually removed the friction between liking someone's outfit, and pressing the trigger on buying it. It wasn't that long ago that the closest alternative involved screenshotting a look, posting it to Pinterest and attempting to track down similar pieces. This is faster, cleaner and almost dangerously good for fashion lovers like me.\n\nIf this gets any better, Samsung may need to add a few guardrails for those of us prone to a little too much impulse shopping."

            "content": "It seems like Netflix's presence at award shows gets bigger every year, and now that the 2026 Academy Award nominations are out, that presence continues to grow. Six Netflix original films earned 18 nominations this year, including nods for Train Dreams and Frankenstein in the Best Picture category, Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song for KPop Demon Hunters, and Best Documentary Feature for The Perfect Neighbor. The streaming giant's combination of original films and a diverse library of films from other production houses makes it a reliable source of entertainment, although it can sometimes be hard to narrow down what to watch.\n\nWhile Blue Moon isn't a Netflix original, it has been nominated for two Oscars this year and it's currently streaming on the platform, making it the perfect opportunity to catch it before this year's ceremony on Sunday, March 15. Set in 1943, the film stars Ethan Hawke as the real-life songwriter and lyricist Lorenz Hart, whose partnership with Richard Rodgers has crumbled. Hart has to witness the success and glory that Rodgers and his new partner, Oscar Hammerstein, are experiencing with their new musical, Oklahoma! and it's bittersweet to say the least. The period drama is one of Hawke's best performances.\n\nIf you'd rather go with a series, peruse our picks for the best TV shows to watch on Netflix.\n\n\n\nWatch movies at Netflix\n\nSony Pictures Classics Blue Moon (2025) Blue Moon was released in theaters in 2025 and it's currently nominated for two Oscars, one for Ethan Hawke's lead performance as songwriter Lorenz Hart and another for Best Original Screenplay. In the film, a depressed Hart struggles to accept the success of his former songwriting partner Richard Rodgers (played by Andrew Scott). Bobby Cannavale and Margaret Qualley also co-star. The film, directed by Richard Linklater, marks his ninth film collaboration with Hawke.\n\nWarner Bros. Best in Show (2000) Christopher Guest directed Best in Show, a mockumentary about people entering the prestigious Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show. The largely improvised movie features an ensemble of actors who appear often in Guest's films: Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean and, of course, Catherine O'Hara. (The movie is so beloved that O'Hara, who died on Jan. 30, was actually honored with a tribute at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on Feb. 3.)\n\nSony Pictures Casino Royale (2006) The debate over which actor is the best James Bond has existed for decades but you can decide for yourself who's the superior 007 now that Netflix has dropped 25 James Bond movies from every era, including Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, No Time To Die and Casino Royale. (We've suggested Casino Royale here because if you like a modern action film, Daniel Craig's version of Bond, especially in Casino Royale, has it all: excitement, romance, glamour, high stakes card games... The film truly revived the franchise. Hot take alert!)\n\nNetflix The Perfect Neighbor (2025) Directed and produced by Geeta Gandbhir, The Perfect Neighbor is a harrowing documentary about the killing of Ajike Owens, a Florida woman who was shot to death on June 2, 2023, by her neighbor, Susan Louise Lorincz. The film's use of police body camera footage and 911 calls lay out the neighborhood disputes stemming from Lorincz's erratic and unsettling behavior and the escalating tension that led to the killing.\n\nNetflix KPop Demon Hunters (2025) The Netflix original animated film KPop Demon Hunters premiered in June and quickly rose through the ranks to become the platform's most-watched original film of all time. The film, about a KPop group that performs by day and hunts demons in their downtime, has a soundtrack that's already been certified Platinum thanks to hits like \"Golden\" and \"Soda Pop.\" The film stars Arden Cho, May Hong and Ji Young Yoo as the titular girl group tasked with fighting off a demonic boy band. (Can't get enough of the movie? Check out the theatrical sing-along version and lyric videos that are also available to stream.) The film was also honored with two Golden Globes this year for Best Original Song and Best Animated Motion Picture and nabbed two Oscar nods.\n\nSony Pictures Animation Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018) Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is the first animated Spider-Man feature in the Marvel canon, and the film follows Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as he becomes the new Spider-Man and teams up with other Spider-People from various parallel universes to save his universe from the Kingpin (voiced by Liev Schreiber). The film's other Spider-Men are played by Jake Johnson, John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn and Nicolas Cage. Tthe rest of the cast is top-notch, too.\n\nStand By Me (1986) Stand By Me, based on a novella by Stephen King and directed by Rob Reiner, is a coming-of-age story about four 12-year-old boys (played by River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'Connell and Corey Feldman) who hear about a dead body on the outskirts of town and go on an adventure to find it. The film earned an Academy Award nomination and has often been lauded as a classic, timeless coming-of-age story. The film will be available to stream on Netflix until Feb. 28.\n\nNetflix Jay Kelly (2025) George Clooney and Adam Sandler received Golden Globe nominations for their performances in Noah Baumbach's Jay Kelly, which arrived on Netflix this December. Clooney stars as the title character, a movie star grappling with his age, career and relationships during a trip to Europe.\n\nUniversal Pictures The Sting (1973) The 1973 Oscar-winner The Sting stars Robert Redford and Paul Newman, who reunite with director George Roy Hill, with whom they previously collaborated on the wildly successful Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. In The Sting, Redford and Newman are two grifters who plot to con a mob boss, played by Robert Shaw. Set amid the Great Depression, with a ragtime score from Marvin Hamlisch, the film is a memorable classic.\n\nNext Entertainment World Train To Busan (2016) In the great horror thriller Train to Busan, a father finds himself trapped on a train from Seoul to Busan that's filled with zombies. As he tries to protect his daughter and escape from the infected, the film delivers pulse-pounding thrills and has been lauded as one of the best zombie movies of the past few years.\n\nParamount Pictures The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) A couple of years ago, Netflix had a huge hit with its stylish series Ripley, which starred Andrew Scott as suave con artist Tom Ripley. Before that series, there was the critically acclaimed 1999 film version, The Talented Mr. Ripley, also based on Patricia Highsmith's story. In the film, also out on Netflix now (so you can compare and contrast the performances!), Matt Damon plays the amoral, ruthless Ripley, who cons his way into the lives of a wealthy group of friends using fake identities. The ruse eventually turns deadly once they catch on to his crime. Catch the star-studded movie before it leaves the platform on March 12.\n\nNetflix Frankenstein (2025) Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein received five Golden Globe nominations this year and nine Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor for Jacob Elordi. The film, a reimagining of the Mary Shelley classic, is pure del Toro, filled with the dark, fantastical style the director is known for.\n\nA24 Priscilla (2023) Sofia Coppola directed the 2023 biopic Priscilla, which is about the life of a young Priscilla Presley who was just a teen when she met her future husband, Elvis Presley. Cailee Spaeny and Jacob Elordi portray the volatile couple in this Golden Globe-nominated film. If you're a fan of their performances, they also appear in two other Netflix originals on our list -- Spaeny co-stars in Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, and Elordi plays the creature in Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein.\n\nNetflix Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery (2025) Daniel Craig returns for a third time as Benoit Blanc in the newest film in the Knives Out mystery series, Wake Up Dead Man. This time around, the charming detective has been summoned to a small town in New York to investigate the death of a monsignor at a small church, and everyone in the sprawling A-list ensemble is a suspect. The film co-stars Glenn Close, Andrew Scott, Josh O'Connor, Mila Kunis, Kerry Washington and others. Why not make it a double feature and watch 2022's Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, also on Netflix, while you're at it?\n\nNetflix Train Dreams (2025) Joel Edgerton stars in Train Dreams, an Oscar-nominated drama that has won awards at several film festivals and the Independent Spirit Awards this year. The film takes place roughly a century ago; Edgerton stars as Robert Grainier, a logger in the Pacific Northwest struggling to build a life for himself and his family. The story is adapted from the novella of the same name by Denis Johnson and costars Felicity Jones, Kerry Condon and William H. Macy.\n\nToho Godzilla Minus One (2023) Godzilla Minus One is an Academy Award-winning Japanese-language movie written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki. Set in 1945, the story centers around Kōichi Shikishima, a young pilot dealing with PTSD in a post-World War II era. After surviving an encounter with Godzilla, he and others realize the kaiju is gearing up to attack Tokyo. A sequel to the Sony film has also just been announced; Godzilla Minus Zero is expected in theaters in late 2026. Watch Godzilla Minus One on Netflix\n\nMandarin Films Ip Man (2008) Ip Man is one of the most iconic martial arts film franchises of the past two decades. Starring Hong Kong martial arts master Donnie Yen (maybe you recognize him as Caine, the blind assassin in John Wick: Chapter 4), Ip Man and its sequels are the biographical films about the life of Yip Man, the kung fu master who famously taught Bruce Lee. Blending biography, drama and action all together, Ip Man and its three sequels have been critically acclaimed and are beloved entries to Hong Kong cinema. All four films arrived to Netflix in October.\n\nSearchlight Pictures 28 Years Later (2025) 28 Years Later is the third film in the zombie series about a viral outbreak that has ravaged England and placed it under quarantine with almost no contact with the rest of the world. Though the first film, 2002's 28 Days Later, just left Netflix, you can still catch 28 Years Later, about a young boy who ventures away from the safety of his village and has his first encounter with \"the infected.\" It's expected that the fourth film in the franchise, the recently released 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, will drop on the platform at some point this year, too.\n\nSummit Entertainment The Hurt Locker (2008) Released in 2008, The Hurt Locker won six Academy Awards, including those for Best Picture and Best Director (Kathryn Bigelow was the first woman ever to receive the award). The film, which co-stars Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty and Ralph Fiennes, follows a team of soldiers who defuse and dispose of explosives while deployed in Iraq. The film was critically lauded for its depiction of the stress and psychological toll of war.\n\nNetflix Rebel Ridge (2024) Netflix original Rebel Ridge snagged an Emmy this year for Best Television Movie. The action film stars Aaron Pierre as an ex-Marine who, in an attempt to post bail for his cousin, has the bail money stolen by corrupt cops, and the ordeal turns into an action-packed, thrilling showdown. Don Johnson has evolved from playing suave cops like Sonny Crockett in Miami Vice to morally compromised officers of the law these days, and in Rebel Ridge, he's earned accolades for playing a wickedly corrupt Louisiana police chief at the heart of the film.\n\nNetflix The Old Guard (2020) Based on the comic book by Greg Rucka, the action-fantasy The Old Guard stars Charlize Theron as one of a group of immortal mercenaries who are able to regenerate even after being killed. When they're tracked down and hunted by a pharmaceutical company that intends to study them, they fight back in an effort to protect themselves. The first film, released in 2020, was such a success that a sequel, The Old Guard 2, premiered in 2025 with Uma Thurman cast as Theron's newest adversary.\n\nSony Pictures One of Them Days (2025) One of Them Days is pure comedy gold. It's the perfect (R-rated) film when you're looking for something silly and fun and packed with great jokes and performances. The movie is part of the \"desperate best friends embark on a mission with a deadline\" genre (see also: Booksmart, Plan B) as best friends Dreux (Kiki Palmer) and Alyssa (SZA in her film debut) try to track down the rent money that was stolen by Alyssa's boyfriend before the end of the day. When they realize the money is gone, they desperately try to make all the money they need in one day, leading them to sell a pair of stolen Jordans and stage an art show to sell some of Alyssa's paintings. The film, which arrived on Netflix in March, features hilarious cameos from Katt Williams, Janelle James and Lil Rel Howery. Rumor has it a sequel is in the works.\n\nYoo Eun Mi/Netflix Ballerina (2023) Netflix's K-drama collection has a few hidden gems, including Ballerina, a 2023 revenge story about a former bodyguard seeking justice for her friend. Jang Ok-ju stops at nothing to make the offenders pay in this action-packed thriller. (Just don't get this Ballerina confused with the recent release of the same name starring Ana de Armas, which is also an action-packed revenge story -- that one's not on Netflix, at least not yet.)\n\nLewis Jacobs/Netflix Rez Ball (2024) A powerful story about a high school basketball team in New Mexico, Rez Ball takes viewers on a journey with the Chuska Warriors. When a tragic event strikes the team, it faces challenges on and off the court -- but still aims for a championship title. Co-written by Sydney Freeland and Sterlin Harjo (co-creator of Reservation Dogs), the movie is based on the novel Canyon Dreams: A Basketball Season on the Navajo Nation.\n\nNetflix Hit Man (2024) The 2024 action comedy was one of several movies starring Glen Powell that helped cement his leading-man status.

Disguising himself as a hitman, he adopts a new persona for each client -- until he falls for a woman (Adria Arjona) who hires him to kill her abusive husband.\n\nNetflix My Octopus Teacher (2020) 2020's My Octopus Teacher won an Oscar for best documentary feature for telling a personal and poignant story of the friendship between a man and an octopus he meets while diving. Filmed over the course of a year, Craig Foster documented the kinship he formed with the octopus who would repeatedly and playfully approach him. The film explores the often unseen personality of a creature found in the wild who ends up giving Foster insight into nature and his own relationships. If you're inspired by the natural world, the film's director Pippa Ehrlich's follow-up feature, Pangolin: Kulu's Journey, is on Netflix now, too.\n\nNetflix The Only Girl In The Orchestra (2024) The Only Girl in the Orchestra won an Oscar in 2025 for best documentary short and you can catch the 35-minute film exclusively on Netflix. The film is the story of Orin O'Brien, the first woman hired to perform in the New York Philharmonic (by Leonard Bernstein, no less). Often ogled for her looks and singled out for attention because of her gender, she rose above it all, staying true to her creative principles to become one of the orchestra's most renowned musicians for decades. Watch The Only Girl in the Orchestra on Netflix\n\nNetflix 1917 (2019) The critically lauded Oscar-winning film, 1917, directed by Sam Mendes about World War I, was remarkable for the fact that it was filmed with the intent of making it appear as though the entire movie was shot as two long, continuous takes. The movie stars George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman playing British soldiers traveling across a dangerous battle zone rigged by Germans in an effort to deliver a message to their superiors warning them of an impending attack. The film's stellar supporting cast includes Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong and Richard Madden.\n\nNetflix Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020) Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is dedicated to the memory of Chadwick Boseman, who made his final screen appearance in the film before his death in 2020. The film stars Boseman as Levee Green, a member of blues singer Ma Rainey's band (Viola Davis), and takes place amid one of the band's conflict-ridden and turbulent recording sessions in 1920s Chicago. Taylour Paige, Colman Domingo and Glynn Turman co-star in the film that was adapted from August Wilson's 1982 play. Watch Ma Rainey's Black Bottom on Netflix\n\nNetflix His Three Daughters (2024) Genre: Drama\n\nRating: R In His Three Daughters, Carrie Coon, Natasha Lyonne and Elizabeth Olsen star as three estranged sisters who come together in their dying father's small New York apartment to care for him in his last days. Writer-director Azazel Jacobs coaxes some incredible performances out of each actress for this intimate, emotional and often funny study of family dynamics. Watch His Three Daughters on Netflix\n\nNetflix Rustin (2023) Colman Domingo earned an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in this film about a man whose legacy has often been overlooked in civil rights history. Bayard Rustin fought alongside Martin Luther King Jr. and helped organize the 1963 March on Washington and the Freedom Rides, among other major historic events. Rustin's outspoken activism and homosexuality made him a target -- not just for political adversaries but sometimes even among his allies. The film explores the life of a man whose legacy has long been overlooked. Watch Rustin on Netflix\n\nNetflix Maestro (2023) This biographical film nabbed seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography and Best Picture. Maestro tells the story of conductor Leonard Bernstein (Bradley Cooper) and his relationship with actor Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan). In addition to starring in the romance drama, Cooper also directed and co-wrote the film and produced it alongside Hollywood legends Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Watch Maestro on Netflix\n\nNetflix The Lost Daughter (2021) Based on the novel by Elena Ferrante, The Lost Daughter stars Olivia Colman as a woman traveling alone to a seaside resort where she observes a mother and daughter. They send her into a bit of a spiral, recalling her own experiences as a young mother. The screenplay was adapted and directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal in her directorial debut. Watch The Lost Daughter on Netflix\n\nNetflix Society of the Snow (2023) The award-winning film, Society of the Snow, is based on true events and adapted from the book of the same name. In 1972, a rugby team from Uruguay boarded a plane to Chile for a game. The plane crashed in the Andes mountains, leaving survivors to contend with injuries, illness, cold temperatures and death. Not everyone makes it and those facing death make agonizing choices to live. Watch Society of the Snow on Netflix\n\nNetflix The Greatest Night in Pop (2024) If you weren't around at the time, it's hard to explain just how huge We Are the World was. Recorded by a supergroup of popular musicians -- assembled on the fly on the night of the 1985 American Music Awards -- the charity single benefiting Ethiopian famine victims sold more than 20 million copies and featured the likes of Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Diana Ross. (It feels impossible to imagine so many megastars assembling in one room for something like this today.) Luckily for us, there were cameras rolling the entire time as dozens of the world's most famous musicians pulled the epic all-night recording session. The recently departed Quincy Jones proves to be the night's true star, wrangling a studio full of nerves, egos and a little too much wine to produce something genuinely special. Watch The Greatest Night in Pop on Netflix\n\nNetflix Leave the World Behind (2023) An absorbingly unsettling psychological thriller, Leave the World Behind chronicles the strange events that arise during a family's getaway at an opulent rental home. A blackout renders their phones, TVs and other electronics useless and two strangers show up at the door.

Watch Nimona on Netflix\n\nNetflix The Swimmers (2022) This biographical film tells the story of two sisters, Yusra (Nathalie Issa) and Sarah Mardini (Manal Issa), who escape war-torn Syria. Amid all the strife and upheaval, Yusra works toward her dream of swimming in the Olympics. It's a touching narrative of hope and survival. Watch The Swimmers on Netflix\n\nNetflix All Quiet on the Western Front (2022) A World War I drama based on the classic novel of the same name, this epic depicts the horrors of war through the eyes of 17-year-old German soldier Paul Bäumer (Felix Kammerer). At first enthused about joining the army, in spite of his parents' wishes, Bäumer gets a violent wake-up call. All Quiet on the Western Front was a dominating force at the 95th Annual Academy Awards, as it was nominated for nine Oscars and ultimately walked away with four, including best international feature film.

            "content": "I'm no stranger to music -- I sing and play bajo and theremin in my band, Ropetrick. I also taught myself guitar (still a work in progress). But there's one instrument I haven't conquered yet: the piano.\n\nInstead of going through private lessons or stumbling through YouTube video tutorials, I went on a quest to see if a new gadget could get me up to speed quickly on how to read and play.\n\nThat's where the Roli Piano Learning System comes in. It promises to make piano lessons fun by using an iPad app paired with Roli's Piano -- a 49-key midi controller -- along with the Airwave, an instrument and controller that uses camera sensors to track your hand movements.\n\nIn this episode of Prove It, embedded above, I go through the process of teaching myself with a high-tech musical system.\n\nThis isn't just one device -- it's multiple machines coming together to be your teacher.\n\nAt the center is the Roli Piano, a $599 midi controller with keys that light up like a Simon memory game. It has one port for your sustain or expression pedal, and it has an USB-C port for charging and data transfer. You can also connect the piano to your phone or tablet with Bluetooth and access the ROLI Learn app.\n\nBecause it's a midi controller and not a standalone keyboard, it doesn't have a headphone jack or output for an instrument cable on the piano; its sound comes through whatever device you have it connected to. And if you connect it to your phone via Bluetooth and connect your phone to Bluetooth headphones or a speaker, you will notice latency between the time you strike a key and the time you hear the note.\n\nThe Airwave retails for $349 and is a new type of instrument Roli calls an \"expressive controller.\" It has two USB-C ports for charging and data, a pedal input, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It magnetically connects to your Roli Piano and uses USB-C to sync with the Roli Learn app on compatible iPads.\n\nBut the real draw of the Airwave is in the infrared cameras it uses to track your hand movements at a rate of 90 frames per second using something called Vision Technology. These cameras track your hands in real time, and the Airwave creates an animated version of them on screen. This allows the Roli Learn app to help correct your hand posture and it color-codes your fingers to match the color of the keys that you should play with them. If you're an experienced piano player, you can use the Airwave to create some seriously cool musical effects, like layering in multiple sounds with just a wave of your wrist.\n\nThe Roli Learn app ($14.99 a month) is so much fun to use. It combines YouTube-style video tutorials with an interactive interface that looks and feels a lot like Guitar Hero. The introductory courses are really easy to follow -- anyone could do it. (My colleague Bridget Carey says her 6-year-old enjoys using the included games to learn how to play.)\n\nI really appreciate the diversity of human instructors in the video lessons and love that the app features popular music, like Sabrina Carpenter's \"Espresso\" and MGMT's \"Kids,\" in addition to piano classics and skill exercises.\n\nIf you wanted to get started with Roli, there are cheaper ways in, such as using the iPhone app with the smaller Roli Piano M model for $249 -- and you can add on from there.\n\nMy biggest issues when learning a new instrument are finding ways to keep it fun and staying motivated to practice. And after playing with the Roli Piano Learning System for a month, I think I could actually become a decent pianist by learning this way.\n\nWatch this episode of Prove It as I put it to the test, and see if it's something that would work for you."

Other feelings include connected, relaxed and calm. Disconnecting from tech improves over half (56%) of US adults' moods. Yet, 44% feel in control and powerful when they stay connected to their devices.\n\nof US adults' moods. Yet, feel in control and powerful when they stay connected to their devices. Experts recommend setting screen time limits using apps, adjusting your phone settings, and following other wellness tips.\n\nMany US adults feel 'in control' with tech, but that's concerning\n\nOur CNET survey found that despite nearly 70% of US adults saying their lives are derailed by a glitch, 46% of US adults have a sense of control when tech is running smoothly.\n\nCole Kan/CNET\n\nGragert pointed out that human beings are wired for control, craving the ability to map out the unknown and seek the comfort of predictability. \"We want to have control over our lives and what's going to happen to us. But we can't,\" Gragert says.\n\nUsing technology to pay our bills, map our commutes and call our friends can make us feel like we're winning at productivity and that our personal assistants are successfully connecting us to the real world. But that constant reliance on technology can be a double-edged sword, especially when it comes to social media.\n\nGragert says we cannot curate our emotions as easily as we curate our feeds. Social media algorithms often take away our ability to regulate our emotions while scrolling. For example, doomscrolling can turn into emotional turmoil when a triggering post catches us off guard. That proves that when we're online, we're at the mercy of our algorithm.\n\n\"What appears on our feeds can be triggering or can give us imposter syndrome, make us feel left out, and make us feel like we're not good enough,\" Gragert says. And when kids and teens stay connected to tech, they can be exposed to inappropriate content and cyberbullying.\n\nUS adults are nearly split on how it feels to disconnect from tech\n\nOne shocking find is how US adults are nearly split on how they feel when connected versus disconnected from technology.\n\nOver half (56%) of US adults say their mood improves when disconnecting from tech, whereas 44% feel powerful and in control when they're constantly connected. Both datapoints make sense to Gragert because how we use social media is a journey.\n\nCole Kan/CNET\n\nInitially, you may feel good about your social media intake because of ads based on your interests and fun posts you see. However, it can turn into a dangerous cycle as you spend more time online, Gragert says.\n\nYou may notice your mood shift when you see a negative headline or a reel that triggers imposter syndrome. Over time, you may not feel as productive or present in your day to day if you spend hours on your phone.\n\n56% of US adults may already have experienced a journey similar to this example, so they may feel better disconnected, Gragert adds. On the other hand, 44% may be at the start of the journey of feeling happy online, and may not have experienced many of those negative feelings, such as depression, anxiety or procrastination.\n\nHow to cut your screen time without giving up your favorite tech\n\nThere are plenty of ways you can lower your screen time, but your method depends on what works best for you. For instance, I've tried putting my phone in another room, but I've found that using my phone's settings to block apps while working or during family time works best. Here are a few methods that Gragert recommends trying.\n\nFollow the 20-20-20 rule\n\nThe 20-20-20 rule can protect your eye health and serve as a starting point for cutting back on screen time, whether you're working on your laptop or doomscrolling. \"When you've been scrolling or on your computer for 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Then repeat,\" Gragert says.\n\nAs you get comfortable following this rule, you may increase the time you spend away from your phone. For example, starting with two minutes to complete a task and extending the time as you progress.\n\nSet boundaries around use\n\nGragert says you can still use your phone and other personal gadgets, but it may be best to set boundaries if you're worried about your screen time. For example, maybe don't use your phone right when you wake up, since it may raise your cortisol levels, which can make you feel emotional. You may also avoid using your phone an hour before bed to start winding down and avoid seeing anything online that can make you emotional before sleep.\n\nDownload productivity apps\n\nMy husband uses Opal, an app that helps him reduce his screen time. You'll pick apps and websites that are counterproductive, and Opal will lock you out of those apps for designated hours (like while you're working). If you need access to those apps, you can request a break but it will give you different notifications reminding you that the app or site is blocked during that time.\n\nCNET's wellness writer, Giselle Castro-Sloboda, also recommends blocking apps. One standout option is Brick, a magnet that locks you out of apps you choose. You'll open the Brick app to choose which apps to block, use the app button, then tap the Brick to block the apps for an allotted amount of time. When you're ready, you'll tap your phone on the Brick to unblock the apps and websites.\n\nWatch this: Brick: How I Stopped Wasting Time on My iPhone 04:15\n\nEnable your phone settings\n\nAndroid and Apple devices have several features to help reduce screen time. I just tested the App Limits setting on my iPhone 14 Pro to limit my time on Instagram. I have a two-hour limit for my favorite apps every day. Before this setting, my average screen time was 6.5 hours. Now, it's down to slightly under 4 hours a day.\n\nApp Limits allows me to schedule when select apps are available. The setting blocks my apps between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., but it still gives me options to ignore the limit for one minute, 15 minutes or the remainder of the day in case I need to complete a quick task, like checking the weather or my calendar, before blocking the app again. Here's how App Limits works and how to set it up.\n\nIf phone settings like App Limits don't work for you, try setting an alarm you physically turn off to get you away from your phone. Gragert recommends setting a timer on your microwave or oven. When the timer is done, get up. Try giving yourself 15 minutes to drink water or go for a walk before picking up your phone again.\n\nMethodology\n\nA quantitative online survey was conducted from Oct. 27 to Nov. 9, 2025, with US adults ages 18 to 70 in partnership with Method and Mode. The study surveyed over 3,700 respondents, including N=2,665 CNET Media Group consumers and a nationally representative sample of N=1,050 adults, weighted to US Census benchmarks for age, gender and region. All of the results are quantitative, with differences between sub-segments statistically significant at the 95% confidence level."

            "content": "It's Wednesday, around 6 p.m. It's been a busy day, but I'm already carving a perfectly roasted chicken on my favorite ebony cutting board, the bird's juices spilling out from under crispy skin and filling up the board's reservoir like a moat.\n\nFor years, Ina Garten's roasted chicken — or some variation of it — has been a Sunday tradition for me. It's not particularly decadent or overly involved, but it's reserved for Sundays because of its roughly 2 hours of total cooking time. Now, the same recipe, adapted for the air fryer, hits the table in under an hour.\n\nAfter months of owning an air fryer and experimenting mostly with versions of traditionally fried foods, such as wings, fries and chicken cutlets, I made my first air fryer roast chicken on a whim. Stunned by the speedy cooking time — 25% faster than traditional roasting — tender meat and impossibly crispy skin without the usual tablespoon of butter, I haven't put a bird in the oven since.\n\nOf all the kitchen tools I've collected, and there are many, the air fryer has shifted my cooking paradigm the most, making cooking easier, faster and more foolproof. Few and far between are air fryer fails, and frequent are the discoveries of something I'd been \"making wrong\" all along until I roasted it quickly under spiraling superconvection heat.\n\nSave for the rare batch of cookies or large cut of meat for a dinner party, the air fryer has all but replaced my oven. I plan meals around it: If a recipe calls for my oven — meatloaf, roasted salmon, charred cauliflower — I consider how I might adapt it for the air fryer.\n\nCelebrated chef and restaurateur Stephanie Izard shares my enthusiasm. \"It's such a versatile tool,\" the James Beard Award winner tells me. \"I use mine all the time for dinners,\" she adds, naming fried rice, marinated chicken and salmon as a few of her go-tos. \"It's like making one-pot meals — but roasted!\"\n\nWe're not alone.\n\nAccording to a CNET survey, over 70% of US adults either own or plan to own an air fryer within the year. Additional studies estimate that about 60% of American households have already made the purchase.\n\nTo put that in perspective: Since the turn of the century, only a small handful of products -- smartphones, Bluetooth speakers -- have matched this level of rapid, widespread adoption for a novel consumer technology category. And no other kitchen appliance even comes close.\n\nEven at its peak, the limited available sales data suggest that the Instant Pot -- a digitized pressure cooker and slow cooker in one --never reached such heights. Instant Pot sales have steadily declined following the multicooker boom, and the company that made most of them filed for bankruptcy in 2023. The air fryer, meanwhile, has rocketed from trendy novelty to everyday essential in record time and shows no signs of slowing.\n\nGuy Fieri, the chef, restaurateur and impresario of TV cooking shows, is another high-profile acolyte. \"An air fryer has a permanent place on my kitchen counter,\" Fieri tells me. He cites wings, roasted potatoes and leftover egg rolls as a few staples that are regulars in his air fryer. \"You can crisp, roast or reheat and still get that pro-level finish every time.\"\n\nOnce pitched as a healthier alternative to deep-frying, air fryers are now edging out ovens, toasters and grills for everyday use. For many people I spoke to, the air fryer has become the most frequently used appliance in their kitchen, reshaping cooking routines and eating habits.\n\nEvery member of my own family and most of my friends keep an air fryer planted on the counter. Some, like my sister, who regularly cooks for a household of five, uses it so often for quick snacks and meals that she jokingly refers to life \"before and after the air fryer\" as two very different realities.\n\nAn entire ecosystem has emerged around air fryers as well. Recipe bloggers, cooking influencers, accessory makers and air fryer manufacturers have all contributed to the movement, solidifying the device's place at the center of fast and modern home cooking.\n\nWhat is everyone air-frying?\n\nAir fryers may have made their debut as the go-to gadget for crisping up wings and fries, but fans have quickly realized that these countertop convection powerhouses can handle much more than game-day fare.\n\nTake Jenny Catton, a UK-based food blogger who bought her first air fryer in 2022. Three plus years and one torrid affair with a small appliance later, Catton now runs The Air Fryer Kitchen, a popular recipe blog dedicated to air fryer cooking.\n\nCole Kan/CNET/Getty Images/Jenny Catton\n\nLike many, Catton initially used her air fryer for frozen foods and pub-style snacks, but her approach quickly evolved. Now, her weekly staples include air-fried salmon wrapped in foil with herbs and butter and batches of homemade granola.\n\nHer readers have also moved beyond the basics. Two of the most-visited recipes on The Air Fryer Kitchen? Banana chocolate chip muffins and pork steaks.\n\nA quick internet search surfaces dozens of other websites dedicated to air fryer cooking, and old-guard food magazines are getting in on the act. Epicurious, Food & Wine and others have lists of air fryer recipes that are many scrolls long and include fare decidedly not for game day. Think air-fried burrata and air-fried roast chicken with rosemary and orange sauce.\n\nWhile the air fryer's top-down heat and smaller size may not be suitable for all things — large roasts and most baking projects are still best in a traditional oven — one could go months using only an air fryer and not run out of new things to cook. And one — me — often does.\n\nFor a prior story, we asked chefs about the best vegetables to air-fry, and the list was long. Most meat and seafood also turn out rather well in an air fryer.\n\nIn our own testing, we unearthed even more unusual air fryer success stories. The fierce, fast heat of the air fryer is enough to char a burger patty to medium-rare in minutes (and you can toast the bun while you're at it). Grilled cheese turns out crisp and less soggy than when pan-fried in oil, and hot dogs earn their coveted caramelized snap without firing up the Weber. For reheating leftovers, the microwave consistently falls short of what an air fryer can do in roughly the same amount of time.\n\nEnlarge Image Cole Kan/CNET/Getty Images/Font texture assisted by AI\n\nSo what's really behind the surge in air fryer popularity? For Catton, it all comes down to speed.\n\n\"Air fryers can handle nearly any dish you'd cook in a traditional oven, but in a fraction of the time,\" she says. \"They're ideal for busy people. Once someone tries an air fryer, they usually tell their friends, and then those friends want one too.\"\n\nCNET's survey supports her claim: 64% of respondents said they use their air fryer because it cooks faster, and 65% cited its simplicity.\n\nAnother big driver? A healthier approach to comfort food. Air fryers promise the crispy indulgence of fried favorites with a fraction of the oil.\n\nAccording to Ninja, one of the leading producers of air fryers globally, the mighty convection cookers use 75% less oil than deep-frying to achieve the same or similar results.\n\n\"[The air fryer] has a permanent place on my kitchen counter.\" Guy Fieri, chef and restaurateur\n\nTo arrive at this figure, the company, which has a sensory team dedicated to refining the recipes and real-world functionality of its kitchen appliances, conducted extensive testing and consumer research. First, it identified the ideal french fry texture when cooked in oil, then cooked fries in the air fryer using a bit more oil every time until taste testers declared them equal to their deep-fried counterparts.\n\nHealthier fries that taste like the real thing would be reason enough for many of us to splurge, but Ninja's precise calculation applies to dozens of other traditionally fried foods. For serial snackers, the appeal of the air fryer is sizable and clear.\n\nWho's buying air fryers? Everyone\n\nIf you'd asked me a decade ago which kitchen gadget would revolutionize home cooking, I would've confidently said the multicooker. Fast forward 10 years: Instant Pot sales have cooled, and the air fryer has undeniably claimed the mantle.\n\nBy the late 2010s, air fryer sales were already soaring — an impressive feat for any new product category. Then the pandemic hit. Like many home-centric devices, air fryers saw explosive growth during lockdown, with sales jumping 76% from 2020 to 2021. That surge translated to 25.6 million units sold and nearly $1 billion in revenue.\n\nIt would be easy to chalk that up to a pandemic-fueled fad, but the momentum didn't stop. During the height of COVID-19, approximately 36% of Americans owned an air fryer. That number has since nearly doubled. Last year, sales rose another 10.2%.\n\nThe US leads the charge by far. In 2023, American consumers accounted for $233.8 million of the more than $1 billion in global air fryer sales. The UK, the second-largest market, trailed with under $90 million.\n\nInterest in air fryers spans generational lines as well. Our survey found that 62% of Gen Xers use an air fryer, followed by millennials and Baby Boomers at 56% each, and Gen Z at 51%.\n\nEnlarge Image Cole Kan/CNET/Getty Images/Ketchup font texture assisted by AI\n\nIn short, everyone seems to be hot on air fryers. According to Statista, if current trends continue, 113.6 million more air fryers will be sold by 2029.\n\nThe rise of the air fryer: How did we get here?\n\nThe air fryer made its market debut in 2010, when Philips acquired a patent for \"rapid air technology\" from the late Dutch inventor Fred van der Weij, who developed the prototype four years earlier.\n\nThe idea was straightforward: intense convection heat, driven by a high-powered fan, circulates hot air around the food at high speed. This rapid airflow crisps the outer layers while keeping the inside moist — mimicking the effect of deep-frying, but without all the oil.\n\nAt first, the air fryer seemed like another passing gimmick, something destined for the QVC clearance bin alongside Slap Chop, Juicero and countless other overhyped, underused kitchen tools.\n\n\"As living spaces shrink, especially in cities, an air fryer could be more practical than a full wall oven.\" Jenny Catton, food blogger\n\nThe somewhat awkward name didn't help its credibility. Nor did early endorsements from overexposed celebrity chefs like Emeril Lagasse and Gordon Ramsay, both known for pushing branded cooking gadgets with perhaps a little too much enthusiasm.\n\nYet, the air fryer slowly earned its place in home kitchens, building a loyal fan base and influential backers. A turning point occurred in 2016 when Oprah included it in her cult-followed \"Favorite Things\" list. From there, its status began to solidify -- joining the ranks of the blender, slow cooker and cast-iron skillet as an indispensable cooking tool. Ten years later, an air fryer — this time Cosori's TurboBlaze smart oven — maintains a coveted spot on Winfrey's curated gifting list.\n\nDave Farmer, CEO of Versuni, which acquired Philips' air fryer business in 2021, recalls another landmark moment that signaled the world was taking air fryers seriously.\n\n\"At a certain point, we saw consumer packaged goods including air fryer cooking instructions on the back of the box, along with stovetop, oven and microwave,\" he tells me. \"Now air fryer directions are standard on bags of french fries, boxes of veggie burgers and other quick-fire frozen foods.\"\n\nThe glass air fryer era is upon us\n\nUntil recently, air fryers largely came in one of two forms.\n\nThe most common type is a basket-style air fryer, recognizable by its pull-out drawer. These models typically include a single basket with a perforated tray — or a nested perforated basket — that allows air to circulate around the food for even crisping.\n\nInside an air fryer, a high-powered fan circulates hot air around the food at high speed using rapid airflow to crisp the outer layers of the food Cole Kan/Jeffrey Hazelwood/CNET/Getty Images\n\nThere are also oven-style air fryers, which resemble a standard toaster oven but are supercharged with air fryer technology. These versions typically come with multiple racks and baking trays, offering more cooking space. They're also, on balance, more expensive and decidedly more onerous to clean.\n\nBut in late 2024, Ninja disrupted the category with a bold new design: a glass-chamber air fryer called the Crispi. Unlike anything else on the market, the nontoxic Crispi quickly shot to the top of our best air fryers list after we tested more than 24 models. It's the one I use at home and has become my recommendation for readers, friends and family.\n\nAccording to Ninja, the Crispi didn't just impress me — it made waves across the industry, earning widespread acclaim and garnering over 715 million social media impressions since its launch.\n\nLess polished versions of the glass air fryer preceded the Crispi, and several brands, including Kismile, quickly launched copycat models. Like a boom within a boom, these transparent, nontoxic and high-performance air fryers are poised to become the new norm — or at least a defining option — in future design.\n\nAs a longtime leader in home appliances with a rosy market outlook, Ninja isn't taking its foot off the gas.\n\nI visited Ninja's sprawling campus headquarters just outside Boston, where the team was preparing to launch the Crispi Pro, a $280 update of its headline-making appliance. The brand, known also for its powerful vacuums, blenders and other small home appliances, currently has a whopping 20 air fryers on the market and many more products featuring an air fryer setting or similar technology.\n\n\"I wish someone would make a supersized version.\" Stephanie Izard, chef and restaurateur\n\nI was invited into the test kitchen, where Ninja's sensory team tests air fryer recipes and delivers its findings back to the folks in engineering. Ninja's 3D printing operation enables them to create physical representations of air fryer concepts in just hours, allowing consumer-ready models to hit shelves faster than ever.\n\nGregory Fish, Ninja's head of product design, is bullish on the air fryer segment and credits the Crispi's success to two standout features: its glass cooking chamber and modular design. The glass allows home cooks to watch their food cook in real time, and the entire chamber is 100% nontoxic, with no nonstick coating. That also makes it easier to deep-clean, whether by hand or in the dishwasher.\n\n\"Much of the insight came from seeing people use their air fryers for everything from simple reheating to full meals,\" Fish says.\n\nBeyond the added capacity, convenience and toxin-free makeup of the larger, more modular Crispi, what really struck a chord with consumers was this air fryer's potential to replace their oven altogether.\n\nCan air fryers really replace ovens?\n\nWith air fryers now in roughly six out of 10 US homes and ownership growing steadily, it's fair to ask: How far can this air fryer thing go?\n\nAmong owners, usage is impressively high. According to Data Bridge Market Research, the average household turns to its air fryer 4.2 times per week, replacing traditional oven use for 35% of cooking occasions.\n\nI asked Catton, the air fryer recipe blogger, whether she thinks air fryers will eventually overtake full-size ovens. For her, it's not a question of if, but when.\n\n\"I think this will happen,\" Catton says. \"As living spaces shrink, especially in cities, an air fryer could be more practical than a full wall oven.\"\n\nEnlarge Image Cole Kan/CNET/Getty Images/Chefman/Cuisinart\n\nCapacity is one of the few advantages that traditional ovens still have over their modern counterparts. You'll still need them for your Thanksgiving turkey. However, air fryers excel in speed and energy efficiency — they cook faster, use less energy and don't require preheating.\n\nThey're also relatively cheap, with budget models available for as little as $50. Higher-end air fryers exist, but it's not a complex technology. If you're paying more than $200 for an air fryer, you're probably overpaying.\n\n\"Whether you're a new cook or a pro, it's the easiest way to bring the heat and still keep it healthy.\" Guy Fieri\n\nNinja, which gathers extensive user feedback, shares Catton's optimism. \"We're seeing people cook entire meals -- chicken on one side, Brussels sprouts on the other,\" a rep for the company told me. \"In many ways, it's replacing how people use their oven.\"\n\nTraditional oven manufacturers have taken notice. Many modern models, including my Samsung induction oven, now feature built-in air fryer settings. I've tested a few — they get the job done, but they lack what makes standalone air fryers shine: a compact chamber that circulates hot air quickly and evenly for that signature crisp.\n\nWhat health experts say about air fryers\n\nMost health experts agree that air fryers can be a healthier alternative to deep-frying. By using little to no oil, one can reduce calories by up to 80% and significantly lower fat intake.\n\nEnlarge Image According to Ninja, air fryers use 75% less oil than deep-frying to achieve the same crispy texture for French fries. Cole Kan/CNET/Getty Images/Font texture assisted by AI\n\nIn a Cleveland Clinic investigation into the health benefits of air fryer cooking, dietitian Julia Zumpano noted that air fryers \"eliminate the need for added oils entirely.\" Research shows that air frying can reduce acrylamide — a potentially carcinogenic compound found in fried potatoes — by up to 90%.\n\nBut let's be clear: air fryers aren't a panacea for an unhealthy diet. They can't remove saturated fat from bacon or trans fats from highly processed snacks. Cooking empty carbs with less oil still leaves you with empty carbs.\n\nThe British Heart Foundation echoes this nuance. Air frying doesn't offer extra health benefits for foods that don't typically require added fat to begin with, such as sausages, bacon or pre-breaded chicken. In those cases, it's just a different way to cook, not necessarily a healthier one.\n\nAnd so the quest for healthy bacon continues.\n\nWhat chefs think about air fryers\n\nWhile dietitians are quick to praise air fryers, it's harder to find career chefs who share the sentiment, with many dismissing them or refusing to offer comment.\n\nStephanie Izard is an exception. A champion of Top Chef and Iron Chef, Izard owns six acclaimed restaurants, most in Chicago, and proudly admits she \"always has an air fryer on the counter.\"\n\n\"I love using it to bake small batches,\" Izard says. \"It [cooks] so evenly compared to my convection oven, and it heats up incredibly fast. They're perfect for crisping pork belly or other proteins, and for roasting vegetables like squash or Brussels sprouts to get that nice crunch without deep frying.\"\n\nAs for using an air fryer in one of those six restaurant kitchens, Izard laments that \"they're just not big enough to be practical. I wish someone would make a supersized version.\"\n\nSince the turn of the century, only the smartphone has matched the air fryer's level of rapid, widespread adoption for a new category of consumer technology.\n\nFieri, who soared to celebrity status with the show Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, is so enamored with air fryers that he has added one to his Flavortown kitchen and cookware collection, featuring a steam function designed to keep food from drying out. (Phillips also makes a steam air fryer.)\n\nAsked about the use of air fryers in professional settings, Fieri says, \"I'm starting to see more chefs use air fryer-style tech for quick tests or catering gigs. They're efficient, cleaner and great for nailing texture without dropping everything in oil.\"\n\nThat love for the air fryer doesn't extend to all chefs and food influencers.\n\nYouTube chef Brian Lagerstrom has been notably vocal in his criticism, calling air fryers \"kinda dumb\" and advocating for traditional stove-oven combinations. Other culinary pros, such as TV chef James Martin, expressed similar doubts, dismissing air fryers as merely tabletop convection ovens with limited applications and middling results.\n\nWhether air fryers find their way into restaurant kitchens and favor with the culinary elite is, in some ways, irrelevant. Consumers are plunking them down on their counters at a record clip and, according to many I've spoken with, finding more ways to use them. More than 15 years into the air fryer era, with sales still on the rise, it feels safe to move the air fryer from a cooking trend to a kitchen staple.\n\nAs Fieri puts it, using his unmistakable parlance, \"I'm about tools that make cooking more fun and flavorful. Whether you're a new cook or a pro, it's the easiest way to bring the heat and still keep it healthy.\"\n\nFor me, there's no going back\n\nTo understand the unique value an air fryer offers the average home cook and, thus, its breakneck rise in popularity, you needn't look further than my Sunday roast chicken — now available on weekdays.\n\nSimply put, air fryers cook food fast and with less oil or grease. The results, at least for many foods cooked with superconvection, are as good or better than other clunkier, slower, greasier methods -- a sentiment backed by a few of the world's most celebrated chefs.\n\nThat a reliable unit can be had for less than $75 only bolsters its quest for a home in every kitchen.\n\nWhile some drag their feet, still writing the air fryer off as a nothing gimmick, nothing more than a toaster oven with a funny name, unworthy of the countertop real estate it demands, I'll be here enjoying my chicken, salmon, grilled cheese, and whatever revelation comes next.\n\nCNET commissioned YouGov Plc to conduct the survey cited here. All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. Total sample size was 1,190 adults, of whom 839 own an air fryer or are planning on buying one in the next 12 months. Fieldwork was undertaken Sept. 24-25, 2025. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all US adults (aged 18 plus).\n\nVisual Designer | Cole Kan\n\nArt Director | Jeffrey Hazelwood\n\nCreative Director | Viva Tung\n\nVideo Host/Editor | JD Christison\n\nCamera Operator | Owen Poole\n\nProject Manager | Danielle Ramirez\n\nEditors | Corinne Reichert, Katie Collins\n\nDirector of Content | Jonathan Skillings"

Today's event had its share of big news and a few surprises.\n\nWatch this: Samsung Unpacked 2026: The Future of AI Has Arrived (Highlights) 10:34\n\nGalaxy S26 Ultra\n\nOne expected announcement was the reveal of the flagship Galaxy phone, the S26 Ultra. In fact, Samsung barely mentioned the other two phones being rolled out today: the Galaxy S26 and Galaxy S26 Plus.\n\nSamsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra is slightly lighter and thinner than the S25 Ultra, features the new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor for Galaxy, has an aluminum frame instead of titanium, and incorporates new display technology, including Privacy Display.\n\nThe S26 Ultra became the hook on which almost everything else announced at the event hung, from AI features to camera technology.\n\nCNET's Abrar Al-Heeti wrote about her first hands-on experience with the Galaxy S26 Ultra, and we'll follow up with full reviews of it and the other S26 phones as we have more time to test them out.\n\nS26 Ultra Privacy Display\n\nPhone display news typically centers on brightness and resolution, but Samsung Unpacked revealed a new technology that looks genuinely useful in everyday situations.\n\nSnoopy coworkers? Privacy Display can thwart their nosy efforts. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\n\"Look\" is probably the wrong word, though, because the Privacy Display feature lets you hide sensitive information on your screen. It's like a sheet of privacy film that can be turned on or off and applied to specific apps and content.\n\nWhen you turn on Privacy Display, people sneaking peeks at your phone from the sides will see just a darkened screen. Or you can choose to enable it when, for example, you're using your banking app or sending text messages. The technology isn't just a full-screen, all-on/all-off implementation: You can configure it so that only incoming notifications get the privacy treatment.\n\nNarrow pixels focus light output to reduce the field of view. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nThis is all accomplished using a clever technology Samsung calls Black Matrix. Normally, display pixels are designed to cast light in the widest possible angle for better visibility. With the Black Matrix, some display pixels include physical rings that can narrow their light output and disrupt visibility from the sides.\n\nCNET's Katie Collins thinks Privacy Display is the one feature that sets the S26 Ultra apart from every other phone right now, and Macy Meyer is looking forward to scrolling in peace away from \"shoulder surfers.\"\n\nGalaxy S26 and S26 Plus\n\nThe S26 phones most people will buy got only a few mentions, but a few things about them stand out, as CNET's Patrick Holland explains in his first-hand look.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S26 and Galaxy S26 Plus Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nThe Galaxy S26 has a larger screen than the S25 it replaces, which means it's also slightly taller and wider. However, it keeps the same 7.8mm thickness, which Holland says makes it feel slimmer overall. That design also includes a larger, 4,300-mAh battery, which is welcome news; the S26 Plus includes the same 4,900-mAh battery as its predecessor.\n\nNot as welcome? Both phones are now $100 more expensive than the ones they replace, at $900 and $1,100 for the 256GB models. (The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, keeps its $1,300 price tag.)\n\nAll New Samsung Browser, Including Perplexity\n\nI know this comes as a shock, but AI featured heavily in Samsung's presentation. And while a lot of the language is still couched in the future-tense \"you will be able to,\" Samsung did show off some practical applications of AI.\n\nSamsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nIt introduced a new Samsung Browser that, at heart, is tied to AI vendor Perplexity. Using an Ask AI tool, the browser can research queries across all the browser tabs, and even your search history, to bring up the answers you're looking for.\n\nPatrick Holland got more details about Samsung's and Perplexity's relationship.\n\nNow Nudge\n\nAnother AI tool announced at the event is Now Nudge, a feature intended to feel like a low-key personal assistant but not one that tries to micromanage your life.\n\nNow Nudge is envisioned as a less-intrusive personal assistant. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nIn the example Samsung gave, when a friend mentions photos you and they shared in a chat, Now Nudge could surface those photos so you have them ready to share, instead of digging through your photo library to find them.\n\nOr, it can bring up calendar events related to a conversation: When a friend asks if you're free on a specific date to go out for dinner, Now Nudge can pop that day up without you leaving the chat app. According to Samsung, \"it helps you stay in your flow.\"\n\nIt's certainly interesting to see at least a partial acknowledgment that not everyone wants AI to handle every task.\n\nGalaxy Buds 4 Series\n\nIt wasn't all phones at the Galaxy Unpacked Event. Samsung introduced the Galaxy Buds 4 earbuds, showcasing a fresh look and numerous internal changes. The woofer design is wider, with 20% more vibration area for deeper, richer sound.\n\nThe Galaxy Buds 4 Pro come in four color options, including a new pink gold color. Vanessa Teal/CNET\n\nCNET's David Carnoy, in his review, says the $250 Galaxy Buds 4 Pro offer excellent sound with upgraded drivers, updated noise cancelling and top-tier voice calling and transparency mode.\n\nThey're available for preorder on Feb. 26 and begin shipping March 11.\n\nSmarter Circle to Search\n\nSamsung and Google really, really want you to shop for clothing using AI, it seems. The Circle to Search feature, which lets you identify an item in a photo and get more information about it, has been updated to let you select multiple items within the circle.\n\nUse Circle to Search to view all items of a person's outfit. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nIn Samsung's example, you can draw a circle around someone's entire outfit and it will identify all the pieces… shirt, jacket, pants, shoes and the like. Are clothing stores seeing an uptick in sales from features like this, or does it just make for a good demo? We'll have to see for ourselves.\n\nGalaxy AI Photo Editing\n\nCameras are always a big part of new phone announcements, and although the camera hardware in the Galaxy S26 phones remains largely unchanged (the S26 Ultra has wider apertures to let in more light on its main and ultrawide cameras), the AI features continue to press ahead.\n\nTell Galaxy AI how you'd like to edit a photo. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nOne thing that stood out is the ability to use AI to edit photos by making voice requests or text prompts. This is what the company mentioned before the event when it teased a new \"Galaxy camera experience\" was coming. In one example, the presenter showed how a cupcake with a bite taken out could be repaired (with a not-so-subtle upbraiding of the unnamed friend who dared to chomp before a photo was taken).\n\nThe upside is that people who don't know how to edit photos or are intimidated by the various controls can ask for a result and let the generative AI engine create it for them.\n\nGoogle showed off similar features when it introduced the Pixel 10 Pro last year.\n\nSee Andrew Lanxon's look at what's changed in the S26 camera systems."
