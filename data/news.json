            "content": "APRIL 25 could be a date for your diaries as there is a dramatic dogfight for the one automatic promotion place into the English Football League.\n\nIt sees runaway non-league leaders Rochdale and York clash at Spotland Stadium on the final day of the season.\n\n\n\nBut this potential winner-takes-all showdown masks a glaring wrong — the EFL doesn’t give a single penny to the National League.\n\n\n\nCan you imagine the sense of outrage from EFL clubs if the Premier League pulled the plug and decided to no longer finance them, to the tune of around £300million per season.\n\nIt would lead to accusations of bare-faced, pigs-in-the-trough greed and yet the EFL does literally nothing to help the National League.\n\nIn football, we are all supposed to belong to one big, football family where organisations help each other.\n\nBut while the EFL gleefully takes Premier League cash, it mysteriously stops short of doing the same thing for their cousins in the National League.\n\n\n\nPlus, the concept of three up, three down runs throughout the EFL but stops short of the National League, where only two teams are promoted, one automatically as champions.\n\nNot exactly a level playing field, is it? In fact, in recent years the EFL has demanded even greater ‘redistribution’ — cash to you and me — from the Premier League.\n\nTo justify their stance, the EFL says it creates only a fraction of the wealth of the Premier League and therefore urgently needs a financial leg-up.\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nBut when it comes to doling out their own funds to the National League, the same principle somehow does not apply.\n\n\n\nEven though the EFL just got nearly £1BILLION of TV revenue from selling their broadcast rights, they still won’t pass a single penny down to the league below them.\n\nWhy? Beats me.\n\nA relatively modest amount handed over to the National League would underline the EFL’s solidarity with their lower neighbours, as well as show a degree of consistency which is currently missing.\n\nAnother EFL justification is they claim to be financially fragile, and as such, every penny clubs receive is fully merited.\n\nThe Premier League could actually make the same argument, as there is close to £4BILLION worth of debt in Prem clubs.\n\n\n\nBut we don’t make that argument, we just continue to push funds downwards, including the fact that the Prem is the sole funder of all football, including being the ONLY funder of the National League and Women’s Super League.\n\nThe National League is almost completely professional and therefore subject to exactly the same financial pressures. They are just as much a part of their communities, yet they do not enjoy the same safety net as EFL clubs.\n\nI would agree that relegation is a financial catastrophe for League Two teams but surely you could say the same about relegation for any club, from any league.\n\nSee the Spanish Grand Prix for just £569 WE’VE got an amazing price on a trip to the Spanish GP in June – but you’ll have to be quick.

Don’t miss Spanish GP trip for just £569\n\nThere is nothing extra special about going from the EFL to the National League.\n\nThe football pyramid is supposed to function as a connected system with the biggest boys handing over to the big boys, who then hand over to the smaller boys, who then pass it on to the smallest.\n\n\n\nYet this sense of pyramid responsibility only goes so far, as National League clubs are left out of the equation by the EFL.\n\nFootball must be a meritocracy and it strikes me that the EFL is very keen to protect their own, less enthused about helping others.\n\nAs for the National League’s demand for three promotion and relegation places, the EFL will discuss this in March and I hope they see common sense.\n\nWhat’s good for the goose is also good for the gander.\n\nFor fans of Rochdale and York, who are both well clear of the pack, this will be a nervous time as the financial rewards of a leap into the EFL are immense.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nBut whoever misses out on automatic promotion — and it is likely to be one of them — can blame a flawed system.\n\nThe EFL should do the decent thing. Firstly, fall in line with their own promotion and relegation rules and secondly, as the saying goes, ‘show them the money’."

The Donbass Arena in Ukraine was built as the home of Shakhtar Donetsk, designed by the same construction firm that created the Etihad Stadium and the Allianz Arena.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe 52,000 seater cost £318million to build, opening its doors on August 29, 2009, after three years of construction. At the time, it was a sign of progressive thinking as the eastern European country, which only regained independence in 1991, looked out to the world.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUkrainian giants Shakhtar flew the flag for their country in Europe as the Donbass Arena regularly hosted Champions League matches. Manchester United faced Shakhtar there in October 2013 in the competition, with the sides drawing 1-1.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

The stadium also hosted five games at Euro 2012, including England's draw with France, and Spain’s penalty shootout victory over Portugal in the semi-finals.\n\nHowever, it was only in use for five years, being abandoned in 2014 and not used since. The UEFA Category 4 ground was shelled after the Donbas war broke out between Ukraine and Russia in 2014.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIncredible stadium bigger than Wembley half-finished and abandoned after cash problems READ MORE :\n\nEerie Six Nations stadium left abandoned as images show 30,000-seater venue in tatters READ MORE :\n\nShakhtar's last game there was in 2014, a 3-1 over Illichivets Mariupol that secured a fifth straight league title, but barely 18,000 people turned up as the city braced for war.\n\nLater that year, it sustained serious damage from the turnstiles and entrances as a result of heavy artillery and explosions as the conflict escalated. A shell initially crashed into the arena, starting a fire. A rocket also later landed in the vicinity of the stadium.\n\nView 4 Images The Donbass Arena was abandoned in 2014 and damaged in 2022 (Image: Alexander Ermochenko/EPA/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPictures from the time show the stadium with part of its roof and facade blown off and various pieces of debris strewn across the floor outside.\n\n\"It was pretty costly to repair the roof after the blast pulled it off,\" Victoria, a stadium guide, told the BBC in 2019. \"The job needs finishing, and that takes money the DPR don't have.\"\n\nView 4 Images It used to host Champions League fixtures (Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe escalation of conflict in the region forced Shakhtar to leave their modern marvel of a stadium and instead play their fixtures in western Ukraine, at Arena Lviv. And despite later images suggesting the stadium had been fully repaired, Shakhtar didn't return to the region.\n\nRussia then launched a full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. As such, it is unclear whether the stadium will ever be used again, having been further damaged in recent attacks.\n\nView 4 Images The stadium was shelled in 2014 (Image: Photomig/EPA/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nSince the outbreak of the long and bloody war, Shakhtar has continued to play its fixtures in Lviv, at the national stadium in Kyiv, and even abroad in countries like Poland and Germany, for security reasons.\n\nThe Donbass Arena once represented the future and brought joy to thousands, even hosting a Beyonce concert. But it is now a harrowing reminder of the impact of geopolitical chaos, demonstrating how war can bleed into and tarnish the beautiful game."

With that in mind, here's an overview of the latest injury updates from both camps ahead of the fixture.\n\nLiverpool\n\nSlot has revealed that summer acquisition Florian Wirtz will be absent from the game against the Hammers owing to the back complaint he sustained during the warm-up against Nottingham Forest last week. Speaking in his pre-match press briefing, he stated: \"I don't expect Florian to be available so that's a disappointment, of course.\n\n\"Every time a player is not available it's a disappointment and it's also something I didn't expect after last week, but that's sometimes how things can evolve and unfortunately this time not in a positive way.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!

Young prospect Jayden Danns is also likely to remain unavailable whilst continuing his rehabilitation from an earlier fitness concern.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOn a more positive note for Liverpool, full-back Jeremie Frimpong has been confirmed as potentially available for the West Ham clash.

Forward Pablo Felipe, who arrived at the club in January, appears unlikely to feature.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking in his pre-match press conference, Nuno revealed: \"He (Pablo) didn't join us yet.

Liverpool will face West Ham on Sunday with Redknapp and Lampard having strong ties to the Hammers, with Redknapp managing the club from 1994-2001 and Lampard playing for the Irons from 1995-2001\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe incident occurred when Klopp's Liverpool faced off with Chelsea in July 2020. At the time, the UK was in the firm grip of the Covid-19 pandemic and Premier League games were played in front of thousands of empty seats.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEx-England international Lampard was in charge of the Blues when the two teams met. Klopp had just brought Liverpool their first top-flight title in 30 years.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

After a free-kick was awarded when Mateo Kovacic brought down Sadio Mane just outside the area, Lampard took exception with the Liverpool bench and went on an X-rated tirade against Klopp and his staff.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold then stepped up and scored the free-kick to give Liverpool a 2-0 win with the Reds eventually running out 5-3 winners. Lampard later warned Klopp not to be \"too arrogant\" as the former midfielder also made it clear that he felt a member of Klopp's backroom staff had \"crossed the line\".\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHaving discussed the mini saga with the media at full-time, Lampard was then the subject of criticism from the Liverpool boss for making their war of words a public matter.\n\nLiverpool's summer transfer blunder identified with Arne Slot paying the price READ MORE :\n\n\"Frank was in competitive mood, I respect that,\" Klopp said. \"Say what you want in that situation, pure emotion, he came to win. But what he has to learn is speaking about that after the game when the whistle has gone is not OK. Final whistle, as a real sportsperson... close the book and he didn't do that and that is what I don't like, honestly.\"\n\nHis comments didn't go down well with Lampard's uncle and fellow Premier League icon Redknapp. \"Frank has been around professional football since he was a toddler,\" Redknapp told The Sun.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Lampard told Liverpool not to get \"too arrogant\" after winning the Premier League (Image: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images)\n\n\"He doesn't need advice from anyone, although I've lots of respect for Klopp. Frank is very calm usually, he doesn't tend to get involved in things like this. For him to react like that, it must have been something to really wind him up.\"\n\nSoon after the heated exchange, Lampard expressed his regret over the clash and specifically the explicit language he used.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSky Sports later released a clip which had audio of the incident. During it, Lampard says: \"That’s not a f*****g foul. I’m not asking you, I’m asking him to shut up!\"\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nHe then turns to Klopp and adds: \"Shut up. F*** off you as well. Tell them to show some respect. Sit down.\" The then-Liverpool boss then gestures to his staff to sit down, which he repeated following the goal.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Chelsea legend did go on to make clear what it was that sparked his fury, adding: \"I could have handled it differently but some of the reports were I was upset with the celebrations. Far from it. They can celebrate like every goal.\n\nView 3 Images Lampard insisted he had no lasting issue with Klopp after the final whistle (Image: Phil Noble/Pool via Getty Images)\n\n\"I'd have had a beer with Jurgen Klopp after the game but there were things on the bench, not from Klopp, that I felt crossed a line. I regret the language but we'll move on.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMonths later, Lampard admitted he was \"embarrassed\" about the whole debacle, telling the High Performance Podcast: \"Yeah, I did regret that.\n\n\"And when that broke [audio of the clash] the next day – I clearly felt it as I was doing it – but when it broke the next day and a friend of mine sent it to me in the morning, I was a bit embarrassed by it.\"\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE!

Berta was the man to bring Alvarez to Madrid in 2024.\n\nIn October, the Argentina international said that he was 'very calm' when quizzed on his future. \"People always talk,\" Alavrez told ESPN. \"Last year, there was a lot of talk as well, but the season is just starting and my focus is on getting better every day, doing my best for the club, helping my team-mates and winning here.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAfter scoring 29 goals in his first season with Atletico, he's been less prolific this term.

Gianluca Prestianni is under investigation for alleged racial abuse towards Real Madrid's Vinicius Junior in a Champions League match last week.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhat he said to Vinicius is disputed, with Prestianni vehemently denying using racist language. The Argentinian's mouth was covered when he appeared to say something to Vinicius.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFIFA is understood to be keen to explore ways to tackle the issue, and is understood to have raised the idea of introducing a deterrent to such behaviour at a technical meeting on Friday ahead of the International Football Association Board (IFAB) annual general meeting in Wales on Saturday.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOne insider referred to it as 'Vinicius' Law' and the British associations - who make up the IFAB alongside FIFA - were understood to be receptive to the idea, although as it is so early in discussions the practicalities of enforcing it would need careful consideration.\n\nFOLLOW OUR REAL MADRID FB PAGE! Latest news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nBenfica release new statement after claims Gianluca Prestianni admitted Vinicius Jr racism READ MORE :\n\nWhere Jose Mourinho amazingly watched Real Madrid vs Benfica clash from due to ban READ MORE :\n\nThis is understood to be just the start of the discussion however, and it is not expected any formal proposal to tackle the issue will be brought forward immediately. FIFA is also believed to have raised increasing the penalty for players walking off the pitch from a yellow to a red card in the wake of the chaos at the end of the Africa Cup of Nations final between Senegal and Morocco.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFIFA has been approached for comment. Vinicius was allegedly abused during Real Madrid's win over Benfica in Lisbon on February 17.\n\nThe 25-year-old left the field after reporting a member of the Benfica team - whom the Spanish side later claimed to have been Prestianni - to referee Francois Letexier. The match was paused in line with UEFA regulations, resulting in a stoppage in play lasting 10 minutes, with Vinicius going on to play the full game in Real’s 1-0 win.\n\nBACK THE MIRROR! Ensure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images The match was stopped for 10 minutes after Vinicius Junior's allegation (Image: Miguel Lemos/DeFodi Images/DeFodi via Getty Images)\n\nIt came after the Brazilian forward had given his team the lead with a wonderful individual strike five minutes into the second half. After celebrating in front of the home fans, the 25-year-old became visibly upset about something said to him and immediately informed Letexier.\n\nAfter the game, Vinicius posted in Portuguese on his Instagram story: “Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts in their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe started for Real in Wednesday's return and had the final word as the Spanish giants reached the last 16, with a cool 80th-minute finish securing a 2-1 win on the night and 3-1 aggregate success.\n\nUEFA had imposed a provisional sanction on Prestianni on Monday, ruling him out of the tie, although the winger had travelled to Madrid as part of the Benfica squad. The Portuguese club had appealed against the decision to ban Prestianni, but UEFA dismissed the case on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Up 2lb for that victory, he has obvious claims under Dylan Johnston.\n\nTwinjets scored by 10 lengths when beating off Heltenham over this track and 2m 4f trip in November and can be forgiven a poor run when unseating at Cheltenham in January. He returns from a short break with an excellent chance for trainer Paul Nicholls who has won this race a record nine times.\n\nIssam justified favouritism when landing a Kempton handicap chase last time and shapes as if he could have plenty more left in the tank.\n\nHeltenham, the 2024 winner, is another with each-way claims for Dan Skelton and Charlie Todd.\n\n2.30 Doncaster - King's Threshold and Dartmoor Pirate feature\n\nA splendid renewal of the Virgin Bet Grimthorpe Handicap Chase at Doncaster where King's Threshold and Dartmoor Pirate headline a field of 13.\n\nEmma Lavelle's King's Threshold had options at the Cheltenham Festival next month but has chosen to come here and could be the one to beat under James Bowen. The form of his latest Newbury win is solid, and he must be taken seriously.\n\nDartmoor Pirate seeks a hat-trick after winning at Lingfield before taking the Great Yorkshire Chase at this venue last time and he looks a danger from 5lb higher in the weights. New Order was second in that contest and merits respect off the same mark.\n\nNeil Mulholland has three runners in here with Kelce the pick under Conor O'Farrell. The eight-year-old racked up a third success over fences and the extra couple of furlongs to 3m 2f ought to suit this strong stayer.\n\nStablemates Broomfields Cave and Lord Accord complete the shortlist.\n\n2.35 Lingfield - Red-hot Ten Carat Harry faces Richie's Rocket\n\nLingfield stages a trappy-looking Listed BetMGM Spring Cup Stakes where in-form Ten Carat Harry faces seven rivals.\n\nA perfect six wins from six starts on the all-weather, Jamie Osborne's charge has been progressing through the grades this winter and deserves a crack at this better race. The manner of his latest Newcastle victory was impressive and the step up to seven furlongs should not inconvenience him.\n\nRichie's Rocket, third on debut at Newmarket in October, made a sparkling all-weather debut when clearing away to win by nine lengths over this trip and track the following month. Well-backed on that occasion, he quickened stylishly despite showing signs of greenness and rates one to follow.\n\nOf the others, Hilitany has some useful form from Meydan this year, while Sir Albert and Bella Lyra are worth a mention.\n\nBest of the rest\n\n5.40am Randwick - Group One Verry Elleegant Stakes where Golden Eagle winner Autumn Glow features and Trinity College debuts for Waller. Sir Delius appears too!\n\nMeydan - Super Saturday\n\n2.50 Meydan - Group Three with Symbol Of Honour and Run Boy Run involved.\n\n3.25 Meydan - Group Three with Apollo One declared.\n\n4.00 Meydan - Group Two where Quddwah and Alakazi clash.\n\n4.35 Meydan - Group Two Al Maktoum Classic with Mendelssohn Bay and Heart Of Honor fancied.\n\n5.10 Meydan - Group Two Dubai City Of Gold - Rebel's Romance tops eight runners.\n\n5.55 Meydan - Group Three with Audience representing David O'Meara.\n\n6.30 Meydan - Talk Of New York is expected to be useful for Charlie Appleby.\n\n2.40 Newbury - Rodney bids for a four-timer.\n\n3.15 Newbury - Brave Kingdom and Eldorado Allen headline Veterans' Chase. Mister Coffey, Hang In There and Capodanno also feature.\n\n4.58 Newbury - Joe Tizzard's Fairy Park rates an intriguing debutant.\n\n1.25 Doncaster - Listed mares novices' hurdle with Coolanna and Broomfield Aderra fancied.\n\n1.55 Doncaster - Mighty Bandit and Queens Gamble headline classy handicap field.\n\n3.52 Lingfield - Royal Jet bids for another success.\n\n6.30 Southwell - Unbeaten Chantelle features for Sir Mark Prescott.\n\n7.00 Southwell - Aisling Oscar is back again!\n\n7.30 Southwell - Charlie Appleby saddles two newcomers.

            "content": "Tim Henman feels Emma Raducanu is better off without a coach despite the British No 1 reuniting with Mark Petchey on an informal basis ahead of Indian Wells - live on Sky Sports Tennis.\n\nRaducanu parted company with Francisco Roig in the wake of her second-round defeat at the Australian Open.\n\nShe enjoyed a strong run of form while working with Andy Murray's former coach Petchey early in 2025 in a temporary arrangement, but hired Roig in August as she sought a new permanent fixture.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights of the Transylvania Open final as Raducanu struggled in defeat against Sorana Cirstea\n\nFollowing a six-month spell in which she has endured disappointing results, Roig, who formerly coached Rafael Nadal, became the ninth coach to depart since Raducanu's 2021 US Open win, with the pair gelling well on a personal level but not aligning on style of play.\n\nHer next tournament in Romania saw her reach her first final since her victory in New York in 2021, and since the split from Roig, Raducanu insisted she is happy working only with hitting partner Alexis Canter, a 27-year-old British former player who reached a career-high ranking of 779 last year.\n\nThe 23-year-old, coming off a first-round defeat to Antonia Ruzic at the Dubai Tennis Championships, is set to retain Canter as part of her setup as well as working with Petchey in the lead-up to Indian Wells next week.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Marion Bartoli believes Raducanu will learn more from playing the top players after she exited the US Open\n\nSky Sports analyst Henman thinks British No 1 Raducanu doesn't need a coach and should concentrate on working on her physicality to match the likes of fellow Grand Slam champions Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Elena Rybakina and Coco Gauff.\n\n\"I just wonder whether she's better off without a coach and that's nothing against Petch,\" said the four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist. \"He's someone I've known for a long time and he's a very, very good coach but we know it's not going to be a full-time appointment because Petch has his broadcast commitments.\n\n\"Emma has talked about her identity, her game style and she wants to own it. She's been around long enough on the tour so I wonder whether that might be a good option for her but it's her prerogative.\n\n\"I worked with three coaches in 15 years. I like the consistency and continuity and we know that coaches don't last long working with Emma.\n\n\"An aggressive game style is how you have to play. You have got to be aggressive because if you don't your opponent will be and for me. I want to see her build her physicality: to get stronger, more resilient, to hit the ball harder.\n\n\"And I think if she does that, that'll mean that she has less interruptions and less little setbacks physically. She'll be able to compete at a high level for longer periods, so if I could add one element it would be the physical side.\n\n\"Raducanu does work on her physical side. I think her tennis game is outstanding but when you think of the physicality of Sabalenka, Swiatek, Rybakina, Gauff, she's not in the same league.\n\n\"The physicality is the biggest challenge.\"\n\nPetchey helped inspire the most productive period of Raducanu's season as she reached the quarter-finals at Queen's before running Sabalenka close in the third round of Wimbledon.\n\nEmma Raducanu's NINE coaches\n\nNigel Sears\n\n\n\nBest known for coaching former top five players Amanda Coetzer, Daniela Hantuchova, Anett Kontaveit and Ana Ivanovic, Sears joined her team in April 2021 and oversaw her incredible breakthrough run to the Wimbledon fourth round.\n\n\n\nAndrew Richardson\n\n\n\nGuided Raducanu to her historic Grand Slam title at the US Open as a qualifier. Raducanu opted not to extend his trial contract immediately after the victory.\n\n\n\nTorben Beltz\n\n\n\nAngelique Kerber's former coach lasted only five months. They split in April 2022 with Raducanu transitioning towards a new training model involving LTA coaching support.\n\n\n\nDmitry Tursunov\n\n\n\nRaducanu took on the former pro on a trial basis during the summer of 2022 but Tursunov decided not to continue, later citing red flags in her camp that he felt could not be ignored for a long-term commitment.\n\n\n\nSebastian Sachs\n\n\n\nThe German joined in late 2022 but the partnership was cut short when Raducanu required multiple surgeries, leading to a mutual split.\n\n\n\nNick Cavaday\n\n\n\nThe 14-month stint was her longest professional partnership, helping her return to the top 60 before he stepped down in early 2025 due to personal health issues.\n\n\n\nVlado Platenik\n\n\n\nHired on a trial basis in March 2025, the partnership lasted only 14 days.\n\n\n\nMark Petchey\n\n\n\nAndy Murray's former coach provided crucial tactical knowledge through Wimbledon where she went out to world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, despite an encouraging display.\n\n\n\nFrancisco Roig\n\n\n\nAppointed in August 2025, Rafael Nadal's former mentor offered elite tactical clarity, but after her Australian Open exit in January 2026, Raducanu announced their split.\n\n\n\nRobson: Raducanu has 'same ideas' as Petchey\n\nImage: Petchey coached Raducanu during the grass-court season\n\nFormer Junior Wimbledon champion Laura Robson sees Raducanu's happiness on court as the biggest advantage and argues working with Petchey can only bring out the best in her.\n\nShe said: \"I think we make such a big deal out of the coaching situation and as long as she is feeling happy on the court, as long as she's confident out there then that's half the job done, and that's what coaches try and bring out in you when you do have one.\n\n\"She obviously gets on really well with Petch. They've been on and off for a fair few years now and it's someone she knows. They have the same ideas. They agree on so much that she needs to bring out there, so why not?\n\n\"As long as you've got someone who's taking care of the boring stuff like the logistics of booking practice, finding someone to practice with, racket re-strings - all of that. As long as that's taken care of, then you can just focus on trying to play.\n\n\"They have the same identity of how both of them feel she should be as a player.\"\n\nRaducanu is hoping to hoping to revert to a more aggressive style in order to compete with the top players and Robson says she has shown in the past she is capable of playing against the elite on the WTA Tour.\n\n\"For sure. We've seen how close her matches against Sabalenka have been,\" said former British No 1 Robson.\n\n\"It feels like everyone is adding different elements to their game all the time, so at the moment it feels like she wants to add that aggression back into her game and once you've got that you can start thinking about adding more variety again so you've got more strings to your bow.\n\n\"But you want to have a clear identity as a player before you go out onto any match court - so long as that's defined in your mind then that's half the job done.\"\n\nOverend on Raducanu finding the right balance\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Jonathan Overend believes that if Raducanu can find the right balance with the correct coach, she will be set up for a great year of tennis\n\nSpeaking earlier this month, Sky Sports commentator Jonathan Overend said Raducanu will only be able to find the right balance in her setup once she answers a key question.\n\n\"I think she has spent a lot of her young career re-evaluating,\" he said. \"In one regard, it explains why she has been through so many coaches and why she has been criticised for it.\n\n\"It's typical of Raducanu that she wants to keep re-evaluating and finding out what is best for her on and around a tennis court.\n\n\"That challenge continues, and to some extent it is a struggle, because finding the right balance is so hard, but I think she is slowly getting [it], not in terms of her Grand Slam results but in terms of that re-evaluation process.\n\n\"What is it she really wants for herself on a tennis court and in tournaments?\"\n\nWatch the ATP and WTA Tours, live on Sky Sports or stream with NOW and the Sky Sports app, giving Sky Sports customers access to over 50 per cent more live sport this year at no extra cost.

            "content": "Fernando Mendoza - the potential No 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft - says the opportunity to be mentored by Tom Brady if he is selected by the Las Vegas Raiders would be \"fantastic\".\n\nThe former Indiana Hoosiers quarterback was attending the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis on Friday after a National Championship-winning season in college that has made him the hot favourite to be taken by the Raiders with the top selection.\n\nLas Vegas have one of the more intriguing quarterback situations in the NFL, as seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Brady became a minority owner in 2024.\n\nAlthough Brady is not directly involved in coaching, the Raiders haven't had a young, potential face of the franchise in the past two years for Brady to mentor. That is expected to change if the franchise invest a high NFL Draft pick in a quarterback.\n\nWhile Brady was not present in Indianapolis, 22-year-old Mendoza said they had spoken on the phone briefly, and was asked what he would think of working with the NFL legend.\n\nImage: Tom Brady is a minority owner for the Las Vegas Raiders and would be expected to help develop a young quarterback\n\nHe said: \"Yeah, I mean, who hasn't admired Tom Brady? I mean, more Super Bowl rings than anybody ... anybody!\n\n\"So, that opportunity would be fantastic.\n\n\"Brady, I believe, is the greatest quarterback of all time - by a wide margin - and to be able to have the opportunity to be mentored by him would mean so much.\n\n\"Especially to learn, and I'm all about learning. So from day one, I've got to learn a lot.\n\n\"It's going to be a long journey, and to potentially have a mentor like that, it would be pretty impressive and pretty meaningful.\"\n\nImage: Mendoza was a winner in college but will likely begin his NFL career on one of the worst teams in the league\n\nMendoza revealed that he had a \"great\" meeting with the Raiders, who appointed Super Bowl-winning Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak as their head coach earlier this month as they look to rebuild after a fourth straight losing season.\n\nAlthough he admitted there's no guarantee he will end up in Las Vegas after April's event in Pittsburgh, Mendoza was enthused about his meeting with the team.\n\n\"It was a fantastic interview,\" he said.\n\n\"The coaching staff were in there. We went over some of my previous plays and drew some plays on the board.\n\n\"I thought it was a great meeting, and I know they have the prospective No 1 pick, but anything can happen in the draft. I'm just excited for the opportunity.\n\n\"Whatever team drafts me, I'm just going to give everything I have to them.\""

            "content": "Arsenal’s journey under Mikel Arteta has long been a reference point for Chelsea’s owners. It is part of the club’s shift towards youth and potential after the Roman Abramovich era. Chelsea have built with a long-term view and, seeing how Arteta has reversed Arsenal’s decline since his appointment as manager in December 2019, have been keen to find a young coach capable of becoming a similarly galvanising force at Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt is not an easy task. Chelsea briefly thought they had their rising star when they hired Graham Potter in September 2022, only for his reign to end after seven months. Now there is hope that Liam Rosenior can become Chelsea’s answer to Arteta. Rosenior is young, confident, talented and a little unconventional in the way he presents himself. It is early days but the 41-year-old has made an encouraging start, winning eight of his first 12 games, and has transmitted enough authority to keep jibes about his inexperience at bay so far.\n\nDoes he have it in him to match Arteta though? More pertinently, will he be given the time to succeed? Just over six years on from turning to Arteta after firing Unai Emery, Arsenal stand five points clear at the top of the Premier League before hosting Chelsea on Sunday. They have benefited from a stable environment. Rosenior, by contrast, is the fifth permanent head coach under the ownership of Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly. Chelsea have had nine managers, including interims, during the Arteta era. It is impossible to ignore the upheaval when it comes to working out why Chelsea have not mustered a title challenge since winning the league in 2017.\n\nThey remain a strong cup team, capable of raising their level in one-off games, but the consistency required to keep up with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City in the league has been lacking. Rosenior has already felt it. Chelsea have been at their careless worst in their past two league games, home draws with Burnley and Leeds the consequence of a repeated inability to stay focused and defend a lead in mature fashion.\n\nDropping 19 points from winning positions this season says a lot about the squad’s mentality. Rosenior has to tackle the listlessness. Behind closed doors he should make clear that he did not like Malo Gusto wasting a promising attack with a pointless no-look pass against Burnley. Chelsea cannot afford to be cocky. They have to be honest about where they are short. They have to acknowledge that they have a discipline problem. They have had eight red cards this season and were pegged back by Burnley – whose stoppage-time equaliser arrived when one of Rosenior’s players dozed off at a corner – after losing Wesley Fofana to a needless second yellow card.\n\nView image in fullscreen Liam Rosenior is young and confident, and has transmitted enough authority to keep jibes about his inexperience at bay so far. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThe frustration is that there are times when Chelsea look like a serious team. They have beaten the champions of England, Italy, Spain and France in the past 12 months. They face Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League and it would not be a surprise if they went through. Chelsea are different in the big games. They have a daunting run-in but are not fearful of top opposition. The problem is more that they switch off when expected to win.\n\nRosenior has to lift standards. He has the youngest squad in the Premier League and needs time to instil good habits. Whether Rosenior lasts, though, will partly come down to whether Chelsea are capable of leaving the chaos behind. Can they hold their nerve when results dip? It is one thing to find your Arteta but another to stand by him when the pressure rises and fans are baying for blood.\n\nIt is worth remembering that it has not always been plain sailing for Arteta. The Spaniard was 37 when he replaced Emery and earned his first managerial role. He arrived with Arsenal struggling to move on from how the Arsène Wenger era fizzled out. There was a lot of damage to repair. The squad were a mess and although Arteta ended his first season on a high, winning the FA Cup thanks to surprise victories over City and Chelsea, it was not long before he was in danger of losing his job.\n\nArsenal were 15th and winless in seven league games before beating Frank Lampard’s Chelsea on Boxing Day in 2020. Arteta was in trouble. He needed Arsenal’s trust. Even then it was not until the second half of the 2021-22 season that Arteta’s vision truly became clear. Arsenal have had to fight their way to the top. They have also stuck with Arteta through three consecutive second-placed finishes. They have had to be resolute in their belief that he is the man to win their first title since 2004.\n\nArteta has driven the process. He is the manager, not the head coach, the individual knitting everything together. Arsenal have a sporting director but Arteta is the face of the club. There is no doubt about his power. Arsenal have thrown everything into winning now. They have targeted experienced, established players in an attempt to get over the line. They have filled holes that needed filling. Signing Martín Zubimendi, Noni Madueke, Viktor Gyökeres and Eberechi Eze last summer gave them depth and quality in every position, while exposing a key point of difference with Chelsea’s model of centring recruitment around young talents who will need time to adapt to English football.\n\nIt remains an issue for Chelsea that, for every hit, there is a signing struggling to meet expectations. João Pedro has shone since signing from Brighton last summer but Liam Delap has been disappointing and Alejandro Garnacho is still the winger who blew hot and cold at Manchester United. There has been too much volatility. Erratic performances are not a surprise. Chelsea are still to prove that their project will work. Their bet is that hoovering up some of the best young talent in the world will give them a team to fear. They are convinced that their collaborative structure, with a head coaching working in tandem with five sporting directors, breeds stability.\n\nYet it will take more than handing Rosenior a six-and-a-half-year deal to show that Chelsea understand why Arteta has flourished at Arsenal. There will come a time when the heat rises. Chelsea’s faith in Rosenior will be tested. How will they react?"

            "content": "As Wolves applied the seal to only their second Premier League victory of the season, Rodrigo Gomes doubling their lead over Aston Villa deep into second-half stoppage time, Rob Edwards hared down the touchline, yelling into the stands as his players started a celebratory pile-on a few yards behind him. It was a moment of catharsis for Edwards, who beat his chest and wellied an advertising hoarding, but for Unai Emery it was a different kind of cue.\n\nAs those in old gold savoured a win over near neighbours that takes them to 13 points, ending any fears that they may not eclipse Derby’s record-low tally of 11 in 2007-08, Emery marched straight down the tunnel before the post-match handshakes.\n\nWolves’s other Premier League win came against West Ham at the start of last month and no wonder the supporters savoured every second. “The two games we’ve won in the league this year, both managers have disappeared from the touchline,” Edwards said with a smile. “I think everyone expects just to turn up and win, which is understandable given how this season has gone.”\n\nAt the end of the season, how costly might this untimely slip prove for Villa? Judging by the way Emery fumed, this defeat will hurt for a while yet and, significantly, it could have major implications for their hopes of returning to the Champions League. They are on a poor run of form having taken only one win in their past six matches in all competitions and 12 points from their past nine league games. Emery called for perspective.\n\n“Maybe you can say: ‘We are losing the chance to the win the Premier League,’” Emery said animatedly. “Some supporters maybe were dreaming. Now we are not with the possibility to fight for the Premier League, some can feel frustrated, even myself because I have my dreams. In September I was worried and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. One month ago I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League.”\n\nView image in fullscreen A sodden Unai Emery tries to spur on his Aston Villa team as they struggled against Wolves. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters\n\nVilla were unpicked by a team almost certainly heading for the Championship but, as they did when rousing to a draw against the leaders, Arsenal, Wolves showed they will go down fighting.\n\nJoão Gomes fired in his first goal in a year just after the hour, starting the move himself after nutmegging the Villa substitute Ross Barkley, and then Rodrigo Gomes put the game beyond doubt on the counterattack, after Yerson Mosquera and José Sá combined to deny Amadou Onana. Morgan Rogers’s attempt to recycle a corner ended with Wolves attacking three v two. Rogers had his face in the turf as Rodrigo Gomes swivelled near the penalty spot and buried the ball past Emiliano Martínez.\n\nIt was never going to be an evening for the purists and driving rain did little to enhance this soggy Midlands derby as a spectacle. It was a contest bogged down by misplaced passes, clunky touches and the ball slowing unpredictably on a saturated surface. Ezri Konsa can vouch for that, the Villa centre-back nudging the ball back to Martínez with his big toe, just as Adam Armstrong sought to prey on Douglas Luiz’s loose pass. It was a night for the poncho-clad Wolves supporters in the uncovered Graham Hughes stand in a corner of this stadium. Hugo Bueno looked battle-hardened, the reverse of the Wolves full-back’s old gold shirt caked in mud.\n\nEmery grew increasingly agitated as the game went on. He exploded as Jadon Sancho declined to take a shot first time at the back post and there was a restlessness within the home support too. Edwards gestured for calm as the locals aired their frustration at Jackson Tchatchoua looking inside for the perceived easy pass. Wolves struggled to hold on to the ball and when they did have it surrendered possession cheaply, João Gomes among those guilty. Sá, wearing the captain’s armband, shanked a goal-kick straight out of play to the disbelief of those in the stands.\n\nWolves, certainly not lacking in spirit, defended admirably. Tchatchoua did well to halt Ian Maatsen, one of those thrown on by Emery as Villa chased the game. Toti Gomes halted an advancing Leon Bailey, another second-half substitute. Bueno blocked off all avenues for Cash and turned to celebrate with the home fans. Then, at the final whistle, having doubled their lead, Wolves let loose."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says his Tottenham players are not fit enough and has questioned their desire to put in the hard yards without the ball.\n\nThe interim head coach has a clearer idea of the problems he faces after two weeks – and there are many of them, including low levels of confidence and the capacity of the younger players to handle the pressure of a relegation battle.\n\nTudor knows there are reasons for the physical issues with the squad stretched by an injury crisis amid a punishing schedule. Although Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso are in contention to return for Sunday’s trip to Fulham, Tottenham will be without eight injured players plus the suspended Cristian Romero.\n\nTudor believes there is only one way out of the situation – an on-the-hoof fitness reboot in training, particularly as the club had no midweek fixture last week or this. The Croat surprised the players by working them extremely hard throughout last week and not tapering off before last Sunday’s home game against Arsenal, which they lost 4-1. As Tudor made plain, it is not a time to pander to player sensibilities.\n\n“Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,” Tudor said. “They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and it made the physical condition of the team drop down. So we need to use this period where we don’t play the games to put some petrol in the engine so the engine starts to work better.\n\n“They are fatigued. To do the pressing high you need to be fit. But [it is] all of them because if someone is not in the right shape there is a problem because someone is coming late [to the press].\n\n“The second thing is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back. If you run up and don’t run back it’s a problem. For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it’s a big question what we can do and what we cannot do.”\n\nTudor was asked about his full-throttle approach from the first training session. “Yes, that’s the only way – running,” he said. “The pitch is 100 yards, it’s long. So you need to run.\n\n“Maybe you have habits to, I don’t know … work a bit less. I put some runs without the ball [into the sessions]. Never players like runs without the ball so we put some runs without balls. But it’s a moment when there is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn’t like. And the best thing is that they understand this. They gave me their availability to do these things.”\n\nTudor is under no illusions about the size of the challenge. It was put to him that the striker, Randal Kolo Muani, had played well against Arsenal. “That’s good, one good thing,” he replied.\n\nWhat Tudor wants to see at Fulham and beyond is players such as Kolo Muani stepping up, accepting the responsibility. “Some players are still young,” he said. “They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to resolve the problems.\n\nView image in fullscreen Randal Kolo Muani scores against Arsenal – Igor Tudor wants him to keep raising his game for Spurs. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\n“If you have too many of these players because of the amount of injuries, who are playing together in the squad, it does create some problems. But it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man. To say: ‘Come on, I’m the guy, give me the ball, I will score.’ Instead of just: ‘What can I do? I’m just here, you know.’\n\n“It’s always how you see the situation. It’s not: ‘I’m just here. We had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play.’ How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy and positive, there is opportunity.”\n\nTudor has not dwelt for long on the derby with Arsenal. “No, no, forget that,” he said. It was never likely to be a game that would define the club’s survival hopes. The same is not true of Fulham – or the home fixture against Crystal Palace next Thursday.\n\n“After the first game, I said if you play against the best team in the world at this moment, it’s not a realistic game to show [whether] we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,” Tudor said. “That’s the truth. They show they can be in some parts of the game. But for long periods we had problems, in defence especially. It’s not easy against them. Let’s see in the next games.”"

            "content": "1. Title run-in all about ‘little details’ Pep Guardiola has told his Manchester City players their pursuit of honours in the final three months of the season will depend on their “brains and minds”. City, who remain in contention for four trophies, meet title rivals Arsenal in the Carabao Cup final and Newcastle in the fifth-round of the FA Cup next month, as well as Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League. In the Premier League, they are five points behind Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal with a game in hand. City have had no midweek games for two weeks and – after the visit to Leeds on Saturday – Guardiola has given his players Sunday to Tuesday off as he believes the challenge in the defining part of the campaign is more mental than technical. Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more “There are still things that we should train and practise more, but I prioritised rest,” Guardiola said. “With three months left, there are many things that the team have improved in and still some things that the team has to improve, but now it is the little details. “Now it is how it is in your brains and your minds that will make the difference. Maybe for the new players it is new, but we have talked a lot in many meetings for many years that, when you arrive in the last three months, competing in all competitions, everything is here [points to his head].” Jamie Jackson\n\nEddie Howe has urged Anthony Gordon not to be distracted by reports linking him with a summer move to Arsenal amid speculation that the 25-year-old winger will be a target for the title-chasing Gunners. Howe, who is still dealing with the fallout from Alexander Isak’s defection to Liverpool last summer, could do without a repeat of that saga, but the Newcastle manager admits there is little he can do to prevent it. Newcastle face Gordon’s former cub Everton in the Premier League on Saturday and Howe said: “I’m not sure there’s a lot I can do about that. I’ve not seen the story, so it’s news to me. But we’re mid-season, we’re in the middle of some of the biggest games of his career and who knows what’s going to happen internationally with him in the summer as well? “He’s got no time to look left or right, he’s got to be fully focused on straight ahead and the next game and trying to be as good as he can be.” View image in fullscreen Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon is reported to be on Arsenal’s wishlist. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA Gordon, who earlier this month dismissed rumours he was on the way out of the club where he signed a new contract in October 2024, will hope to continue his good run of form to secure a place in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for this summer’s World Cup finals and Howe is hopeful he will not be unsettled by talk over his future. “It comes with the territory of being a top player and playing at this level, that there’s going to be speculation,” said Howe. “You’ve just got to put it out of your brain and you’ve got to focus on the football because as we know with our schedule, there’s so many games, there’s no time for distractions. We have to be fully focused on each match.” PA Media\n\n3. Moyes blames referees for corner ‘dark arts’ David Moyes has claimed corner-kick routines are turning into wrestling contests because referees have ignored “the dark arts” for too long. Moyes’s Everton team were criticised for crowding the Manchester United goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, at several corners during their 1-0 defeat at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Monday. Ahead of Saturday’s game at Newcastle, the Everton manager insisted that went against his gameplan but he, and other managers, would seek any advantage that the laws of the game offer. However, he also believes referees should take a harder line to try to eradicate jostling at set-pieces. “Truthfully, it wasn’t the plan for our corner kicks to end up like that. But I think there’s a bigger issue with it,” Moyes said. “It has been allowed to let go, whether it be blocking of goalkeepers or blocking of defenders, and you get the feeling now that referees really don’t want to get involved in any of it. It is nearly wrestling to an extent, which it shouldn’t be. It should never have got to this situation, but I think it’s been really poor that they’ve not tried to deal with it well enough and stop it. “You are now allowed lots of blocking, for example. In my day, if you blocked someone it would have been a free-kick. But blocking has become a big part of it. Let’s be fair, the best at it – but with style – would be Arsenal: good delivery, good style, but ultimately there’s a lot of dark arts in it such as blocking the goalkeeper from the back or the front, blocking defenders and making it difficult for them to be your key headers of the ball. “It is a big thing in football, but I do think the level of refereeing has let that part of the game drop. And managers, if we see somebody else doing it and not getting punished for it, then we are all on it.” View image in fullscreen More wrestling match than football as Manchester United and Everton players indulge in some dark arts from a corner. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images Ironically, Moyes felt Everton’s approach in the closing stages against United worked against his team. He wanted more variety from Everton’s corners but claimed: “It was very difficult to get the message on.” Moyes admitted: “The plan was not to deliver the corners in the fashion we did the other night. They shouldn’t have been delivered as close to the goalkeeper. They should have been delivered into different areas at different times according to what we had worked on. It became a bit of a wrestling match and I didn’t think it showed enough quality or enough thought.” Andy Hunter\n\n4. Glasner wary of United’s Carrick bounce Oliver Glasner credits Michael Carrick for imbuing Manchester United with a “great spirit” and “clear structure” since his appointment last month. No team has picked up more Premier League points in 2026 than United, with Carrick winning five of his six games in charge since replacing Ruben Amorim. Palace have been a thorn in United’s side in recent years, winning three of their five last encounters, but Glasner expects Carrick’s side to be in fine form on Sunday when the Eagles head to Old Trafford. View image in fullscreen The Crystal Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, steered his team into the last 16 of the Uefa Conference league on Thursday. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA “Of course, when Man United plays at home against Crystal Palace, everybody there is expecting now a win,” said Glasner. “They are a very good team now. They gave a very good balance between, it’s a very experienced team, with really, very experienced Premier League players, and very young players with huge talent. “It’s a good mix they have now, but I think the most important thing for them is they are consistently playing with their team and have a clear structure in the way they are playing. This is what I could see against Everton. They have a great spirit right now. It was really impressive seeing Matheus Cunha celebrating winning a duel in their own box. This, I think, is what Michael Carrick brought into this team.” PA Media"

            "content": "Paris Saint-German v Chelsea\n\nThe Club World Cup final victory over Paris Saint-Germain last summer was probably Enzo Maresca’s finest hour as Chelsea manager. He devised a gameplan, pinging balls over Nuno Mendes for Cole Palmer to chase, backed up by Malo Gusto, that tore the European champions apart in the first half. Liam Rosenior may try to exploit the same vulnerability, but this is a Chelsea that look weary, their exertions in the US perhaps having left them fatigued.\n\nPSG’s recent form has been indifferent, as proved by the fact they were forced into the playoff round by a defeat by Sporting and a draw against Newcastle in their final two league-phase games, before limping to a 5-4 aggregate win over Monaco. But then they looked unimpressive until this stage last season as well.\n\nVerdict Narrow PSG win.\n\nGalatasaray v Liverpool\n\nLiverpool have won only one of five previous meetings with Galatasaray, their league-phase defeat in Istanbul in September part of their miserable autumn. But four of those games were more than 20 years ago and Liverpool, while still nowhere near the level of last season, are a more solid team now than they were five months ago, while Florian Wirtz had begun to find his feet before his injury.\n\nGalatasaray showed both sides of their character against Juventus in the playoff round. They were exceptional in the second half of the first leg at home and Victor Osimhen may have a physical edge over the heart of Liverpool’s defence. But in the second leg, even against 10 men, they wobbled badly, losing discipline and self-belief.\n\nVerdict Comfortable Liverpool win.\n\nReal Madrid v Manchester City\n\nThe players change, the managers change, the format changes, and somehow Manchester City always end up playing Real Madrid. The sides had never met in a competitive game until 2012; these two legs will bring their meetings since to 17, including in the league phase in December, when City withstood early pressure to win 2-1 at the Bernabéu.\n\nThis will be the fifth straight season in which City and Madrid have met in the knockouts, with Madrid having prevailed on three occasions. Although City are beginning to click into form, having won seven of their last eight in all competitions, they are not the all-conquering side of old, but Madrid, having sacked Xabi Alonso, are also flawed, a gaggle of great individuals having not quite coalesced into a coherent whole.\n\nVerdict Narrow City win.\n\nAtalanta v Bayern Munich\n\nBayern Munich are perhaps the side most likely to prevent a Premier League success. They have lost just once all season in the Bundesliga and are averaging more than 3.5 goals per game in a system that gets the best out of Harry Kane. He has scored 43 goals in all competitions this season and his habit of dropping deep is complemented by Michael Olise, Serge Gnabry and Luis Díaz running beyond him.\n\nBayern finished the league phase second behind Arsenal, their only dropped points coming at the Emirates Stadium, where they were outclassed and lost 3-1. Atalanta’s comeback to overhaul a 2-0 first-leg deficit against Borussia Dortmund in the playoff round was stirring but they are not the side they were when they won the Europa League in 2024 and lie seventh in Serie A.\n\nVerdict Comfortable Bayern win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Harry Kane has scored 43 goals in all competitions for Bayern Munich this season and is key to their hopes of a first Champions League title since 2020. Photograph: Maryam Majd/Reuters\n\nNewcastle v Barcelona\n\nFor Newcastle fans, any mention of Barcelona will always conjure images of Faustino Asprilla’s hat-trick in their 3-2 win in the Champions League in 1997. They’ve lost all four meetings since, though, including in the league phase in September. That 2-1 defeat at St James’ Park, though, should give Newcastle hope: they were far from outclassed and showed a clear physical edge.\n\nA combination of set plays and pace in behind Barcelona’s remarkably high line could be a path to the quarter-final. That high line places huge stress on Barça’s press; any slip-up and Hansi Flick’s side are wide open, which in the end was what cost them in last season’s semi-final. They are top of La Liga, though, and only Arsenal scored more goals in the league phase.\n\nVerdict Narrow Barcelona win.\n\nAtlético Madrid v Tottenham\n\nTottenham have met Atlético Madrid only once, but it was one of the most famous nights in the history of the club as Bill Nicholson’s side romped to a 5-1 win in the 1963 Cup Winners’ Cup final in Rotterdam, making them the first British club to lift a European trophy. For Spurs this season, the priority has to be avoiding relegation, and it remains to be seen what impact Igor Tudor will have.\n\nUnder Thomas Frank, Europe brought a sense of relief. Only Arsenal let in fewer goals, and five of the seven they did concede came in their only defeat, at PSG. Atlético have had a mixed season and lie a frustrating fourth in La Liga. They lost to Liverpool and Arsenal in the league phase.\n\nVerdict Narrow Atlético win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Xavi Simons celebrates scoring for Tottenham in the Champions League. The tournament has offered much-needed respite to the beleaguered London club. Photograph: John Walton/PA\n\nBodø/Glimt v Sporting\n\nHaving been one of only two non-English sides, along with Juventus, not to have played a Premier League side in the league phase, Sporting’s luck held as they were drawn against by far the least-fancied side in the last 16.\n\nBodø/Glimt didn’t win a game in the league phase before Christmas but then beat Manchester City and Atlético to qualify for the playoff round, where they were highly impressive in beating Inter over two legs, despite having to play a very different style of football to the possession-heavy approach they take domestically. Momentum and their artificial pitch north of the Arctic Circle give them a chance.\n\nVerdict Narrow Sporting win.\n\nBayer Leverkusen v Arsenal\n\nArsenal won every game in the league phase. They scored the most goals and they conceded the fewest. Last season, Liverpool gained no advantage from finishing top, but Arsenal have. It’s not just that they face Leverkusen, sixth in the Bundesliga, in the last 16, it’s that if they win they will face Bodø/Glimt or Sporting in the quarter-final.\n\nThe clubs have met only once, in 2002, when Arsenal drew 1-1 away and won 4-1 at home in the second group stage, and there’s every chance of something similar here. Although Leverkusen did beat Manchester City at the Etihad in the league phase, that was one of only three victories, and in their only other game against Premier League opposition they needed a late equaliser to force a home draw with Newcastle.\n\nVerdict Comfortable Arsenal win."

            "content": "Premier League clubs are unhappy with Uefa’s decision to reveal details of their financial results before some have been published and without warning.\n\nChelsea’s record pre-tax loss of £355m last season formed a key part of Uefa’s European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report, which was presented by its executive director, Andrea Traverso, at the Financial Times’s Business of Football Summit on Thursday, with the losses incurred by Tottenham and Aston Villa also featuring prominently.\n\nThe issue is understood to have been discussed by Premier League representatives at Friday’s Champions League draw in Nyon, where there was agreement that Uefa had failed to keep them informed.\n\nNone of the clubs were briefed about Uefa’s plans, leaving Chelsea in particular frustrated at being given no time to prepare for questions on their results. The club are not planning to publish their 2024-25 accounts until the end of March.\n\nChelsea, while not contesting the £355m loss, which is based on information they provided to Uefa, insist the headline figure does not reflect the economic reality.\n\nClub sources have disclosed that the record loss reflects non-cash accounting adjustments required by Uefa’s financial sustainability regulations, specifically one-off transactions related to player contract and asset write-offs, and that they are profitable on an operational basis.\n\nChelsea were fined £27m by Uefa last summer for breaching its spending restrictions and ordered to submit to a business plan, but are confident of avoiding another sanction. As part of that settlement agreement Chelsea were permitted to continue running at a substantial loss, as long as it remained in line with “the projected deficit submitted in the business plan”."

            "content": "Being teetotal, always asking questions and taking up yoga in his early 30s after a recommendation from Gareth Barry have played their part. But if one thing inspired James Milner to break the Premier League’s appearance mark then it is a trait honed during his formative years in Yorkshire: sheer bloody-mindedness.\n\n“Some things don’t change,” Milner says with a chuckle when asked whether his desire to prove people wrong was as strong as ever after his 40th birthday last month. “There’s people who are always going to doubt you but that’s always something that’s been at my forefront: to prove them wrong.”\n\nMilner credits his father for instilling the fighting spirit that has carried him through a remarkable 24 seasons in English football’s top flight. He started as a 16-year-old with Leeds under the watchful eye of Terry Venables, and has had spells at Newcastle, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Liverpool and now Brighton.\n\n“He knew what I was like and he used to say: ‘You don’t work hard enough, you’re not going to make it,’” he says of his father. “He’d never say it in a horrible way or anything like that. But he’d be like: ‘You got no chance of scoring the goal from there.’ And then [I would] take free-kicks and two shots later it’s in the top corner. He knew how to get the best of me.”\n\nThe same desire provided motivation after it seemed Milner’s career was finished in 2024 when he was unable to walk following knee surgery. He spent nine months on the sidelines before returning at the end of last season.\n\n“I think most people – the surgeon, the physio, people who knew what I had, probably every single person – thought I was finished; at my age being a footballer and what I had,” he says. “So it was probably that same thing that meant I’m still playing now: not to finish your career in a way that wasn’t really in your control. That was the drive really. I wanted to try to prove that I could get back from that because I don’t think many people could.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner salutes the fans after the final whistle in Leeds’ victory over Chelsea in December 2002, a month after his Premier League debut as a 16-year-old. Photograph: Gareth Copley/PA\n\nIt has been particularly satisfying for Milner that, having come off the bench more than 200 times in the Premier League, he started on his 654th appearance to break his former Villa teammate Barry’s record when Brighton overcame Brentford last week. “My body doesn’t agree to sitting still, so that’s why I don’t like being on the bench so much,” he says.\n\nHe relishes his role as the elder statesman of the Brighton squad and reveals that the teenage striker Charalampos Kostoulas has been joining him for yoga sessions. “I probably started maybe eight or nine years ago now, which I think Gareth put me on to actually,” he says. “We’re passing it down, so I’ve passed it on to Babis [Kostoulas] at this moment. He’s only 18, so he’s starting young.”\n\nMilner, whose rippling muscles bulge as he holds court at Brighton’s training ground in Lancing, recognises he has been fortunate that his career coincided with the rapid growth of sports science. He uses strengthening techniques created by the celebrated German athletics coach Frans Bosch to counteract injuries that have included a fractured ankle at Newcastle and 12 hamstring problems, meticulously tracks his sleep patterns and takes magnesium to boost a natural shortfall in his body. Milner believes the decision to never drink alcohol, made during his schooldays in Horsforth, outside Leeds, is another of the secrets to his longevity.\n\n“I’ve never had a problem with people drinking at all – I think it’s healthy,” he says. “Like if that’s the right time to do it and if that’s your thing to get away from football and go have a blast, then I’ve no problems with it all. But it’s just a decision I made that if it would help me, I wouldn’t do it.\n\n“When I first started playing you had maybe one or two physios, maybe a part-time masseur, one fitness coach. Now you’ve got five or six fitness coaches, you’ve got seven or eight in the medical team. So that’s been to my advantage that I’ve managed to learn from that to ask questions early.\n\n“I always ask questions: ‘Why are we doing this?’ Or: ‘Explain it to me so I understand and then I decide if it is the right thing to do. I’m not just going to do it because you say. Give me the information why. Give me the science behind it.’ It was interesting, a few of the messages I had over the weekend were: ‘You were a nightmare to work with,’ or ‘challenging to work with’. But I take that as a compliment that I push them to be better and ask questions and challenge them. The best people always come out and give you the exact reason why you’re doing it.”\n\nThings have changed from his youth, when Milner recalls “teacups flying and walls being punched” at half-time by irate managers. “You don’t see much of that now,” he says. “I just feel fortunate. I played through two eras; one when I was emerging and now another.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner, with then teammate Jordan Henderson, holds the FA Cup after Liverpool’s win in 2022. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nMilner was presented this week with three Guinness world records: one for the appearances, another for most consecutive Premier League seasons (23) and the third for the longest gap between his first and last Premier League goals (22 years and 248 days). The next milestone on the horizon is surpassing Teddy Sheringham’s record as the Premier League’s oldest outfield player at 40 years 272 days, though Milner has never been inspired by chasing records.\n\nHe is yet to open discussions with Brighton about extending his stay beyond this season – a prospect recently welcomed by his 33-year‑old head coach, Fabian Hürzeler – but is keen to stay and he denies fearing what retirement may bring.\n\n“When we have some days off I look forward to that: go and play golf, spend time with the family. So I feel whenever I finish, I’ll probably have a break and a rest because I’ve been so 100% for so long.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner with his three Guinness World Records certificates. Photograph: Paul Hazlewood\n\nHaving worked under Venables, Sir Bobby Robson, Roberto Mancini, Jürgen Klopp and many other of the game’s finest managers, Milner is well placed to judge what makes a good one. He rates his two seasons as a central midfielder at Martin O’Neill’s Villa as his best from an individual perspective, and has especially fond memories of winning City’s and Liverpool’s first league titles for a generation. There are doubts about his prospects of making the transition to the dugout when he hangs up his boots.\n\n“It’s such a hard gig, innit? You see managers getting a new contract and getting sacked in two months. People don’t get the time they deserve now. But the competitive guy in you thinks: ‘Yeah, I wouldn’t mind giving that a go.’\n\n“I’ve got a great array of different managers from different countries and different personalities to lean back on, so in one way I think it’d be a big shame to lose all that knowledge and experience I’ve built up, to not be able to use that.”"

            "content": "A European occasion that appeared ominous for Celtic instead provided evidence that it is never wise to write off Martin O’Neill. His side exited the Europa League in Stuttgart but the scale of spirit and togetherness visible during their 1-0, playoff second-leg victory emphasised that tales of their demise may be overstated.\n\nCeltic’s key attribute during a critical week, which begins at Ibrox on Sunday, is course and distance specialism. The shortcomings within, and patched-up nature of, O’Neill’s squad are blindingly obvious. This is, however, a club that has become accustomed to dominating Scottish football over more than a decade. Much earlier, O’Neill had demonstrated he could emerge successful from title scraps. Contrary to giddy analysis, there is nothing miraculous or remarkable about O’Neill’s work during his second short-term stint of the season. It is, though, immediately striking how a 73-year-old can achieve such buy-in from players. Faith in O’Neill within Celtic is absolute.\n\nThis Celtic season, typified by managerial upheaval and protesting supporters, retains a pulse. Stuttgart felt significant because Celtic, in makeshift form, displayed character. The easier option would have been to limp out of the Europa League. Instead, there was an unwillingness to concede an equaliser that reflects positively on O’Neill and his squad.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill (left) is in his second interim stint of the season at Celtic and has galvanised the players after a rocky period. Photograph: DPA/PA\n\nOn Sunday they face a Rangers team who are under considerable pressure to prove they will not deliver another campaign typified by false dawns. Rangers’ home form is strong but Danny Röhl’s team are yet to remove the sense of a soft underbelly, demonstrated by draws at Hibernian, Motherwell and Livingston. The most recent of those, last Sunday, was a horrendous result; Livingston had not won in 25 league matches. The stakes are huge for Rangers, who should be embarrassed if a net spend of about £30m is not sufficient to prise the title from Celtic – at one point managed by Wilfried Nancy – and a Hearts side assembled for buttons in comparison. Celtic’s seven Premiership losses to date match their combined tally from the previous two seasons.\n\nA Rangers win would place Celtic in tricky territory, five points behind their oldest foes. Celtic’s game in hand will be played in Aberdeen on Wednesday, before a return to Ibrox on Scottish Cup business. Hearts hope to extend their lead at the top to seven points on Saturday when Aberdeen visit Edinburgh. An Old Firm draw would suit Hearts perfectly.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rangers’ Danny Röhl speaks to the media on Friday – his side are four points behind Hearts and two above Celtic. Photograph: Luke Nickerson/Rangers FC/Shutterstock\n\nStuttgart gave O’Neill plenty food for thought. Luke McCowan’s terrific performance in midfield should afford him a start at Ibrox. O’Neill’s public backing of Kasper Schmeichel suggests he will restore the veteran goalkeeper despite almost weekly errors. Schmeichel’s deputy, Viljami Sinisalo, repelled Stuttgart. Auston Trusty’s suspension leaves Celtic weak in central defence. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was not in Celtic’s European squad, was surely signed to play in fixtures such as the derby.\n\nO’Neill is aware of a bigger picture, despite that hardly being his concern given he is due to leave in the summer. “European football is what big clubs in Scotland should be aiming for,” he said. “Not for the coefficient points to be dropping out of sight. It’s ridiculous. This is what it’s all about.”\n\nHis regular reference to the country’s coefficient, which is indeed dipping to a worrying level, is intriguing. There is a theory Celtic’s reluctance to spend heavily on players is linked at least in part to knowledge that their potential lack of access to European revenue in upcoming years could swallow up cash reserves. In a worst-case but feasible situation, Celtic could be staring at Conference League football. This does not, however, explain the horrendous lack of preparation for this season’s Champions League playoff tie. Sensible investment would have been sufficient to topple Kairat Almaty, who instead left Celtic with red faces.\n\nThe shadow boxing has started. McCowan has asserted no team in the league can touch Celtic when at their best. In truth, it would be more of a story had McCowan stipulated Celtic are also-rans. Röhl cast aspersions on Celtic’s approach in Stuttgart; this was amusing, given Rangers finished 32nd out of 36 in the Europa League table.\n\nAll Old Firm jousts are fascinating. This one carries more meaning than most. Events in Germany suggested Celtic are formed of the kind of substance that Rangers must be wary of."

This was a large SUV type vehicle and was inevitably going to cause serious injury.\n\n“Had the car passed over someone’s head that person would have almost inevitably been killed.\n\n“The reality is that having lost your temper you were intent on causing mayhem and injury to those on the road.”\n\n\n\nProsecutor Daniel Oscroft said the car “reversed and circled back and round and drove at pedestrians knocking people over”.\n\nMr Calistus heard the “cracking” of his bones as the Mercedes rolled over him and later said he thought he was going to die.\n\nHe spent three weeks in hospital undergoing major surgery.\n\n\n\nIn a victim statement, the DJ said: “I was the victim of a serious incident which changed my life.\n\n“I am still undergoing treatment. I am left in constant pain, I have reduced mobility, have visible scars and psychological trauma.\n\n“It was not just my job it was my dream my purpose.”\n\nAfter the carnage, Suffi tried to dispose of the Mercedes and fled to Dubai before being brought to justice.\n\nHe was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent after a trial in December, having already admitted dangerous driving.\n\n\n\nSuffi, of Aston, Birmingham, was jailed for 11 years and six months and banned from driving for 10 years and seven months.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThree pals — Daanyal Hussain, 21, of Yardley; Mustafa Gohari, 21, of Acocks Green; and Armaan Abid, 23, of Handsworth — had earlier admitted affray.\n\nThey were each handed 11-month jail sentences, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to complete 180 hours of unpaid work."

            "content": "DONALD Trump today teased a “friendly takeover” of Cuba, suggesting that Washington’s long-time nemesis is on the brink of collapse.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the White House lawn, the president revealed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is locked in “very high level” talks with Cuba’s top brass.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s comments come after Cuban border guards killed four US-based exiles as they charged towards the coast on a speedboat.\n\n“The government is talking with us,” he said.\n\n“They have no money. They have no anything right now.\n\n\n\n“We could very well end up having a friendly takeover.”\n\nTrump did not elaborate on his comments, but he has repeatedly mocked the communist state’s rapidly deteriorating financial position.\n\nCuba has been on the president’s mind since the US military’s daring capture of Venezuelan tyrant Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe ousting of one of Havana’s closest allies delivered a bitter blow to the island’s economy.\n\n\n\nTrump even suggested that initiating military action against Cuba might not be necessary as the absence of Venezuelan oil shipments had already brought the country to its knees.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of years dealing with Cuba,” he told reporters today.\n\n“I’ve been hearing about Cuba since I was a little boy. But they’re in big trouble.”\n\nTrump also alluded to the Cuban exile community living in the US, saying: “There could be something coming that I think [is] very positive for the people that were expelled, or worse.”\n\nThe US has maintained a strict trade embargo on Cuba since 1962, the year after a failed, CIA-sponsored Bay of Pigs invasion left the White House with egg on its face.\n\n\n\nHavana confirmed it was speaking to US officials following the shooting of the American boat carrying Cuban exiles.\n\nCuban authorities accused its ten occupants of plotting a terrorist attack, saying that they found a sizeable stash of guns and Molotov cocktails on board.\n\nRubio has vowed the US will “find out exactly what happened” and “respond accordingly.”\n\n\n\n“We’re not gonna base our conclusions on what they told us,” he said.\n\nIn January, Trump signed an executive order punishing countries that supplied oil to Cuba with tariffs.\n\nThe move has sent an already reeling economy into a tailspin and deepened an energy crisis that has already caused mass blackouts across the country.\n\nCarlos Fernndez de Cosso, Cuba’s deputy foreign minister, said today that the US’ fuel embargo remains in full force.\n\n“Nothing announced in recent days changes that reality,” he wrote on X.\n\n\n\n“The possibilities of conditional sales to the private sector already existed and do not alleviate the impact on the population.”\n\nMeanwhile, over 40 US civil society organisations sent a letter to Congress today warning that cutting oil shipments to the Caribbean island would spark a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThey implored Senators and Representatives to press the Trump administration into rowing back on its aggressive policy towards the country.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIt reads: “Policies that deliberately impose hunger and mass hardship on millions of civilians constitute a form of collective punishment, and as such are a grave violation of international humanitarian law.”\n\nSignees included the Alliance of Baptists, ActionAid USA and the Presbyterian Church."

            "content": "Six reasons you may cancel your £174.50 TV Licence payments\n\nWhile TV Licences currently cost £174.50 per year, this will increase to £180 from April 2026\n\nView 3 Images The TV Licence fee is typically mandatory for people who watch live TV or BBC iPlayer content (Image: Halfpoint Images via Getty Images)\n\nBuying a TV Licence is typically a legal obligation for anyone watching live television or BBC iPlayer, with the fee currently costing £174.50. However, there are six specific situations in which you can cancel it entirely and avoid future payments.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMost evidently, this covers people who don't watch or record live television on any channel or device, along with those who have stopped viewing programmes on BBC iPlayer. Anyone moving to a property already covered by a TV Licence may also want to end their payments.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFurthermore, official TV Licensing guidance identifies several other scenarios that could require cancellation. The six situations listed on its website include:\n\n‌\n\n\n\nYou don’t watch or record live TV on any channel or device, and you don’t download or watch BBC programmes on BBC iPlayer any more You are moving to an address that already has a TV Licence You are moving into a care home You are moving abroad The licence holder has died You have two licences for the same address\n\nView 3 Images There are six specific situations in which you can cancel a TV Licence entirely (Image: Alrphoto via Getty Images)\n\nThe site further advises: \"You may be able to get a refund on your TV Licence if you are not going to need it again before it runs out, and there is at least one whole month left on it. If you pay for your licence with a TV Licensing payment card (cash plan), call 0300 555 0286. If you pay for your licence by Direct Debit, call 0300 790 0368.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt's important to note that some Brits may also qualify for a free or discounted TV Licence, provided they meet the criteria set by the UK Government. This includes people living in residential or sheltered accommodation who might be eligible for a £7.50 licence if they meet either one of two conditions.\n\nAccording to the UK Government, this includes:\n\nBeing retired and over 60\n\nHaving a disability\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"You can get a TV Licence for £7.50 if you live in an eligible residential care home, supported housing or sheltered accommodation,\" official GOV.UK advice explains. \"Your housing manager can check if you can get it and will apply for you.\"\n\nMoreover, people aged 75 or over who claim Pension Credit might be entitled to a free TV Licence. The same arrangement exists if you share a home with a partner who claims Pension Credit, as the licence covers everyone at a particular address.\n\nPension Credit is separate from the State Pension. It refers to a means-tested benefit for people past State Pension age on a low income, topping up weekly earnings to £227.10 for single people or £346.60 for couples.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Some people are also eligible for free or discounted TV Licences (Image: alvaro gonzalez via Getty Images)\n\nThose claiming Pension Credit can apply for a free TV Licence upon turning 74, although they must keep paying until the end of the month before their 75th birthday. After this point, they become entitled to the free licence.\n\nLastly, anyone registered as blind or residing with someone who is can secure a 50% discount on their TV Licence. This brings down the price of a colour licence to £87.25.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOfficial Government guidance explains: \"The licence must be in the blind person’s name - if it’s not, you can make a new application to transfer it into their name. You’ll need to provide your existing TV Licence number when you apply.\"\n\nStandard-coloured TV Licences usually cost £174.50 per year, while black-and-white licences cost £58.50 per year. However, from April 1, 2026, the annual cost of a TV licence will rise to £180.\n\nThe increase follows the methodology of calculating the licence fee in line with the consumer price index (CPI) until the end of the BBC Charter Period. This means the cost of an annual colour TV licence will rise by £5.50, or the equivalent of an extra 46p a month.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFor more information, head to GOV.UK or the official TV Licensing website.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

According to renowned royal author Andrew Lownie, who spoke to one of the Queen Mother 's former equerries, Colin Burgess, for his book Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, the ex-royal's scathing catchphrase was \"do it!\"\n\nView 2 Images Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor reportedly 'upset' everyone he came across (Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAnd now an interview with a former member of the former duke's security team has resurfaced with more startling insight into his behaviour behind closed doos.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking to 60 Minutes Australia, the ex protection officer said although the official call sign for Andrew was \"Purple 41\", they had a more crude name for him amongst themselves.\n\nReluctant to say the name, the security guard told the host: \"He did have a nickname, but it's a bit rude to tell you. You wouldn't be able to air it.\" The staffer then went on to claim: \"Andrew was known as the c***. Plain and simple, because unfortunately, he upset everyone he came across.\n\n\"He was the most unpopular member of the royal family while I was there. He was just rude and arrogant, and his sense of self-entitlement was breathtaking.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEven after King Charles stripped him of his titles, it's claimed that the ex-duke still demanded royal treatment from staff, enjoying full cooked breakfast prepped by a personal chef and ordering weekly crates of champagne and fine wines. Royal sources - from experts to former employees - have dubbed the disgraced royal \"entitled\" in various reports.\n\nLownie further claimed that Andrew didn't have the same grace as his mother when it came to speaking to staff, with one former equerry saying: \"He would say things such as 'I want this done and I want it done now,' or 'Have that done by such and such a time.' I remember him always saying 'Do it!' which was his catchphrase of sorts.\"\n\nThis was in stark contrast to how the equerry was treated by the Queen Mother or King Charles, who saw staff as \"human beings\", he said. Elsewhere in Lownie's book, he claims that Andrew insisted that the maids in his home climb four floors of stairs just to open his curtains for him in the morning - while he lay right beside them.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAndrew also once allegedly banished a staffer because he \"couldn't bear\" to look at a mole in his face, and also arranged to remove a member of his staff because he was wearing a nylon tie, according to royal writer Tom Quinn."

It additionally contained two cafés, two restaurants, and a \"Leisureland\" amenity featuring an entertainment centre and go-karts.\n\nHowever, the transformation of the retail landscape, with increasing numbers turning to online shopping, combined with the launch of the neighbouring Livingston Designer Outlet in 2000, led to visitor numbers at Five Sisters quickly dwindling.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images The site has stood empty for 20 years (Image: YouTube/BeardedReality)\n\nWithin twelve months of the competing outlet launching, the majority of stores at Five Sisters had shut their doors, whilst the handful that persisted offered final stock clearances before departing. By 2004, Freeport Leisure determined it was time to shutter the centre permanently, ending the entire venture.\n\nFreeport Chairman Sean Collidge acknowledged at the time that the arrival of the Livingston outlet in close proximity played a role in their collapse: \"This scheme was 100% let when it opened in 1996 and had four tremendous years. Then retail in Scotland became overpopulated in the central belt.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFive Sisters last served as the setting for a 2015 BBC Three reality game show, I Survived a Zombie Apocalypse, which saw contestants concealing themselves from the \"undead\" whilst rushing to accomplish challenges.\n\nView 3 Images The last stores closed their doors in 2004 (Image: YouTube/Bearded Reality)\n\nWhen Bearded Reality explored the sprawling site, situated just off the M8 motorway, he discovered all 40 of its retail units sealed up, with scant indication that Five Sisters had formerly been a thriving shopping and entertainment venue.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhilst one fire exit had been left ajar, it merely allowed access to a limited, cordoned-off section, and gaining entry to the main shopping centre remained unfeasible.\n\nDespite Five Sisters having been shut for over 20 years - exceeding double the duration it actually operated - CCTV surveillance and a security officer continue to deter unauthorised public access.\n\nIn 2021, West Lothian Council turned down a proposal to convert the land into a residential development, though authorities indicated their enthusiasm to witness the site's regeneration.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images The site is slowly being reclaimed by nature (Image: YouTube/BeardedReality)\n\nA council representative stated at the time: \"The redevelopment or reuse of Westwood (Freeport), near West Calder, which previously operated as a factory outlet centre, is supported by the council.\n\n\"Leisure and tourist uses, specialised employment, starter units (Class 4), or institutional uses appropriate to a rural location will be supported.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"Some element of new or extended building outside the development envelope on-site and/or housing (very low density, with a maximum of 30 houses, meriting a rural location, all confined to the development envelope) will be considered where this is shown to be necessary for the financial viability of an appropriate scheme.\""

Her mother, Lina Savickiene, remembers hearing Lilia call her name before she rushed into the street to see her daughter still clutching the hoop and, moments later, collapsing into her arms. The trial heard how Lina initially thought \"something might have happened\" with the hula hoop.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nToday (February 25), Skebas has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 25 years. Mrs Savickiene said in her statement: \"She was getting pale. She collapsed in my hands. I saw the wounds, started to cover them. I just got scared, started to shout for somebody to help me.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe court heard that earlier in the day, Mrs Savickiene and Lilia went into town for lunch and to do some shopping, before she let the girl play outside in Fountain Lane from about 5pm because the street was 'quiet'. Prosecutor Christopher Donnellan KC said Lilia had been 'in and out' of the shop and the mother checked her 'quite often', before she heard her child call out for help.\n\nFour drug lord and cartel bosses foiled by romance - El Chapo escape to El Mencho death READ MORE :\n\nMurder probe launched as man dies after alleged South Wales Wetherspoons attack READ MORE :\n\nView 4 Images Deividas Skebas stabbed Lilia in a completely unprovoked attack (Image: PA)\n\nHe told how the attacker lay in wait. \"The street, not accessible to through-traffic, was empty. Barely anyone was about, it was quiet. The defendant was waiting. He waited while other pedestrians moved out of the way. When they left the immediate area and had gone… he approached from the Wormgate end of Fountain Lane.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMr Donnellan said Skebas's pace 'quickened' before he took a knife out from his back pocket. Skebas was then seen walking towards the girl, before stabbing her and running away.\n\nThe court heard that despite the efforts of an off-duty police officer who arrived on scene first, alongside doctors and paramedics, Lilia died within an hour of being stabbed. After the killing, Skebas said he had \"the power to resurrect\" Lilia if the police contacted \"his controller in Nasa\".\n\nSkebas, who had no connection to Lilia, was arrested at his home two days after the attack, and the paring knife he had recently bought from a local shop was found behind a radiator. He was found unfit to stand trial in the months after the stabbing and was later transferred to Rampton high security hospital.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Lilia Valutyte had been playing with her friend at the time of the attack (Image: Lincolnshire Police/ SWNS)\n\nIn July 2023, a jury found Skebas carried out the act of killing Lilia, and, two years later, following an improvement in his mental health, it was decided he could face a murder trial. During the trial, the jury was told Skebas was assessed by three psychiatrists. All three doctors agreed Skebas had schizophrenia and was showing symptoms of psychosis on the day he killed Lilia.\n\nBut the prosecution rejected Skebas's claim of diminished responsibility and alleged the killing was \"deliberate and planned\". He was found guilty earlier this month and sentenced to life in jail. Prosecutor Christopher Donnellan KC told the court it was a \"wicked act\", adding Skebas knew he was \"killing a child\".\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSkebas appeared on a video link from Rampton Hospital to hear the verdict and did not appear to show any emotion. He stared straight ahead as the statement of Lilia's mother, Lina Savicke, was read out. It began by stating Lilia would have turned 13 on Monday this week.\n\nView 4 Images Lilia Valutyte died within an hour of receiving the stab wound (Image: PA)\n\n\"Over these years of loss, both I and my entire family have lived through so much. Tears and pain cannot wash away everything we feel.\" The statement added: \"What parent ever thinks they will have to bury their own child?\" Speaking in court, Aurelijus Savickas, Lilia's stepdad, said: \"I came into her life when she was just three years young.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"From that moment on, we loved our journey together through the good days and the bad. I loved her as my own. She was a beautiful soul with a strong character and strong personality.\"\n\nAs the family impact statements were read out in court, several people could be seen wiping tears from their faces. The judge Mr Justice Choudhury excused the jury from further jury service for ten years. Addressing them, he said: \"I appreciate it has been a difficult experience for you.\"\n\nDet Chief Insp Jennifer Lovett, from Lincolnshire Police, said: \"It's taken us three-and-a-half years to bring Skebas to justice. It's not lost on me how difficult that must have been for Lilia's family.\" She added: \"It's been one of our most high-profile investigations that Lincolnshire Police has had.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nSentencing, Mr Justice Choudhury said Skebas had been a user of drugs including cannabis and amphetamines which would \"likely worsen\" his schizophrenia. Mr Donnellan told the court on Wednesday: \"This was a particularly vulnerable victim, a young girl aged nine. The offence took place with a degree of planning or premeditation.\"\n\nThe judge told Skebas that although he has been sentenced to life imprisonment, \"alternative arrangements may have to be made\" because of his current mental health state."

Just hours before they arrived, it was revealed they would be visiting Jordan alongside a delegation from the World Health Organisation.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThere over a packed two days, they visited medical evacuees from Gaza, heard from the World Central Kitchen, visited Jordan’s National Centre for Rehabilitation of Addicts and comforted cancer patients at the country's hospital for the disease. In the past, the Sussexes have been accused of stealing the thunder of their estranged royal relatives when it comes to carrying out high profile visits.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPrince Harry gives rare TV interview to deliver urgent message and issue plea READ MORE :\n\nKate Middleton forced to decline fan's request due to unusual royal ban READ MORE :\n\nView 3 Images Harry and Meghan on a two-day trip to Jordan (Image: PA)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJust weeks ago, Harry’s estranged brother Prince William also visited the Middle East on a diplomatic trip to Saudi Arabia. But according to former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond, it appears Harry and Meghan want to have a more collaborative approach.\n\nShe told the Mirror : \"I understand that they gave advanced notice of this trip to Buckingham Palace, so it is encouraging that they seem to be trying to coordinate with the royal diaries.\n\n\"It might have been awkward if this visit had come before William’s trip to Saudi Arabia, but by going afterwards it seems to me that Harry and Meghan are showing they are now sensitive to potential clashes.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe two-day trip also caused some raised eyebrows after it emerged the couple spent time with the British ambassador to Jordan. But Jennie hit back: \"I can’t see any reason why Harry and Meghan shouldn’t visit places in the world where they think they can do some good. If people want to dub it a quasi-royal tour, then frankly that’s their problem.\n\nView 3 Images Harry introduces himself to Maria who was evacuated from Gaza (Image: PA)\n\n\"It seems quite natural to me that they would want to see the results of their support for the WHO projects — through donations from their Archewell Foundation — and assess whether they can do more to help. I think they needed time when they left the royal family to settle down and sort out their priorities.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAt the end of the trip, Harry gave a rare TV interview to Channel 4 News, where he said food and medical aid corridors need to be opened to help people in Gaza.\n\nHarry was speaking after hearing an update on the situation from World Central Kitchen, which provides fresh meals in response to crises.\n\nEchoing the thoughts of WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu, the duke said there is a need for “full access for humanitarian organisations to be able to deliver that aid to the people that need it the most”. Harry and Meghan also met children at a refugee camp at the invitation of Dr Tedros, according to the programme.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Prince William on a recent trip to Saudi Arabia (Image: PA)\n\nThe duke said “it was a really important time for us to collaborate and come here and shine a light and focus on the very real humanitarian catastrophe that has happened and continues”.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAnd Jennie explained: \"Like his mother, Harry is at heart a humanitarian, and I think all he wants to do is use the influence he has to improve people’s lives and draw attention to some of the conflict areas in the world. That’s a noble aspiration, and I hope people don’t sneer at his and Meghan‘s efforts.\""

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The cameras were forced to cut away before medics attended to the fighter.\n\nReplays show that late in the first round, the two boxers clashed heads, with George coming away dazed and shaken. It appears this was the reason for his sudden fall to the canvas.\n\nThe 36-year-old made it back to his feet following medical attention and was taken to a Detroit hospital to be monitored.

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\n\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "If rugby’s authorities are serious about changing the sport for the better, then they should be incentivising the Prem’s new franchises to be placed in some of England’s untapped counties.\n\nTake Norfolk, for example. Ben Youngs, Freddie Steward and Jack van Poortvliet all grew up in East Anglia yet the area has no professional club representation.\n\nSeason ticket renewals for Norwich City are among the highest in England because it is a remote part of the country which has little other professional sport on offer.\n\nThe RFU and Prem Rugby should be banging down the door of Sir James Dyson, the British inventor who grew up in the area but currently pumps his millions into the jersey sponsorship of Bath.\n\nBirmingham, Yorkshire, Liverpool and the south coast are other areas that rugby should be trying to tap into as part of the long-term plan to grow the sport.\n\nScrapping promotion and relegation is a tough pill to swallow, although the gulf between the first and second division has become virtually unbridgeable.\n\nEnglish rugby's overhaul should be used as a springboard for expansion in untapped counties\n\nWorcester Warriors and London Irish are primed to apply for one of the 12 top-flight franchises and return to the PREM, having been expelled over financial difficulties in 2022 and 2023\n\n28 CLUBS HAVE PLAYED IN THE PREMIERSHIP - WHO'S NEXT? Team Seasons Bath 36 (7 titles) Gloucester 36 Leicester Tigers 36 (11 titles) Harlequins 35 (2 titles) Wasps 35 (6 titles) Northampton Saints 31 (2 titles) Saracens 31 (6 titles) Sale Sharks 30 (1 title) London Irish 28 Bristol Bears 25 Newcastle Red Bulls 24 (1 title) Worcester Warriors 16 Exeter Chiefs 13 (2 titles) Orrell 10 Leeds Tykes 8 Nottingham, West Hartlepool 5 Birmingham Moseley, Rosslyn Park 4 Bedford Blues 3 Liverpool St Helens, London Scottish, London Welsh, Richmond, Rotherham Titans, Rugby Lions, Waterloo 2 Coventry 1\n\nThe model is broken and ring-fencing with the option for expansion offers a happy medium. A pathway for ambitious clubs remains (at least in theory), while new investors can be confident they are not throwing money into a black hole.\n\nAfter the RFU council approved the changes yesterday, Exeter Chiefs owner Tony Rowe told Daily Mail Sport that investor confidence immediately spiked.\n\nNow 77, Rowe is speaking to new investors and negotiations can now advance with financiers in America. ‘We’re talking to a couple of investors and one of them wanted to wait to hear what happened this week,’ he said.\n\n‘English rugby is desperate for money but it’s difficult to find investment because of the worry of relegation. Red Bull didn’t just come along and say, “we don’t mind if we get relegated”. They were banking on this decision.\n\n‘I’m certain we’ll see more big names invest in English rugby now. Money dictates where sport goes and if somebody wants to pay handsomely to change the name of Exeter I have no doubt that might happen.\n\n‘We’re in the market for a partner investor. It’s going to cost you somewhere between £50m and £100millon to get a Prem side together with a stadium. I’m sure there are people out there interested in doing it.\n\n‘There are talks about rugby at the new stadium in Birmingham. Yorkshire has more rugby clubs than any other county but none of them perform at the top level so it would be nice to see another club there. Maybe someone in the North West. We want people to come into the Prem and first we want to get back to 12 clubs.’\n\nThe likes of Ollie Chessum, Freddie Steward and Fraser Dingwall have all played in the second division and the competition must not be set up to fail. It is key the chances of promotion remain genuine if teams meet the relevant criteria.\n\nSeason ticket renewals for Norwich City are among the highest in the country because it is a remote part of the country which has little other professional sport on offer\n\nYorkshire has not had a Premiership team since 2011, when Leeds Carnegie went down - a year later, they sold their P shares in the competition to Exeter Chiefs\n\nThe perfect scenario is more big hitters enter the market and rugby’s ecosystem grows. We could see more investment into playing squads, stronger academies and a trickle-down effect on the Champ.\n\nWe have seen London Irish, Wasps and Worcester fold under the financial pressures of professional sport but, after years of turmoil, there is an opportunity for new shoots to appear off the beaten path."

            "content": "Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall always thought he would play for David Moyes, ever since the Everton manager tried to sign him for West Ham.\n\n‘It felt like I needed to work with him at some point,’ he says. But then close relationships with managers don’t always take you where you think they will.\n\nTwo summers ago, Dewsbury-Hall followed Enzo Maresca from Leicester to Chelsea only to find himself on the fringes. Two Premier League starts in a season was not what he thought Chelsea had paid £30million for.\n\n‘There were times when it felt very dark,’ Dewsbury-Hall admits. ‘If I am not playing, I can feel useless. I am very emotional.’\n\nNow, three-quarters of the way through a debut season at Everton, Dewsbury-Hall can talk about a career revived and some ambitions of winning a first cap for his country that have not been discouraged by England manager Thomas Tuchel.\n\n‘I've spoken to him once or twice,’ he tells Daily Mail Sport. ‘He was at Old Trafford when I scored. He was at Fulham when I scored. So I wouldn't mind him coming to more games! He's been complimentary and told me to stick at it. I feel like I am ready now. I feel like I am moving forwards again.’\n\nIn his debut season at Everton, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall can talk about a career revived and some ambitions of winning a first cap for his country\n\n'I feel like I am ready (to play for England) now. I feel like I am moving forwards again.’\n\nDuring a season of change – most of it positive – at Everton, Dewsbury-Hall stands out. Jack Grealish was the big-name signing but injury has ended his season. Young Tyler Dibling has struggled. Dewsbury-Hall, now 27, has assumed the role of senior player quite naturally.\n\n‘When I broke through at Leicester I just went on to the pitch trying to do the right thing,’ he says. ‘Now I've got a different mentality. I want to stand out.\n\n‘The manager and myself have history. He's known me for a while. He was interested when he was at West Ham. So it felt like the right time now to come to him. I just genuinely thought it would click here and it has. I know if I had the opportunity at Chelsea, it would have been the same.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall was a late developer and a thinker. It’s not always a great combination. As a teenager he interpreted his slow physical progress as a weakness. But now that he’s through all that, a clear intellect radiates and it’s to his benefit.\n\nFew footballers are as engaging or as curious. Two years into a degree in sports management, he has concerns about the direction football is taking on and off the field. He is also obsessed with West End musicals – 'my guilty pleasure' – and is convinced he will stand on a different kind of stage one day. Meanwhile he is an accomplished snooker and pool player.\n\n‘I do like to learn,’ the Nottingham-born midfielder says in his broad East Midlands accent. ‘I don't just like sitting on my backside doing nothing.’\n\nIn three weeks, fatherhood beckons. A little girl. That learning process is about to be accelerated and maybe it’s fitting, then, that Everton chose him to visit Much Woolton Primary School, 10 miles from Hill Dickinson Stadium, to read to a class of 25 children ahead of World Book Day next week.\n\nThe kids are blindfolded and have to guess the identity of their ‘secret reader’ as Dewsbury-Hall makes his way slowly through a page of a Harry Potter book he has chosen. When his identity is revealed, there is classroom bedlam. An enthusiastic signing session follows, as Dewsbury-Hall makes his way from table to table talking about books, reading and a fair bit of football.\n\nThe kids at Much Woolton Primary School are blindfolded and have to guess the identity of their ‘secret reader’ as Dewsbury-Hall reads a page of a Harry Potter book he has chosen\n\nWhen his identity is revealed, there is classroom bedlam. Dewsbury-Hall makes his way from table to table talking about books, reading and a fair bit of football\n\n‘You know, I was really nervous before going in there,’ he smiles as he sits down to talk in the headteacher’s office. ‘I haven't read out loud for a while. Football's not easy but I'm used to that, aren’t I? I thought, \"God, if I start making mistakes here, I'll make myself look like a right sausage\". But no, it was good in the end.’\n\nChildren can be blunt. At one stage, Dewsbury-Hall is asked by an eight-year-old why Everton can’t win at home. It’s a theme we return to. Ahead of today’s visit to Newcastle, Everton sit ninth despite having won only twice at their new Hill Dickinson Stadium in the Premier League since the start of November, and none of the last six.\n\n‘I do think there's maybe a little mental block there at the moment,’ he admits. ‘That does happen in football. I truly believe it. Something will happen in a game and it will just knock us for six or it will change the way we play. Whereas away, we know what we're doing.\n\n‘We do talk about it. I'm not gonna lie to you. We're humans. We ask ourselves why it goes wrong. We have tried training on the pitch and stuff and will probably do it again.’\n\nReflection is common in football and Dewsbury-Hall is prone to it. His home library comprises largely of autobiographies and motivational business books but not much of it prepared him for what happened at Chelsea.\n\nFollowing Maresca to Stamford Bridge in 2024 felt like the next step. Instead, Dewsbury-Hall found himself buried beneath a mountain of midfield bodies. He was the only player to feature in all 15 games of the club’s Conference League triumph and had some minutes at the Club World Cup. But every weekend brought Premier League disappointment.\n\n‘I had a lot of options but signed for Chelsea genuinely thinking I was gonna play,’ he says. ‘I believed I could. I know I could. And then football is football. Things happen.\n\n‘Obviously the competition was high. Rival midfielders were £100m players (Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez). It was a strange dynamic at times. It was quite fortunate for the club that the manager could field two very strong teams.\n\nHe was the only player to feature in all 15 games of the club’s Conference League triumph and had some minutes at the Club World Cup\n\nHis home library comprises largely of autobiographies and motivational business books but not much of it prepared him for being overlooked by Enzo Maresca at Chelsea\n\n‘But it was weird - it almost felt like no matter how well I played in midweek, I would not play at the weekend and that was the only thing that didn't sit well with me. In football it's important, if you're playing well, that you get the chance to play. I'm a very emotional guy. If I'm not playing, I feel useless, basically. I feel like I haven't got a purpose because that's my life.\n\n‘So yeah, there were dark times where I thought, “I don't care about money or anything else. I just wanna play football, so why aren’t I?”.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall’s relationship with Maresca meant there were regular conversations but not reassurances. ‘He was as honest as maybe he could be,’ the player adds. ‘He said some things that I wanted to hear and maybe some things that I didn't want to hear. He told me I had to be patient and said I wasn’t as big a fish in a pond as I was at Leicester.\n\n‘I am not gonna cry over it. I know if I did play more I would have been able to show people what I could do. In my head, that's a fact. But the strategy worked for the club, didn’t it? They won trophies and they got in the top four.\n\n‘I could easily have stayed at Chelsea for much longer but I wanted to go to a club with a project and be a main player. Everton felt perfect. Seamus Coleman has been here 17 years and tells me to imagine what winning a trophy would be like.\n\n‘If you can do that here, you'll go down in history books. This fanbase deserves good times and it gave me that extra motivation to come. Now I'm in such a better place. People look at me in a different light I hope.’\n\nRelationships with coaches and managers are always key to a player’s development. Dewsbury-Hall has had his bumps in the road and sometimes they have been impossible to see coming.\n\nAt Leicester, the club he joined aged eight, Brendan Rodgers gave him his senior debut at the age of 21 but he soon learned that managers have egos too.\n\nAt Leicester, the club he joined aged eight, Brendan Rodgers (right) gave him his senior debut at the age of 21 but he soon learned that managers have egos too\n\nScoring the winning goal at Old Trafford in November as David Moyes' side pulled off a famous win with 10 men\n\n‘He organised a pool tournament and everyone had to join in,’ recalls Dewsbury-Hall, a friend of four-time world snooker champion Mark Selby, the 'Jester from Leicester'. ‘I was playing for a pub team when I was 10 years old. I mean, I can play.\n\n‘I was young at the time – wasn’t a first-team player – but was drawn to play him (Rodgers) in the first round. I said to the lads: “Do I try my hardest?” Because he was having himself. He was going, “I'm really good at pool” and all the lads thought he fancied himself to win the whole thing.\n\n‘Quite a few people were watching and I beat him 3-0 and you could tell he was raging. I've just gone, “Yeah, sorry gaffer” and a week later got sent out on loan to Blackpool. So yeah, I mean, that was a fun week of my life.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall’s talents as a snooker player are not in doubt. As an actor, there is not yet any proof but he does yearn to find out. His love of the West End runs deep. He has watched endless shows in London and on New York's Broadway, and has contacts and friends in the business. A few years ago he was due to have a brief role through a BBC project in The Lion King but an injury got in the way.\n\nHe has tried and failed to encourage interest in various team-mates. ‘They just look at me like I am alien,’ he says. 'But one day I genuinely believe I'll do something in the West End.\n\n‘I resonate with what they do every night, giving their best to a completely new set of eyes. That's hard to do, so I respect them so much.’\n\nIn terms of the football, Dewsbury-Hall looks at where the game is going and, along with many others inside and outside of dressing rooms, has concerns about the influence of money, endless VAR checks, 100-minute matches and social media.\n\nAsked if the game is losing a bit of its innocence, he says: ‘Yeah, a little bit. And look, I'm old school. I'm an old head. That's why I hang around with people like Seamus.\n\nDewsbury-Hall looks at where football is going and has concerns about the influence of money, endless VAR checks, 100-minute matches and social media\n\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel was at Craven Cottage earlier this month to see Dewsbury-Hall score in the win over Fulham\n\n‘It's going away from that sort of old-school football isn’t it? It’s the way the world's going. Football’s more business now than it was. It will only increase. I just don't want it to lose its identity and lose why we fell in love with the game. I grew up watching Match of the Day and all I cared about was seeing people score goals. I don't want kids in 10 years watching it and going: “What is this?”\n\n‘It should be about the love. But look at the last week. The north London derby is taking 15 minutes to get restarted. Lloyd Kelly gets sent off for Juventus in the Champions League for the most ridiculous thing in the world. Rules are rules in football but sometimes you just need to smell a situation.\n\n‘The players, we're humans just like you. We grew up watching the sport. It's obviously just because we're inside it now, it's a bit more close to home. But we see the same things you see. We have the same concerns.’\n\nFor now, Dewsbury-Hall is probably too busy to save football. But Everton have a fine player and the rest of us have a genuine thinker in our midst. He is in Tuchel’s thoughts for a reason."

            "content": "Why Aston Villa can feel a Champions League place slipping through their fingers AGAIN: The three key players they look half a team without and where Unai Emery is going wrong after Wolves defeat: TOM COLLOMOSSE\n\nWhen Rodrigo Gomes sealed Wolves' victory with a handful of seconds remaining, Unai Emery had seen enough.\n\nThe Aston Villa boss marched straight down the tunnel and when Rob Edwards approached the away dugout at full-time to shake hands, Emery was nowhere to be seen. Soon after full-time his captain, Ezri Konsa, appeared to be restrained by a Villa staff member. There were suggestions Konsa had exchanged cross words with some away supporters.\n\n'In September I was worried about being in the relegation zone,' said Emery, referring to Villa's poor start. 'Then maybe a month ago I was dreaming of fighting with Manchester City and Arsenal for the title.\n\n'We are having a great season and I want to tell our fans now that we need them. We are grateful for them for being with us but at Villa Park we need their help. We need to be together – players, coaches, fans, everyone.\n\n'Our points total is similar to clubs who have finished in the top five before. We are competing against great teams and for them it is necessary to finish in the Champions League. We need to keep our position.'\n\nJoao Gomes' opener and Rodrigo's clincher means Wolves eclipse Derby's record low points total from 2007-08 and they deserved their win. 'I have not been especially focused on [the total] but it is important for the club and the fans,' acknowledged Edwards.\n\nAston Villa will have fears over their Champions League spot again after losing 2-0 at Wolves\n\nUnai Emery was left with his head in his hands as his third-place side stumbled at Molineux\n\nThe lasting image of the night, however, was Emery's touchline meltdown. Villa fans hope their toiling team do not follow suit as they fear a Champions League place will slip from their grasp for the second season in a row. Their next two fixtures are against fellow contenders Chelsea and Manchester United.\n\nAsked about the pressure on Villa, Morgan Rogers said: 'It does weigh on us but it shouldn't. We deserve to be here and we should not forget that. There is nothing to worry about.'\n\nEmery's early exit was no surprise. From the moment he gave Jadon Sancho an earful midway through the first half, the Spaniard looked ready to boil over. 'Only seven?!' he seemed to scream at the fourth official after the stoppage time board was raised, with his side chasing an equaliser. Earlier, Emery appeared to ignore Emi Buendia and Lucas Digne when they were substituted, his frustration growing when play was delayed due to an issue with referee Craig Pawson's earpiece.\n\nEmery is one of the finest managers in Villa's history but this was not his finest hour. From the moment the team sheet landed, his night started going wrong. Ollie Watkins and Lucas Digne ahead of the in-form Tammy Abraham and the adventurous Ian Maatsen. Really?\n\nThen there was his demeanour throughout the game. Emery is always full of nervous energy on the touchline and usually it is a positive force. Here, though, it could not possibly have been.\n\nVilla are still third in the table, six points ahead of Liverpool in sixth, and are favourites for the Europa League.\n\nVilla needed Emery to be calm. Instead he acted like a man who was watching everything go up in smoke, though he had cooled down by the time he faced the media.\n\nIn this form, Villa will struggle to succeed at home or in Europe. When Joao Gomes gave Wolves the lead just after the hour mark, only Ezri Konsa and Digne tried to encourage their team-mates. Konsa and Amadou Onana berated Buendia for dragging his heels as the Argentine walked to the bench after being substituted.\n\nWolves know they are down but there are still certain matches that can bring some light in the darkness. One is next week's FA Cup fifth-round tie against Liverpool. The other is the chance to knock over one of their local rivals.\n\nThe absence of key players is starting to take its toll on Villa. Shorn of Boubacar Kamara, as well as John McGinn and Youri Tielemans, they look half the team.\n\nJoao Gomes (above) struck midway through the second half to put Wolves in the ascendancy, before Rodrigo Gomes grabbed the hosts' second goal with virtually the last kick of the game\n\nVilla's dismal defeat marked just the second time Wolves have won in the league this season\n\nThe early signs were not promising. Buendia's clumsy challenge on Jean-Ricner Bellegarde gave Wolves a free-kick that Mateus Mane sent just wide from 22 yards. Many expected Abraham to be preferred to Watkins here and in the sixth minute Watkins wasted a great chance to repay that faith.\n\nSent clear by Morgan Rogers, Watkins hesitated just long enough for Yerson Mosquera to steal the ball before the forward could even shoot. Moments later, Pau Torres wasted a free header from Douglas Luiz's corner. Luiz then volleyed straight at Jose Sa and at the other end, Mateus Mane put a free-kick just wide and Toti Gomes miscued a volley.\n\n\n\nThe pattern did not change in the second half until, moments after Emery had made a double change, Jackson Tchatchoua crossed from the right, Adam Armstrong laid the ball off and Gomes crashed it in off the bar from 15 yards. Maatsen's arrival made a difference and his rising shot forced Sa into another sharp stop and Mosquera cleared off the line from Abraham before Rodrigo sealed it in front of the South Bank."

'We have earned the right to be in a strong position (with) what we've done in the group stage, and that's it.\n\n‘And now we need to start to analyse them and find ways to be better than them (Bayer Leverkusen), to try to go through the tie.’\n\n\n\nAsked if the route ahead gives him excitement, Arteta added: ‘Yeah, we are really excited. Obviously, being in the forefront and the way the team is consistently performing gives you a lot of hope and positive thoughts about what is coming.'"

            "content": "Igor Tudor has shelved plans to impose his full-throttle brand of football at Tottenham after realising his players are not in good enough physical shape.\n\nTudor has forged a reputation for an intense, man-to-man, high-pressing tactical style during his 13-year coaching career.\n\nIt was part of his appeal for Spurs where fans demand adventure and ambition but just a fortnight and one game into his tenure, he admits this will not be possible with the tired and depleted squad he has inherited.\n\n'Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,' said Tudor. 'They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and the physical condition of the team has dropped down. So, we need to use this period where we don't play the games to put some petrol in the engine, so the engine starts to work better.\n\n'They are fatigued and to press high you need to be fit. But all of them. If someone is not in the right shape, there is a problem because someone is coming [pressing] late. And the second thing, is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back so if you run up and don't run back it's a problem.\n\n'For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it's a big question what we can do and what we cannot.'\n\nIgor Tudor has revealed that he was shocked by his players' fitness at this point in the season\n\nTudor has surprised some Spurs players with some gruelling running sessions in training overseen by the fitness coach he brought with him Riccardo Ragnacci.\n\n'That's the only way, running,' said the Spurs interim boss. 'The pitch is a hundred yards, it's long. You need to run. There are habits. Maybe you have habits to work a bit less. Players never like runs without the ball so we put in some runs without the ball.\n\n'There is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn't like. And the best thing is that they understand this.'\n\nTudor's initial assessment is not dissimilar to predecessors Ange Postecoglou and Thomas Frank, who both concluded that the squad was neither strong nor robust enough to cope when coupled with the expectation to play adventurous, exciting football and attack four competitions.\n\nBut the urgency of these circumstances, four points above the relegation zone without a win in nine Premier League games, together with the Croatian's imposing stature and taciturn delivery gave his message the ring of a chilling wake-up call for his players.\n\n'There is some pressure here in this club,' said Tudor. 'Some players are still young. They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to solve the problems.\n\n'If you have too many of these players because of injuries who are playing together it does create some problems, but it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man.\n\n'To grow fast and say, 'Come on, I'm the guy, give me the ball, I will score' instead of just, 'What can I do, I'm just here you know'. This is the challenge for each of them. Why not say, 'Come on, I will be the guy, give me the ball, I will not cry, I will take the ball, I will defend my box'.\n\n'It's always how you see the situation. You can always see it both ways. Or 'I'm not, I'm just here and we had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play'. How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy, positive there is opportunity.'\n\nWhen asked ahead of Sunday's trip to Fulham if he thought there were enough soldiers for the fight ahead, Tudor said that he hoped and believed there were and promised not to read too far into performances in his first game, a 4-1 defeat against Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\n'If you play against the best team in the world, at this moment, for us, I need to be honest, it's not a realistic game to show we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,' he said. 'That's the truth. For long periods in the game we had problems, in defence especially. It's not easy against them. Let's see in the next games.'"

And no one looks at the circumstances, which are that the 450 is very well spent… very, very, VERY well spent, one more time: very well spent.\n\n'They are great football players which will be a big, big, big success for this club. Some already now and some in the future. The reality of this season is we sold for £300m, some starters like Trent (Alexander-Arnold) sold for only £10m.\n\n'We had to recoup the money with players. From that spend, then £250m of it (has not been used)… Alex has not been the Alex of Newcastle, maybe 20 minutes at Tottenham, I don't criticise him because we signed him for six years not six months.\n\nArne Slot has insisted Liverpool were right to splash out £450million in the summer because of the players they sold\n\n'Giorgi (Mamardashvili), we needed him because Caoimh (Kelleher) left but we hardly played with two goalkeepers. Jeremie (Frimpong) has been injured, Giovanni (Leoni) out for the season.\n\n'Tomorrow, I miss out on Florian (Wirtz, who is injured).'\n\nMeanwhile, Slot has also urged for patience with 17-year-old winger Rio Ngumoha, who has been subject to much clamour from fans and media this week after his promising cameo off the bench at Nottingham Forest last week.\n\nIt comes at the same time fellow wingers, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo, have been out of form in front of goal.\n\nSlot said: 'Let's be clear, he is a special player that will have more playing time and already has more playing time recently.\n\n'But for a player that is playing for the Under 19 team of England, if everyone thinks he is so good, then he should be in (in a higher international team).'\n\n\n\nThe Reds will be without Wirtz for the visit of West Ham but Frimpong is back in the squad after missing the last month with a groin problem."

            "content": "Two significant dates are marked in the calendar for Harry Maguire next week.\n\nOn Thursday, a celebration for the Manchester United and England defender’s 33rd birthday. Twenty-four hours earlier, a retrial over allegations he assaulted a police officer and of attempted bribery is scheduled to take place on the Greek island of Syros.\n\nSafe to say, he will only be turning up at one of them.\n\nIn the unlikely event that the shambolic Greek legal process functions on this occasion after no fewer than four previous postponements, Maguire isn’t even required to appear in person. He will instead be doing what he does best, anchoring United’s defence against Newcastle in the Premier League at St James’ Park.\n\nThe good times and the bad times have never been far apart during a rollercoaster career at Old Trafford that could feasibly come to an end in June, although there is growing optimism that contract talks will have a positive outcome before then.\n\nAside from the arrest in Mykonos on a family holiday in 2020, Maguire has been booed by his own fans playing for club and country, and been the target of a bomb threat. He has been dropped from the United team, stripped of the captaincy, and would have been sold in 2023 had he not rejected a £30million move to West Ham.\n\nHarry Maguire has fought his way back into a key role for Manchester United\n\nThe good times and the bad times have never been far apart during a rollercoaster career at Old Trafford that could feasibly come to an end in June\n\nThroughout it all, Maguire has kept his dignity and remained loyal to United when it didn’t always feel like the club were being loyal to him. Those who have worked with him describe the ultimate team player who puts his body on the line and faces adversity while worrying more about those around him.\n\nThere he was again at Everton on Monday, leading the defensive effort in the face of a late onslaught to earn a 1-0 win that put United back into the top four.\n\nRestoring Maguire to central defence in a 4-2-3-1 formation has been one of the key changes under Michael Carrick.\n\nAfter missing the final two months of Ruben Amorim’s tumultuous reign through injury, he returned on the bench for two games under Darren Fletcher, and has started all six of Carrick’s matches in charge.\n\nNo wonder United’s new head coach expressed hope on Friday that Maguire will stay beyond this summer, when his contract expires. United are known to be concerned about losing him at the same time as another experienced player in Casemiro.\n\n‘Harry's had a great career so far, and hopefully there's a lot more to come,’ said Carrick, who was first-team coach under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when Maguire arrived at United from Leicester in a £80m deal in 2019.\n\n‘He’s an impressive character. He has been here on the journey and the experiences that he's had, and with England as well, shows exactly what he is. I think we all know the player he is and what he's capable of doing.’\n\nWith all Maguire’s experience, is he in some of the best form of his career?\n\n<p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>\n\n‘There's a case,’ nodded Carrick. ‘I think as your career goes, when you're a young player everything's fresh and new, and you're fearless and there's not many scars there.\n\n‘You get to your peak years and you feel good, but obviously you've had a few ups and downs along the way. The experience that you've gained then makes you a better player; that sweet spot of being able to do it physically still, but using the experiences to know what's coming.\n\n‘Experience is massive, it's hard to put a price on how valuable that can be. Harry's gained an awful lot of it in different ways through this club.’\n\nIncluding interim managers and caretaker coaches, Maguire has played under seven different bosses at United. Some have valued him highly, others less so. Most of them had to rely on him at some point.\n\nLikewise the fans, although for the most part he has always had the backing of hardcore United supporters who appreciate his endeavour and a knack for late goals. His winners against Liverpool and Lyon were the stand-out moments under Amorim.\n\nMaybe not the Australian day-trippers who booed him at the Melbourne Cricket Ground when United played Crystal Palace – their opponents at Old Trafford on Sunday – on tour in 2022, and again in Perth a few days later.\n\nOr the idiot who had threatened to bomb Maguire’s home in March of that year, leading to the player moving his partner Fern and their two young daughters to a safe house while police carried out a sweep of the property and United brought in extra protection.\n\nThe so-called United boo-boys never bothered Maguire, but that wasn’t the case with his England critics.\n\nTargeted by Three Lions fans when England played Ivory Coast and Germany in 2022, he was hammered so relentlessly by Scotland supporters as he scored an own-goal at Hampden Park the following year that his mother Zoe took to social media to hit back at the ‘disgraceful’ behaviour. ‘That was a bad one for him,’ says an insider, referring to the lows of the 2022-23 season.\n\nThe so-called United boo-boys never bothered Maguire, but that wasn’t the case with his England critics\n\nNew United manager Erik ten Hag preferred Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane in central defence. The captain and mainstay under Solskjaer, Maguire only started eight Premier League games.\n\nThere was the awkwardness of coming off the bench in the Carabao Cup final against Newcastle at Wembley to then lift the trophy with Bruno Fernandes.\n\nMaguire had to publicly deny rumours of a leadership challenge from Cristiano Ronaldo before the Portugal star was pushed out of Old Trafford, but insiders say that he saw Ten Hag’s decision to hand the armband to Fernandes coming long before he was stripped of the captaincy that summer.\n\nNews broke just before a pre-season tour in which Maguire had the added indignity of being berated by goalkeeper Andre Onana on the pitch against Borussia Dortmund in Las Vegas and again booed by fans before a pre-season game against Athletic Bilbao in Dublin.\n\n‘He was very consistent in terms of his emotions,’ says one source. ‘When the younger players look at him, they must think “he’s been through so much, what have we got to complain about?”.’\n\nAll the while, the shadow of his trial in Greece continued to hang over the player and his family after he was arrested in August 2020 following a brawl. Maguire, who claimed to be defending his sister Daisy during the altercation in a bar, was handed a 21-month suspended sentence. However, the conviction was automatically quashed on appeal under Greek law and four retrials have been postponed.\n\nThe Maguire camp want to clear his name, and their legal team will be ready for court again on Wednesday, but no-one expects it to go ahead. There are doubts it will ever take place at all before the statute of limitations runs out in August 2028.\n\nMaguire is said to be very close to his family. His parents Zoe and Alan travel the world watching him. His brothers Laurence and Joe are both footballers, and Daisy works in the sports and entertainment industry.\n\nMaguire has played under seven different bosses at United. Some have valued him highly, others less so. Most of them had to rely on him at some point\n\n‘He was very consistent in terms of his emotions,’ says a source. ‘When younger players look at him, they must think “he’s been through so much, what have we got to complain about?”.’\n\nThat's one reason why Sheffield-born Maguire is said to be keen to stay in the North West and sign a new deal with United. The signs are promising.\n\nHe has been able to talk to foreign clubs since the beginning of the year, but turned down AC Milan and Brendan Rodgers’ new Saudi club Al Qadsiah in January.\n\nUnited are committed to driving down the wage bill and want to reduce his £180,000-a-week salary. But at least they are open to negotiation, which was not necessarily the case with Casemiro.\n\nAt this stage of his career, Maguire wants some security in terms of length of contract as he prepares to turn 33. ‘It’s an amazing club to play for and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could,’ he said last year.\n\nForm and fitness will be factors in United’s decision, and in that sense Maguire has a strong case.\n\nHe has outlasted his central defensive partners Varane, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans at Old Trafford. Martinez is out again after only recently returning from a long-term injury, and Matthijs De Ligt has not been available since the end of November. Youngsters Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven have had their teething troubles.\n\nThomas Tuchel has also taken note and says Maguire is in his thoughts for the World Cup. The player is desperate to go to North America after missing out on Euro 2024 through injury.\n\nHe has yet to play under Tuchel and won the last of his 64 caps in a Nations League win over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in 2024.\n\nHe has yet to play under Thomas Tuchel and won the last of his 64 caps in a Nations League win over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in 2024\n\nMaguire is still holding out hope of playing in a third World Cup for England\n\nSteve Bruce, who knows a thing or two about playing centre back at United and captaining the club, believes Maguire is worthy of a new contract and a World Cup spot.\n\n‘I believe Harry has been made the whipping boy for what was going on around him for too long,’ Bruce told Daily Mail Sport. ‘I don't think he's ever let Man United down. In fact, he's never let England down either.\n\n‘I wouldn't be surprised if he went to the World Cup and gets offered a new deal. Why wouldn't you? I think centre-halves get better with age. Over the last five or six weeks, he's given a reminder of just what he's about – if he ever needed to.’"

            "content": "England have spent this entire Twenty20 World Cup talking about playing the perfect game, yet remain firmly in the hunt to become the first country to win the tournament three times because they have learned to deal with their imperfections.\n\nThis astonishing late heist against New Zealand kept up their 100 per cent record in the Super Eight stage, meaning Harry Brook's team will, barring some extraordinary results this weekend, be heading for the second semi-final in Mumbai on ­Thursday — where the prospect of a frenzied atmosphere against co-hosts India or a replay of their group-stage meeting with West Indies, their only defeat here, awaits.\n\nMore top-order failure meant that for much of a chase of 160, it looked like they would be destined for Kolkata instead, until a seventh-wicket union between Will Jacks and the recalled Rehan Ahmed worth 44 off just 16 deliveries catapulted them to victory.\n\nIt speaks of the dysfunctional aspects of this team that Jacks, their No7 batsman and sixth bowler, has won four man-of-the-match awards in 20 days. On the balance of probabilities, their luck must run out eventually.\n\n'Yeah, you're right, because ideally I would do nothing, and I'm kind of at some stage the extra bowler and the extra batter. If I didn't bowl and didn't bat, we'd have had that perfect game that we keep speaking about,' Jacks said, following two for 23 with an unbeaten 32.\n\n'We've won six out of seven games and qualified for a semi-­final. We obviously want to play well but we're not gutted we ­haven't been perfect. What we've done well is in the key moments, we've kept a calm and clear head and managed to get those rewards.'\n\nWill Jacks starred with both bat and ball as England beat New Zealand at the T20 World Cup\n\nEngland required 42 off 17 when Ahmed, preferred to Jamie Overton because the match was contested on a used pitch, got off the mark by launching a 103-yard six off spinner Glenn Phillips, who had been reintroduced to the attack for his ability to dart the ball in from around the wicket, cramping his opponents for room.\n\nIt was almost fantasy cricket: as he left the dugout at 117 for six, all-rounder Ahmed received a walkie-talkie message from coach Brendon McCullum to bat like India great Virender Sehwag.\n\nTwo balls later, Jacks sent a skyscraper of a hit over the midwicket boundary to truly seize the momentum and with New Zealand reeling, he powerfully pierced the field for back-to-back fours.\n\nWhen Ahmed danced down the track to hit a second six from the final ball of the penultimate over, sent down by the usually parsimonious Mitchell Santner, they were on the verge of a victory set to an all too familiar template: Nepal, Scotland and Italy discomforting them until late in proceedings in the group stage.\n\nHowever, after New Zealand followed the way of Sri Lanka and Pakistan, captain Santner said of England: 'If you can get yourselves out of a tricky position to end up winning it does a lot for the team, and a lot for the confidence.\n\n'There's no better team at finding a way to win from anywhere. There's different guys stepping up at different times, which is what you want. I wouldn't want to face them, if we're in the semi-finals.'\n\nThe Kiwis face a nervous wait as defeat has presented the outside possibility of Pakistan pipping them for the last four. To do so, Pakistan must defeat Sri Lanka by a minimum of 64 runs or chase down their target in 13.1 overs in Pallekele today.\n\nIn England's favour is an extraordinary belief that they can win from anywhere, and an enviable team spirit. 'This is the era of Harry Brook as white-ball captain,' said Jacks, as if to emphasise the captain's popularity within a youthful squad.\n\nRehan Ahmed put on a more-than-useful partnership wirth Jacks to steer his side to their sixth win from seven games\n\nBut members of the old guard are an issue: the opening partnership of Jos Buttler and Phil Salt averages just 12 in the tournament, and Buttler has just 62 from seven visits to the crease.\n\nEngland have been effective at the start of bowling innings, taking 18 powerplay wickets in the tournament, before this fruitless return against Tim Seifert and Finn Allen.\n\nJofra Archer's form bodes well whichever opponents await. Here, he started with a maiden featuring a successful Seifert review for caught behind, but did not bowl out, as Brook opted to send down a record 16 overs of spin.\n\nThings will get tougher but despite being outhit by opponents, England's engine room has fired.\n\nIn addition to Jacks, who has figures in the Sri Lankan leg of 10-0-72-5, Sam Curran followed closing out the last-ball thriller versus Nepal with handy runs, and combined in a 42-run stand with Tom Banton that kept the prospect of another dramatic England win alive."

Their conflict came to a head at the 2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and resulted in a crash for the ages — not so much because of its intensity or damage, but more so because it ultimately led to Ricciardo’s departure from Red Bull Racing and straight into the arms of their biggest rival — Renault.\n\nEpisode three — Redemption — was a deep dive into the Verstappen-Ricciardo rivalry, exploring the build-up of tension and the ultimate fallout from the collision.\n\nThe drivers had pretty much been inseparable from the start of the Baku race, surviving early wheel-to-wheel contact by a hair’s breadth.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nVerstappen’s refusal to yield even as the seemingly faster Ricciardo fought tooth and nail was a fight for the ages, and things finally boiled over on lap 40, when Ricciardo slammed into the rear of his team mate’s mean machine in an attempt to slipstream past him on the Turn 1 run.\n\nSpeaking about the dramatic collision between his team members, Red Bull’s then Team Principal Christian Horner said at the time: “We allow them to race, we allow them to go wheel to wheel. We even discussed it in pre-race meetings about giving each other space.\n\n\"Unfortunately this was the culmination of two guys taking things into their own hands which shouldn’t have happened. We talked about it before the race, both drivers nodded in agreement that they would give each other space. It was a low point and I made my feelings very clear to both drivers.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nExcellent primetime television, that.\n\nRomain Grosjean’s terrifying fireball crash in Season 3 (and all his other crashes)\n\nView 6 Images Romain Grosjean's fireball crash was one of the most terrifying moments in F1 history (Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix will forever live on in the minds of motorsport lovers and Formula 1 drivers — especially those racing on the grid at the time.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe race saw Romain Grosjean’s Haas engulfed in horrific, eat-you-alive flames and it was considered to be a certified miracle that Grosjean survived the horrific crash.\n\nThe ex-Haas driver crashed through the barriers in the opening lap itself as his vehicle spontaneously combusted into monster flames.\n\nOnlookers were peering at the fiery wreck with instant grief, however miraculously, Grosjean emerged from the flames, having escaped death by the narrowest of margins.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe suffered extensive burns on both of his hands, and it turned out that his 179th Grand Prix was to be his last, the crash invariably spelling the end of his Formula 1 career.\n\nSeason three’s 9th episode, Man on Fire, took us behind the scenes and showed the impact the terrifying incident had on the rest of the paddock, with Lewis Hamilton saying: “This one was hard to watch. I felt very vulnerable at that moment.”\n\nHaas Team Principal Guenther Steiner said: “Once you see fire, that is the worst thing you can have. This is bad,” while Sergio Perez reflected: “Only when you see those things do you believe the danger we go into.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMax Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton’s Silverstone collision — and that\n\nView 6 Images Max Verstappen's car is loaded onto a truck after his crash with Lewis Hamilton in Silverstone in 2021 (Image: Sutton Images)\n\nWorld Champ Max Verstappen and his rivalries know no end, with another one for the books playing out in Drive to Survive’s fourth season, this time between seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton and the Flying Dutchman.\n\nThe enthralling battle between the titular protagonists of season four came to a head in Silverstone, where the two collided on lap 1 itself with Verstappen suffering a 51G hit as he flew into the barriers at 180mph.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHamilton had made contact with Verstappen’s mean machine at the infamous Copse corner at the British Grand Prix and the collision led to the Dutchman being taken to the hospital for checks.\n\nVerstappen later admitted that he had raced with blurred vision in a few races after the collision with a quote in the Red Bulletin: “Since my Silverstone crash, I've struggled with visibility problems, especially on undulating circuits or those with lots of advertising boards on the side of the track. In this race, I wasn't just fighting against Lewis, but also against blurred images.”\n\nSpeaking about the collision, Hamilton had said at the time: “If you don’t go for a gap, you may as well stop racing.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe dramatic season finally culminated in Verstappen clinching his first‑ever Formula 1 World Championship after winning the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix — a finale that saw him defeat Hamilton for the coveted title on the final lap after a (highly contentious) Safety Car restart.\n\nLewis Hamilton’s bombshell announcement in season 7\n\nView 6 Images Lewis Hamilton created shockwaves worldwide with his Ferrari announcement (Image: PA)\n\nHaving raced with Mercedes since 2013 and winning six out of his seven World Championship titles with them — Lewis Hamilton actually leaving the Silver Arrows was on no one’s bingo cards, ever.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSo we don’t exaggerate when we say that Drive to Survive Season 7’s most dramatic moment was most definitely Hamilton’s bombshell pre-season announcement that he was leaving Toto Wolff’s team’s friendly ranks for the legacy red of the Scuderia for the 2025 season.\n\nTackled in the first episode itself, Netflix was able to capture some thrilling behind-the-scenes moments from the fallout of the announcement, even finding themselves in the room when Toto and Hamilton reunite onscreen after the announcement at the Mercedes car launch.\n\nRaw and unfiltered comments from Toto regarding the switch and Mercedes’ future plans feature in Episode 1 and 3, with the Mercedes Team Principal questioning the timing of Hamilton’s move and even discussing the potential poaching of Verstappen with his wife and current managing director of the F1 Academy, Susie Wolff.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nToto can be heard saying: “I haven’t talked to him [Verstappen], because I promised Lewis not to talk to him, but I will have the conversation now.”\n\nUltimately the coveted Mercedes seat goes to Kimi Antonelli, the teenager and his family’s joy caught square on Netflix’s lens when he is informed. Hamilton’s Ferrari move also meant fan-favourite Carlos Sainz lost his seat with the Scuderia, prompting his eventual move to Williams (another gripping season seven storyline — and one of our favourite subplots).\n\nCharles Leclerc’s home race ‘curse’ and emotional Monza win in Season 7\n\nView 6 Images Charles Leclerc's Monza win in Season 7 was one of the most emotional moments of the show (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSeason 7’s Episode 5 titled ‘Le Curse of Leclerc’ takes us behind the scenes with Formula 1’s mega talented softboy Charles Leclerc.\n\nOne of the most emotionally rousing episodes in Drive to Survive’s loaded history, it gives us a closer glimpse into the life of Leclerc — something fans of the seemingly introverted motorsport champ can’t help but cherish.\n\nTaking a closer look at his unfortunate run in all his home races at Monaco during his almost 9-year long career, Drive to Survive gives us one of the most emotionally charged moments of the show when Leclerc finally clinches the trophy that has been eluding him for so long.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nTender moments with friends and family are shown throughout the episode, including a lovely moment with Leclerc getting an at-home haircut from his mom and speaking about his late father and his F1 aspirations for him.\n\nIn a quintessential ‘I’m not crying, you’re crying’ moment as a viewer — Leclerc finally gets his hands on the Monza trophy after an electric drive in his home race, telling the cameras: “I definitely did not only realise my dream, but my father’s dream. He’s probably celebrating it from above.”\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Now 30 years since the Dallas Cowboys' last Super Bowl appearance, owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he has let the fans down with his team's championship drought.\n\n\"I really can't accept just the thought of winning one Super Bowl and then what?\" Jones said Friday night from the NFL scouting combine. \"I've got more time on my clock than that in my mind. And so I don't see it that way. I see a chance to put a team together and basically be knocking at the edge and get another one or get a chance at a another one.\n\n\"It runs that way in my view. ... Make no mistake about it now, if you told me I could, because I've done a lot of hitchhiking in my life. ... I'd start here with you right now and hitchhike back to Dallas to win a Super Bowl.\"\n\nAfter a 7-9-1 finish in 2025, Jones promised change. One change will be the team's approach to free agency.\n\nThe Cowboys have not relied heavily on free agency in years, choosing to pick their spots to shore up holes on the roster with cost-effective players.\n\n\"I would bet that we will spend more money in free agency than we have,\" Jones said.\n\nTo do so, the Cowboys will first have to create salary cap room. Well over the $301.2 million cap that was set Friday, they will restructure the contracts of quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and left guard Tyler Smith, which will create $66 million of room.\n\nJones said the Cowboys will rework the contracts of defensive tackles Kenny Clark, Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa, who are scheduled to count around $63 million against the cap. With Clark and Williams, the Cowboys can look to add voidable years to their contracts then restructure that way.\n\n\"I want you to know that the only way to push more [out] is for me to go borrow some of my future, OK?\" Jones said. \"Expect me to go borrow some of my future.\"\n\nTo Jones, it goes beyond his personal Super Bowl wishes.\n\n\"I look at where we are with Dak and I look at where he is in his career. And I look at some of the pluses that we have on our front and what we think we can do there. And what we can do with [George] Pickens and Lamb and what we can do with our running back that we just signed [Javonte Williams],\" Jones said. \"And so all of those things I want to do everything we possibly can to stop somebody and to basically win some third downs more than we did last year. And so I think that would be the area that you would see me bust the budget. Where you would see me do that is what we're doing defensively.\n\n\"And I would expect anybody that's a Cowboy fan or a critic of the Cowboys to say, 'Duh, that's not hard to see, Jerry, to do.' But I guess what I'm doing is saying, yes, I intend to do that if given the opportunity.\"\n\nThe Cowboys defense finished at or near the bottom of the league in yards and points allowed in 2025. Christian Parker has been hired as the new defensive coordinator, and Jones acknowledged the need for more than just one or two new players, while also saying players that were on the defense in 2025 will be better in 2026 \"because the situation has changed.\"\n\nWith two first-round picks, the Cowboys have an opportunity to add more talent to their defense. Jones would not rule out the possibility of making trades, like the additions of Williams from the New York Jets and Clark from the Green Bay Packers for Micah Parsons.\n\n\"I don't know that I'd expect it but we have the ammunition to be good at it,\" Jones said. \"And I wouldn't hesitate to be good at it if it will help our team and help the timeline that we're talking about.\"\n\nNow 83, Jones was introspective at times during the hourlong meeting with reporters. His resolve to win a championship is strong.\n\n\"It's every bit the prize of anything I have, with the exception of family and your love for family,\" Jones said. \"I guess what I would say is make no mistake about it, I don't have a higher priority than to go and win a Super Bowl.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nBOSTON -- The Celtics have been one of the NBA's hottest teams since returning from the All-Star break.\n\nThey can add one of the best offensive performances in league history to their list of accomplishments as they await a possible return of star Jayson Tatum to action.\n\nBoston shot a season-high 66.7% (52-of-78) from the field in their 148-111 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Friday. Including the playoffs, it was the club's third-highest percentage in a game in the shot clock era (since 1954-55), behind 67.9% in 1984 and 67.0% in 1990, according to ESPN Research.\n\nThe Celtics also shot 64.7% from the 3-point line Friday, which equated to an 80.8% effective field goal percentage -- the highest in the shot clock era. Effective field goal percentage measures shooting efficiency by adjusting for the fact that 3-pointers are worth more than two-point shots\n\nAll-Star Jaylen Brown led the way, finishing with 28 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. But he got plenty of support from his teammates, with trade deadline acquisition Nikola Vucevic adding 28 points and 11 rebounds for his third double-double as a member of the Celtics.\n\n\"I thought we just did a good job reading the game,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"I thought we made the right reads throughout most of the entire game.

So it's just another step,\" Tatum said. \"I don't know percentage. I just know I feel a little bit better every day. I just try to focus on that.\"\n\nTatum said in the same interview that he is also mindful of not wanting to disrupt the progress of a Celtics team that at 39-20 sits in second place in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\n\"I'm just hyper aware of what's going on. I think it would just stem from that. Obviously, I know what I bring to the table and bring to the team. But I'm also aware that these guys have been playing extremely well,\" Tatum said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

Miami extended the best start in program history and added to its school record for wins in a season. Miami also boasts the best start and longest win streak in MAC annals.\n\nMiami is also just the fourth Division I team in the past 20 years to enter March unbeaten, according to ESPN Research.

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe Women's National Basketball Players Association submitted a new counterproposal to the WNBA on Friday evening with some concessions on revenue share and housing, a source familiar with the collective bargaining negotiations told ESPN.\n\nIn the new CBA proposal, the players' union is asking for players to receive 26% of gross revenue (defined as revenue before deducting expenses) over the lifetime of the agreement, with the salary cap in Year 1 of the deal (about $9.5 million) unchanged from its previous offer.\n\nThe revenue share split is down from 27.5% of gross revenue as proposed in the WNBPA's Feb. 17 proposal, a change that a source said amounts to nearly $100 million in reductions on revenue share.\n\nThe new proposal also contains tweaks to the union's housing offerings: Previously, the players asked that teams continue to provide housing to players in the first several years of the new deal, but that in later years, teams will no longer be obligated to provide it for players making at least 80% of the maximum salary, on multiyear deals and receiving full salary protection.\n\nIn the new proposal, the union struck the multiyear component and lowered the salary threshold to 75% at which players would no longer be obligated to receive team-provided housing.\n\nThe two sides are still negotiating the years of service limit for developmental players -- a new feature of this CBA with each team now expected to have two developmental player spots. The union is now proposing a years of service limit of six after originally asking for no experience limit for those players, a source said, whereas the league's latest proposal suggested a limit of four or five years of service based on minutes played.\n\nThe WNBPA's counterproposal comes one week after the league submitted one of its own. That Feb. 20 league proposal guaranteed housing for all players in 2026 before being phased out in subsequent years of the deal. Players on their applicable minimum salary and those with zero years of service would be provided a one-bedroom apartment in 2027 and 2028 only, and developmental players would be provided studio apartments for the entirety of the deal.\n\nBut the two sides are still far apart on the issue of revenue sharing, including proposing different revenue sharing systems: The WNBA has held firm in its proposals, with players being offered on average over 70% of net revenue (revenue after deducting expenses), which would amount to less than 15% of gross revenue. The 2026 salary cap would come in at $5.65 million (up from $1.5 million in 2025) and in subsequent years would grow in line with revenue growth.\n\nThe league's proposal features maximum salaries, including revenue sharing payouts, amounting to nearly $1.3 million in 2026 and projecting to approach $2 million in 2031. The supermax in 2025 came in at $249,000. The average player salary, including revenue sharing, would be projected to reach $540,000 in 2026 and $780,000 by 2031, up from $120,000 in 2025.\n\nThe WNBA publicly struck down the WNBPA's previous proposal as \"unrealistic\" and \"caus[ing] hundreds of millions of dollars of losses for our teams.\" A source familiar with the negotiations told ESPN the league projected that Feb. 17 plan would result in losses of $460 million over the lifetime of the agreement, though the union has maintained its revenue sharing model would still put the league in a \"profitable position,\" another source said.\n\nEarlier this week, the league gave its teams and the WNBPA a target date of March 10 to complete a term sheet, or else the schedule for the 2026 season might be impacted."

Spohr was killed, and Wood survived, though she died a year after the shooting.\n\nPlacer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said in a statement Friday that Spohr and Wood were loving grandparents and that Serafini's crimes greatly impacted family members and friends.\n\n\"The impact of this attack has extended far beyond the immediate victims, deeply affecting family members and the broader community, and highlighting the lasting harm caused by deliberate violence,\" Gire said.\n\nSerafini's attorney did not return requests for comment.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Serafini addressed the court and maintained his innocence, according to MyNews4. He said he was out partying with his wife the night of the shooting and described himself as a \"broken, imperfect man that makes mistakes.\"\n\nSerafini was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 1992. In a career spanning 11 years, the left-hander played for the Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies.\n\nProsecutors said Serafini hated his wife's wealthy parents and was heard saying he was willing to pay $20,000 to have them killed, according to the Sacramento Bee. Prosecutors showed jurors transcripts of angry emails and text messages between Serafini and his in-laws.\n\nDuring the six-week trial, Serafini's attorney, David Dratman, argued that there was no physical evidence linking his client to the crime scene. Dratman told the jury that although Serafini had a rocky relationship with his in-laws, he did not have a motive to kill them.\n\nAfter his conviction, Serafini filed multiple motions for a new trial, but those were denied.\n\nSerafini will serve his sentence at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the Placer County District Attorney's Office."

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Dr Kwabena Bempah Tandoh, a former Deputy Director-General of the Ghana Education Service (GES), has finally put to rest the long-standing public scepticism regarding the educational background of the NPP’s Ashanti Regional Chairman, Bernard Antwi Boasiako, popularly known as Chairman Wontumi.\n\nFor years, social media and political circles have buzzed with debate over whether Chairman Wuntomi truly walked the hallowed halls of the Kumasi-based school as he claims.\n\nBut Dr Tandoh, speaking with the authority of a fellow 'Amanfour' (as Prempeh College alumni are known), ended the conjecture by revealing that their bond dates back to their very first year.\n\nSpeaking on JoyNews’ Personality Profile on Friday, February 27, Dr Tandoh provided a definitive eyewitness account of Wontumi’s time at the prestigious Prempeh College, revealing that the two were not only in the same year group but also shared the same sleeping quarters.\n\nDorm 7: The shared history\n\n“I know in this country people are always wondering whether Wontumi went to Prempeh College. Wontumi was my mate. We went into Form One together. Not only was he my classmate, but he was actually my dorm mate,” Dr Tandoh revealed.\n\nThe duo belonged to Aggrey House, where they specifically shared Dorm 7, a period Dr Tandoh credits for developing \"great friendships\" that have sustained them into their professional adult lives.\n\nDr Tandoh has not only cleared the air on a piece of political trivia but has also underscored the enduring influence of Ghana's traditional secondary school brotherhoods in national life.\n\nThe ‘Amanfoo’ spirit: A house built on loyalty\n\nBeyond settling the Wontumi debate, Dr Tandoh used the platform to highlight the unique and intense loyalty shared by alumni of the school. He described an environment where seniority is respected regardless of age and where support for one another is unconditional.\n\nRecounting a remarkable personal experience, Dr Tandoh shared how a senior colleague he had never met before facilitated his relocation to Ghana from the diaspora.\n\n“When I was relocating to Ghana, my first home that I moved into, the entire one-year rent was paid for by a senior I didn’t know... He left Prempeh College some 15 years before I went there,” he shared.\n\nThe senior, identified as Senior Poku-Agyemang, not only secured a home for Dr Tandoh’s wife and children but also provided him with a car and fully paid insurance for a year.\n\nLessons beyond the classroom\n\nFor Dr Tandoh, the Prempeh College experience was defined by a philosophy of collective growth rather than individual success. He noted that the institution taught him to be \"focused on growing people around me and supporting things around me.\"\n\nThe bond between the Amanfuo, he suggests, is a powerful social network that transcends political and professional boundaries.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Violent scenes erupted at the Kasoa Old Market in the Awutu Senya East Municipality on Friday, February 27, as an aggrieved mob turned their frustrations on emergency responders during a devastating fire outbreak.\n\nWhile two container shops were being razed to the ground, a team from the Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS) was met with a hail of stones, resulting in significant damage to a fire tender and the disruption of life-saving operations.\n\nThe incident has once again brought the dire state of firefighting equipment in the municipality into sharp focus, with local stations reportedly unable to respond due to broken-down machinery.\n\nWhile no casualties were reported, the total loss of goods in the two shops has left traders in despair.\n\nThe fire, the cause of which remains under investigation, started in the heart of the market, quickly engulfing two metal container shops. As the flames intensified, residents were horrified to learn that neither the Kasoa nor the Budumburam fire stations could deploy their tenders.\n\nDO Addo Danso, the Weija Fire Station Administrator, confirmed the systemic failure that led to the delayed arrival of help. He explained that a crew had to be dispatched all the way from Weija to fill the vacuum left by the non-operational local units.\n\n“All the fire tenders stationed at both Kasoa and Budumburam were not operational at the time of the incident,” DO Addo Danso revealed, explaining the logistical nightmare that triggered the community's anger. Violence against the 'First Responders'\n\nUpon their arrival, the Weija crew were not greeted as saviours but as targets. Local youth, incensed by what they perceived as a lethargic response, allegedly attacked the firefighters. Stones were pelted at the moving vehicle, successfully shattering the windscreen and forcing the officers to navigate both the inferno and a hostile crowd.\n\nDespite the assault, the team managed to deploy their hoses and eventually brought the blaze under control, preventing a wider catastrophe in the densely packed market.\n\nCondemnation and police hunt\n\nThe Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) for Awutu Senya East, Seth Serwono Banini, visited the scene to assess the damage and expressed absolute disgust at the treatment of the officers. He has formally tasked the police to track down the individuals behind the assault.\n\n“I urge residents, especially the youth, to desist from the act of attacking security personnel on duty,” the MCE stated, reinforcing that such actions only endanger the lives of the entire community during emergencies.\n\nDO Addo Danso further confirmed that the GNFS is not taking the matter lightly and will seek criminal prosecution for the damage caused to state property.\n\n“We are going to make an official complaint to the police so that they can arrest some of the culprits,” he added.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

This growth was propelled by a near-tripling of digital revenue and robust gains in the mobile money and data sectors, reflecting Ghana’s rapidly maturing digital economy.\n\nIn a move that will delight investors, the Board of Directors has recommended a final dividend of GH¢0.40 per share. This represents a significant increase from the GH¢0.24 paid out the previous year, signaling deep confidence in the company’s liquidity and future growth path.\n\nPending shareholder approval at the next Annual General Meeting, the dividend is slated for distribution on 10 April 2026.\n\nIn his review of the year, MTN Ghana CEO Stephen Blewett attributed the financial windfall to a combination of heavy infrastructure spending and a friendly economic backdrop.\n\n\"MTN Ghana reported a strong operational and financial performance for 2025, driven by the significant investment in our network and targeted commercial initiatives that have enhanced the customer experience,\" Blewett remarked.\n\nHe further observed that the broader economic recovery played a crucial role: \"These results were achieved in a favourable macroeconomic climate, with subsiding inflation and a strengthened local currency boosting consumer purchasing power.\n\nTo sustain this growth, MTN Ghana committed GH¢6.4 billion in capital expenditure during the year. This investment was primarily directed at bolstering 4G coverage and improving overall service quality to support a burgeoning subscriber base. Total mobile subscribers now stand at 31.2 million, with active data users jumping to 19.9 million.\n\nAs the company transitions out of its \"Ambition 2025\" strategic cycle, the leadership team remains bullish on the medium-term horizon. The company has maintained its guidance for service revenue growth in the \"mid-to-upper thirties\" per cent range.\n\n\"Looking ahead to 2026, MTN Ghana is well-positioned to capitalise on Ghana's improving macroeconomic environment. Building on 2025's performance and operational agility, we will continue to deliver value to our stakeholders,\" Blewett concluded.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

That’s why we were thrilled to join hands with the Greater Accra School Feeding Coordinator and the amazing cooks who fuel the future of our nation.”\n\nMr Ocran explained that the engagement forms part of a broader strategy to channel and supply schools with organic, healthy and locally produced chicken.\n\n“By working directly with the school feeding programme, we are not only ensuring our children get the best nutrition but also empowering our local farmers and reducing our reliance on imported poultry.”\n\nHe further encouraged stakeholders to support the initiative, stressing that the programme seeks to build a sustainable future, one healthy meal at a time.\n\n'Nkoko Nkitinkiti'\n\n'Nkoko Nkitinkiti' is a flagship agricultural initiative launched by the Government of Ghana in November 2025.\n\nUnder the broader Feed Ghana Programme, it aims to revitalise the domestic poultry industry, improve food security, and reduce the country’s high annual expenditure (over $300 million) on imported chicken.\n\nKey Objectives and Components:\n\nImport Reduction: Aims to cut down Ghana's massive chicken import bill and save foreign exchange.\n\nJob Creation: Targets economic empowerment for approximately 55,000 households and thousands of young people nationwide.\n\nHealth and Safety: Promotes \"fresh Ghanaian-grown chicken\" over imported options that may use growth hormones or GMOs.\n\nTwo-Pronged Approach: Anchor Farmer Programme: 50 commercial farmers aim to produce 4 million birds annually. Household Initiative: Distributed to everyday spaces like homes and schools, where individual households raise smaller batches of birds (e.g., 50–500 per year).\n\n\n\nImplementation Details\n\nBeneficiary Support: Participants receive essential inputs, including day-old chicks, high-quality feed, and veterinary services.\n\nInfrastructure: The government is establishing Farmer Service Centres in agricultural districts and plans to build modern processing plants, such as one in Bechem, Bono Region.\n\nCurrent Progress: As of February 2026, the programme has begun distributing birds in regions like Ashanti, with targets to scale production to over 7 million chicks.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "A legal showdown has commenced at the Supreme Court as a farmer from Techiman, Mariam Alhassan, has filed a landmark suit to strike down the government’s stringent regulatory framework for industrial cannabis cultivation.\n\nThe plaintiff is seeking to invoke the original jurisdiction of the apex court to declare the current licensing fees and entry requirements unconstitutional, arguing they are designed to exclude ordinary Ghanaians from the emerging multi-billion-dollar industry.\n\nThe suit, filed at the Supreme Court on Friday, February 27, names the Ministry for the Interior, the Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC), the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, and the Attorney-General as defendants.\n\n“The Defendants acted unfairly and in breach of legitimate expectation by imposing materially higher... fees without reasonable accommodation of the consultative process,” the filing states, noting that the government failed to provide a tiered system that would allow smaller enterprises to enter the market.\n\nAt the heart of the legal challenge is the claim that the government has imposed \"materially higher, unscaled, and cumulative fees\" that make it impossible for smallholder farmers to participate in the legal hemp trade.\n\nMadam Alhassan argues that these fees violate Article 23 of the 1992 Constitution, which guarantees administrative justice and fair treatment.\n\nThe plaintiff contends that despite extensive stakeholder consultations where \"proportionate, tiered, and risk-based regulation\" was advocated, the authorities ignored these recommendations in favour of an extortionate fee structure.\n\nReliefs sought\n\nIn the Supreme Court filing, Mariam Alhassan (the Plaintiff) seeks the following reliefs against the Defendants:\n\nA declaration that the industrial hemp licensing framework established under section 43 of the Narcotics Control Commission Act, 2020 (Act 1019), as amended, and L.I. 2475, is inconsistent with Articles 17, 23, 36, and 296 of the 1992 Constitution. This is due to its \"irrational design, exclusionary economic effect, and disproportionate exercise of administrative discretion\".\n\nA declaration that the high licence fees (up to USD 45,000 per hectare), annual regulatory levies, and percentage-based charges constitute the imposition of de facto taxes. The Plaintiff argues this violates Article 174, which grants taxing power exclusively to Parliament.\n\nA declaration that the requirement for narcotics-style transport permits and armed security escorts for industrial hemp (containing no more than 0.3% THC) is irrational and arbitrary.\n\nAn order for the Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC) and other relevant ministries to reconsider and redesign the framework to be constitutionally compliant. This redesign must include: Tiered, scaled, and risk-based licence fees. Elimination of narcotics-style transport and escort controls unless objectively justified. Removal of unscaled, cumulative, and USD-denominated fee structures that exclude ordinary Ghanaian citizens.\n\nAn interim order to restrain the enforcement of the challenged fees, levies, and transport/escort requirements until the framework is made compliant.\n\nAny further orders or directions the Court deems fit to safeguard inclusive economic participation and the rule of law.\n\nDetails of the suit\n\nMariam Alhassan, based in the Bono East Region, represents a growing movement of local farmers who view industrial hemp as a transformative cash crop for the middle belt of Ghana. The suit highlights that industrial hemp (cannabis with low THC levels) is a vital raw material for textiles, construction, and medicine, yet the current \"unscaled fees\" effectively bar local agriculturalists from the supply chain.\n\nThe filing raises several critical questions regarding economic governance and the directive principles of state policy:\n\n\"If imported hemp goods circulate normally, can domestic production of the same non-narcotic material rationally be treated as a high-risk narcotics activity?\"\n\nThe plaintiff argues that the difference creates:\n\n• economic exclusion (Article 17)\n\n• irrational administrative action (Articles 23 & 296)\n\n• potential frustration of economic participation goals (Article 36)\n\n• and possibly de facto taxation through licensing (Article 174).\n\nConsumers face almost no unusual hurdles, but Ghanaian producers face many.\n\nThat mismatch between the free entry of finished hemp goods and the heavy restriction of local hemp cultivation is the constitutional tension at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe plaintiff is of the view that if a hemp product is imported into Ghana, such as a hemp body scrub, lotion, oil, or cosmetic containing ≤0.3% THC, such goods typically enter the country through ordinary commercial channels because they are treated as finished consumer goods, not narcotic substances.\n\nHowever, if a Ghanaian farmer produces industrial hemp of the same grade (≤0.3% THC — the same non-psychoactive material), the activity shifts from product regulation to narcotics-administration regulation under the current framework.\n\nThe hurdles identified by the plaintiff include:\n\nHigh entry licensing\n\nA Ghanaian producer must obtain:\n\n• cultivation licence\n\n• application approvals\n\n• background/security vetting\n\n• compliance clearances\n\nWith fees reaching tens of thousands of USD per hectare in some categories.\n\nUSD-denominated fees create a structural barrier for local farmers operating in cedis.\n\n• Payments tied to U.S. dollars\n\n• Exposure to exchange-rate fluctuations\n\n• Costs unrelated to farming risk or yield\n\nAnnual regulatory levies\n\nEven after paying licence fees:\n\n• recurring annual charges (e.g., percentage of licence value)\n\n• payable regardless of production success or market conditions.\n\nLayered licensing across the value chain\n\nSeparate permissions may be required, with each attracting additional fees for:\n\n• cultivation\n\n• processing\n\n• storage\n\n• transport\n\n• export\n\n• research or testing\n\nTransport permits\n\nMoving harvested hemp within Ghana may require:\n\n• official transport authorization\n\n• pre-approved logistics arrangements.\n\nSecurity / escort requirements\n\nTransport may involve:\n\n• supervised or escorted movement\n\n• additional security costs\n\nControls typically associated with controlled narcotics.\n\nSecurity bonds and compliance costs\n\nFinancial guarantees may be required before operations begin.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Investigators are reportedly looking into the kingpins behind the Ntoranang operation, as the scale of equipment suggests significant financial backing.\n\n“All 38 suspects are currently in custody, assisting with investigations and are expected to be arraigned before the court on Monday, March 2, 2026, for prosecution,” a police statement confirmed.\n\nSecurity officials revealed a troubling demographic breakdown of those taken into custody. Of the 38 individuals arrested, nearly half are foreign nationals, highlighting the international dimensions of the illegal mining surge in the Eastern Region.\n\nNationality: 17 suspects are Burkinabe nationals, while the remaining 21 are Ghanaians.\n\n17 suspects are Burkinabe nationals, while the remaining 21 are Ghanaians. Vulnerable Populations: Most alarmingly, nine of the suspects are juveniles, aged between just 13 and 17 years.\n\nThe presence of children at the site has sparked fresh concerns regarding child labour and the exploitation of minors in high-risk environmental crimes.\n\nThe police did not only focus on personnel but moved to permanently disable the site's operational capacity. Intelligence had suggested that the miners were using high-powered machinery to wash gold within the plantation, leading to significant soil and water degradation.\n\nOfficers on the scene successfully seized and subsequently destroyed a vast array of illegal mining items, including:\n\nWater pumping machines used for high-pressure washing.\n\nIndustrial power plants providing electricity to the remote site.\n\nExtensive networks of water hoses.\n\nMultiple makeshift shelters that served as living quarters for the workforce.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The National Democratic Congress (NDC) has criticised Mohammed Umar Sanda, a former party stalwart now contesting the Ayawaso East by-election as an independent candidate.\n\nWith the polls scheduled for Tuesday, 3rd March 2026, the party hierarchy has dismissed Sanda’s rebellion as a political suicide mission, insisting his influence has evaporated following his \"automatic\" expulsion from the party.\n\nSpeaking on Citi FM on Friday, 27th February 2026, the NDC’s Greater Accra Regional Organiser, Anthony Nukpenu, revealed that the party had previously attempted to de-escalate the situation through internal counselling, but Sanda had ultimately \"shot himself in the foot\".\n\nNukpenu did not mince words regarding the independent candidate’s electoral prospects. Despite Sanda’s previous standing within the local structure, the Regional Organiser predicted that the rebel candidate would fail to secure even a 2 per cent share of the total voter turnout.\n\nInstead, the NDC is doubling down on its endorsed candidate, Mohammed Baba Jamal Ahmed, with a targeted victory margin of at least 75 per cent.\n\n“Umar Sanda is not a threat. All we were trying to do was to talk to our brother—you must have ambition, but don’t be overambitious. Now that he has chosen this route, he has lost his heritage,” Nukpenu declared.\n\nSanda’s transition from a party loyalist to an independent challenger has come with immediate and severe professional consequences. Following his formal declaration to contest against the NDC’s chosen representative, the party’s General Secretary, Fifi Fiavi Kwetey, issued a directive on 17th February 2026, officially revoking Sanda’s membership.\n\nUnder the NDC’s strict internal regulations, the act of running against an endorsed candidate results in the automatic nullification of membership. Furthermore, the party has issued a legal warning prohibiting Sanda from leveraging the NDC’s \"intellectual property\", including:\n\nThe NDC leadership has also sent a clear message to its rank and file: any executive or member found providing logistical or moral support to Sanda’s \"rebel\" campaign will face immediate disciplinary action.\n\nThis internal crackdown is designed to present a unified front as the by-election enters its final 72 hours.\n\nWhile Sanda attempts to frame his candidacy as a grassroots alternative, the NDC is positioning the vote as a test of loyalty to the party's heritage and its national agenda, as outlined by President John Dramani Mahama in his recent State of the Nation Address.\n\nAs the people of Ayawaso East prepare to head to the polls this Tuesday, the atmosphere remains charged. The NDC’s strategy of total isolation for Sanda aims to ensure that the seat remains firmly within the party’s grasp, maintaining its legislative strength.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Panama: A resilient side that adds a dynamic challenge to the pool.\n\nThe President highlighted that the selection of Bryant University as a base camp provides the perfect environment for the squad to emulate the legendary 2010 quarter-final run, which remains the gold standard for African football.\n\nWhile the President’s address was filled with optimism for on-field glory, he issued a stern and detailed \"call to responsibility\" to the thousands of supporters planning to travel to the United States, Mexico, and Canada.\n\nHe revealed that the current five-year non-immigrant visa status enjoyed by Ghanaians was the result of exhaustive diplomatic negotiations and must not be jeopardised by fans seeking to overstay their welcome.\n\n“Mr Speaker, supporters and other people interested in going to support their team would have to submit a visa request to the American Embassy. We are being told that we must ensure that supporters who go return on their visits,” the President cautioned.\n\nHe underscored the high stakes involved in maintaining international compliance: “It has taken a lot of work to restore Ghana's five-year non-immigrant visa and take us off the ban list. It is my hope that this event will not send thousands of Ghanaians to America and get us back on the ban list.”\n\nThe President argued that a successful World Cup campaign transcends football, acting as a catalyst for tourism and foreign investment. By maintaining a disciplined presence in the stands and a winning performance on the pitch, Ghana aims to solidify its reputation as a \"Gateway to Africa.\"\n\nAs the Black Stars prepare to move into their Rhode Island headquarters, the President’s message was clear: the pursuit of glory must be matched by a commitment to the rule of law.\n\n“We are being told that we must ensure that supporters who go [to the tournament] return on the visas,” he reminded the house, stressing that every Ghanaian traveller acts as an ambassador for the Republic.\n\nWith the tournament just months away, the nation remains on a knife-edge of excitement, hopeful that 2026 will be the year the Black Stars finally break the \"glass ceiling\" of the semi-finals while upholding the integrity of the Ghanaian passport.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

The two footballers were subsequently arrested and have been on remand since.\n\n\n\nHowever, a close associate of the accused has disputed the allegations. Speaking to Angel Sports, the associate claimed the encounter was consensual and alleged that the woman was a commercial sex worker.\n\n\n\nAccording to this account, one of the players had paid her for sexual services, after which the second player also engaged her.\n\n\n\nThe associate further claimed that a dispute arose over payment, alleging that one of the men had made promises he was unable to fully meet, although part payment was reportedly made.\n\n\n\nThe case has drawn attention in Ghana, with the families of the two men appealing to the Government of Ghana, the Ghana Football Association, and other stakeholders for assistance to secure legal support and facilitate their release.\n\n\n\nThe matter is expected to return to court on March 19, 2026, nearly three years after the arrests, as both sides prepare to present their case."

            "content": "President Mahama delivered the State of the Nation Address on Friday, February 27, 2026\n\nThe Operation Recover All Loot (ORAL) anti-corruption initiative was one of the major campaign promises of President John Dramani Mahama, aimed at recovering all monies stolen from the state by political appointees.\n\nIn his first State of the Nation Address, President Mahama mentioned ORAL three times, noting the number of corruption-related cases the ORAL committee has submitted to him, which he subsequently forwarded to his Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine.\n\n\n\n“I also pledged to fight corruption head-on by implementing Operation Recover All Loot (ORAL). In that regard, Mr Speaker, one of the first committees I established, even before my investiture as President, was to establish the ORAL committee on the sidelines of the transition committee.\n\n\n\n“It is instructive to announce that the committee received over two thousand (2,000) complaints and has since submitted a comprehensive report. The report has been handed over to the Attorney General for further review, thorough investigation, and eventual prosecution.\n\n\n\n“The recent arrests related to the unwarranted payment of Two Million US Dollars in the Skytrain saga and the National Service ghost names scandal mark only the beginning of a comprehensive response based on the ORAL Committee’s findings,” the President said in his 2025 SONA.\n\n\n\nAbout a year down the line, even though there are a number of prosecutions on ORAL cases ongoing, including the National Service scandal, the Adu Bohen NSB case and the Sky Train case, the President appears to be taking a softer tone on the initiative.\n\nPresident Mahama, in his 2026 SONA, did not even mention ORAL, even though he hinted at a section of Ghanaians being disappointed by the ‘slow pace’ of the initiative.\n\n\n\nMahama assured that the people who have stolen from the state will be brought to book, insisting that the right processes must be followed in that quest.\n\n\n\nHe warned against rushed proceedings, where actions might lead to wrongful conviction, as was seen in past administrations.\n\n\n\nBelow are his exact words:\n\n\n\nMr Speaker, the Government remains resolute that corruption will not be tolerated, regardless of status or political affiliation. The Attorney General’s Office will continue to use both criminal prosecution and non-conviction-based asset recovery mechanisms to ensure that stolen public resources are returned for national development.\n\nI understand that a large majority of Ghanaians are impatient to see those who abused their trust in office held to account.\n\n\n\nThere were periods when, under military regimes and unconstitutional governments,\n\n\n\nextrajudicial means could be used to exact retribution against persons perceived as corrupt or who had abused the public trust. This may have appeared as swift justice, but many regrettable\n\n\n\nexcesses were recorded.\n\n\n\nIn 1992, we overwhelmingly adopted the 1992 Constitution to accept governance by the rule of law. On 7th January 2025, I swore before the people of Ghana to uphold the 1992 Constitution.\n\nI may be as impatient as everyone else to see justice done, but painstaking investigations must be conducted, dockets must be prepared, charges must be filed, and the accused must have their day in court, including appealing even the smallest points of law to higher courts.\n\n\n\nThis process is necessary to protect us all against abuse or ill-treatment of citizens and to ensure that only those guilty of offences against the state are punished.\n\n\n\nAs President Mills of blessed memory said, “The wheels of Justice grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine.”\n\n\n\nFULL TEXT: The 2026 State of the Nation Address\n\n\n\nBAI\n\nWatch NPP MPs in all-black as President Mahama delivers 2026 SONA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe didn't arrest the dollar, we strengthened the cedi to fight other currencies - Mahama"

The Assin South MP did not hesitate to extend pleasantries to him as well, humorously referring to Asiedu Nketiah as “His Excellency.”\n\n\n\nThe banter did not end there. Spotting the cocoa pod in Ntim Fordjour’s hand, Asiedu Nketiah teased him, saying, “Do you know cocoa is the symbol of UP… and there’s UP in town?”\n\n\n\nThe statement was intended as a playful jab, but it appeared the NDC National Chairman may have mixed up party symbols in the process.\n\n\n\nThe United Progressive Party (UP) is, in fact, symbolised by a butterfly, while the cocoa symbol belongs to the Ghana Freedom Party (GFP), founded by the late Akua Donkor.\n\n\n\nThe easygoing moment stood in contrast to what had unfolded earlier in the day inside the Chamber.\n\n\n\nMinority Members of Parliament had turned up in coordinated black outfits as they staged a protest during the President’s address.\n\n\n\nClad in black attire and matching kente sashes, the Minority Caucus, led by Minority Leader Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin, registered their dissent as President Mahama entered the House to fulfil his constitutional duty under Article 67 of the 1992 Constitution.\n\n\n\nThe protest carried a specific message. The sashes worn by the New Patriotic Party MPs bore the inscription “Cocoa Akuafo Yayɛ Mobo Dodo,” a Twi phrase translated to mean that “cocoa farmers have become so pitiful.”\n\n\n\nThe inscription was a direct reference to the recent reduction in the farmgate price of cocoa announced by the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD).\n\n\n\nWatch the video below:\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the heartwarming moment as Gizella Tetteh, Rev Ntim Fordjour, and Asiedu Nketia exchange pleasantries after SONA2026\n\nA playful jab from Asiedu Nketia to Rev.

Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

Kim’s young daughter, wearing a brown leather coat similar to her father’s, was also seen handling a weapon.\n\nSince first appearing in public at a long-range missile test in November 2022, the girl – believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and about 13 years old – has accompanied her father to a growing number of events, including military demonstrations, factory openings and a trip to Beijing in September, where Kim Jong Un held his first summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in six years.\n\n\n\nThe party congress, which concluded on Wednesday with a military parade in the capital, Pyongyang, after seven days, is North Korea’s most significant political event, held every five years since 2016, and a carefully choreographed spectacle glorifying Kim’s leadership before some 5,000 delegates.\n\nAt this year’s meetings, Kim reiterated his plans to accelerate North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, which already is equipped with various weapons systems threatening the US and its allies in Asia, and confirmed his hardline view of rival South Korea.\n\nEarlier this week, Kim dismissed dialogue with South Korea, claiming his forces could “completely destroy” his southern neighbour, while signalling that the future of talks with the US required Washington to discard “hostile” policies towards Pyongyang.\n\nIf Washington “respects our country’s current status as stipulated in the Constitution … and withdraws its hostile policy … there is no reason why we cannot get along well with the United States”, Kim said on Wednesday, as the country wrapped up the week of meetings.\n\nHe repeated Pyongyang’s earlier stance, calling for the US to abandon demands for the North’s denuclearisation as a condition for resuming talks."

This is the usual army line, but large numbers of civilians and civilian infrastructure have been targeted in the ongoing near-daily Israeli attacks.\n\nAl Jazeera’s correspondent noted that no casualties have been reported so far, with most of the raids targeting open areas amidst forests and hills and added that Israeli army aircraft continue to fly over southern Lebanon.\n\nThe Lebanese Al-Mayadeen channel confirmed that the Israeli army aircraft targeted the heights of the al-Tuffah region with a series of raids. Hezbollah ’s Al-Manar TV reported that Israeli “quadcopter” drones dropped explosive devices for the third time in the town of Markaba.\n\nOn Thursday, Israeli strikes on Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley killed one person and wounded 29 others.\n\nLebanon’s Ministry of Health announced that a “16-year-old Syrian boy was killed”, the National News Agency (NNA) reported. He was named as Hussein Mohsen al-Khalaf and was killed in a strike on Kfar Dan near Baalbek, the L’Orient news outlet reported.\n\nCeasefire violations\n\nIsrael’s military has continued to carry out attacks in Lebanon, despite a November 2024 ceasefire with Hezbollah that sought to bring an end to more than a year of fighting. More than 300 people have been killed since then, including 127 civilians, according to the United Nations.\n\n\n\nIsrael killed more than 4,000 people and injured about 17,000 others during its war against Lebanon, which began in October 2023, before turning into a full-scale war in September 2024.\n\nLast week, at least 12 people were killed in Israeli strikes on the Bekaa Valley and the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp near the city of Sidon. Israel said it was targeting Hezbollah and Hamas command centres.\n\nIsrael continues to occupy parts of Lebanon, blocking the reconstruction of border villages and preventing people from returning to their homes.\n\nLebanon’s government has said it has almost completed its ceasefire commitment to disarm Hezbollah south of the Litani River. It said it will need four months to complete the second phase.\n\nHowever, Hezbollah has rejected this, saying it believes the disarmament in the ceasefire agreement only applies to areas south of the river. The group has also said it will not disarm while Israel continues to attack and occupy parts of Lebanon."

            "content": "Aden, Yemen – Abu Amjad was shopping with his two children last week, finally able to take them out and buy them new clothes – a cherished Ramadan tradition in Yemen.\n\nThe 35-year-old is a teacher, and he had just received his salary. That payment was a sign things are improving in Aden – the salaries are funded by Saudi Arabia as a way of backing the Yemeni government, which has recently arrived to take control of Aden after the defeat of secessionist forces.\n\nBut problems and instability are never far away in Yemen.\n\nJust as soon as the children, Amjad, 10, and Mona, 7, began trying on their outfits, the sound of gunfire erupted. Shoppers froze. Amjad and Mona clutched their father, asking to leave.\n\nAbout 3km (2 miles) away, security forces had opened fire on protesters who attempted to breach the gates of al-Maashiq Palace, where members of the Yemeni government have been based since they arrived from Riyadh a week ago.\n\nThe gunfire shattered the family’s moment of joy.\n\n“It ruins your joy when you see a person bleed and robs you of peace when you hear prolonged gunfire,” Abu Amjad told Al Jazeera.\n\nAfter years of operating from exile, Yemen’s Saudi-backed, UN-recognised cabinet is spending Ramadan in Aden, a move that has coincided with improvements in basic services and a renewed sense of relief. Yet that relief was overshadowed by the deadly confrontation between security forces and antigovernment protesters, in which at least one person was killed.\n\n“That was the first clash after the return of the government to Aden. Our concern is that it may not be the last,” said Abu Amjad.\n\nGovernment wins\n\nYemen’s new Prime Minister Shaya al-Zindani has said that stabilising Aden and other areas under government control was among the new government’s main priorities.\n\n\n\nThe Yemeni government is currently in its strongest position for years. An advance by the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) at the end of last year in eastern Yemen ultimately was a step too far for the United Arab Emirates-backed group.\n\nSaudi Arabia considered the STC advance the crossing of a red line, and lent its full military backing to the Yemeni government, allowing it to take territory it had not controlled for years.\n\nNow, the Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia are focused on attempting to improve conditions in the southern and eastern areas of Yemen under government control, to attract more public support. That would in turn weaken support for both the STC and the Houthi rebels, who have controlled northwestern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, since the country’s war began in 2014.\n\nLit city and busy markets\n\nAbdulrahman Mansour, a bus driver and resident of Khormaksar in Aden, said Ramadan this year feels different.\n\n“When I see the lights on and the markets busy on Ramadan nights in Aden, it feels like a different city. The improvement is undeniable,” Mansour, 42, told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe noted that one distinct difference this Ramadan is the stable provision of electricity. “This reminds me of the pre-war time. We used to take that service for granted,” said Mansour.\n\n“When the city is dark at night, it appears gloomy, and families prefer to stay home. The movement of people brings life to the city and helps small businesses keep afloat, especially in Ramadan,” Mansour added.\n\nYemeni Electricity Minister Adnan al-Kaf said last week that efforts to improve electricity services in Aden and other provinces continue, noting that Saudi support had contributed to improved service over the past two months.\n\nWafiq Saleh, a Yemeni economic researcher, said the improvement in the living standards of citizens in Aden and southern Yemen, in general, was obvious, particularly after Saudi Arabia’s payment of public sector salaries and the supply of basic services such as water and electricity.\n\nSaleh told Al Jazeera, “The recent Saudi financial support has been very generous, and it can help the government during this period by enabling it to work on reactivating dormant resources, resuming oil exports, combating corruption, and improving the efficiency of revenue collection with transparency and good governance.”\n\nBut Saleh emphasised that the progress achieved so far is not the result of economic reforms by the Yemeni government, but rather because of Saudi support.\n\n\n\nTherefore, according to the economist, the improvement in the living situation and the currency’s value may not be sustainable, even if it is a positive indicator and may be the first step towards promised economic reforms in the country.\n\n“There must be a comprehensive vision for developing revenue collection so that the government can implement sustainable economic reforms,” Saleh said.\n\nSearch for cooking gas\n\nWhile the distribution of electricity has improved in Aden, other essential services remain strained. Cooking gas shortages remain a major concern. The search for it remains a daily struggle for families in the port city, and the crisis has intensified in Ramadan.\n\nLines of vehicles queue at stations, while residents wait with cylinders for a few litres (quarts) of gas.\n\n“Going from one station to another in search of cooking gas while fasting is exhausting,” said Fawaz Ahmed, a 42-year resident of Khormaksar district.\n\nFawaz describes the shortage of cooking gas as a cause of hunger in the city. “If I stay in [my home] village, I would resort to firewood. But in the city, that option is not available, and if we find firewood in the market, it is expensive.”\n\nGas distributors say the quantity of cooking gas supplied to them is not adequate, citing this as the root cause of the crisis. Supplies are transported from Marib province in northern Yemen.\n\nTensions to continue\n\nThe cooking gas shortage is a sign that it will not be plain sailing for the Yemeni government in Aden.\n\nAnd opponents will likely seize on any ongoing problems to foment more unrest.\n\nMajed al-Daari, editor-in-chief of the independent Yemeni news site Maraqiboun Press, described the situation in Aden as “very worrying”.\n\n“What happened to the demonstrators at the start of Ramadan underscores the fragility of the political and security situation. Tensions are set to continue,” al-Daari said.\n\n“The STC will continue mobilising its supporters against the government. This is its last card that it will use to restore lost political interests,” al-Daari added.\n\nThe STC said in a statement last week that raids and arbitrary arrests had targeted people who had participated in the recent protests. These attacks, the statement emphasised, would only increase the determination of the southerner secessionists.\n\nFor Abu Amjad, demonstrations in Aden give space to chaos, which he resents.\n\n“At least, Ramadan should pass without protests. Political actors should spare us this month so we can fast and share some joy with our children,” he said."

It really makes the enrichment argument less relevant, because now we are talking about zero stockpiling,” Al Busaidi said.\n\nRegarding recent US demands regarding Iran’s missile programme, Al Busaidi said: “I believe Iran is open to discuss everything”.\n\nAsked if he thought enough ground was covered in the most recent talks in Geneva to hold off a US attack on Iran, the minister said, “I hope so.”\n\n“We have really advanced substantially, and I think, obviously, there remains various details to be ironed out, and this is why we need a little bit more time to really try and accomplish the ultimate goal of having a comprehensive package of the deal,” he said.\n\n“But the big picture is that a deal is in our hands,” he added.\n\nThe foreign minister’s comment followed after he met earlier on Friday with US Vice President JD Vance and as US President Donald Trump continued to sabre-rattle while at the same time declaring he favoured a diplomatic solution with Tehran.\n\nTrump said on Friday that he was not happy with the recent talks that concluded in Geneva.\n\n“We’re not exactly happy with the way they’re negotiating,” Trump told reporters in Washington, adding that Iran “should make a deal”.\n\n“They’d be smart if they made a deal,” he said.\n\nTrump later said that he would prefer it if the US did not have to use military force, “but sometimes you have to do it”.\n\nThe US and Iranian sides are expected to meet again on Monday in Vienna, Austria, for more indirect negotiations."

            "content": "The expanded indictment targets protesters who rallied at Cities Church in St Paul against Trump’s immigration surge.\n\nThe administration of United States President Donald Trump has broadened its prosecution of the protesters involved in a church demonstration to 39 people, up from nine.\n\nThe demonstration was part of a backlash to Trump’s deadly immigration surge in the Midwestern state of Minnesota, but officials have sought to frame the protest as an attack on religious freedom.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced the expanded indictment on Friday in a message posted to social media.\n\n“Today, [the Justice Department] unsealed an indictment charging 30 more people who took part in the attack on Cities Church in Minnesota,” Bondi wrote. “At my direction, federal agents have already arrested 25 of them, with more to come throughout the day.”\n\nShe added a warning to other protesters who might seek to disrupt a religious service.\n\n“YOU CANNOT ATTACK A HOUSE OF WORSHIP,” Bondi said. “If you do so, you cannot hide from us — we will find you, arrest you, and prosecute you. This Department of Justice STANDS for Christians and all Americans of faith.”\n\nAppealing to Christian voters\n\nSince taking office for a second term, Trump has sought to appeal to Christian conservatives by launching initiatives, for example, to root out anti-Christian bias and prevent alleged acts of Christian persecution, both domestically and in countries like Nigeria.\n\nBut critics have accused his administration of attempting to stifle opposition through its prosecution of the Minnesota protest attendees.\n\nSome of those indicted deny even being a part of the January 18 protest. Defendants like former CNN anchor Don Lemon and reporter Georgia Fort say they attended in their capacity as journalists.\n\n\n\nBoth have pleaded not guilty to the charges and have publicly questioned whether their prosecution is an attempt to curtail freedom of the press.\n\nThe superseding indictment, filed on Thursday, levies two counts against the 39 defendants, accusing them of conspiracy against the right of religious freedom and efforts to injure, intimidate or interfere with the exercise of religious freedom.\n\n“While inside the Church, defendants collectively oppressed, threatened and intimidated the Church’s congregants and pastors by physically occupying the main aisle and rows of chairs near the front of the church,” the indictment reads\n\nIt also describes the protesters as “engaging in menacing and threatening behavior” by “chanting and yelling loudly” and obstructing exits.\n\nA magistrate judge on January 22 initially rejected the Justice Department’s attempt to charge nine attendees who were at the protest.\n\nBut the department sought a grand jury indictment instead, which was filed on January 29 and made public the next day.\n\nA reaction to Trump’s immigration surge\n\nThe protest, dubbed “Operation Pullup”, was conceived as a response to the violent immigration crackdown that had unfolded in Minnesota.\n\nMany of the enforcement efforts centred on the metropolitan area that includes the Twin Cities: St Paul and Minneapolis.\n\nTrump had repeatedly blamed the area’s large Somali American population for a welfare fraud scandal involving government funds for programmes like Medicaid and school lunches.\n\nIn December, the Trump administration surged federal immigration agents to the region, nicknaming the effort Operation Metro Surge. At its height, as many as 3,000 agents were in the Minneapolis-St Paul area.\n\nBut the effort was plagued by reports of excessive violence towards detainees and protesters alike. Videos circulated of officers breaking the car windows of legal observers, pepper-spraying protesters and beating people.\n\nOfficers also engaged in the practice of entering homes forcibly without a judicial warrant, which advocates described as a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. Cases of unlawful arrests were also reported.\n\nBut a turning point came on January 7, when an agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was caught on camera shooting into the vehicle of 37-year-old mother Renee Good. She died, and her killing triggered nationwide protests.\n\nOperation Pullup took place at Cities Church in St Paul less than two weeks later.\n\nIt was intended as a demonstration against the church’s pastor, David Easterwood, who serves as a local official for ICE.\n\n\n\nSeveral protesters have indicated that they are prepared to fight the government’s charges over the incident, citing their First Amendment rights to free speech.\n\nSome also said that they intended to remain vigilant towards government immigration operations, even after Trump administration officials announced Operation Metro Surge was winding down in mid-February.\n\n“This is not the time to be Minnesota Nice,” one protester, civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong, wrote on social media last week. “It’s time for truth, justice, and freedom to prevail.”"

Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of “effective altruism,” they have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission - a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives.\n\nThe Terms of Service of Anthropic’s defective altruism will never outweigh the safety, the readiness, or the lives of American troops on the battlefield.\n\nTheir true objective is unmistakable: to seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military. That is unacceptable.\n\nAs President Trump stated on Truth Social, the Commander-in-Chief and the American people alone will determine the destiny of our armed forces, not unelected tech executives.\n\nAnthropic’s stance is fundamentally incompatible with American principles. Their relationship with the United States Armed Forces and the Federal Government has therefore been permanently altered.\n\nIn conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security. Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.

            "content": "Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.\n\nYet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, Kodak, and others.\n\nAll the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.\n\nIf you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that offers great image quality and lets you choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like Kodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.\n\nTake a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for most people\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 306 grams / Charging method: AA batteries / Companion app: None / Other features: Built-in selfie mirror, film counter\n\nIf all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well-suited for kids and those new to photography.\n\nFor an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most struggle to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash helps. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both bright and dark environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. Photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before, but selfies captured my features and skin tone more accurately, thanks in part to the small front-facing mirror. The updated lens design also lets you twist into Close-Up Mode to zoom slightly and activate the Parallax Correction features for a more aligned photo. It’s a fun, point-and-shoot-style feature, though aligning photos still takes some practice (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).\n\nFor an instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 produces vivid, relatively true-to-life photos. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nThe Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the small counter that shows your remaining shots, which is a useful tracking feature given that each print costs about $1. However, it doesn’t support Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it doesn’t feature filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for a solid instant camera that caters to all ages and experience levels, you’ll likely be satisfied with the Instax Mini 12.\n\nThe best premium instant camera\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 285 grams / Charging method: USB-C (on newer models) / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nOne of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo was a favorite of my former colleague Becca Farcase — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a handsome brown version, as well as a newer pink model.\n\nIt’s easy to balk at its price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.\n\nBeing able to adjust the brightness of the prints helped me capture night photos and a low-light immersive exhibit a little more clearly and realistically, which is a feature the Instax Mini 12 doesn’t offer. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Mini 12, the Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can disable the flash, leverage the 3-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder, and adjust the brightness of a print — a helpful feature, given Evo doesn’t capture dark environments well. The camera’s dials also let you apply various lens options and effects, from retro filters to monochrome shades, and you can even take app-based remote shots, allowing for better seflies and more photographic control.\n\nThe Evo isn’t perfect, though. The companion app isn’t as feature-rich as competing software, the menu system can be confusing to navigate, and the camera’s internal storage maxes out at 45 images. Still, these are relatively minor drawbacks for a stylish, portable camera that makes it easy to quickly capture and print quality shots.\n\nThe best instant camera for social occasions\n\nFilm type: Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / Film size: 3 x 3-inch square prints / Weight: 467 grams / Charging method: Micro USB / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nWhereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app lets you apply frames, stickers, filters, and a wide range of customization options to photos, making it great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature in the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making it a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.\n\nLike the Evo, the Shot 3 Retro features an LCD screen — albeit a much smaller one — that lets you decide whether to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp images from your phone. Unlike the Evo, however, the Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of film. It also uses cheaper film; you can often pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for under $20. The cheaper arguably encourages creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than those from both Fujifilm and Polaroid.\n\nPhotos taken with the Kodak Mini Shot 3 aren’t particularly sharp and can have an excessive pink tint. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nHowever, there are notable drawbacks to the Shot 3 Retro. The resulting prints aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone, for one, nor were they as clear or sharp as what you might get with the Evo or Mini 12 (some even have an excessive pink tint). The Shot 3 Retro doesn’t store images the way the Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish. Nonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.\n\nThe best instant camera for retro fans\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / Weight: 648 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: Yes / Other features: Flip-up lid, scene analysis feature\n\nIf you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the Polaroid Flip is the camera for you. It resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 more than any other camera on our list, thanks to its classic, retro-inspired design and flip-up lid. Its square I-Type film prints and iconic white frame give photos an authentically vintage look, while modern touches like Bluetooth, USB-C charging, and a beginner-friendly companion app add greater convenience and creative control.\n\nCompared to the third-gen Polaroid Now Plus, my former retro pick, the Flip delivers clearer shots with fewer wasted photos, making the extra $50 worthwhile given that eight I-Type sheets are a spendy $18.99. The increased clarity can be attributed to several factors, including the Flip’s sonar autofocus and a four-lens hyperfocal system — which result in sharper, more focused images — along with its excellent flash. It’s the most powerful of any Polaroid camera, and while it can sometimes overexpose images, you can adjust exposure directly from the camera or app. The Scene Analysis feature also helps by warning if a shot is likely to be over- or underexposed, or if you’re too close to your subject. In my experience, the warnings didn’t always prevent overexposure, but they did leave me with shots that looked less blown than those from the Now Plus.\n\nA few outdoor examples I captured with the Polaroid Flip. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nAll that being said, there are some notable drawbacks. The Flip is relatively heavy and awkwardly sized, so you can’t slip it into a purse or easily carry it around. Prints also take up to 15 minutes to develop — during which they must be shielded from light — which can be quite an inconvenience. Low-light performance remains a weak spot as well, and I struggled to capture indoor shots given the contrast and saturation are lower than with Instax film. Admittedly, this gave my pictures a more dreamy, vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust the saturation and exposure settings.\n\nTruth be told, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, the Flip is the perfect camera for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for portability\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / Weight: 239 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: No / Other features: Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter\n\nWhereas the Flip is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It weighs just over a pound and fits easily in the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it the most portable instant camera on our list. If its images were more true to life and didn’t require you to sheild them from the light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d call it the best instant camera for kids or travel.\n\nAt $89.99, the latest Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera available, with film that costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (a 16-sheet pack runs $21.99). The new Go sports a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including USB-C support, and Polaroid claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor. Photos are slightly brighter, though the original Go produced warmer images that felt more true to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low, but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Flip.\n\nThe second-gen Polaroid Go produces charming photos but with a cooler tone. Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Flip, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. There’s no Bluetooth or companion app for added effects; however, the camera does include a self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. The smaller prints may disappoint those who prefer traditional Polaroid sizes, though, and its modern design lacks the retro charm of older models. But classic Polaroid cameras didn’t come with an app, either, and the Go’s simplicity makes it an a easy-to-use option that delivers a traditional instant film experience at less than half the price of the Flip.\n\nOther instant cameras to consider\n\nFujifilm’s $116.99 Instax Mini 41 is the long-awaited follow-up to the Mini 40. The updated model retains the retro design found on the prior model but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups. It didn’t take long testing the Mini 41 for me to realize it’s simply the Mini 12 for adults. With its black-and-silver body and flatter, squarer edges, the Mini 41 looks sleeker and more stylish. The two cameras are nearly identical, aside from the design, with the same solid photo quality and feature set. Both battery-powered options turn on with a simple twist of the lens, and each comes equipped with a selfie mirror, a close-up mode, and a flash (which cannot be disabled).\n\nThere are a few subtle upgrades to the Mini 41, however. A textured grip in the front makes it easier to hold, and its shape makes shooting in landscape mode more comfortable. But those are small differences, and at their core, the cameras offer the same experience. Since the Instax Mini 12 retails for less, I ultimately believe it’s the better value; however, if a fashionable, mature look appeals to you, the Mini 41 is a great alternative, especially if you can find it on sale.\n\nIf you’re looking for an advanced analog instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At $234.95, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12 or the Mini 41, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click cameras given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket, an aluminum extension column, and a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur when capturing fast-moving subjects.\n\nThanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12, Mini 41, and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera, not a hybrid like the Evo, so you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The newer model is also less user-friendly than the Mini 12 and Mini 41, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters.\n\nThe Kodak Smile Plus is another hybrid instant camera that allows you to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $129.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with a physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers.\n\nHowever, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark.\n\nThat said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software isn’t as snappy or feature-rich, it still lets you add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it’s often available for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.\n\nFrom photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, Leica’s Sofort 2 is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.\n\nThe drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s challenging to recommend at $399, as most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The Leica user interface is easier to navigate, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also appreciate that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.\n\nWhile it didn’t make the cut, the Instax Square SQ1 is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and features a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $159.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100. That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Flip and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.\n\nFujifilm also sells the newer Instax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at $199.95. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.\n\nFujifilm’s Instax Wide Evo Hybrid is nearly identical to the Instax Mini Evo. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $409.95 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lenses and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.\n\nPlus, unlike the Wide 400, the Wide Evo Hybrid is a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful feature that can reduce wasted shots. However, at $409.95, it costs significantly more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken, which is something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects, such as a dog or hyperactive toddler.\n\nIf you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $409.95 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $175.95 Instax Wide 400 is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar stills to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.\n\nFujifilm’s new Instax Mini LiPlay Plus isn’t nearly as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo, but it’s worth considering if you take a lot of selfies. At $234.99, the hybrid camera costs the same as the Instax Mini Evo, but features a 3-inch LCD screen on the back, along with a second, rear-facing wide-angle lens designed specifically for self-portraits. That dedicated selfie camera, paired with the LCD, delivers some of the best — and most precise — selfies I’ve captured with an instant camera to date.\n\nThe LiPlay Plus also includes some fun extra features, such as a layered photo mode that combines images from both cameras into a single shot. It can also record short audio clips, which are saved as a QR code you can place in a corner of the printed photo. Both features are enjoyable to play with, though the layered photo mode can, admittedly, come off as gimmicky. You’re basically just dropping a selfie onto a background image with no way to reposition or resize it.\n\nWhat I’m looking for How we test instant cameras Collapse Typically, I try to spend at least a couple of weeks, if not months, testing each camera to get a sense of what it would be like to actually own one. I’ll use them to capture photos of loved ones while hanging out, as well as subjects and scenes I stumble across as I explore Los Angeles and its many beaches. I shoot indoors and outside, with and without the flash, allowing me to compare how each camera performs in both bright and low-light environments.I also ask friends and family — both young and old — for their input on image quality, and I have them take photos with the instant camera to get their thoughts on usability. If the camera comes with extra features, such as filters or support for a companion app, I’ll make sure to put them to the test in real-life situations. I note how easy it is to pull up and navigate the app, apply the effects, and, of course, how the results look. Photo quality Collapse Instant cameras aren’t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most struggle in low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life. Ease of use Collapse How easy is it to set the instant camera up and take photos with it? Ease of use is a big part of what makes instant cameras fun and accessible to people of all ages. You shouldn’t need a professional photography background just to enjoy an instant camera. Value Collapse Instant cameras come with different features at various price points. Generally, the more feature-rich cameras tend to be pricier, but do the extra capabilities justify the added cost? Some cameras, for example, pair with a companion app or feature a built-in selfie mirror, while others let you print images from your phone. None of these are essential, though the added niceties may be worth it for some people. Suitability Collapse Some instant cameras aren’t as well-suited for certain situations and / or people as others. For example, there are instant cameras that print old-fashioned Polaroid photos that aren’t very clear. They frustrate me, but retro lovers might find them charming. Other cameras come with advanced creative modes that let you edit photos and even print smartphone photos, but a young child might find them difficult to use. Film Collapse Each instant camera requires a different kind of film, which means that the sticker price of the camera isn’t the true price. This is something you should take into account before making a purchase, as the cost of film can quickly add up. Depending on the brand, you may have to pay anywhere between 50 cents and $2 a shot.It’s also important to take into account that some film is easier to find. The Instax Mini 12, for example, uses credit card-size Instax Mini film that’s sold at most major retailers. Other types of film, including the film needed for Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, are available on Amazon but aren’t sold by as many retailers.Finally, most instant camera brands sell films of varying quality in a range of styles. Some are decorated with colorful frames and patterns, while others are black and white. They also vary in shape and size, from small rectangular prints you can stick in your wallet to square-shaped ones. You can also buy wider prints, and some brands even sell film with an adhesive backing that allows you to use the resulting images as stickers.\n\nUpdate, February 27th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and shorten the copy for all of our main entries."

The Artemis III mission, scheduled for 2027, was originally going to attempt to land on the Moon but will now be a test flight instead. NASA also says it’s “increasing its cadence of missions,” including adding a second test flight in 2027 and aiming for “at least one surface landing every year thereafter,” including the Artemis IV landing.\n\nThe overhaul to the Artemis launch schedule follows a report from NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) earlier this month that highlighted serious safety risks with NASA’s previous plans for future launches. ASAP was particularly concerned about Artemis III, which its report said included too many “cumulative technical, operational, and schedule risks associated with multiple first-of-a-kind objectives planned for a single mission.”\n\nThe Artemis II mission, scheduled for this year, has faced a string of issues during testing over recent weeks, delaying its launch until no earlier than April.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance’s merger agreement is now official. On Friday, the two companies announced plans to merge into a massive media company that will fold WBD’s studio, linear channels, streaming service, and gaming segment into Paramount.\n\nThough WBD initially signed onto an $83 billion agreement to merge part of Warner Bros. with Netflix, Paramount persisted with a hostile takeover bid, followed by a series of offers. That persistence paid off, as WBD determined that Paramount’s “best and final” offer is “superior” to Netflix’s deal. On Thursday, Netflix declined to match Paramount’s bid, calling it “no longer financially attractive.”\n\nParamount and WBD say the board of directors of both companies has signed off on the deal. The companies expect it to close in the third quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Under the agreement, Paramount will acquire WBD in a deal valued at $110 billion. Paramount has also agreed to cover the $7 billion regulatory termination fee and the $2.8 billion breakup fee owed to Netflix, which it has already paid, according to Bloomberg.\n\n“Together, Paramount and WBD will deliver greater choice for consumers through its leading streaming platforms with an exceptional intellectual property portfolio that has produced popular franchises such as Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Top Gun, the DC Universe and SpongeBob SquarePants,” the companies say in the press release.\n\nLawmakers and regulators are skeptical about the Paramount-WBD merger. “A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a statement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta also warned that the agreement isn’t a “done deal,” and that the state’s Department of Justice will be “vigorous” in its review of the merger."

            "content": "Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts, and have stopped getting a response. This week, thanks to a reader tip, we think we’ve found the original phone the T1 is based on.\n\nA long time ago, back when the Trump phone was but a single, inaccurate render and a contradictory spec sheet, we tried to figure out what other phone it might be based on. Now, eight months, two spec overhauls, and one redesign later, I have a good guess: the HTC U24 Pro.\n\nI didn’t spot this by myself. A reader first tipped me off to the similarities between the U24 Pro and the Trump phone I revealed a few weeks ago, which are numerous: a similar angled body and curved display, a unique front sensor array, and broadly similar specs, including oddities like a headphone jack and microSD card support.\n\nLet’s get one thing out the way at the top: I’m pretty sure HTC isn’t secretly building the Trump phone. Sohaib Ahmed, the company’s global director of PR, told me as much: “HTC does not design or manufacture phones for third parties.” But that doesn’t rule out another company playing a part in designing or building both phones, and given just how similar they look, I suspect that’s exactly what happened.\n\nIt’s a little hard to make out in this screenshot, but the Trump phone shares the sharply angled edges of the HTC U24 Pro. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nThe U24 Pro is an odd phone in its own right. It launched in 2024 for €549 (around $600 at the time), and was heralded in some corners as a return from the dead for HTC, despite the fact that it followed the U23 Pro a year earlier, and a string of smaller releases that targeted the Asian market. HTC, once one of the major players in the Android phone industry, had been greatly diminished ever since selling a large part of its smartphone business to Google for $1.1 billion in 2017.\n\nBoth the T1 Phone and the U24 Pro share a slightly asymmetric angular frame, jutting out into a point along every edge, with a heavily curved screen on the front. I cannot think of, nor find, another phone that is quite the same shape — even small details like the positions of the antenna lines around the power and volume buttons line up. Even more telling is the set of sensors along each phone’s top. The U24 Pro splits up its speaker grill, notification LED, and proximity sensor into three, resulting in an unusual design with a long bar, a small dot for the LED, and then a second shorter bar, at the point where the display meets the phone’s top. What looks like the same sensor design can be clearly seen on the Trump phone I was shown, though I can’t confirm that the sensors themselves are the same, or that the T1 Phone will also have a notification LED.\n\nBoth phones have near-identical sets of speakers and sensors about the front selfie camera, with headphone jack and microphone visible behind them on the top edges. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nOther details are subtler. It’s hard to tell exactly from the glimpses I got of the Trump phone, but along the top frame it certainly looks to have both a headphone jack and a microphone in the exact same positions as on the HTC device. Even having a headphone jack in the first place is evidence of the phones’ connection, given how rare the feature is in modern devices. The same can be said for the fact that both phones include a microSD card slot, sharing support for up to 1TB cards on top of a base 512GB of storage.\n\nWhile the rear cameras look completely different, which seems to scupper my theory, look again: The U24 Pro’s cameras are split into a pair close together, with a third lens lower down. The new Trump phone sets all its cameras in one mount, but they’re unevenly spaced, with a larger gap between the second and third lenses. These cameras may look totally different on the surface, but I suspect that underneath you’ll find they’re similar. And what we know of the specs matches too: Trump Mobile told me that its phone will have 50-megapixel sensors for both the main and selfie cameras, and my glimpse of its camera UI showed an ultrawide and a 2x zoom option — all of which you’ll find on the U24 Pro.\n\nThe two phones’ cameras look different at first, but the unusual lens placement might just line up. Screenshot: Dominic Preston / The Verge and Image: HTC\n\nAssuming that the two phones are essentially the same, does the U24 Pro tell us any more about what to expect from the T1? It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, matching what I’d been told about a Snapdragon 7-series chip in the Trump phone. The U24 Pro has a 6.8-inch OLED display, 60W wired charging and even wireless charging support, and an IP67 rating for dust and water protection. There’s reason to be cautious reading too much into the spec sheet, though: The U24 Pro released with a 4,600mAh battery, smaller than the 5,000mAh capacity I’ve been told will be in the Trump phone. If that spec differs, then other elements of the internals could well too — the bigger battery in particular might replace the wireless charging coils of the HTC phone.\n\nThe U24 Pro launched to middling reviews, which may not inspire much confidence in Trump Mobile’s offering. Tech Advisor gave the phone two and a half stars out of five, calling it “hard to recommend over rivals,” while Notebookcheck declared it “modern and yet out of date.” Still, it fared surprisingly well in a JerryRigEverything teardown and durability test.\n\nHe noticed, however, that this didn’t appear to be the HTC of old, lacking the sapphire crystal HTC previously used on its displays and optical image stabilization on the front camera it once pioneered. The U24 Pro and other HTC phones released in the last few years share little consistent design language, and ship with near-stock Android software. Speculation has been rife that HTC isn’t in fact manufacturing the phones internally, but had commissioned an ODM — original design manufacturer — to produce the hardware. ODMs design and manufacture phones for other companies, usually to a set of specifications provided by the consumer-facing brands, and often retain ownership of the designs, allowing them to reuse and repurpose them for other clients. I asked HTC for clarification, but the company wouldn’t confirm whether the U24 Pro was made in-house or contracted out.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that Trump Mobile, or its manufacturing partner, is simply ripping off the design of a little-known HTC device. But I think the most likely answer here is a more mundane one: HTC probably worked with some unnamed ODM to design and manufacture the U24 Pro, and Trump Mobile just happened to work with the same company. That manufacturer may have either dug out its old designs for HTC when developing the T1 Phone, or perhaps gave new life to old, unused components from HTC’s production run. Without knowing the hypothetical ODM involved, it’s hard to say for sure. Trump Mobile has previously confirmed that it’s working with a partner or partners to manufacture its phones outside the US, before their “final assembly” in Miami, but executive Don Hendrickson wouldn’t tell me the name of its manufacturer or where it’s based. I reached out to the company again for comment on this story, and received no reply.\n\nSo no, I don’t think that HTC made the Trump phone. But it does look likely that it is based, more or less, on one of that company’s phones. It remains to be seen how the T1 Phone will differ in its details, but the fact that its origins seem so closely tied to an unpopular midranger from two years ago doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the T1 Phone’s flagship credentials.\n\nGot inside information on Trump Mobile or the Trump phone?

The leadership change comes just a month after reports that Gottumkkala uploaded sensitive documents to ChatGPT. Gottumkkala had requested special permission to use ChatGPT, despite the AI being off-limits for other DHS employees.\n\nGottumkkala’s departure follows a downturn at CISA over the past year as the agency has been “gutted and politicized” by the Trump administration, resulting in budget cuts, layoffs, and wavering trust from local leaders. CISA is also still without a Senate-confirmed director. Trump nominated Sean Plankey for the role last year, then renominated him in January. Plankey previously served in the first Trump administration."

            "content": "is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nOn Thursday morning, I attended a Q&A panel with four top Samsung smartphone executives. Until 2025, Samsung was the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer, and by association, the world’s largest maker of cameras. It’s still the second largest after Apple.\n\nSamsung handed me the microphone first. I asked:\n\nWe see a divide in society between people who want AI to do impressive things with their photos and videos, and those who don’t want AI to do anything with photos and videos because it’s eroding our ability to believe that what we have seen is real, destroying the concept of photographic evidence. Metadata tools like C2PA have utterly failed to stem the tide. Does Samsung have any new and different ideas on how to prevent AI images from taking over the world?\n\nSamsung’s four executives did not have any new and different ideas to share.\n\nI will credit Won-Joon Choi, the mobile division’s COO and R&D chief, for not dodging the question. He told the room that the erosion of reality is a problem and he wants to fix it.\n\nBut he, and other Samsung executives, suggested that the company needs to balance the desire for photographic reality with letting smartphone buyers be “more creative.” They passed the buck by suggesting it’s an industry-wide problem, one that requires a broader conversation, and suggested that Samsung has already partially solved it simply by adding a watermark to AI-generated images. A watermark that can easily be removed.\n\nGiven an opening later, an exec suggested our feelings toward AI-generated content might become more favorable in the future.\n\nHere are some of those answers.\n\n“We recognize the issue, because a lot of content is generated by AI,” Choi began. “On the one hand, people want to be more creative, so we believe we have to provide a solution so people can be more creative,” he said. “On the other hand, it’s really hard nowadays to distinguish the real photos and videos from the fake ones. I think this is a problem, we recognize that, and I think it’s a problem we have to solve at an industry level.”\n\n“The C2PA, you may view it as a failure, but it’s still enough to provide a mechanism if people want to validate that those pictures and videos are made by AI. I think we have to provide a mechanism so people can use it. I think it’s an ongoing effort throughout the industry to solve this problem,” he added.\n\n“I think if we make joint efforts to solve this problem, I believe that we should be able to do it,” he concluded.\n\nAs my colleague Jess Weatherbed wrote earlier this week, we’re starting to worry that this sort of “the industry will solve this together” rhetoric, and the C2PA itself, are substitutes for actual meaningful action.\n\nPerhaps responding to our Samsung AI slop watch reporting, Samsung America exec Dave Das also chimed in to say that the company’s still learning about how much AI is acceptable when creating its own ads. He admitted that the company has “just started utilizing some AI content in our creative, and the feedback has been pretty clear.”\n\n“We’re trying to discern what is the right place to use it, and absolutely how to be very clear about when we are using AI generated content vs naturally generated content,” Das said.\n\nBut Das still frames it as a balancing act between business priorities, not a social responsibility. “It really boils down to giving the creator choice,” he said, suggesting that Samsung’s job is to find “the right balance.”\n\nLater in the morning, KTLA-TV tech reporter Rich DeMuro felt out Samsung’s stance with a very different question. He asked whether Samsung might want to make it easier for customers to remove its AI watermark from AI-generated photos.\n\nThree screenshots taken from AI-generated Samsung ads on YouTube. More on Samsung slop watch here. Image: Samsung / The Verge\n\n“If I’m making a Christmas card with all your fun tools, do I really want that to say ‘AI-generated content?’” asked DeMuro.\n\nDrew Blackard, Samsung America’s SVP of mobile product management, took that one. He concluded by saying that “If we feel like consumers really want that ability to remove watermarks, and there are other ways to address the first point around authenticity at the same time, we’ll do both things and deliver the best of what people are wanting out of the experiences.”\n\n“At least right now, there’s enough concern from consumers around authenticity that that’s the primary thing we’ve solved for, in terms of the watermarking both in the metadata and on the photo itself. Not all services do that,” he said.\n\nBlackard also suggested we might look back one day and realize that AI-generated content isn’t such a big deal, that our perceptions might change over time, the same way perceptions changed toward user-generated content to begin with. People were concerned then with “the amount of content now flowing into the system” and how it wasn’t the professional video product they were used to, he said.\n\nI wonder if Samsung and fellow smartphone makers have considered the opposite: that perceptions of AI-generated imagery might become even less favorable after people lose their jobs in favor of cheap-to-produce AI slop, and after it becomes far easier to lie and cheat and steal in the absence of reliable recorded evidence.\n\nI wonder if they’ve considered solving this problem ”at an industry level” before they break the dam, and whether perception might turn against Samsung for helping create the flood that comes after."

            "content": "Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.\n\nThe blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.\n\nThe Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.\n\nAccess to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.\n\nWe understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase. We acknowledge the difficulties this is causing for our users there. Supabase continues to follow up through all available channels to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nWe continue to advise affected customers… — Supabase (@supabase) February 27, 2026\n\nAn Indian founder, who asked not to be named to avoid potential repercussions, told TechCrunch they had stopped seeing new user sign-ups from India over the past two to three days. A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.\n\nWhile Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.\n\nAt the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.\n\nThe incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.\n\n“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.”\n\nIndia has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted access to developer platform GitHub, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also reported that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.\n\nFounded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has gained traction amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its valuation to $5 billion.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond."

Per the BBC, CEO Sam Altman sent a memo to staff on Thursday saying he shared the same “red lines” and that any OpenAI-related defense contracts would also reject uses that were “unlawful or unsuited to cloud deployments, such as domestic surveillance and autonomous offensive weapons.”\n\nOpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who very publicly fell out with Altman in November 2023 and has since co-founded his own AI company, also waded into the conversation on Friday, writing on X: “It’s extremely good that Anthropic has not backed down, and it’s significant that OpenAI has taken a similar stance.\n\nIn the future, there will be much more challenging situations of this nature, and it will be critical for the relevant leaders to rise up to the occasion, for fierce competitors to put their differences aside. Good to see that happen today.”\n\nBut within hours of the Trump administration ordering federal agencies to cut ties with Anthropic, OpenAI moved to fill the void, announcing a deal with the Pentagon that Altman said preserved the same core principles Anthropic had fought for — prohibitions on domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons. According to the New York Times, OpenAI and the government began meeting about a potential tie-up on Wednesday of this week.\n\nSurely, there will be more twists to come.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI and Google each received contract awards from the U.S. Defense Department last July.

In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.\n\nSuno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\n\nStill, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more."

Here are a few more we like, but for one reason or another don't warrant a place above.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nKrafted Couch Wireless Charger for $52: I thought this wireless charger that’s designed to be draped over the arm of your couch was a great idea when I saw it, but the ridges failed to keep it in place on my velvety couch, so it kept slipping down the side. The silicone finish with the Krafted logo is also a bit ugly. It's just a silicone mat with a magnetic charger inside, though there is a fairly generous 6.6-foot (2-meter) cable, and it is Qi2 rated. If you’re always rooting around for a charger and one of the colors blends well with your furniture, it might be a good solution for you.\n\nEinova Eggtronic Charging Stone for $70: Made with 100 percent solid marble or stone—you can choose from a variety. Every single pick in this guide looks very much like a wireless charger, but I've had visiting friends ask if this one is a drink coaster. (I'm still figuring out whether that's a good or bad thing.) It has zero LEDs, perfect for bedrooms; just try to hide the cable to truly make it blend into your home. We recommend putting a case on your phone when using it with this charger, as there's a risk of scuffing up the back with these harder surfaces.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nBaseus Nomos 5-in-1 Charging Station for $100: If you liked the PicoGo W2 above but need more gadget-charging power, this 5-in-1 could be worth a look. It also has a tilting pad and retractable USB-C cable, but adds two more USB-C ports and one USB-A, along with a stats-filled display. It’s perfect for your desktop. I also tried and quite liked the Baseus Nomos 8-in-1 Magnetic Charging Station ($70), which combines a similar folding Qi2 pad with three US AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one USB-A.\n\nRapport London Formula Wireless Charging Tray for $475: Yes, this is an obscene price for a Qi wireless charger. You can probably make a version for a fraction of the cost. But Rapport's build quality is quite nice, with a lacquered grey box and a soft-touch fabric to keep your watches and phone scratch-free. It reliably recharged several Android phones without making them too warm, all while offering storage for a few watches. It's attractive, but you have to have cash to burn at this price.\n\niOttie iOS Wireless Duo for $50: This dual-charging system looks pretty—I like the fabric-wrapped stand—and you can charge another device on the rubberized charging pad next to it. The stand can be used in portrait or landscape, though in the latter orientation it'll block the pad. I use the pad to top up my wireless earbuds, but I wouldn't use this iOttie on a nightstand, because the LED on the front can be glaring. A cable and adapter are included, which makes it a good value. It can charge Pixel phones at up to 15 watts, iPhones at 7.5 watts, and other Android phones at 10 watts.\n\nJourney Alti Play Performance Desk Mat for $120: This is a desk mat that doubles as a wireless charging pad. On the left side is a plasticky rectangle with a Qi2 magnetic puck for your smartphone. Above it is a little area to charge wireless earbuds (5 watts). Naturally, there's RGB all over, and there are two buttons you can press to cycle through patterns and colors. It's a smart-looking system, though the quality of the actual mat leaves a bit to be desired. I didn't have issues gliding my mouse on it, and it stays put thanks to the rubber underside, but I just didn't like the look and feel of the Lycra surface. Journey has some other versions of this mat that use different materials, so take a look if you like the overall aesthetic.\n\nCourant Catch:2 Essentials for $75: Wireless chargers should look nice. You shouldn't settle for anything less! This Courant dual charger oozes luxury with its Belgian linen-wrapped surface (especially in the camel color). I've used it by my front door to recharge my partner's and my wireless earbuds for two years. The rubber feet prevent it from shifting around, but even if there are five coils in this pad, you should try to be precise when you put your device down to charge and make sure the LED lights up to double-check. It comes with a color-matching USB-C cable.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nZens Liberty Wireless Charger for $150: I tested the Glass Edition of this wireless charging pad, and it looks stunning with the 16 overlapping copper coils on display (the standard version has a woolen fabric top). It can charge two devices simultaneously at up to 15 watts apiece, and there’s an optional Apple Watch add-on ($19). As stylish as it is, the price is too high. Because you can see the coils, placement is never an issue, but it’s a bulky charger; the fan is audible at times, and while I had no problem charging my iPhone or AirPods, my Pixel 6 Pro got very warm on this pad.\n\nXiaomi Mi 80-W Wireless Charging Stand for $50: By far the fastest wireless charger we have tested, this stand is only worth considering for Xiaomi phones (it seems to charge most other phones at 10 watts or below). I tested with the Xiaomi 13 Ultra, which tops out at 50 watts (some Xiaomi models can go higher). The unusual sail shape combines a white triangular section with a clear acrylic base that has a subtle groove to hold your phone in place and a gap underneath for the exhaust grill from the noisy fan. The USB-C port and LED indicator are on the back.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

The speed maxes out at 28 miles per hour (mph), which doesn't make it the fastest scooter on the market, but it has a good range. (Chokkattu is a very tall man and was able to travel 15 miles on a single charge at 15 mph.) Other Apollo features he appreciates: turn signals, a dot display, a bell, along with a headlight and an LED strip for extra visibility.\n\nApollo Phantom 2.0 for $2099 ($900 Off)\n\nThe Apollo Phantom 2.0 maxes out at 44 mph, with plenty of power from its dual 1,750-watt motors. It's a gorgeous scooter, designed with 11-inch self-healing tubeless tires and a dual-spring suspension system for a smooth riding experience. But with great power comes great weight. At 102 pounds, the Phantom 2.0 is the heaviest electric scooter Chokkattu has tested, so I would only recommend this purchase if you don't live in a walkup and/or have a garage.\n\nMore Discounted Electric Scooters"

            "content": "US President Donald Trump announced Friday that he was instructing every federal agency to “immediately cease” use of Anthropic’s AI tools. The move comes after Anthropic and top officials clashed for weeks over military applications of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump said that there would be a “six month phase out period” for agencies using Anthropic, which could allow time for further negotiations between the government and the AI startup.\n\nThe Pentagon and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nShortly after the President’s announcement, defense secretary Pete Hegseth said that Anthropic would also be designated a “supply chain risk,” a move normally reserved for foreign businesses considered a danger to American national security. The designation will bar the US military and its contractors and suppliers from working with the AI company.\n\nHegseth also lashed out at Anthropic and its CEO, Dario Amodei, over the company's refusal to agree to its demands. “Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of ‘effective altruism,' they have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission—a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives,” Hegseth wrote on X.\n\nThe Department of Defense has sought to change the terms of a deal struck with Anthropic and other companies last July to eliminate restrictions on how AI can be deployed and instead permit “all lawful use” of the technology. Anthropic objected to the change, claiming that it could allow AI to be used to fully control lethal autonomous weapons or to conduct mass surveillance on US citizens.\n\nThe Pentagon does not currently use AI in these ways, and has said it has no plans to do so. However, top Trump administration officials have voiced opposition to the idea of a civilian tech company dictating military use of such an important technology.\n\nAnthropic was the first major AI lab to work with the US military, through a $200 million deal signed with the Pentagon last year. It created several custom models known as Claude Gov that have fewer restrictions than its regular ones. Google, OpenAI, and xAI signed similar deals around the same time, but Anthropic is the only AI company currently working with classified systems.\n\nAnthropic’s model is available through platforms provided by Palantir and Amazon’s cloud platform for classified military work. Claude Gov is currently largely used for run-of-the-mill tasks, like writing reports and summarizing documents, but it is also used for intelligence analysis and military planning, according to one source familiar with the situation who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nIn recent years, Silicon Valley has gone from largely avoiding defense work to increasingly embracing it and eventually becoming full-blown military contractors. The fight between Anthropic and the Pentagon is now testing the limits of that shift. This week, several hundred workers from OpenAI and Google signed an open letter supporting Anthropic and criticizing their own companies’ decisions to remove restrictions on military use of AI.\n\nIn a memo sent to OpenAI staff today, CEO Sam Altman said that the company agreed with Anthropic and also viewed mass surveillance and fully autonomous weapons as a “red line.” Altman added that the company would try to agree to a deal with the Pentagon that would let it continue working with the military, The Wall Street Journal reported."

            "content": "Looking for an upgraded Roku that's a great match for your new 4K TV? Right now, both Amazon and Best Buy have the 2024 Roku Ultra discounted to $80, a $20 break from the usual price. It sports dual-band Wi-Fi and Ethernet for a more consistent connection, support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and the remote has a headphone port.\n\nWhile there are a ton of great Roku streaming devices to choose from, the Ultra stands out for a few reasons. Streaming in 4K requires a huge amount of bandwidth, and some wireless networks just aren't up to the task, particularly if your TV isn't near your router. A true dual-band Wi-Fi setup in the Roku Ultra helps ensure a stutter-free experience on all of your favorite streaming services. If you really hate buffering and dropped connections, there's an Ethernet port around back for a wired hookup, something most other streaming devices can't claim.\n\nAnother nice upgrade you get with your Roku Ultra kit is the remote, which includes a built-in 3.5-mm headphone jack. That's perfect if you like to sneak in a few episodes of your favorite show after everyone's gone to bed, or want to catch a movie without waking a sleeping baby. The Roku Ultra even includes a pair of earbuds you can use right out of the box, which are surprisingly good for what they are, and they include extra ear tips for getting the fit right.\n\nLike some of the other premium Roku streaming devices, the hands-free voice controls make it super easy to find what you're looking for. Rather than dig through all of your apps and services looking for a movie, you can just say the title into the remote and let Roku go and find it for you.\n\nIf you're ready to take your 4K streaming to the next level, both Best Buy and Amazon have the Roku Ultra marked down to $80. We also have a great guide that breaks down the differences between all of the available Roku streamers, and a roundup of our favorite media streamers, in case you're wondering what the Roku alternatives look like."

            "content": "A few months ago, a family came into Pasadena Cyclery in Pasadena, California, for a repair on what they thought was their teenager’s ebike. “I can’t fix that here,’ Daniel Purnell, a store manager and technician, remembers telling them. “That’s a motorcycle.” The mother got upset. She didn’t realize that what she thought was an ebike could go much faster, perhaps up to 55 miles per hour.\n\n“There’s definitely an education problem,” Purnell says. In California, bike advocates are pushing a new bill designed to clear up that confusion around what counts as an electric bicycle—and what doesn’t.\n\nIt’s a tricky balance. On one hand, backers want to allow riders access to new, faster, and more affordable non-car transportation options, ones that don’t require licenses and are emission-free. On the other hand, people, and especially kids, seem to be getting hurt. Ebike-related injuries jumped more than 1,020 percent nationwide between 2020 and 2024, according to hospital data, though it’s not clear if the stats-keepers can routinely distinguish between ebikes and their faster, “e-moto” cousins. (Moped and powered-assisted cycle injuries jumped 67 percent in that same period.)\n\n“We’re overdue to have better ebike regulation,” says California state senator Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat who sponsored the bill and represents parts of North County in San Diego. “This has been an ongoing and growing issue for years.”\n\nSenate Bill 1167 would make it illegal for retailers to label higher-powered, electric-powered vehicles as ebikes. It would clarify that ebikes have fully operative pedals and electric motors that don’t exceed 750 watts, enough to hit top speeds between 20 and 28 mph."

            "content": "OpenAI has fired an employee following an investigation into their activity on prediction market platforms including Polymarket, WIRED has learned.\n\nOpenAI CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, disclosed the termination in an internal message to employees earlier this year. The employee, she said, “used confidential OpenAI information in connection with external prediction markets (e.g. Polymarket).”\n\n“Our policies prohibit employees from using confidential OpenAI information for personal gain, including in prediction markets,” says spokesperson Kayla Wood. OpenAI has not revealed the name of the employee or the specifics of their trades.\n\nEvidence suggests that this was not an isolated event. Polymarket runs on the Polygon blockchain network, so its trading ledger is pseudonymous but traceable. According to an analysis by the financial data platform Unusual Whales, there have been clusters of activities, which the service flagged as suspicious, around OpenAI-themed events since March 2023.\n\nUnusual Whales flagged 77 positions in 60 wallet addresses as suspected insider trades, looking at the age of the account, trading history, and significance of investment, among other factors. Suspicious trades hinged on the release dates of products like Sora, GPT-5, and the ChatGPT Browser, as well as CEO Sam Altman’s employment status. In November 2023, two days after Altman was dramatically ousted from the company, a new wallet placed a significant bet that he would return, netting over $16,000 in profits. The account never placed another bet.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former tech worker who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at kateknibbs.09.\n\nThe behavior fits into patterns typical of insider trades. “The tell is the clustering. In the 40 hours before OpenAI launched its browser, 13 brand-new wallets with zero trading history appeared on the site for the first time to collectively bet $309,486 on the right outcome,” says Unusual Whales CEO Matt Saincome. “When you see that many fresh wallets making the same bet at the same time, it raises a real question about whether the secret is getting out.”\n\nPrediction markets have exploded in popularity in recent years. These platforms allow customers to buy “event contracts” on the outcomes of future events ranging from the winner of the Super Bowl to the daily price of Bitcoin to whether the United States will go to war with Iran. There are a wide array of markets tied to events in the technology sector; you can trade on what Nvidia’s quarterly earnings will be, or when Tesla will launch a new car, or which AI companies will IPO in 2026.\n\nAs the platforms have grown, so have concerns that they allow traders to profit from insider knowledge. “This prediction market world makes the Wild West look tame in comparison,” says Jeff Edelstein, a senior analyst at the betting news site InGame. “If there's a market that exists where the answer is known, somebody's going to trade on it.”\n\nEarlier this week, Kalshi announced that it had reported several suspicious insider trading cases to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the government agency overseeing these markets. In one instance, an employee of the popular YouTuber Mr. Beast was suspended for two years and fined $20,000 for making trades related to the streamer’s activities; in another, the far-right political candidate Kyle Langford was banned from the platform for making a trade on his own campaign. The company also announced a number of initiatives to prevent insider trading and market manipulation.\n\nWhile Kalshi has heavily promoted its crackdown on insider trading, Polymarket has stayed silent on the matter. The company did not return requests for comments.\n\nIn the past, major trades on technology-themed markets have sparked speculation that there are Big Tech employees profiting by using their insider knowledge to gain an edge. One notorious example is the so-called “Google whale,” a pseudonymous account on Polymarket that made over $1 million trading on Google-related events, including a market on who the most-searched person of the year would be in 2025. (It was the singer D4vd, who is best known for his connection to an ongoing murder investigation after a young fan’s remains were found in a vehicle registered to him.)"

A looming Paramount Skydance merger with Warner Bros. Discovery would expand their empire even further.\n\nNow that Netflix has backed out of its bid to acquire WBD, the Ellisons stand to gain an entirely new trove of significant intellectual property, from DC Comics to Harry Potter. According to Reuters, Warner Bros. agreed to be acquired by Paramount Skydance in a $110 billion deal signed Friday, with Paramount Skydance agreeing to pay a $7 billion termination fee if federal regulators don’t approve the merger.\n\nParamount’s merger with Skydance has already brought about mass layoffs, including at CBS News, where Free Press founder Bari Weiss is leading a cultural overhaul as editor in chief. In January, Oracle became a partial owner of TikTok, giving the Ellisons even more cultural currency.\n\nHere’s everything the family would control if the WBD deal goes through.\n\nCBS and CBS News\n\nBesides its news division, which includes 60 Minutes, CBS is also home to hits like Tracker and Matlock, along with reality stalwarts Survivor and Big Brother.\n\nHBO and HBO Max\n\nAmong the most Emmy-winningest networks to exist, HBO’s library includes classics like Game of Thrones, The Wire, and Veep, as well as newer hits like The Pitt, The Gilded Age, and Thrones spin-off A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. (Outside of Canada, HBO Max is also a key distributor of the hockey smut drama Heated Rivalry.)\n\nCNN\n\nWhile CNN’s ratings dipped last year, it remains a news juggernaut and a top 5 cable network, featuring household names like John King, Kaitlan Collins, and Anderson Cooper (who recently announced he will be leaving 60 Minutes at the end of the current season).\n\nDC Comics\n\nThe merger would put Paramount Skydance in control of storied comic book franchises like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nThe wizarding world of Harry Potter, including all eight fantasy films and the upcoming HBO television series slated to premiere in 2027 would also be under the Ellisons’ purview.\n\nTikTok\n\nAs of a deal finalized in January, Oracle now holds a 15 percent stake in TikTok’s US operations.\n\nStar Trek\n\nAll 13 Star Trek movies and television shows are owned by Paramount Skydance. At a press event last year, Dana Goldberg, cochair of Paramount Pictures and chair of Paramount Television, said the franchise would be a “priority across the company.”\n\nWarner Bros. Studios\n\nHome to blockbusters like Barbie, The Dark Knight, and more recently, One Battle After Another and Sinners.\n\nComedy Central\n\nSouth Park announced a five-year, $1.5 billion deal with Paramount last July, just prior to the merger with Skydance. The show has since skewered Donald Trump and those in his administration regularly.\n\nAvatar Studios\n\nIn December, Paramount+ announced it would be the exclusive streamer of Avatar Studios content, including animated film The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender and series Avatar: Seven Havens.\n\nA Bunch of Cable Channels and Networks\n\nThe Food Network, HGTV, Discovery, TLC, OWN, Adult Swim, Showtime, TNT, and TBS are all part of WBD.\n\nOther Key Franchises\n\nOther notable titles that are or would be controlled by the Ellisons, pending the WBD takeover, include: The Lord of the Rings franchise, the Mission Impossible franchise, and the distribution rights to Dune: Part Three.\n\n2/27/26, 2:34 PM EDT: WIRED updated details about Paramount Skydance's deal with Warner Bros.

The Pro charger's battery stores enough for another 45 days, which you top off with Qi-compatible wireless charging. In addition, the case incorporates locator technology via the app and a speaker, as well as usability features such as haptic notifications and a power LED.\n\nThe ring can also retain up to 250 days of data versus less than a week for the cheaper model. Ultrahuman redesigned the heart-rate sensor for better signal quality. An upgraded processor improves the accuracy of the local machine learning and overall speed.\n\nIt's offered in gold, silver, black and titanium finishes, with available sizes ranging from 5 to 14.\n\nJade's Deep Research Mode is the cross-ecosystem analysis feature, which aggregates data from Ring and Blood Vision and the company's subscription services, Home and M1 CGM, to provide historical trends, offer current recommendations and flag potential issues, as well as trigger activities such as A-fib detection. Ultrahuman plans to expand its capabilities to include health-adjacent activities, such as ordering food.\n\nSome new apps are also available for the company's PowerPlug add-on platform, including capabilities such as tracking GLP-1 effects, snoring and respiratory analysis and migraine management tools."

In rare cases, reading glass strength can go up to +4.00.\n\n“Tips for buying reading glasses online are similar to buying ready-made reading glasses at the drugstore: It’s a convenient option but it’s not a good idea for everyone,” says Dr. Ravi Goel, clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. “If you have different prescription needs in each eye, astigmatism, high-power or more complex prescription needs, you should see an eye care professional for updated prescription eyewear.”\n\nReed seconds this, adding, “The wrong prescription can lead to headaches, eye strain or even nausea. If you do choose to buy online, we recommend selecting a lower power when deciding between two strengths, as this is generally a safer choice, and overly strong lenses tend to cause more discomfort than those that are slightly weaker.”\n\nGoel notes that everyone older than 40 should see an ophthalmologist for a medical eye exam because that is the age when presbyopia and potentially blinding eye diseases usually begin developing. Plus, not all eye diseases begin with noticeable symptoms.\n\nType of reading glasses\n\n“There are four main types of reading glasses: single vision, bifocal, trifocal and progressive,” says Goel, defining them as:\n\nSingle-vision reading lenses are typically designed to correct just for near vision.\n\nare typically designed to correct just for near vision.

Reed says these can be particularly helpful for people over 50 experiencing reduced depth of focus. Progressive lenses have a smooth transition between distance and near focal areas without visible dividing lines. “They deliver a more natural look and a smoother transition between different viewing distances,” adds Reed.\n\n“When generic OTC readers are no longer enough, prescription reading glasses -- also called single-vision readers -- are a great next step. These are custom-made by an eye doctor to correct for astigmatism, unequal prescriptions or other specific vision needs,” says Reed. “For those who need multiple levels of vision correction, there are multifocal lenses.”\n\nThe best lens material\n\n“This depends on lifestyle,” Goel says. “For example, if you spend a lot of time outdoors, you might prefer polycarbonate, which is lightweight and doesn’t break easily. There are also various lens coatings available for convenience (i.e., anti-reflective coatings) but are not required.”\n\nGoel notes that the American Academy of Ophthalmology doesn't recommend blue light-blocking coatings or lenses because “there is no scientific evidence to suggest blue light-blocking glasses help reduce eye strain.” Instead, take breaks from near-work activity and use eye drops if necessary. If you continue to experience symptoms, see an ophthalmologist.\n\nAccording to Reed, most people choose among the following three lens materials for reading glasses:\n\nCR-39 plastic lenses: Affordable, lightweight and provide good optical clarity, making them a popular choice for basic reading glasses.\n\nAffordable, lightweight and provide good optical clarity, making them a popular choice for basic reading glasses. Polycarbonate lenses : Lighter and significantly more impact-resistant than CR-39 plastic, making them a safer option for people who tend to drop their glasses or want something more durable.\n\n: Lighter and significantly more impact-resistant than CR-39 plastic, making them a safer option for people who tend to drop their glasses or want something more durable. High-index plastic lenses: Thinner and lighter than other materials and are a good choice for people who need a stronger prescription but want to avoid thick, heavy lenses.\n\n“For most reading glasses, especially for occasional or indoor use, CR-39 plastic works well,” says Reed. “If you need extra durability or prefer thinner, lighter lenses, polycarbonate or high-index materials may be a better fit. Your doctor of optometry can help recommend the best lens material based on your specific needs.”\n\nReed adds that not all lens materials and coatings are created equal. That’s why it’s important to check with your eye doctor to ensure the reading glasses you choose are the right fit for you.\n\nStyle\n\nOne of the most fun parts of buying glasses is finding a frame that speaks to your personal style and fits with your face shape. When shopping for glasses online, pay attention to the material, color and width.\n\nPrice\n\nReading glasses can range from affordable to expensive. For instance, if you want a designer pair of reading glasses, be prepared to spend over $100. If you tend to lose your reading glasses, you may want to buy more inexpensive pairs to keep multiple on hand.\n\n“Price of eyeglasses is not necessarily reflective of quality; the real question is if someone finds the ready-made reading glasses helpful or if they need custom reading glasses to meet their vision needs,” explains Goel.\n\n“In general, spending more on frames doesn’t mean you’ll end up with better-quality eyeglasses. You don’t need designer frames to have a good set of glasses. For prescription lenses, such as bifocal, trifocal or progressive lenses, an optician will help you select good lenses that best meet your vision needs. A personalized evaluation of vision needs is a value-add that is often missed by online sellers.”\n\nAdditional coatings\n\nYou can get reading glasses with lenses treated with blue light, anti-glare and polarization coatings. But note that you'll likely have to pay extra for these.\n\nShipping and returns\n\nIf you buy your reading glasses online, you likely won’t get to try them on before you buy. As a result, ensure the company has a return and exchange policy you can work with. As for shipping, if you need your reading glasses ASAP, you’re better off going with a company that offers express or overnight shipping."

            "content": "Two of the largest internet providers in the US are set to merge, as the FCC announced its approval of Charter’s $34.5 billion acquisition of Cox Communications Friday afternoon.\n\nCharter, which sells phone, internet and TV services under the Spectrum brand, agreed to buy Cox in May 2025. The deal will create the largest internet provider in the country, with Cox’s 6.5 million customers joining Charter’s 31 million.\n\nWhile internet monopolies are a major problem in the US -- over a third of Americans only have access to one or no internet provider -- this acquisition won’t necessarily make that problem worse. That’s because Charter and Cox have very little overlap in the areas where they operate.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\n“No consumer is going to lose a competitive offering they currently have,” Blair Levin, a former FCC chief of staff and a telecom industry analyst at New Street Research, told CNET. “There's no reduction of competition in any relevant geographical product market.”\n\nThe FCC’s announcement doesn’t specify when Cox customers will transfer to Spectrum, but it could be a welcome change for many. Cox received a score of 68/100 in the most recent American Customer Satisfaction Index survey, while Spectrum earned a 71/100.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nHowever, a CNET analysis of internet plans found Spectrum’s price hikes to be steeper, with Spectrum increasing prices by an average of $37 monthly after one or two years, depending on the location. Cox’s plans increased by $28 per month, but only after two years.\n\nSome critics argued that the FCC should have done more to help consumers before granting Charter approval.\n\n“The FCC approved the largest cable merger in nearly a decade and did not require Charter to do anything it wasn’t already planning to do,” John Bergmayer, legal director at the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said in a statement. “Consumers, as always, will bear the costs of reduced competition.”\n\nAs part of the approval process, Charter agreed to move all of Cox’s offshore jobs to America within 18 months. According to a post on its website, Charter says it has a 100% US-based workforce as of Dec. 31, 2025."

            "content": "Key takeaways:\n\nAll five watches tracked steps and distance accurately, but heart rate accuracy varied.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 11 was the most accurate heart rate monitor during workouts.\n\nThe Garmin Venu 4's heart rate tracking has more data, ideal for serious training analysis.\n\nIf steps and distance accuracy are your priorities, you don't need an expensive smartwatch.\n\nTraining for a marathon definitely wasn't in the cards when I began this project. Testing five smartwatches for accuracy looked to me more like a few leisurely jogs, rocking what looked like the entire smartwatch section of Best Buy stacked on my wrists. I've tested dozens of smartwatches over the years, but never five at once, and never under the level of scrutiny this test demanded. Mile after mile, I pushed my heart rate (and my body) well beyond my comfort zone with the finish line in focus.\n\nFitness trackers have come a long way since the early Fitbit days of step counting, and in today's wearable landscape, a reliable step counter isn't enough. Smartwatches, rings, fitness bands and even earbuds compete for real estate on your body to monitor everything from heart rate to temperature. To edge out the competition, they must be accurate enough to catch subtle changes in your vitals and turn that data into results.\n\nI tested five models (one at a time), ranging from $80 to $550, to determine which was most accurate for steps, distance and heart rate. Heart rate, in particular, is the most critical (and the hardest to get right) since so many other metrics depend on it.\n\nFrom left to right: Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, Google Pixel Watch 4, Amazfit Bip 6, Garmin Venu 4 and Apple Watch Series 11, alongside the Polar H10 chest strap and tally counter used in our accuracy tests. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nIt's not like I was starting from scratch. I'd already reviewed the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, Google Pixel Watch 4, Garmin Venu 4, Apple Watch Series 11 and Amazfit Bip 6, and each had proven itself in its category. There's a reason they landed on our best lists. But glancing at a workout summary and dissecting raw data are entirely different beasts.\n\nAfter two months and more than 30 miles of testing, I'm finally ready to share the results (and give my legs a rest). The biggest takeaway: All five watches performed well in real-world testing. None deviated by more than a few percentage points from the control when measuring steps and distance.\n\nHeart rate accuracy proved to be the biggest differentiator. On the surface, the watches looked similar: average and maximum heart rates were often only a few beats apart. But the gaps became clear in the second-by-second data. While most stayed within 8% of our control, the Apple Watch Series 11 remained within 1% of the Polar H10 chest strap, which served as our control, earning it the CNET Labs Award for most accurate heart rate tracking.\n\nThe Garmin Venu 4 came in second, recording heart rate every second compared to every 5 seconds on the Apple Watch. For most people, that level of granularity is overkill, but for serious athletes who depend on second-by-second feedback, it could be the deciding factor.\n\nHeart rate: electrodes vs. optical sensors\n\nHeart rate is one of the most important vitals your smartwatch tracks because it feeds into so many other metrics, like calories burned, intensity, heart rate variability (a measure of the variation in time between heartbeats), and VO2 max (the maximum amount of oxygen your body uses during exercise). As a casual fitness enthusiast, I regularly use live heart rate data from my watch to make runs and strength training workouts more intense.\n\nMost smartwatches, including the five we tested, take background heart rate readings at intervals throughout the day. However, they increase sampling frequency during exercise. Even a short workout can generate hundreds more data points than passive tracking alone.\n\nWe used the Polar H10 chest strap as our control during the heart rate tests. Giselle Castro-Sloboda/CNET\n\nCNET's heart rate test\n\nTo capture a broad range of heart rate data, I tested each watch individually across three separate 1-mile runs on a flat track. I held a moderate intensity for the first half of the run (roughly Zones 3 to 4), then went all out for the second half, pushing myself as close to my peak (Zone 5) as possible.\n\nI cleaned the sensors and secured each watch snugly (about one to two fingers below the wrist bone) before each run. Each watch was tested one at a time alongside a Polar H10 chest strap, CNET's top-rated consumer heart rate monitor. Unlike wrist-based optical sensors, which detect changes in blood flow using light, chest straps like Polar's use electrodes to directly measure the heart's electrical signals. Because of this method and proximity to the heart, chest straps are widely considered more precise than wrist-based devices. Matching that level of precision isn't realistic for a watch, but they're coming close.\n\nDuring testing, I noticed a consistent pattern: most watches lagged behind the chest strap during the first minute of a run, when heart rate rose rapidly from rest. Once I reached cruising altitude (Zones 3 and 4), the readings aligned more closely. But when I pushed into Zone 5, differences reappeared, with some watches struggling to keep up during spikes above 160 beats per minute. The Bip 6, for example, never registered my peak heart rate. That lag helps explain why workout summaries often look similar. Average and peak heart rate were just a few beats away from the chest strap, while the second-by-second analysis revealed significantly wider gaps.\n\nBecause raw, second-by-second heart rate data isn't easily accessible in most apps and can include thousands of data points, I teamed up with CNET Senior Lab Engineer Gianmarco Chumbe to interpret and map the results. The graph above shows just how close the Apple Watch Series 11 was to the Polar chest strap, with an error rate of less than 1% (an average of 1.4 bpm for the three tests). In our results, it tracked almost side-by-side throughout the run, even at the outer edges of the graph where the other watches struggled. This consistency earned it our Labs Award for most accurate heart rate tracking. There is, however, an important nuance.\n\nThe Apple Watch data we extracted (via the HealthFit app pulling from Apple Health) sampled heart rate roughly every five seconds. By comparison, the Polar chest strap and Garmin Venu 4 recorded data nearly every second. Of the data points we could compare, the Apple Watch was closest to the chest strap, but it had fewer data points. The Venu 4 matched the chest strap's sampling frequency, but with a slightly higher error rate of 3.89% (5.5 bpm). Those extra seconds of data could help guide training decisions and, over time, mean the difference between finishing strong and setting a new personal record.\n\nAll of the watches posted heart rate error rates below 8%, which is impressive -- especially at higher-intensity levels. It's worth noting these were short workouts (8-9 minutes per run). Because the Google Pixel Watch (5.6% error rate) and Samsung Galaxy Watch (6.6%) tended to catch up to the chest strap over time, longer runs would likely narrow some of those gaps. The Amazfit posted a similar overall error rate (7%), but struggled to capture the highest heart rate spikes. That limitation makes it less ideal for prioritizing heart rate precision for intense workouts.\n\nAfter over 30 miles of testing, I'm more convinced than ever that heart rate accuracy really does impact training. Over six weeks, my VO2 max climbed from 41.3 to 45.8, according to Apple Health. I haven't reached that level since before my third pregnancy three years ago. Without the watches and chest strap as a guide, I might not have recognized what \"pushing myself\" actually felt like in the moment.\n\nCNET distance test\n\nMeasuring distance proved significantly easier, both physically and technically. Distance accuracy matters because it also feeds into other metrics, such as pace, calories burned and training load (the duration and intensity of exercise over a specific period of time).\n\nThe most reliable way to test distance was on a route with precise measurements and minimal elevation change. (Credit goes to Gianmarco for suggesting a track test.) Most high school and college tracks are built to official specifications: 400 meters per lap. I found an old college track near my house that had been paved over, but remained within regulation length. I even broke out a measuring wheel to be sure. I ran every single test on this track, reliving high school mile day 30 times over, but with more knee pain.\n\nThis is the track as shown in the Polar H10 chest strap app (summary view, not raw data). Vanessa Hand Orellana/Polar/CNET\n\nWhile GPS is a major factor in outdoor tracking, distance is also calculated using accelerometer and motion sensor data. To control for variables, I put the watch's paired phone on airplane mode before each run to prevent it from using GPS. I photographed each watch display after every lap (400m increments) to capture a data point, repeating the process four times (1,600m is a little more than 1 mile).\n\nAll five watches were within a tenth of the actual distance, which is an impressively tight spread. The Apple Watch again led the pack, measuring my runs at 0.99 miles for all three tests. The runner-up was the Garmin Venu 4, which averaged 0.96 miles per test (only 0.03 miles behind the Apple Watch).\n\nAccurate distance tracking isn't reserved for premium price tags. The $80 Amazfit Bip 6 averaged 0.95 miles per test, proving it is more than capable for casual walkers or joggers looking to log miles.\n\nCNET's step test\n\nOnce considered the holy grail of fitness tracking, step count has slid down the metric hierarchy as more advanced health markers have taken center stage. And while the 10,000-step goal is somewhat arbitrary, it set a target and got people moving.\n\nToday, we know it's less important to hit a specific step count and more about walking and your progress over time. Steps remain an accessible starting point for many people, and accuracy is important. \"Extra credit\" from a faulty tracker can lull people into a false sense of accomplishment. And if a device can't nail the basics, it raises questions about the rest of its metrics.\n\nWhile pedometers were once considered the gold standard in this category, a $10 model today is likely less precise than the smartwatches on this list. Traditional pedometers use a simple mechanical switch triggered by hip movement, while most modern smartwatches use accelerometers and motion sensors to detect and measure movement in multiple directions.\n\nThis (photos) is how I'd keep tabs of the steps out in the field: smartwatch on the left and clicker (tally counter) in my right hand. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nTo test accuracy, I went old-school and counted every single step myself with a manual tally counter (like what you use for baseball). I also used StepsApp, a pedometer app on my phone, as a backup. I started with 1,000 steps for each watch on a flat path. I didn't use the track, but didn't follow the exact same route for every test, which may introduce minor variance.\n\nThe results were impressively tight; all within about 10 steps of the clicker. The Galaxy Watch 8's results (18 steps off) were the exception, but I suspected it might be a fluke. So I re-tested and raised the stakes; this time, walking 2,500 steps with each watch. The results were nearly identical. None deviated by more than 11 steps, or less than half of a percentage point.\n\nThe differences were negligible, so all of the watches were winners in this category, proving that you don't have to splurge for accuracy. That Amazfit Bip 6 is looking pretty fantastic right now.\n\nTwists, turns and variables to consider when tracking workouts\n\nEven with the best intentions, 30 miles of testing and a data scientist in my corner, there is no way to eliminate every variable in real-world conditions. These results aren't gospel. They're rigorous, repeated and carefully averaged, but they're still human, and your mileage may vary (pun intended).\n\nIt took more than 30 miles of testing before I felt comfortable putting results down on paper because I kept encountering variables, especially for heart rate.\n\nThe testing order was significant. The first watch in any session was always at a disadvantage because my heart rate started lower and spiked more dramatically. By the second and third runs -- even with deliberate rest periods to bring my heart rate back down -- the jump wasn't as sharp. Your body doesn't fully reset that quickly.\n\nTo mitigate this, I rotated the starting watch for each session. I limited each outing to three runs (three miles total), making sure that every device had a chance to be tested first, middle and last. Our Labs data and results (on the charts in the story) are averages of the error rates across these three tests.\n\nFit and sensor interference were other issues. My jacket sleeve occasionally moved the watch; warmer days meant more sweat by mile three, which can interfere with optical readings, and then there was the time I almost cut off my circulation from wearing the Galaxy Watch too tightly.\n\nThe data extraction nightmare\n\nThis is just a snapshot of the layers of folders and raw data we had to comb through to compare heart rate. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nThen came the data. Polar's raw heart rate data can be downloaded as a .CSV file (spreadsheet) ready for analysis.\n\nGarmin's is almost as easy, as long as you have a data analyst and Reddit thread on hand. It can export workout-specific heart rate data as a .TCX file, which was foreign to me. Gianmarco wrote custom code, based on info he found on Reddit, to extract and convert the data into a format that matched Polar's output. Amazfit required a similar conversion process.\n\nApple, Google and Samsung made us work for it. All three require exporting your entire health archive (and I mean everything, not just workouts or heart rate). For me, this meant downloading more than a decade of health data. Once extracted, the compressed file opens into a maze of nested folders with cryptic labels. The best strategy is to sort by date and hope that one of the files mentions heart rate.\n\nFor Google, I got lucky and found the right file after what felt like hours of searching. For Apple, several third-party apps are available that can do the sorting for you. I downloaded the $6 HealthFit app, which filters and extracts data directly from the Health app. However, the sampling frequency wasn't as dense as the Polar strap, leaving fewer data points for comparison. It's hard to say whether it would've been any different if I'd been able to extract it directly from the Health app.\n\nWith Samsung, the only workable option was to use the Strava app as a middleman. I started workouts in the Strava watch app and exporting the data to the desktop version. All of this took two people many hours across multiple days to figure out. Accessing your own health data shouldn't be this hard.\n\nThe paved college track at sunset where I completed all distance and heart rate testing. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nSmartwatch accuracy bottom line\n\nIf heart rate accuracy is your top priority, the $400 Apple Watch Series 11 is what to buy. It was the all-around winner, consistently strong across every category and the most precise for heart rate, staying within 1% of the chest strap during runs.\n\nBut the bigger takeaway after 30 miles of testing is that you can't go wrong with any of these watches; it just depends on what you value most.\n\nThe $550 Garmin Venu 4 may be better suited for data nerds and serious athletes. It's Gianmarco's pick: \"The combination of high fidelity and clean export access makes it especially appealing for users like me, who want full visibility into their training data.\"\n\nIt's also the best option for Android phone owners wanting elite-level heart rate tracking.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 8 (both $350) are reliable for steps, distance and overall heart rate trends. You may not get the same second-by-second precision during intervals, but for everyday workouts, they're more than capable. And the Amazfit Bip 6 is the reminder that accurate distance tracking doesn't have to be expensive. For beginners looking to build a baseline without a major investment, it's better than its $80 price suggests."

            "content": "President Donald Trump on Friday called for US federal agencies to stop using Anthropic's Claude AI after the company refused to grant the Department of Defense permission to use it for mass domestic surveillance or for fully autonomous weapons systems.\n\nThe president posted on the Truth Social platform, which he owns, that he is ordering the federal government to \"IMMEDIATELY CEASE\" use of Anthropic's tools, saying there would be a six-month phaseout for agencies like the Department of Defense. He also decried Anthropic as a \"RADICAL LEFT, WOKE COMPANY.\" The post signaled the latest step in a showdown that escalated significantly this week between Anthropic and the federal government.\n\nClaude is widely used across the Pentagon, including in classified systems, but the Trump administration has sought to use the technology for \"any lawful purpose.\" Anthropic has insisted in its existing contract that the technology not be used for mass surveillance of Americans or in autonomous offensive weapons systems without human input.\n\nEarlier this week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei that he would invoke seldom-used powers to either force Anthropic to let the Pentagon use Claude for any lawful purpose or label the company a supply chain risk -- jeopardizing its use by the government or defense contractors. Hegseth gave Anthropic a Friday deadline to comply.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a statement that the company, which was founded with a stated focus on AI safety, \"cannot in good conscience accede to [the Pentagon's] request\" that it remove contract provisions stating Claude cannot be used in fully autonomous weapons systems or for domestic surveillance.\n\n\n\nWorries about AI and mass surveillance\n\nAmodei raised concerns that the law has not caught up with the potential for mass surveillance of Americans. The government can already buy information like Americans' browsing history and records of individual movements without a warrant, but artificial intelligence raises the stakes. \"Powerful AI makes it possible to assemble this scattered, individually innocuous data into a comprehensive picture of any person's life -- automatically and at massive scale,\" he wrote.\n\nMichael Pastor, dean for technology law programs at New York Law School, said in an email that it's typical in contract law for those involved to seek clarity on terms. \"Anthropic is right to press hard on what 'for lawful purposes' means,\" he said. \"If the Pentagon is unwilling to clarify whether it would use Anthropic's technology for mass domestic surveillance, that raises flags Anthropic seems justified in waving.\"\n\nAnthropic's Claude is reportedly the most widely used AI system by the US military. Alternatives could include tools from OpenAI, Google or Elon Musk's xAI.\n\nIn an internal memo reported by The Wall Street Journal Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly told employees that the company has the same red lines as Anthropic -- no mass domestic surveillance or autonomous offensive weapons. Altman said he believed those guardrails could be managed through technical requirements, such as requiring models to be deployed in the cloud. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\n\nEmployees of Google and OpenAI circulated a petition calling for their companies to stand with Anthropic in refusing to allow the use of AI models for domestic mass surveillance or fully autonomous lethal weapons systems. The petition said the Pentagon is \"trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in. That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.\"\n\nJust as in consumer technology, artificial intelligence systems have seen widespread adoption in government and military cases. These tools have seen their capabilities grow significantly just in the past few years, and that pace of change has not slowed. Regulation and oversight of AI haven't kept up. AI has magnified the potential harms of corporate or government surveillance by making it easier and cheaper.\n\nPastor said this dispute could have significant ramifications for what leverage governments and tech companies have against each other when their views on the appropriate use of technology clash. \"Anthropic may feel that yielding here opens a Pandora's box of uses for which Claude could be deployed,\" he said."
