            "content": "CHELSEA posted the biggest loss in English football history – despite cashing in on the Club World Cup.\n\nFigures published by Uefa showed the Blues recorded a pre-tax loss of £342million last season, the second-highest loss any European club has ever made.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes with Uefa’s latest European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report finding the Tod Boehly-led takeover has seen Chelsea become by far world football’s biggest total spenders.\n\nChelsea’s five-year spend on new players was £1.94billion, adding up to them once again having the most expensively-assembled squad in world history, with the players who ended 2025 under now-sacked Enzo Maresca having cost £1.52bn in total, up a further £90m from 12 months earlier.\n\nThe pre-tax loss was double the £165m posted by French crisis club Lyon and second only to the Covid era £484m lost by Barcelona in 2021.\n\nWhile the club declined to make a public comment, it is understood that Chelsea argue the figures relate to “one-off, non-cash accounting adjustments” required to meet Uefa guidelines.\n\nStamford Bridge bosses insist the numbers will have NO impact on the club’s transfer activities and that there is “no requirement for the club to sell core or key squad players”.\n\nChelsea maintain their financial model is “stable” and compliant with Uefa regulations, while contracts are now more heavily incentivised based on performance.\n\nDespite that, Chelsea were fined £80m by Uefa in the summer and agreed to a four-year “settlement agreement” after their squad costs reached nearly 90 per cent of revenue, well above the 70 per cent limit for clubs in European competition.\n\nUnlike the Premier League, Uefa did not allow Chelsea to include the in-house sales of the hotel at Stamford Bridge and the club’s women’s team in their accounts.\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nThe Uefa figures found Manchester United and Arsenal joined the Blues as football’s biggest net spenders over the past five years.\n\nUnited’s transfer activities from 2021 to 2025 reached a staggering £692m in the first half of this decade, despite gross transfer fees paid being only the third highest, at a fraction under £1.1bn.\n\n£569 for 5-night trip to Spanish Grand Prix SUNSPORT readers can save £30 with our discount trip to the Spanish Grand Prix This five-night holiday in June costs just £569pp with our exclusive extra 5% discount.

            "content": "CRISTIANO RONALDO has extended his incredible business empire even further.\n\nThe Portuguese superstar, 41, boasts a wealth of different ventures, investing his sizeable wages over the years into all kinds of companies to cement himself as football’s first billionaire.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he added to his brimming portfolio by becoming a co-owner of Spanish football club UD Almeria, who were bought by a Saudi investment group last year.\n\nRonaldo bought a 25 per cent stake in the second-tier outfit through his CR7 Sports Investments company.\n\n\n\nHe said: “It has been a longtime ambition of mine to contribute to football, beyond the pitch.\n\n“UD Almeria is a Spanish club with strong foundations and clear potential for growth.\n\n“I look forward to working alongside the leadership team to support the club’s next phase of growth.”\n\nAnd being a part-owner of a football club adds to the long list of side hustles Ronaldo already has – on top of his plethora of sponsorship deals with the likes of Nike, Armani and Tag Heuer.\n\n\n\nHOTELS\n\nEarlier in February, SunSport exclusively revealed Ronaldo is ready to expand his hotel and bar business to the UK.\n\nThe forward signed a deal with Portuguese hotel chain Pestana in 2016 for Ronaldo-branded resorts and bars.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL – BEST CASINO BONUSES FROM £10 DEPOSITS\n\nThe chain have CR7 hotels in Madeira, Lisbon, Madrid, New York and Marrakech.\n\nAnd now Pestana CR7 have applied to register their trademark in the UK.\n\nA source said: “Cristiano is a smart man, and makes smart business decisions.\n\n\n\n“He’s still adored in Manchester and knows there is a market there for him if he ever wanted to open a bar.”\n\n\n\nGYMS & HEALTH\n\nRonaldo, for many, is the epitome of peak physical conditioning.\n\nSo it is no wonder he is capitalising on his hard-earned reputation with a series of health-related ventures.\n\nHe has CR7 Crunch Fitness gyms across Portugal and Spain where his own bespoke training routines are on offer.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d’Or winner is proud of his hair, too – hence investing into Insparya health and medical clinics which focus on hair treatments, with centres in Spain and Portugal and now the Middle East.\n\nRonaldo owns Ursu9, which is labelled as “much more than water” because of its natural antioxidants, alkaline pH and minerals – although it looks and sounds very much like bottled water.\n\n\n\nHe invested heavily in Bioniq in 2024, a health company focused on using blood tests to personalise vitamin supplements.\n\nRecovery is also important for Ronaldo, which helps explain why he set up AvaCR7 – linking up with Ava – to sell various training, massage guns and trackers.\n\n\n\nSPORT\n\nOn a similar theme, Ronaldo has heavily invested in sport – even before putting money into Almeria.\n\nAs well as football, he loves padel and spent around £4.5million to set up the Padel City padel club in Lisbon in 2025.\n\nIn the same year, he became a shareholder in the new WOW FC MMA promotion.\n\n\n\nCLOTHING BRAND\n\nArguably Ronaldo’s most famous and instantly recognisable company is his very own CR7 brand.\n\nHe launched the fashion label way back in 2006 with a boutique in Madeira and then expanded to Lisbon – and beyond.\n\n\n\nOne of the key focuses is underwear – any excuse for Cristiano to strip down to his boxers for a modelling shoot, eh.\n\nBut they also sell shirts, shoes and even fragrances.\n\nWe might not be able to play football like the serial goalscorer, but at least we can smell like him.\n\n\n\nMOVIES\n\nWe all know Ronaldo likes to be in front of the cameras.\n\nHe has featured in various documentaries about himself including a film in 2015.\n\nBut now he is preparing for a life behind the camera.\n\nHe launched the independent UR-Marv movie studio in April 2025 with British filmmaker Matthew Vaughn, husband of Claudia Schiffer and investor in Brentford.\n\n\n\nThey say their style of “embracing innovative technology, with a nod to tradition” is designed to shake up conventional filmmaking.\n\nVaughn said: “Cristiano has created stories on the pitch that I could never have written, and I look forward to creating inspiring movies with him – he’s a real-life superhero.”\n\nRonaldo added: “This is an exciting chapter for me, as I look ahead to new ventures in business.”\n\nRonaldo was also part of the investment group to buy Confina Media, a Portuguese media company that owns the country’s best-selling newspaper and a TV station and which they rebranded Expressao Livre.\n\n\n\nTECH\n\nErakulis could have gone in the health section but it finds itself here as Ronaldo’s flagship app, combining fitness, nutrition and wellbeing in one platform for the goal of longevity.\n\nThe app has the motto “Live Healthier, Live Longer” and Ronaldo says: “You don’t need to be perfect, you just need to be consistent. When you take care of your body and mind every day, life becomes easier.”\n\nHe also launched Viva Ronaldo, a social media network app, in 2013 – two years after his iPhone game, Heads Up With Ronaldo.\n\nIn more recent times, he has invested into tech company Perplexity AI, wearable health brand Whoop and football video game UFL.\n\n\n\nLUXURY & RETAIL\n\nRonaldo is a man of style, as we well know.\n\n\n\nSo although it is a little out of his ordinary wheelhouse, it does make sense that Ronaldo bought a 30 per cent stake in Vista Alegre.\n\nThe famous Portuguese company specialises in porcelain and crystal and sells their high-end products around the world.\n\nHe also stumped up £770m of his own capital to invest in Chrono24 – an online watch marketplace with more than 9m monthly visitors.\n\nRonaldo said: “As a long-term watch collector and regular user of Chrono24, it’s a pleasure for me to become a shareholder in the company now.\n\n“Chrono24 unites millions of watch lovers from all around the world to share in their passion, together – that global unification is something I know well and am thrilled to be a part of.”\n\n\n\nPROPERTY\n\nAnd the last category is Ronaldo’s property.\n\n\n\nRonaldo has no shortage of expensive cars that may appreciate in value over the years, especially with him as an owner.\n\nBut he also has invested heavily in his homes for him to live in with partner Georgina and his kids – with £43m worth of pads all over the world from Madeira to Manchester to Marbella to Madrid and more.\n\nRonaldo has also bought luxury villas on a private island and one of the most exclusive retreats in the world – the Nujuma, Ritz-Carlton Reserve Residence in the Red Sea.\n\nThe secluded resort is only accessible by chartered boat or seaplane and is nearly 26km away from the Saudi Arabian mainland – with stays costing north of £5,500 per night.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nRonaldo described the place as “close to heaven” and said: “The Red Sea is a truly remarkable place. From the moment we first visited, Georgina and I felt a connection with the island and its natural beauty – it’s a place where we feel at peace.\n\n\n\n“Now we have a home here, we can enjoy quality time with family in complete privacy and serenity any time we like.”"

Maybe it’s a sign!\n\n\n\n“So many people at my school and even my teachers saw me on Sky and have been celebrating with me.\n\n“What I love most about Bukayo Saka is that as well as being a great player, he is a really nice person and he’s been such a role model for me.\n\n“I hope he pushes on and helps Arsenal win the title this season!”\n\nCelebrate good times\n\nYOU can take the player out of Hale End – but you cannot take Hale End out of the players.\n\nThat seems to be the case for Alex Iwobi and Emile Smith Rowe, who celebrated Arsenal’s win over Spurs while on the bus back from Fulham’s victory at Sunderland.\n\n\n\nThe pair were watching the North London Derby on the coach home and clips of it have gone viral on social media.\n\nFulham defender Ryan Sessegnon, who played for Tottenham, gets plenty of stick from Iwobi and Smith Rowe.\n\nAnd Smith Rowe even celebrated Gyokeres scoring by mimicking the Swedish striker’s famous mask celebration.\n\nSquad games\n\nARTETA has been handed a squad boost for the title run-in after it was made official that no Arsenal player can be suspended for accumulation of yellow cards in the Premier League.\n\n\n\nPlayers who accumulate 10 yellow cards in Prem matches up to and including their side’s 32nd fixture will serve a two-match suspension in the competition.\n\nBut with no Arsenal player currently amassing more than five yellow cards this term, and there being only four games left until that 32nd fixture, Arsenal will avoid any suspensions for yellow card accumulation.\n\nThe Gunners are also yet to receive a red card in the Premier this season and will be hoping to become just the third team in history to win the title without having anyone sent off.\n\nOnly Manchester United (1992-93) and Chelsea (2004-05 and 2016-17) have completed that feat before.\n\n\n\nIt’s a stark change for Arteta’s side, who had previously gained a reputation for a poor disciplinary record during the Spaniard’s first few years in charge at the Emirates.\n\nEll-is of a surprise\n\nJAMES ELLIS leaving his post as Arsenal technical director after just a few months in that job is a surprise.\n\nHe had only been promoted seven months ago, with the intention that he would provide support to new sporting director Andrea Berta.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIn fact, he was doing a lot of work for Berta behind the scenes in terms of the academy, dealing with parents and sorting out contracts like Max Dowman’s plus a number of highly-rated youngsters who have joined the club.\n\nEllis, understood to be a strong character, had very clear plans of the direction he wanted to take the academy during the 2026-27 season and that did not seem to align with those above him."

Manchester United confirmed during January that the midfielder will depart when his contract runs out on 30 June.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCasemiro's agreement contains a clause to extend by a further year, but the club have opted not to retain him for a fifth year. With fewer than six months left on his existing contract, the Brazil international can negotiate a pre-contract arrangement with clubs beyond England.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNo agreement has yet emerged publicly. However, Casemiro is understood to be eager to remain in Europe.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nThe Sun reports sources close to the player have suggested Italy represents a possible destination. They point to his former Real Madrid teammate Luka Modric and his transfer to AC Milan last summer as a precedent.\n\nCasemiro is six-and-a-half years younger than the 2018 Ballon d'Or recipient, who celebrated his 40th birthday in September. He has also devoted the past 13 years of his career to playing European football since departing Sao Paulo in January 2013, initially on loan, for Madrid.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeculation regarding a switch to Italy comes after former United striker Dion Dublin's appeal for Casemiro to remain. He told OLBG that United ought to allocate some of their transfer funds to offer him fresh terms.\n\nView 2 Images Casemiro could follow Luka Modric to Italy this summer (Image: DeFodi Images, DeFodi Images via Getty Images)\n\nDublin said: \"[Casemiro's] been sort of 75% and he's had his dips where people said, 'oh, his legs are gone, oh, his legs are gone, he can't run around anymore, he can't do this, he can't do that. To be honest with you, I retired at 39; my legs went about 33.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"If you can do your job and you're clever with it, then I think you'll have a long time in the game. I retired at 39, so I knew how to manage my body.\n\n\"The managers that I had knew how to manage me,' just do two or three days of training, that's fine,' because they knew what they'd get on a match day. I think it's the same with Casemiro.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"His footballing brain and knowledge are just outstanding. If you watch Casemiro, who tries to play a pass and it gets cut out, and then the other team go and breaks, and they might have had a chance, but if that pass comes up again, he'll try it again.\n\n\"I just think you have to try and find somebody when he goes, that's as brave as him, as clever as him, and as Man United as him, to be honest with you, because he's loved it. Absolutely, I like watching him play.\"\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Carrick has made an impressive start to his second stint in the Old Trafford hot seat.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nStepping in as Ruben Amorim's interim successor until the season's close, the ex-midfielder has returned to the dugout and already steered United into a favourable position in the battle for Champions League qualification. The Reds have remained undefeated under Carrick, securing five wins from their six matches, including notable triumphs over Manchester City, Arsenal, and Tottenham.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCurrently occupying fourth place, they are merely three points adrift of third-placed Aston Villa. Despite widespread knowledge that United's board plan to appoint a new permanent manager in the summer, there is increasing demand for Carrick to be awarded the role full-time.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDublin, speaking to OLBG, has suggested that making Carrick the permanent manager might not be such a poor decision after all. He said: \"I think you have to leave it as it is because if it's working, then don't mess with it. You know, don't tinker with it.\n\n\"The players seem to be on board with Michael.

The dressing room seems to believe that what they're doing is the right thing. I suppose the question is, can he keep it going? Well, what manager can do that? What manager can consistently win and win and win? I just think you leave it as it is.\"\n\n\"United at this present time and it hasn't been for years, is stable. It's stable, it's strong. And when you watch Man United now, and I've been in the stands a few times at some of Michael's matches, it's like watching Man United, which is very odd. It hasn't been like that for a long time.\"\n\nThe ex-Aston Villa striker Dublin admitted that United will undoubtedly consider big-name contenders like Zinedine Zidane, yet he remains convinced Carrick has demonstrated he possesses the credentials to succeed at the Theatre of Dreams.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Dublin believes Carrick can bring Man United back to their best (Image: PA)\n\n\"But the biggest and the best allegedly have had a go,\" Dublin continued. \"Have had a go before, Michael, and it just hasn't worked, you know.\n\n\"The best up and coming, the best coaches, the best football, the best results in Portugal, the best results in Germany, whatever it may be, they're all getting the best results, but who's done what Michael's done?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

The 58-year-old left the Reds in 2024 after nearly nine years in charge.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nKlopp remains an immensely popular figure among Liverpool supporters, having led the club to Premier League and Champions League silverware. The German manager pointed to exhaustion as his motivation for leaving the club, with successor Arne Slot leading Liverpool to their second league title in the Premier League era in his first season.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn January 2025, Klopp began a brand new role as head of global soccer for Red Bull, with several clubs under his watch. Recent claims in Austria suggested Red Bull wouldn't block Klopp if he opted to resume management duties, though these suggestions have subsequently been refuted.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhile Klopp has been associated with various positions since departing Anfield, he has indicated he's in no hurry to make any changes from his current post and return to the dugout. When questioned about whether he would ever return to English football, Klopp declined to entirely dismiss a Liverpool return - though don't expect to see him in charge of a rival.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Do I have to make the decision today? Then I will not coach again. But thank God, I don't have to do that. I can just see what the future brings.\"\n\nWhen asked what might tempt him back into management, Klopp said: \"I don't even know exactly, I love what I do right now, don't miss coaching; I don't miss standing in the rain for two-and-a-half or three hours; I don't miss going to press conferences four times, three times a week or having 10-12 interviews a week.\n\nView 2 Images Klopp has been Red Bull's global head of soccer since 2025 (Image: RONNY HARTMANN, AFP via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I don't miss the dressing room as a dressing room, but sitting in a restaurant with the players having a chat, that's nice. We won a lot of games so there was often a very good mood in the building. I still have Virgil [van Dijk's] laugh in my ear for example.\"\n\nRumours in Austria pointed to Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner being earmarked as a potential successor to Klopp at Red Bull. However, CEO Oliver Mintzlaff has rubbished suggestions the company is dissatisfied with the work the Liverpool legend has delivered so far.\n\n\"This is complete nonsense and completely plucked out of thin air,\" Mintzlaff stated. \"On the contrary, we are extremely satisfied with the work Jurgen Klopp is doing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n\"He invests a great deal of time and effort, he is in constant communication with our coaches and sporting directors, and continues to develop our Red Bull football philosophy in a sustainable way.

And it is likely to signal a revolution in the multi-billion pound business of TV rights and could change the way every armchair viewer watches the English top flight.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPremier League chief executive Richard Masters revealed they are starting the new project by launching a new direct-to-viewer streaming service with broadcaster StarHub in Singapore. That will act as a pilot for the Premier League + channel and it will show all 380 games live as well as magazine content starting next season.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThere is currently a 3pm blackout in the UK but foreign deals would be exempt from rules showing games live on a Saturday. Prem insiders insist there are no immediate plans to scrap the blackout in the UK despite a growing belief in the industry that it could be ditched after the next TV deal in 2029.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPrem bosses are hoping Premier League + will be a big success in the Far East and that could then pave the way for the 20 clubs to sell their TV rights directly to the viewers.\n\nMasters, talking at the FT Live Business of Football Summit, said: “For the first time, we’re going direct-to-consumer in Singapore. It’s a very long, considered process, carefully chosen. We have a six-year agreement with StarHub, one of the two providers out there.

Barroso/Getty Images)\n\nLa Liga chief Javier Tebas has delivered a double blast at the Premier League. Tebas called it a “failure” that Manchester City’s case has still not been resolved more than three years after they were hit with 115 charges.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd Tebas also warned the Premier League’s new financial rules will cause huge transfer and wage inflation across Europe. It came as Premier League chief executive Richard Masters sidestepped the City issue once again as he said: “I can’t talk about it and talk about the timing of it. Having spent three years not talking about it, I’m not going to stop now obviously.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut Tebas did not hold back at the Premier League taking such a long time to reach a conclusion on the City case, even though Everton and Nottingham Forest were dealt with quickly and issued points deductions.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTebas said: “It’s a failure of Premier League governance. Other clubs are looking at and watching this and seeing what’s going on. They are being fined and having points deductions and that’s fine, if you don’t abide by the rules.\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

FFP is what everyone has to apply at home. You can’t spend more than our revenues. But then new regulations here will cause more inflation and more problems.

They're not even regulars in the Champions League.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn fact, for spending a net fee of £692million, the Manchester outfit only have an FA Cup and a Carabao Cup to show for it. That figure is across a five-year period, detailed in a UEFA financial report. They have spent more than Chelsea (£656m) and Arsenal (£587m) but their squad still has a number of holes.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThis summer has shown some green shoots with proven performers Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha both being signed. Benjamin Sesko, despite a slow start, was regarded among the best young strikers in Europe.\n\nBut since 2021, United have had three permanent managers, seen a new ownership structure come in, major changes to their hierarchy, which includes differing sporting directors. Add it all up and you get a plethora of different strategies, the majority of which haven't worked.\n\nMan Utd star Senne Lammens reveals secret to success under Michael Carrick READ MORE :\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt means huge sums have been spent on players who have underdelivered. A narrative that has continued to drag on. Equally the club have overlooked players they've had on their books. In the years after Ferguson's departure the club had a thing for big names, often downplaying some of the talent they already possessed.\n\nThey've look to move away from that but the success of players in their post-Old Trafford eras suggests they're still getting it wrong. The numbers don't lie and United's reputation for being poor at buying and selling is not baseless as we detail some of their biggest failings in the market.\n\nTen Hag's Antony wish\n\nIf anything summed up the United failings since 2013 it was constantly allowing managers to call the shots, signing whoever they wanted, sometimes for however much they wanted. Whatever sell Erik ten Hag gave to the United bosses about Antony, it worked. So much so that they paid an initial £80m to land the Brazilian, who had been impressive at Ajax, but certainly not a player deserving of that fee.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Erik ten Hag got his man within months of arriving in Manchester\n\nA debut goal against Arsenal was as good as it got, but within months he was the poster boy of another summer of failed recruitment. The damning thing about the environment at Old Trafford is that Antony has looked a competent player at Real Betis, but joining the Spanish side for £21m represents a staggering loss.\n\nUnproven Hojlund\n\nNot content to spend big on one unproven player sought by Ten Hag, United pulled off the same trick a year later. In need of a striker the club scoured the market and landed on a 20-year-old Dane who had scored 10 goals in 34 appearances for Atalanta.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe then United boss batted away concerns over his age and lack of experience. Instead he was sold as a player for the long-term, one who would develop. Nevertheless £70m is a lot to fork out for a project player, one who took until late December to score in the Premier League for the first time. After two years he was deemed surplus to requirements, now at Napoli, who have a £38m clause to buy him in the summer.\n\nView 4 Images Rasmus Hojlund and Scott McTominay both call Napoli home after being deemed surplus to requirements at Old Trafford (Image: Getty Images)\n\nMagnificent McTominay\n\nIn Italy Hojlund can class one Scott McTominay, named the best player in Serie A last year, as his team-mate. The same McTominay who formed part of a defensive midfield duo with Fred, known as McFred, that were ridiculed at times. The Scot was never seen as a player capable of being overly productive in the final third.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHis goalscoring exploits in his final season came as something of a shock and Ten Hag was happy to move him on for £25m. For context, Arsenal moved on Emile Smith Rowe that same summer for even more cash. McTominay would be the big winner from the move, landing an Italian title, a new adoring fanbase and would now command more than double what United sold him for.\n\nOle's final summer falls flat\n\nMcTominay was part of the United squad in the summer of 2021 when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, off the back of finishing second, went for it in the transfer market in a bid to take the final step. His spree included the £70m signing of Jadon Sancho, Raphael Varane for £34m and the return of Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nView 4 Images Jadon Sancho was signed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but has come nowhere near repaying his fee\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWithin months the Norwegian boss was axed following a huge demise. Ronaldo's influence was question, Sancho has never lived up to his fee and is due to leave for nothing when his contract expires this summer. Varane too left on a free. A summer that promised a lot, delivered next to nothing.\n\nYouth undervalued\n\nIf Solskjaer did one thing it was, largely, give youth a go. Some of his loyalties though cost the club, as was the case with Dean Henderson. The goalkeeper was the coming man when he returned from Sheffield United, but Solskjaer remained loyal to David de Gea and Henderson's patience ran out. He was sold for just £15m and has since become an FA Cup winner.\n\nAnthony Elanga scored the winner to down United whilst at Nottingham Forest last season. His exploits earned him a move to Newcastle, who paid £55m to land his services, two years after the Red Devils had cashed in on him for £15m.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThese are by no means two isolated incidents. Alvaro Carreras once called Manchester home, but was never given a look in before being sold to Benfica in 2024 for £7.8m. A year later and Real Madrid paid £43m to bring him to the Bernabeu. United are either undervaluing or underusing these players. Either way its not a good look and has an impact on the balance sheet.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Signed for £72m as a promising striker filled with potential just two years earlier, he was pushed out of Old Trafford to make way for Sesko over the summer.\n\nImage: Sesko celebrates his winner in the 1-0 win at Everton\n\nSesko is beginning to show signs he can bear the burden of being United's No. 9 - but three of his five goals have come as a substitute and the other two against promoted-side Burnley, currently second from bottom.\n\nHow Sesko copes when he is the regular starter will be the true test of the 22-year-old.\n\n\"It's a lot of pressure,\" Neville said. \"The biggest pressure in English football, that's a Manchester United goalkeeper, but not far behind would be a striker who comes for big money to United.\n\n\"When you come in as a striker with a big price tag, you've got to deliver and he's starting to deliver.\n\n\"There is a danger that maybe that he's sort of getting that super-sub title, but I don't think he's that type. He's a starting player. He has been a super sub in the last few games because he's needed to be.\n\n\"I don't think he's ever going to be the perfect striker, like I said about Gyokeres. But if he can be a handful, contribute with goals, hold things up, link play, that'll be enough. You don't have to be always perfect and [his winner at Everton], it's a big moment for him.\n\n\"If he can get another four or five and finish this season in double figures, in his first season with the struggle that the team were having at the beginning, I think that would be deemed to be a good season.\"\n\nManchester United\n\nCrystal Palace Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\nSesko faced questions about how he copes with the scrutiny of being United's goalscorer after his winner at Everton as the conversation soon turned to whether he would start at Palace.\n\n\"The pressure is something that, if I want to be a good player, it's something that I have to have,\" Sesko said.\n\n\"It's something that has (to be there) if you want to play at the highest level and it's about accepting it and not really caring about it.\"\n\nSesko has made a strong case to be in from the start against Palace. It is now up to Carrick to decide whether now is the right time to open the door for the young striker.\n\nWatch Man Utd vs Crystal Palace on Sunday, live on Sky Sports, kick-off 2pm"

            "content": "Welcome to The Radar, a Sky Sports column in which Nick Wright uses a blend of data and opinion to shed light on need-to-know stories from up and down the Premier League. This week:\n\n9️⃣ Joao Pedro excelling as Chelsea's striker\n\n🧱 Maguire crucial for Carrick at Man Utd\n\n🔍 Two players to watch this weekend\n\nJoao Pedro's evolution\n\nFew forwards have caused more problems for William Saliba and Gabriel this season than Joao Pedro on his last visit to the Emirates Stadium. The Carabao Cup tie ended in defeat for Chelsea but Joao Pedro returns on Sunday aiming for a repeat performance.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Liam Rosenior gave a candid press conference after Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley\n\nThe 24-year-old spent that evening dragging the Arsenal centre-backs out of position and showing impressive strength to hold them off with his back to goal. He linked the play, ran the channels, won twice as many fouls as anyone else and gave Chelsea an outlet.\n\nAll that was missing was a goal but those have hardly been in short supply lately. Joao Pedro has seven in his last nine appearances for Chelsea. Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres is the only Premier League player to have scored more since the turn of the year.\n\nThe increase in his scoring output, from eight goals in 30 appearances earlier this season to seven in his last nine, coincides with the appointment of Liam Rosenior, who said last week that Joao Pedro can become one of the best strikers in the world.\n\nFanciful, some may say, but there is no doubting the strides he has taken. Joao Pedro's goal against Burnley was his 11th in the Premier League this term. He has reached that total despite losing the penalty-taking privileges he enjoyed at former club Brighton.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Joao Pedro has scored more than twice as many non-penalty goals as in any of his previous top-flight campaigns. Erling Haaland and Antoine Semenyo are the only players with more in the Premier League this season.\n\nHaving split his time between the No 10 and No 9 positions for Brighton, and indeed for Chelsea under Enzo Maresca following his £60m arrival in July, Joao Pedro has been used almost exclusively up front by Rosenior, despite the availability of Liam Delap.\n\nImage: Joao Pedro is spending less time out wide and in his own half, and more in the opposition box\n\nChelsea's last meeting with Arsenal showcased his ability with his back to goal, but overall, Joao Pedro is less involved in general play, averaging fewer touches and fewer passes under Rosenior as the new head coach tries to maximise his threat in the box.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

It has allowed him to have roughly twice as many shots. And while he remains capable of spectacular strikes, like his first goal in the Champions League win over Napoli, he has mostly hunted down easier chances.\n\nHis goal against Burnley, forced over the line from Pedro Neto's cross, was his second from inside the six-yard box under Rosenior and put him on five for the season, the joint-highest total by any player along with Leeds striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nImage: Joao Pedro's shot maps show an increased concentration of close-range chances\n\nHelped, of course, by the better service on offer at Chelsea compared to Brighton, Joao Pedro's shot quality is transformed. Excluding penalties, he has gone from averaging 0.12 expected goals per shot at Brighton last term to 0.21 per shot at Chelsea.\n\nRosenior has challenged Joao Pedro to raise the intensity of his play and he has stepped up on that front too, both in terms of his pressing and his attacking movement. He has increased both the volume and effectiveness of his runs in behind.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

But carry on scoring at the same rate and he will eclipse the totals of those to have come closest in Nicolas Jackson, who scored 14 two seasons ago, and Tammy Abraham, who hit 15 in 2019/20.\n\nArsenal\n\nChelsea Sunday 1st March 4:25pm Kick off 4:30pm\n\nBefore all that, though, there is Sunday's trip to the Emirates Stadium, and another opportunity for a striker establishing himself among the elite to test Saliba and Gabriel.\n\nMaguire key to Man Utd resurgence\n\nBenjamin Sesko is another No 9 catching the eye but Manchester United's resurgence under Michael Carrick owes just as much to their defensive performances. It's three clean sheets in six games so far. The return of Harry Maguire has made a difference.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights from the Premier League match between Everton and Manchester United.\n\nMaguire had not started in two months at the time Carrick's appointment due to a thigh issue but his return to fitness has proved timely for the new head coach. The 32-year-old is in line to start a seventh consecutive game against Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\nHe has mostly featured alongside Lisandro Martinez, with Ruben Amorim's back three now a thing of the past. But with Martinez absent due to injury against Everton on Monday, he proved similarly influential next to Leny Yoro, using his experience to guide the young defender and reaching double figures for clearances.\n\nImage: Harry Maguire has the best duel success rate in the Premier League since January 17\n\nThe quality of Maguire's defensive work has been apparent across the last six Premier League games. Having won 36 of his 44 duels in that period, he has the highest success rate of any player.\n\nHis future at Manchester United is uncertain, with his contract due to expire in the summer. A place in England's World Cup is no guarantee either given he has not yet had a call-up from Thomas Tuchel. Clearly, though, he has a lot left to offer.\n\nManchester United\n\nCrystal Palace Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\nPlayer Radar: Who else to keep an eye on\n\nAlex Iwobi and Emile Smith Rowe celebrated their former club Arsenal's North London derby win over Spurs in a video published on social media after helping Fulham beat Sunderland. Next up? Spurs at home, and a chance to inflict more pain on Igor Tudor's side.\n\nOn Friday Night Football, Wolves host Aston Villa live on Sky Sports Premier League and Main Event from 7.30pm, kick-off 8pm.\n\nLeeds against Man City is the Saturday Night Football, live on Sky Sports Premier League and Main Event from 5pm, kick-off 5.30pm\n\nWatch Brighton vs Nottingham Forest, Fulham vs Spurs and Man Utd vs Crystal Palace from 1pm across Sky Sports on Sunday, kicking off at 2pm, before Arsenal vs Chelsea at 4.30pm.\n\nThe last column proved a timely one as it outlined the need for Arsenal to unlock Eberechi Eze's full potential before he went and delivered his two-goal performance against Spurs."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says his task at Tottenham is the biggest rescue-job of his career.\n\nThe Spurs head coach arrived in the Premier League with a reputation for instant-impact turnarounds at previous clubs he's managed, having helped Juventus and Lazio secure European football and Udinese avoid relegation.\n\nHowever, following the 4-1 thrashing at home to Arsenal last weekend in his first game in charge, which ramped up the relegation pressure on Spurs, Tudor admitted the scale of his challenge now is the greatest of his career.\n\nSpurs are just four points above the relegation zone and haven't won a league game in 2026.\n\n\"If I recognised the difficulties there are, probably yes [it is the biggest],\" he said in his press conference ahead of Sunday's trip to Fulham, which is live on Sky Sports.\n\n\"It's an even bigger motivation that we do it,\" he added.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights from the Premier League clash between Tottenham and Arsenal.\n\nTudor also said it is now all about results for Tottenham, regardless of style of play ,such is the severity of their situation.\n\n\"There's not too much time to think about performance or style,\" he said.\n\n\"Every game needs to be prepared in that way: How are we going to take the points? One way or the other way.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it's for me very clear. I'm not that kind of coach who doesn't want to cure style, how we perform - but in this moment it's not possible to think about those kind of things.\"\n\nHe later said: \"The style is second because it's a question of life and death, if I can say that sportingly.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player On The Premier League Show, we assess whether Tottenham Hotspur are too good to be relegated this season.\n\nAnd on the mentality required, he suggested Spurs should see themselves like an underdog.\n\n\"In Italy they use the term, 'have the mentality of a small team',\" he explained.\n\n\"That's the key always, to have the willingness and motivation like you play against bigger teams.\"\n\nChampions League 'not ideal' with 'hard work' key\n\nTudor was keen not to dwell on the defeat to Arsenal - \"The less we speak the better it is\" - and admitted Spurs' Champions League involvement is \"not an ideal situation\" given their relegation battle in the Premier League.\n\n\"It's a beautiful competition to play, everyone wants to play. The problem is the lack of numbers we have in the team. There's the problem. If you need to play every three days with 10,12, 13... Also it's not only about spending physical energy but also mental energy when every game for us in the league is a final.\"\n\nBut he insisted his players were in no doubt about the situation they are in - and how they will have to fight their way out of it.\n\nFulham\n\nTottenham Hotspur Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\n\"The mentality changes by training. Doing the right things there and to have enough training sessions that you can transmit these things to the team so that on Sunday this can be seen from the fans in the stadium.\n\n\"Hard work. There is no other possibility.\"\n\nTudor confirmed Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso will be in contention to play at Fulham on Sunday after returning to training from injury and that Micky van de Ven should also be fine to feature, despite an issue with one of his little toes.\n\nHe also said he remains hopeful Dejan Kulusevski can return to the field before the end of the season.\n\nTudor dismisses suggestion Van de Ven ignored him during derby\n\nImage: Igor Tudor issues instructions to Micky van de Ven and Djed Spence\n\nFollowing Spurs' defeat to Arsenal, fan footage emerged appearing to show centre-back Micky van de Ven ignoring Tudor's encouragement to push up and then the head coach becoming frustrated.\n\nHowever, Tudor insisted that was not the case.\n\n\"It was not an instruction to Micky, it was an instruction to the team to go up,\" he explained. \"It was not about Micky. It was about the team coming up. We want to go up because we want to have this style that we press high but maybe in this moment it's too much for them. That's why there is a little frustration of that. Nothing special happened.\"\n\nPressed on whether Van de Ven had disrespected him, Tudor said: \"If you watch carefully. You see I don't speak with him. After, I say to him come closer and he comes closer. At that moment I say this, it was for all the defence to go up.\n\n\"We didn't even speak about this because there's nothing to speak about. He's a fantastic guy, very good professional. He'd never do [those] things.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Speaking on Sky Sports FC, Jamie O'Hara breaks down where Spurs went wrong in the North London Derby and why he fears for his former side's chances in the race for Premier League survival.\n\nEx-Tottenham midfielder Jamie O'Hara has slammed the attitude and mentality of the Spurs squad and believes they \"haven't got the stomach for a relegation fight\".\n\nHe told Sky Sports News' Fan Club: \"I was expecting a bit of a manager bounce. Arsenal had a couple of sticky performances against Wolves and Brentford, so I was expecting the team to go into this game with a high attitude, a bit of passion, fight, relentless pressing, and not letting easy crosses in the box.\n\n\"[It was the] complete opposite. It was miles away from where I thought it was. I know there's injuries, but the attitude of the players is my biggest concern. The attitude to defend, to run, to compete, to not concede goals. That for me is basic 101, and then you can talk about creativity, whether we're good enough, whether we've got the players, the formation, but the basic defending, basic mentality of a football club.\""

            "content": "The Premier League is to launch its own streaming service, with live ­coverage of all 380 matches over a season available directly to fans – but only if you live in Singapore.\n\nKnown as Premier League Plus, the new app will be launched before next season and will be the first time match coverage will be sold direct to consumers.\n\nDescribed by the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard ­Masters, as simply being a “learning” ­opportunity, the move will still cause shockwaves throughout the game as the world’s biggest domestic football league moves to directly control its revenues without the need for a broadcast partner.\n\n“From next season onward, from August, ­Premier League Plus is going to happen,” Masters said. “For the first time the Premier League is going to have its own customers. We’re looking to build a business, but we’re also looking to learn to see how that might be replicable around the world.”\n\nMasters told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London that Premier League Plus would be offered in partnership with the existing rights holder, Starhub, and would be a “24-seven” service.\n\n“It’s going to be a really exciting product, and the big change is I think that the Premier League will have its own customers and means us delving into things like promotion and pricing,” said Masters. “That’s why it’s an important step for us.”\n\nThe idea of a “Premflix” offering has been speculated on for a number of years. Premier League club owners have backed the idea, with Chelsea’s Todd Boehly telling the FT conference last year that the league should sell its global rights direct to the streaming service Netflix. Instead, the Premier League has gone for a trial approach, with ­Masters telling an audience of industry insiders that international broadcast revenues had grown by 27% through the latest three-year rights cycle.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Premier League’s Richard Masters says its new app is ‘an important step for us’. Photograph: Jon Super/AP\n\nAlso appearing at the conference was the chair of the Independent Football Regulator, David Kogan. He called on the Premier League and EFL to come to a new “long-term sustainable agreement” over financial redistribution, arguing that it would lead to “less regulation” in the future.\n\nKogan also reaffirmed that parachute payments, which have been a barrier to any resolution between the ­Premier League and EFL, would come under scrutiny as part of the forthcoming State of the Game review. “Parachute payments are not going to vanish overnight,” Kogan said, “[but] the discussion about parachute payments is a fundamental part of the discussion about distribution.”\n\nThe chair of the EFL, Rick Parry, also speaking at the summit, said that parachute payments had represented 6% of EFL turnover when introduced in 1992, but by the 2018-19 season had reached 173% of turnover. The wage bill of clubs in receipt of the payments was more than double that of the rest of the Championship. “The Premier League chase is the most expensive lottery ticket on the planet,” he said.\n\nKogan said he believed the “backstop” option which would allow the regulator to impose a distribution deal would not need to be activated and that the leagues would come to a deal independently. Masters said that while “we’re all agreed we want a strong pyramid”, he thought “it should be left to the organisations to come up with these agreements.”"

            "content": "The big winners\n\nBodø/Glimt’s 2-1 defeat of Inter at San Siro continued this season’s miracle. The post-match discussion between Inter coach Cristian Chivu and his opposite number, Kjetil Knutsen, was one of admiration, an acknowledgment the Norwegian team had been too good for the runaway Serie A leaders. Even though Inter were without Lautaro Martínez, their standard bearer, a comeback seemed likely as they dominated the early stages. But they found no way through, eventually falling victim to the high-quality, high-speed attacking that had left them with a 3-1 deficit to overcome from the first leg.\n\n“The hardest thing was to create an opening,” lamented Inter’s Nicolò Barella of the long spell of toil that preceded Jens Petter Hauge stabbing in his sixth goal in this season’s competition before Håkon Evjen completed a counter and sealed progress with a brilliant strike.\n\n“We tried everything we could,” Chivu said. Like Manchester City and Atlético Madrid before them, Inter were dumbfounded by the team laying claim to be Scandinavia’s best since IFK Gothenburg picked up two Uefa Cups in the 1980s and reached the European Cup semi-final in 1986.\n\nGalatasaray are into the last 16 after goals by Victor Osimhen and Barış Alper Yilmaz in extra time at Juventus. That tells nothing of the full story of a classic tie, which almost became a classic comeback. Probably the main reason Juve did not fully overturn their 5-2 first-leg deficit was the dismissal of Lloyd Kelly, a red card awarded by video assistant when the on-field official had already awarded a second yellow. How video officials reached that decision was mysterious, controversial; Kelly looked to have accidentally landed on Yilmaz. The Englishman initially believed VAR would come to his rescue but stormed down the tunnel. He missed out on the ecstatic scenes that followed Weston McKennie levelling the tie at 5-5. In injury time, though, Juve ran out of legs, counting the cost of a third red card in four matches.\n\nIn Wednesday’s earlier game, Atalanta had already preserved the dignity of Serie A with a 4-1 defeat of Borussia Dortmund. Atalanta trailed 2-0 from the first leg but perhaps we should have paid attention to a telling stat before kick-off: there has been an Italian team in the last 16 of the competition every season since 1987-88. In Bergamo, Mario Pašalić’s header put Atalanta 3-2 up on aggregate, only for Karim Adeyemi’s lovely goal to push the tie towards extra time. The denouement was bizarre: Dortmund defender Ramy Bensebaini was sent off after his studs caught the head of Atalanta’s Nikola Krstović in the penalty area as he attempted a backheel flick. Lazar Samardžić stepped up in the ninth minute of added time, with all Atalanta’s usual penalty takers subbed off, to score the spot-kick. He lashed it home to maintain the honour of Italian calcio.\n\nJosé Mourinho has now lost his last 10 Champions League knockout ties. At Real Madrid, parking the Benfica bus did not prove a successful strategy. Although this time it was a literal bus: Mourinho, banned after his red card in the first leg, watched the second leg sat in the team coach. Benfica scored first at the Santiago Bernabéu against a rather languid Madrid through Rafa Silva, only to leave space for Aurélien Tchouaméni to score from distance. In the 80th minute, Vinícius Júnior scored the decider of an edgy match, issuing the final word on a tie that concluded with relative calm. The fallout from last week’s first leg, in which Benfica’s Gianluca Prestianni was accused of racially abusing Vinícius, may continue for some time. “Mourinho and I were in contact and share the same feeling: frustration and pride,” said Benfica’s assistant coach, João ­Tralhão. Mourinho’s thoughts remain private. For now, at least.\n\nPlayer of the week\n\nIt all came up Norway, as Alexander Sørloth, the one-time Bodø/Glimt loanee, scored the treble for Atlético Madrid that ended Club Brugge’s participation. Sørloth will probably partner Erling Haaland at the summer’s World Cup. The 30-year-old has a harsh journeyman reputation but his skillset has found its home within a Diego Simeone team undergoing a reboot. The hat-trick was Sørloth’s fifth goal in two matches, after a weekend double against Espanyol. They said it\n\n“There are moments when you lose precision and it’s difficult to recover the level.” Luis Enrique breathed a sigh of relief after Paris Saint-Germain’s 2-2 draw with Monaco, who had Mamadou Coulibaly harshly sent off and missed a golden chance to level the tie when Wout Faes headed wide. As it was, the holders squeezed through 5-4 on aggregate. They remain unconvincing, and are yet to find the stride of last season.\n\nThe pundit’s chair\n\n“Italian teams play at a slow pace. When they find teams that play press and run, they don’t have the quality, aren’t accustomed to playing at a high pace, and make mistakes … As soon as they increase the pace in Serie A, they are stopped because a challenge is too hard, a player’s ear is touched, and they go down. These are the results. We play at a slow pace, unfortunately, and when it happens, it’s hard to be dangerous.” Champions League-winning coach Fabio Capello, speaking after Inter’s exit on Sky Italia, diagnoses the Serie A malaise.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nFriday’s last 16 draw takes place in Nyon, Switzerland, and the playoffs, or “punishment round” as some insiders term it, have opened up some potentially huge ties. Paris Saint-Germain face either Barcelona or Chelsea. Galatasaray’s reward is one of Liverpool or Tottenham, whose interim coach Igor Tudor had a stint with the Turkish club.\n\nManchester City could face familiar foes: Real Madrid, with whom they have clashed plenty of times before in recent years, or Bodø/Glimt, who shocked them in January. There’s also the potential of an all-English tie in Newcastle v Chelsea, and an all-German one in Bayer Leverkusen v Bayern Munich."

            "content": "When the whistle blows to start USA v Argentina on Sunday in Nashville, a new period of the Emma Hayes era will begin in earnest. The team preparing to play La Albiceleste in Tennessee for the 11th SheBelieves Cup, followed by Canada and Colombia, is the first in more than a year to feature no uncapped players.\n\nFor a head coach who spent 2025 setting, challenging or matching all-time USWNT records for capping players, that is a notable shift and it marks the next phase of the team’s World Cup preparation.\n\nThe first two chapters: Nearly two years ago, Hayes took hold of the humbled giants two months before the Paris Olympics. While noting she felt like a “heart surgeon in the middle of emergency surgery”, the first phase was a whirlwind redemption run that culminated in the USWNT’s fifth gold medal.\n\nIt was slow after the tournament, but last year Hayes worked methodically with her team to develop talent, test a broader pool, foster competition and fold new players into the environment. While securing a record of 12 wins and three defeats, Hayes capped 44 players in the calendar year, the most in the team’s history. She gave debuts to 16 players, the most since 1985, with 38 in all getting starts, the second-most in history and the most since 2001. Since taking over, Hayes has doled out 32 debuts and starts to 55 players.\n\n“You got to create competition,” Hayes said last week. “But to create competition, you got to give people experiences.” Indicating that no one, including those previously in starting spots, was 100% safe in their role, Hayes said: “I expect more competition as a result of the decisions we took last year. But you’ve got to perform. That’s the bottom line.”\n\nThe next step: The absence of uncapped players signifies a shift. Rather than trialling and testing an enormous pool, the four-time Women’s World Cup winners are moving toward refining the group Hayes has built as they prepare for the qualifying tournament in November. “I do think there is clarity, a lot more clarity in terms of the squad of players we are building around for the upcoming year,” said Hayes.\n\nFans can expect a few key themes from this period. For one, as Hayes works towards the Concacaf W Championship (which serves as World Cup qualification), observers can expect healthy experimentation and rotation in the starting XI.\n\nView image in fullscreen Chelsea’s Naomi Girma (left) is part of an established USWNT central defensive pairing. Photograph: Ben Whitley/PA\n\nInjuries, as ever, are one cause for this. Catarina Macario, Kate Wiesner, Tierna Davidson, Croix Bethune, Michelle Cooper, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson are absent due to injuries and other fitness precautions, though Hayes indicated they would all compete for roles when fit. As they re-emerge, and club form fluctuates, some in the camp may move to continue their growth with the under-23s or other youth teams.\n\nAnother cause for rotation and fluctuation is the necessary balance between perfecting the team’s core while encouraging competition and building experience in the main pool. Hayes illustrated this point while discussing her first-choice center-backs, Emily Sonnett and Naomi Girma, and the cadre of less experienced options around them: “When you’ve got such experience like Girma and Sonnett and then a big gap below, it’s always a balance between developing them and developing the players who are my starting center-back pair.”\n\nThere are no uncapped players in camp. But outside five players, no one has more than 42; Riley Jackson has one and 12 players have 10 or fewer. Complemented by a spine of veterans, it is still a notably young squad. Hayes will emphasize gaining experience for all of them before the World Cup: “My job as a coach is to recognize I have to get a group of players ready. And if I just selected 14 players all of the time I genuinely think I’d be failing in this job.”\n\nAnother riveting theme this year is the assured competition for starting roles come next summer. Despite the experience gap Hayes illustrated at center-back, numerous players staked their claim last year for roles held firmly by others two years ago. The goalkeeper position feels open. “Triple Espresso” – Wilson, Swanson and Trinity Rodman – stunned for a summer, but the trio have not figured together since. A squad always dense with attacking talent offered other options in the interim. And with Sam Coffey, Lily Yohannes, Claire Hutton, Jaedyn Shaw, Rose Lavelle, Olivia Moultrie, Lindsey Heaps and, when fit, Bethune, all jockeying for lead roles in the midfield, that could quickly become the most interesting part of the pitch to watch.\n\nThey will face interesting competition with varied styles in the SheBelieves Cup. Colombia, ranked 20th in the world, are making their second appearance, and have provided the USWNT entertaining, at times technically masterful and often physically challenging tests in recent meetings. Argentina, ranked 30th, are also making their second appearance and will hope to improve on their last-place finish in 2021. Canada, longtime rivals to the US, enter the fray without a number of marquee names (Olivia Smith is a doubt after an injury in the FA Cup, while Adriana Leon and Ashley Lawrence were omitted to give others a chance) after some disappointing results in 2025, including a 3-0 loss to the USWNT.\n\nThe US, who finished second behind Japan in last year’s edition, will compete to claim their eighth title on 7 March.\n\nGet in touch\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email moving.goalposts@theguardian.com."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says the salvage operation he has taken on at Tottenham is tougher than he envisaged and most likely his hardest job in management.\n\nThe interim coach, who is preparing for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Fulham, has worked with his new squad since the beginning of last week, having replaced the sacked Thomas Frank. Tudor lost his first game 4-1 at home to Arsenal on ­Sunday, which left Spurs four points above the relegation zone.\n\nAn alarming fitness situation has improved slightly with the return to training of Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso, meaning Tudor will be without eight injured players at Fulham, plus the suspended Cristian Romero, though Micky van de Ven is expected to be fit.\n\nSpurs are without a win in nine league matches and Tudor’s eyes are wide open about the scale of the task. “Probably, yes … I agree with you,” Tudor said when asked whether the role was more difficult than expected.\n\n“It’s very tough … but it is how it is. So daily work, focus, raising in all things we need to do – physical condition, mental confidence, performance – and waiting for the [injured] players to come back.”\n\nTudor started work as a manager in 2013 and is now in his 12th job. Is Spurs the biggest challenge? “Probably,” he said. “If I recognise the difficulties there are, probably, yes. It’s an even bigger challenge, an even bigger motivation to do this and we do it.”\n\nTudor described Spurs’s plight before the Arsenal game as an “emergency situation” and he warmed to the theme before another derby. “It’s not looking to the style at this moment,” he said. “Because now it’s a question of life and death.\n\n“There is not too much time to think about performance or style. Every game needs to be prepared in that way. How we can take these points, one way or the other?\n\n“In Italy, they use the term ‘have the mentality of a small team’. That is the key, to always have motivation when you play big teams. So that’s the start, of course, and we work a lot on that. The players are aware of the situation.”\n\nLike Frank before him, Tudor refused to use the R word – relegation. “I never used it but not because it’s something too scary or it’s a danger word or we won’t sleep,” he said. “It’s about that we need to refocus on ourselves.”"

            "content": "Senne Lammens revels in the “war” of being Manchester United’s goalkeeper in the hugely physical Premier League yet remains bemused at being applauded when entering a primary school classroom on a Wednesday afternoon.\n\nClearly the 23-year-old is still adjusting to a rocketing career trajectory. Following his £18m transfer from Royal Antwerp on 1 September, Lammens made his debut in the 2-0 win against Sunderland on 4 October, and established himself as the first choice with a faultless start that featured five clean sheets in 21 league games.\n\nTo do so in the relentless glare at United is impressive. In Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton, Lammens was again calm and assured, producing vital saves while navigating the hurly-burly of set pieces and corners as players crowded his goalmouth.\n\nView image in fullscreen Senne Lammens is first to the ball while under pressure from Everton’s Thierno Barry as the United goalkeeper keeps another clean sheet. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n\nLammens shrugs when considering the chaos he faces at dead balls. “Physically Everton was a big battle, a big game so I’m still recovering from that,” Lammens says. “It’s been like this. It’s just the way it is – the Premier League, it’s physicality and a bit of war in the 18-yard box.”\n\nAt 6ft 4in and with a robust frame, the young Belgian is built for the game’s demands. “It’s one of my strengths,” he says, “so sometimes I like the challenge as well. Of course it can get too much sometimes but everyone has to deal with it. It’s not like only one team does it, it’s everyone in general.\n\n“As a goalkeeper you have to get used to that and train for it and get better at it. I’ve been doing a good job at it so I’ll continue to do that. The club said to me that it was the most physical. It’s the best league but the physicality is the biggest difference. We do it as well sometimes, making it hard for the goalkeeper.\n\n“In Belgium it’s less physical but still the principles are the same. Here there are a bit more bodies in front of you, but my team has helped me out with blocking guys. You have to be big and not be pushed around easily.”\n\nLammens suggests that greater protection for keepers may have to be considered. “There have to be certain rules,” he says. “You can’t get to the point where it’s too [unfair]. That’s something the Premier League has to look towards.”\n\nLammens made his debut for Club Brugge in July 2021 before moving to Antwerp two years later. He remained uncapped at senior level for Belgium until November’s 7-0 win over Liechtenstein, replacing one of his heroes. “Thibaut Courtois was always a big thing when I was growing up because his saving is just world class,” Lammens says of the 33-year-old Real Madrid goalkeeper.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘You have to be big and not be pushed around easily,’ says the 23-year-old. Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Shutterstock\n\nBayern Munich’s 39-year-old Manuel Neuer was another source of inspiration. “When I was growing up my biggest idol was probably Neuer,” he says. “I take pride in being an all-around goalkeeper and that’s why I was such a big fan because he didn’t really have a weak point, so that’s something I want to take from him. But I try to learn something from everyone because everyone has strong points.”\n\nLammens is speaking at a Manchester United Foundation event at Partington Central Academy for World Book Day. The surprise at being cheered by pupils draws comparison with being ambushed by paparazzi this month when leaving the Ivy in Manchester after dining with his partner.\n\n“That was one of the more special moments. Special, like I couldn’t believe it. It’s not always the best feeling – they weren’t too bad. But for my girlfriend and I this was the first time with paparazzi. Looking back, it was quite funny. The club warned me that Manchester United is a different animal, especially social media wise.\n\n“It’s a bit new for me, but it’s also probably one of my best feelings when you go into [schools] and see all those children cheering for you and they don’t believe it’s you. Because I was there once in my life, it’s not that long ago. I still remember those times.”\n\nAway from the game, Lammens reads – his favourite book is Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist – and follows other sports. “I don’t really watch a lot of football because on a daily basis you’re doing a lot with football,” he says. “You want to switch off mentally. Of course you still have to watch other people play but everyone has his own experiences so the best learning school is yourself, your own experiences.\n\n“I’m a big sports guy. I love watching other sports and other athletes do their thing. Especially how they prepare for the game and think about their game. Like in the NBA and with, for example, Kobe Bryant or LeBron James.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Lammens with the pupils of Partington Central Academy. Photograph: MUFC\n\nAfter being recommended by Tony Coton, United’s goalkeeping scout, as the replacement for the erratic André Onana, Lammens has developed a rewarding working relationship with Tom Heaton, the third-choice keeper. He served early notice of his quality when gathering a corner with authority against Sunderland. It drew a rousing cheer from the Old Trafford faithful.\n\n“It was really nice getting the support from the fans and my teammates, the best feeling in the beginning. And they also gave me even more confidence to keep going and to make the steps I did after that.”\n\nIn an improving campaign under Michael Carrick that has garnered 16 points from the interim manager’s first six games, Lammens wants to maintain consistency. “I don’t really want to look too much into the past,” he says. “It’s been great but I still have to prove myself every week. I just have to keep going now. It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world but also you have to look through that – it’s still a game of football, the game isn’t that much different.”"

While there have been costlier mistakes (hello, Loris Karius) and far more high-profile disintegrations (bonjour, b@nter-era PSG), it is difficult to recall any one elite professional footballer being responsible for quite so many howlers in one game as the hapless Algerian left-back.\n\nDuring a performance labelled “hesitant”, “reckless” and “unfathomable” in your Kickers, your Bilds and your Fußball Jeden Tags, the unfortunate Bensebaini was either directly or indirectly responsible for each of the four goals his team shipped as they threw away a two-goal first-leg lead over Atalanta to capitulate 4-3 on aggregate. He didn’t just open the door for the Serie A side, he rolled out the red carpet, provided valet parking and offered up the combination to the safe. On an evening that started badly and went quickly downhill, Bensebaini’s almost heroic failure to intercept a routine cross trundling through his penalty area allowed Gianluca Scamacca to halve Atalanta’s deficit, before his bizarre attempt to block a Davide Zappacosta shot from distance sent the ball past his own goalkeeper, Gregor Kobel, as the Italians made it 2-0 by half-time. It was slightly unlucky, the kind of thing that could happen to just about anybody but given the myriad misfortunes the gods still had in store for Bensebaini, it was only ever going to happen to him.\n\nView image in fullscreen Ramy Bensebaini and Gregor Kobel after Atalanta’s second. Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty Images\n\nQuite early in the second half, Mario Pasalic nodded home Marten De Roon’s cross to send Atalanta in front on the night and on aggregate, the Croatian midfielder having ghosted in behind the completely oblivious Bensebaini at the far post to rise unmarked. It was at this point the thoughts of concerned citizens turned to that “Stop! Stop! He’s already dead!” gif from The Simpsons, but Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac opted to leave his left-back out there, possibly working under the assumption that things couldn’t possibly get any worse for his experienced defender. Hoo-boy.\n\nAfter Karim Adeyemi came on to pull a goal back and restore parity on aggregate, the tie looked to be heading for extra time but Bensebaini was having none of it. In the eighth minute of added time, Nikola Kristovic flung himself at a Pasalic cross, only to land face-first in the upturned studs of Bensebaini, who had for reasons best known to himself attempted to cut out the delivery by c0cking his left leg in the manner of a dog at their favourite lamp-post. While the referee was prepared to let the incident slide, VAR opted to stick its beak in and Atalanta were awarded a penalty, with our hero receiving his second yellow card of the game. Before Lazar Samardzic could smash the decisive goal into the top corner with the final kick of the tie, Bensebaini trudged off, having had a very public and belated full-stop put on an evening that was the stuff of nightmares. Still, if there’s an upside for him, it’s that it seems inconceivable that he will ever be unlucky enough to endure an evening that awful again.\n\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\n\nJoin Daniel Harris from 8pm GMT for Bigger Vase minute-by-minute updates from Nottingham Forest 1-1 Fenerbahce (agg: 4-1).\n\nView image in fullscreen Fener fans at the team’s hotel in Nottingham.

Barristers for Andy Pilley, who was handed a 13-year prison sentence in July 2023 for selling fraudulent energy contracts, claimed his convictions were unsafe as he experienced “disadvantage through difference” as a result of his ADHD not being recognised at the time of his trial. In his ruling, Lord Justice Edis said the prosecution’s case was “based upon extensive documentary evidence” and that Pilley was “able to engage with complex material” during the trial.\n\ndouble quotation mark Re: yesterday’s Football Daily.

            "content": "Where will you be when Bodø/ Glimt win the Champions League? OK, they won’t win the Champions League, but they could win the Champions League. Could they? Four wins in a row. Manchester City, Atlético Madrid away, Inter, comprehensively, twice. It’s an astonishing run.\n\nI am generally cynical about anything foisted upon us by the game’s overlords, but after a brilliant couple of nights of football Uefa must be delighted with the drama and excitement these playoffs produced.\n\nParis Saint-Germain a Wout Faes glancing header away from being taken to extra time. Juventus thrillingly close to a 10-man comeback against Galatasaray. Atalanta keeping Serie A alive with an injury-time penalty. OK, less jeopardy with Qarabag, but you can’t have everything.\n\nIt is Bodø/Glimt who are the dream. They were of course helped by Manuel Akanji, who picked the wrong time to start buffering, giving the ball away and then going peak complain at anyone and everyone for a mistake that was at the very least 100% his fault.\n\nThere’s never a good time to do that, but especially when you’ve gone full Terry Butcher: Mr Bump-style bandage wrapped around your head. Butcher would’ve row-zedded that before any thoughts of playing out came into his head. Actually, Mr Bump might have at least knocked it down the channels.\n\nBut Glimt’s second goal was a thing of beauty. A glorious pass from Jens Petter Hauge and the touch and finish from Håkon Evjen was perfect. They are a good team, with good players – and this is them in pre-season.\n\nWhat struck me most was how the players and staff reacted at full time. It is slightly different when you know you are through, when one goal isn’t going to change the game. But this wasn’t delirium at the end. It didn’t feel like Macclesfield knocking out Crystal Palace in the FA Cup: everyone running in different directions, not knowing how to act or who to hug (and to be clear, Macclesfield absolutely should have celebrated like that).\n\nThis was quite measured. You got a real sense that Glimt, if they did not expect it, knew it was achievable. OK, Serie A isn’t the Serie A people of a certain vintage instantly conjure in their minds: Van Basten, Gullit, James Richardson reading the papers. Sadly the 90s were ages ago. But, still, Inter are 10 points clear at the top. They have been in two of the past three Champions League finals.\n\nView image in fullscreen Bodø/Glimt were 2-1 winners in Milan, sealing a comfortable aggregate victory. Photograph: Claudia Greco/Reuters\n\nTransfermarkt figures put the difference in squad value at about €610m (£532m). Glimt’s weekly wage bill (FOR THE WHOLE SQUAD) is just over £150,000. Thanks to Jack Kenmare on Sportbible for listing some Premier League players who earn that on their own: Mateo Kovacic, Noni Madueke, Federico Chiesa, Joelinton, Sandro Tonali, Anthony Gordon and Mason Mount.\n\nTo paraphrase the Norwegian football expert and Football Weekly galáctico Lars Sivertsen – for whom this run is almost as profitable as Ole Gunnar Solskjær taking over at Manchester United – Glimt’s win is good for football. It is good for anyone who loves the game, and especially anyone who supports a team who don’t win anything – which is pretty much all of us.\n\nFootball is about hope. It is about dreaming that one day your team may be the best, or at least beat the best. Reality suggests this is very unlikely. But Glimt were in the second division of Norwegian football a few years ago and on Tuesday night they comfortably beat Inter.\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, they are the good guys. So often you think you’ve found a charming underdog story, only to discover the owner sells AK-47s to children or makes videos of kittens vaping. There’s always something. A nation state, some collection of words – hedge bond tax scheme – that is in some way nefarious. But here it’s a tiny town near Father Christmas with a team who are just brilliantly run and well coached. It is all just, well, nice.\n\nAnd although we like to think the European Super League idea is dead, there are still big clubs who don’t think they should have to sully themselves with random sides from just north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nWill other teams, to quote Conor Coady, be “rubbing their lips” at the thought of getting Glimt in the latter stages of the competition? Probably not, but it is human nature to underestimate an opposition like that. Even if they do get knocked out by Sporting Lisbon or Manchester City in the next round, they have still given us the chance to ask: if they can do it, why can’t we?\n\nCambridge United are second in League Two. One defeat in their past 19 matches. Any lower-league fan will understand – it is an odd feeling to start to expect to win. You feel like you’re cheating. You don’t want to jinx it. I don’t even want to write this down. Please don’t be my fault.\n\nBut carry this on and it’s League One. Lincoln City are proving that it’s possible you don’t have to be one of the mega rich to compete in the third tier. OK, a movie star or a rapper or a quarterback may have to give us a few quid to get into the Championship and beyond, but it is possible.\n\nCould Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu be the first footballer to play in all four divisions for two teams? Will Louis Appéré be running the channels at the Etihad in 2028‑29? Fortunately I’ve never written a column wondering who Louis Appéré is, nor a column questioning the loyalty of Neil Harris.\n\nIn the early 90s Cambridge went up the divisions to the top of the second tier in consecutive years. It’s different now, but Glimt show good things are possible. Yes, they won’t win the Champions League, and we’ll get gubbed by MK Dons on Saturday. But you never know – and that tiny bit of hope is everything."

            "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo announced on Thursday that he had acquired a 25% stake in Saudi-owned Spanish second division club Almería.\n\n“This strategic investment in UD Almería reflects Ronaldo’s long-term commitment to professional football ownership,” read a statement from his new sports holding company, CR7 Sports Investments, which gave no financial details of the deal.\n\n“It has been a long-time ambition of mine to contribute to football,” the statement quoted Ronaldo as saying. “I look forward to working alongside the leadership team to support the club’s next phase of growth.”\n\nAlmería, who were last in the Spanish top flight in 2024, are third in the Segunda, one point from the automatic promotion places. The club are owned by Saudi group SMC.\n\nAlmería’s president, Mohamed al-Khereiji, suggested the player would be particularly involved in the club’s youth programme. “He is considered the best on the pitch,” Khereiji said. “He knows the Spanish leagues very well and understands the potential of what we are building.”\n\nRonaldo, who has played in the Saudi Pro League for Al-Nassr since 2023 and who also owns a stake in the club, became the first footballer included in Bloomberg’s “Billionaire Index” last October. He recently returned to the Al-Nassr first team after a spat over the way the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the national sovereign wealth fund which controls four clubs in the league, handled the winter transfer window. He has scored four times in the last three games.\n\nRonaldo is set to take part in his sixth World Cup next summer although he has suggested that, aged 41, it could be his last."

I think the issue is about a whole raft of other things.\n\n\"But the bottom line is they had the means, they proved the funding, they proved the principle of the cash, they've gone to the highest bidder, they put £4million which is now gone, they've kissed goodbye to £4million.\n\n\"And the administrator has other bids in town, and people are going to have to get a bit more realistic about this.\n\n\"It's all well and good suggesting that you want to buy something, that's why I wouldn't get in with my guy into a bidding war.\n\n\n\n4 Wednesday are 'six years of hard work' away from being back to where they should be, says Jordan Credit: Getty\n\n\"Do you want this? Go bid for yourselves, go pull your own arm off at the shoulder, you're not going to me in an auction to pay twice what the price of this business should be bought for.\n\n\"Great football club, great potential, it's going to take a hell of a lot of work, going to get relegated, might even take a 15-point sanction next year if people are sensible and don't want to pay Chansiri 25p in the pound.\n\n\"Then you've got six years (of) hard work and hundreds of millions of quid to get it back to where you might want to get it back to, because anyone buying a football club that isn't a Sheffield Wednesday fan, is buying it as an investment.\"\n\nJordan admitted in November that he believed Wednesday were worth just £30million in their current state.\n\n\n\nHe added that this would also include the purchase of the club's stadium, Hillsborough, as well as giving Chansiri 'as little as possible'.\n\nWith relegation from the Championship already confirmed, the Owls host Southampton on Saturday.\n\nWhat is the '25p in the pound' rule? Under EFL rules (specifically the Insolvency Policy), the person or group buying the club is given a choice regarding how they pay back the 'unsecured' (non-football) creditors: The 25p Rule: Pay the creditors at least 25p for every £1 owed as an immediate, lump-sum payment upon the transfer of the club's 'Golden Share' (the right to play in the league). The 35p Alternative: If they can't pay it all at once, they must pay at least 35p in the pound spread over a maximum of three years. If a new owner fails to meet these minimum repayment thresholds, the EFL triggers a sporting penalty. If they don't meet the 25p/35p rule, they are hit with a further 15-point deduction at the start of the next season.\n\nIt follows a midweek defeat at Norwich City in their first outfit since a return to League One was sealed.\n\nHenrik Pedersen's side sit bottom of the table on -7 points after winning just one of their 34 matches so far this season."

Now, Darren Eales, who was the chief executive at the time, had said the announcement was ‘imminent’.\n\n“This was a year ago. Now, that wasn’t forthcoming, and what we are led to believe is that the Saudis didn’t follow through with what we expected them to do.\n\n4 Newcastle could still expand St. James' Park to a capacity of 68,000 Credit: Getty\n\n“More feasibility studies were commissioned, and they wanted more time to be sure this once-in-a-lifetime cheque had to be right.”\n\nIt is now nearly four and a half years since the Newcastle takeover by the Saudi Arabian PIF went through, and the Toon are still at St. James’ Park with no direction on what is happening there, and they still train at the same training ground.\n\nThis has led to a sense of frustration for supporters, and Hope shares that same frustration.\n\nHe said: “Infrastructural investment: Training ground, stadiums and regeneration all fall outside of PSR, so they can’t use that as an excuse.\n\n“So, if I had said to you then four and a half years down the line, there would be no training ground, no stadium, no regeneration. Not even any spades in the ground, but no plans.\n\n“I think they’ve missed a trick because you don’t actually have to build the training ground. I think an announcement itself would send a message to those players inside the club and any prospective signings of ambition.\n\nInside The Toon on talkSPORT talkSPORT does Newcastle like nowhere else.

We're building a house right now and my missus wanted to have a really big trophy room.\n\n\"There was another small room and I said, 'This is enough, because we know how many trophies we have, we will not add any.' It might sound arrogant, but I know I can coach a football team. But I don't need to do it until my last day.\"\n\nRed Bull gives you wings?\n\nHowever, according to Salzburger Nachrichten, the Salzburg-based publication that first reported of a potential link-up between manager and group, neither Klopp nor Red Bull are happy with the current development.\n\nRed Bull clubs RB Leipzig, Leeds United and Paris FC are all struggling in their respective leagues this season.\n\nShould Klopp and Red Bull part ways, then Crystal Palace head coach Oliver Glasner, who will leave Selhurst Park this summer, has been linked with succeeding Klopp.\n\nGlas all over?\n\nGlasner has previous links with the Red Bull Group having worked as a sporting coordinator and assistant coach at Red Bull Salzburg.\n\n3 Red Bull clubs are struggling this season with Klopp in his role Credit: Getty\n\nMintzlaff, though, has hit back at rumours that Klopp is set to depart the Red Bull Group, stating: \"That is complete nonsense and entirely made up.\n\n\"On the contrary: we are extremely satisfied with Jürgen Klopp’s work. He invests a great deal, is in constant communication with our coaches and sporting directors, and is continuing to sustainably develop our Red Bull football philosophy.\n\n\"We are convinced that he is the right man for this job. That is where we are placing all of our focus and energy.\"\n\nA Klopp out\n\nSome reports suggest that Klopp is being eyed as a long-term replacement for Xabi Alonso at Real Madrid.\n\nLos Blancos relieved Alonso of his duties at the Bernabeu last month, with Alvaro Arbeloa handed the capital club reins until the end of the season.\n\nGermany, meanwhile, may turn to Klopp as a potential successor to Julian Nagelsmann.\n\n3 Nagelsmann will lead Germany at the 2026 World Cup Credit: Getty\n\nThe former Bayern boss will lead Die Mannschaft at the 2026 World Cup in North America this summer and recently penned a new contract with the Germany national team through to Euro 2028.\n\nLast week, Angelina Kelly felt that Klopp 'should want' the Manchester United job as she discussed the German manager with Alex Crook on Fiery Fridays."

            "content": "TWO young ski mountaineers have been killed in a horror avalanche in northern Italy after a snow cornice gave way beneath their feet.\n\nMarika Mascherona, 28, and Alberto De Maron, 27, were swept to their deaths on the southwest face of Mount Cornaccia in Valdidentro on Thursday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pair, both from Valtellina, were buried under tonnes of snow near the Cancano dams in the province of Sondrio.\n\nRescuers clawed through the snow as helicopters thudded overhead, but it was too late.\n\nThey told Corriere della Sera that “a snow cornice broke away from under their feet, and they fell down the rocks with the avalanche.”\n\n\n\nThe alarm was raised just before 11am after three people were caught up in the high-altitude slide.\n\nMascherona, from Bormio and sister of Italian national ski mountaineer Katia Mascherona, and De Maron, from Grosotto, were pulled lifeless from the snowdrift.\n\nA third ski mountaineer, who witnessed the tragedy and called for help, was treated at the scene but did not need hospital treatment.\n\nEmergency crews, including technicians from the National Alpine and Speleological Rescue Corps, firefighters from Sondrio and the Guardia di Finanza’s Alpine Rescue team, battled treacherous conditions to secure the slope.\n\n\n\nThe operation was coordinated by AREU 118, with two rescue helicopters scrambled from Sondrio and Bergamo.\n\nRescuers continued sweeping the mountainside amid fears of further collapses.\n\nThe deadly slide comes as avalanche risk across Lombardy spikes due to unseasonably warm temperatures.\n\nARPA Lombardia had warned in its morning bulletin of a “locally increased avalanche danger during the warmest hours at intermediate altitudes.”\n\nThe agency said in a snow bulletin: “The temperature trend of recent days has favoured an increase in natural avalanche activity, including ground-level avalanches, due to the wetting of the snowpack and the resulting heavier weight on the uppermost layers.”\n\n\n\nForecasters said weakening internal bonds within the snowpack had led to the triggering of even very large avalanches on most steep slopes.\n\nThey added that the situation is gradually improving, with fewer potentially dangerous slopes as natural avalanche activity stabilises the snow.\n\nThey explained that in the early hours of the day the snowpack is frozen at all altitudes, with surface melt-and-freeze crusts forming.\n\nBut as temperatures rise into the central hours, those crusts and internal bonds weaken down to 2,500 metres.\n\n\n\nAt the highest altitudes, the snow remains dry and winter-like, with widespread highly cohesive, load-bearing slabs still present.\n\nInvestigators are now probing the exact chain of events that led to the fatal collapse.\n\nThe stretch of mountain above the Cancano lakes – close to the Swiss border – has seen similar avalanches in recent days.\n\nHuge avalanches have swept Europe this winter leaving record fatalities in their wake.\n\nSeveral ski resorts have been forced to shut as avalanche danger levels surged to the highest levels across vast stretches of the Alps.\n\n\n\nThe death toll across France, Italy, Switzerland and Austria has already climbed above 60 this season alone.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIn the French Alps at least 27 people have died this year, including three British skiers who died in the past week.\n\nIt marks France’s highest death toll since the 2020 to 2021 season when 40 people lost their lives in avalanches."

We didn’t know how to behave in such a situation.”\n\nWitnesses said the toddler had been trying to open the top floor window for up to 20 minutes, with no adult in sight.\n\n\n\nAt one point, the toddler was spotted standing on the sill and opening and closing the window.\n\nAn elderly man coordinated the rescue effort from the ground, calling emergency services and directing those holding the coat.\n\nThen came the scream: “He’s falling!”\n\nMoments later there was a heavy thud as the child dropped like a stone and slammed into the outstretched coat, which tore apart under the force – and the child hit the snow beneath.\n\nOne of the heroic rescuers said: “The coat was torn to pieces — sleeves, lining, everything.”\n\n\n\nLuckily, the boy was conscious – and crying.\n\nHe was wrapped in the remnants of the coat and rushed to the nearest clinic before being transferred to hospital, where his condition is described as satisfactory.\n\nAmong the rescuers was Sergey, 57, who had been walking past when he saw two women screaming beneath the building.\n\n\n\nHe said: “I looked up — the child was already on the ledge.”\n\n“I realised we had to catch the child somehow.”\n\n“You couldn’t catch him with your hands from that height, and a sheet would tear.

Hobson had been jailed for murdering his girlfriend, her twin sister and an elderly couple.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThis inmate-on-inmate attack happened at HMP Wakefield, in West Yorkshire, and Hobson was thrown into solitary confinement for three months after the targeted scalding.

Yorks - now documents released by an inquiry have unveiled new details\n\nView 3 Images Robin Garbutt was found guilty of murder in 2011 (Image: PA)\n\nThe Post Office knew about problems with evidence against a postmaster before he was jailed for killing his wife, documents released by an inquiry reveal. Robin Garbutt, 60, was found guilty of murdering wife Diana in 2011 after she was found bludgeoned to death at their post office in the village of Melsonby, North Yorkshire, on March 23, 2010. An internal Post Office email outlined 'duplication of Transaction records in ARQ returns' months before he appeared in court. ARQ is an Audit Record Query, a database log that records all transactions. The Post Office data experts knew the system wasn't operating correctly, but the flawed information was often used to generate 'expert witness' statements in criminal cases against postmasters.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

We need to know what in the way of ARQs and the corresponding statements have been presented to the court. \"In addition I have identified the following offices from the case work spreadsheet as one that potentially could have already had information submitted to the court. \"Could you please confirm whether or not that is the case and also whether or not there any that I have missed as Fujitsu will need to take corrective action.\" Melsonby appears at the bottom of a long list in a July 2, 2010, email, when the murder probe into Robin Garbutt was well underway. His legal team say that he was asked about transactions in court based on flawed Post Office data and that he could not therefore have received a fair trial. Experts on the Post Office IT system back that view.\n\nThe Inquiry did not release the full email chain regarding the ARQ issues until 20 August 2025. But the Criminal Case Review Commission has not previously deemed computer evidence serious enough to make Robin Garbutt's murder prosecution unsafe. Asked about the latest email chain, their spokesperson said: \"Whilst I can confirm that an application was received from Mr Garbutt and that a review is ongoing, we do not give operational detail about investigations and are bound by legal limitation on what can be shared publicly from case reviews by section 23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995.\"\n\nMrs Garbutt’s mother, Agnes Gaylor, has always maintained justice was served. She previously said of the campaign to free her former son-in-law: “It’s obvious to anyone that Robin is taking advantage of the Horizon scandal to gain publicity. I don’t believe he is going to get away with it.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGarbutt has written an impassioned plea for justice to the Criminal Cases Review Commission chair. He asks Dame Vera Baird to assist in his fight for truth \"in ways the previous chair did not.\"\n\nView 3 Images Robin Garbutt and his wife Diana in a family photo (Image: Family Photo)\n\nHe tells her: \"I have fought this terrible miscarriage of justice from day one. I truly believe I have done everything that would satisfy the Court of Appeal to quash this conviction. The case put to the jury was circumstantial evidence.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I remember my trial legal team saying to me: 'No one can be convicted when the murder weapon has none of your DNA on it.\n\nPolice lost a clump of hair found next to Di, a reliable witness says Di was alive at 0645 and you have an alibi from 0430 where witnesses put you in the shop until the body is found.'\n\n\"If the Post Office had not lied at trial by withholding vital evidence, I would have been able to defend myself, in fact they would not have been able to pursue any of their arguments.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"It was non-disclosure of Post Office figures got me to the Court of Appeal, unfortunately we did not know of the Horizon Scandal and the Court of Appeal concluded we needed more and highlighted Time of Death as a concern for them.\n\n\"We point out that at least one of the Post Office witnesses in my case has been involved in at least three of those now quashed miscarriages of justice.\n\n\"I ask you to do the right thing. Put my case forward to the Court of Appeal, from there I will get my justice.\""

A former classmate wrote: \"I'm shocked to hear this.

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980. The bout was competitive, but Arguello scored the 11th-round knockout to retain his WBC super featherweight title.\n\nCastillo would lose his next bout, too, dropping a unanimous decision to Mexican legend Salvador Sanchez after leading the first six rounds.\n\nCastillo later lost to Julio Cesar Chavez in 1985 as the iconic boxer scored a sixth-round knockout at the Forum in Los Angeles.\n\nRuben Castillo (L) throws a punch against Julio Cesar Chavez during the fight at the LA Forum\n\nBoxer Ruben 'the Conquistador' Castillo has passed away at 68, according to the World Boxing Council.

'Definitely world championship material in a different era. R.I.P.'\n\nCastillo ultimately served as an announcer alongside legendary play-by-play man, Chick Hearn.\n\n'Ruben and Chick Hearn were gold on Fights From The Fabulous Forum broadcasts,' one fan wrote online. 'Great stuff.'\n\nHe also had a reputation as a positive influence on many young fighters and fans.\n\n'A great man,' his nephew wrote on Facebook. 'Both him and his family were a great part of my childhood. He always gave great advice, would be there when ya needed him. Going to parties at his place, doing golf charity events. He def was the neighborhood Uncle for alot of us.\n\nCastillo later served as an announcer on many WBC fights from the Forum in Los Angeles\n\n'A Family man, Boxer, Charity planner, we lost. Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God.

The cameras were forced to cut away before medics attended to the fighter.\n\nReplays show that late in the first round, the two boxers clashed heads, with George coming away dazed and shaken.

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "What's next for Sheffield Wednesday: Inside the key meeting for Mike Ashley bid, how to stop Dejphon Chansiri getting the £16m he's owed, the truth about Bord takeover collapse and why club insiders are happy it did, and EFL sanction that could be fatal\n\nUnlock more of the best of our journalism with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight and the writers you love every day\n\nOn Thursday, a man called Justin Barnes had a meeting with another man called Julian Pitts – in a summit that could shape the future of the biggest club in England outside of the Premier League.\n\nBarnes is a close associate of Mike Ashley and has been described as the former Newcastle United owner’s ‘most powerful and abrasive lieutenant’. Pitts is the national managing partner for restructuring at administrators Begbies Traynor, who are overseeing the sale of crisis-hit Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nDaily Mail Sport understands the meeting had been in the diary for some time and was not called to discuss the club, but it is safe to assume that Wednesday will have featured heavily in Thursday’s conversation, 24 hours after the club’s proposed sale collapsed.\n\nIndeed, to those who believe Ashley – with his expertise in distressed businesses – may well be just what is needed in S6, the pre-planned meeting could be the first bit of good fortune to befall Wednesday for some time. Ashley was one of nine interested parties who provided proof of funding to the tune of £50m to Begbies. He also made a bid north of £20m.\n\nLate on Wednesday night that group of nine had an email from Begbies telling them the sale was back on, and that they had a week to make another offer after the Bord Group, who had blown everyone else out of the water with their belief-defying bid of £47.8m, withdrew from the process.\n\nAll of a sudden there is a deal to be done and to a man like Ashley, that could prove too much to resist.\n\nAll of a sudden there is a deal to be done for Sheffield Wednesday and to a man like Mike Ashley, that could prove too much to resist\n\nThe Bord Group's proposed takeover collapsed just three days after Wednesday suffered relegation to League One, at the home of their rivals Sheffield United\n\nThere are many hurdles to overcome for the Sports Direct supremo, and anyone else who fancies a challenge. Much has been made of the EFL’s ‘25p in the pound’ rule that means if a bid fails to provide such compensation to creditors, then the Owls will start next season in League One with a 15-point deduction – something that could prove fatal to attracting a buyer.\n\nSources believe there is a conversation to be had with both the EFL and the Independent Football Regulator. The biggest creditor by far is the club’s hated former owner Dejphon Chansiri, who is owed around £64m. Why should a buyer pay £16m to compensate him for his mistakes?\n\nThere are also non-negotiables for secured creditors. Around £7-8m secures control of the company that owns the stadium, football creditors total around £2.5m, mainly in outstanding fees. A hefty chunk of that is thought to relate to the signing of Ike Ugbo from Troyes, a forward who has subsequently scored zero goals in 54 Championship appearances.\n\nThe taxman is owed around £3m, with administrative and legal costs another £3m. Before you get to Chansiri, it’s already £16m. Double that and you avoid the 15 points. It is, according to those with knowledge of the process, highly unlikely that anyone – including Ashley – will be bidding anywhere near £32m.\n\nThe 25p rule was meant to negate the impact on local businesses. It was not brought in to pay for the wanton mistakes of an owner who nearly put a grand old club in the ground. To that end Ashley, or other interested parties, may even offer to pay that 25p to the non-secured creditors who are not called Chansiri. It is thought such a move would cost around £1.5m.\n\nShould it get to a place where this 159-year-old club stands or falls on a payment to Chansiri, it is hard to see the EFL insisting the money is handed over.\n\nThree or four of the nine have told administrators they remain keen, and Ashley’s main opposition appears to be the Storch group, who told BBC Radio Sheffield this week they are ready and waiting.\n\nBut according to insiders, few were amused last time they made a bid, only to significantly move the goalposts on deadline day by trying to include incentives for promotions to the Championship and Premier League rather than cash up front – of zero use to creditors, who tend to want to be paid now.\n\nThe biggest creditor by far is the club’s hated former owner Dejphon Chansiri, who is owed around £64m. Why should a buyer pay £16m to compensate him for his mistakes?\n\nAn advantage for Ashley and Storch is the transparency of their funding. Ashley would sail through tests given his businesses are based in the UK with information readily available at Companies House. Much of David Storch’s success has come from the aviation services industry in the United States and well-regulated businesses. Again, compliance with EFL and IFR requirements would not be an issue.\n\nSheffield-born entrepreneur Ryan Howsam explored the situation before the Bord group gained exclusivity on Christmas Eve, with a view to making his friend – ex-Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan – part of the management. Jordan lambasted the Chansiri situation on talkSPORT after the collapse while Howsam told local media he would not entertain an offer without assurances that no points deduction would be forthcoming.\n\nSo here we are. And yet there was relief inside Hillsborough when the deal collapsed. ‘It just never smelled right,’ said one club source. ‘It sounds like a really stupid thing to say but there’s a confidence that other, more suitable options are ready to step in.’\n\nHowever, an agent who has experience of dealing with the Bord group at Dunfermline Athletic has only praise. ‘If you put a player in at Dunfermline you get paid straight away,’ they said. As Daily Mail Sport revealed, they paid a non-refundable £2.5m deposit, and further sums paid to keep the club going means they have just set fire to £4m.\n\nGroup member Alsharif Faisal Bin Jamil blamed differences between the bid they had lodged, which later emerged to be that staggering £47.8m, and the actual value of the club. This newspaper asked how – given the amount of time that had passed and due diligence taken – the difference only came to light now.\n\nBin Jamil, a member of the Jordanian royal family, said a structural survey of Hillsborough, which highlighted the full extent of the finance needed, only landed on Monday. Some believe that is a smokescreen, and that the group had realised that they were unlikely to pass either the EFL’s Owners' and Directors' Test or the requirements of the Independent Football Regulator.\n\nSince administrators arrived in October, hundreds of thousands has already been spent on making the stadium safe, which will have given a clue to the costs needed. A local firm working on the South Stand did so for free on the promise they would be paid when the next tranche of EFL money landed in January.\n\nThe Bord group is now history, along with their £4m, and the hope is that Wednesday do not go the same way. Is that a real possibility? If no bid is forthcoming relatively soon it is difficult to see a future, not least because of those stadium costs. The fans’ trust could step in and scale everything back but they would need hundreds of thousands a year to fund an ageing, 40,000-capacity home.\n\nIf no new bidder is forthcoming, the club would need hundreds of thousands a year to fund the maintenance of Hillsborough, their ageing, 40,000-capacity home\n\nIt is to be hoped the ghost of Chansiri does not continue to haunt Sheffield Wednesday\n\nAshley is a man with an eye for a bargain and Wednesday are approaching that territory.\n\nDespite all the problems, this is a club with a huge fanbase and huge potential. Should he get things right, £20m may seem a snip in a few years’ time.\n\nMuch will depend on any points deduction – if a year in League One is difficult to stomach, two may prove impossible. One avenue may be to press for the deduction to be delivered in this already-doomed season.\n\n\n\nIt is to be hoped the ghost of Dejphon Chansiri does not continue to haunt Sheffield Wednesday."

            "content": "Chelsea are ‘shattered’ with Cole Palmer and his fellow stars suffering from burnout, according to the PFA chief executive Maheta Molango, who wants the footballing calendar eased.\n\nMolango used Palmer as an example of why the game’s biggest names are being overworked, highlighting how he is facing a third successive summer without rest. After representing England at the 2024 Euros, and winning the 2025 Club World Cup with Chelsea, he may now head to the 2026 World Cup if selected by Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel.\n\nPalmer registered 33 Premier League goal involvements in 2023-24, and 23 in 2024-25. This season, he has yet to reach double figures, having struggled with injuries which have seen him appear in only 19 of Chelsea’s 42 games in all competitions.\n\nMolango revealed at the FT Business of Football Summit event in London on Thursday how he had visited Chelsea's training ground after the Club World Cup, and saw first-hand how they were struggling. ‘I was at the training camp of Chelsea when they came back (from the Club World Cup),’ Molango said. ‘They were shattered. This is just the reality.\n\n'You wonder whether this is what we wanted as an industry. I'm not sure. I think sometimes we need to be honest with ourselves and understand that sometimes less is more.’\n\nChelsea were left 'shattered' after the Club World Cup, says PFA chief Maheta Molango\n\nPFA boss Maheta Molanga warned that players can only give 60-70 per cent of themselves\n\nHaving already referenced Palmer’s schedule, Molango continued: ‘People say he is a millionaire. Yeah, he is, but it doesn't give you an extra lung or an extra leg.\n\n‘Come to a stage where, you know, “I want to see Cole Palmer on the pitch because he's the one who makes me dream”. The reality is that the fans pay right now 100 per cent of the ticket and a lot of time they get 70 per cent if they're lucky of the show or 60 because players start regulating themselves.\n\n‘The Premier League is the best product in terms of football. They make north of £4billion for 38 games. Surely there's an element of valuing the scarcity.’\n\nMolango added: ‘When I look at the last international window and I see (Jude) Bellingham out, Lamine Yamal out on the one side, Lucy Bronze out. Is this the football we want to see? Because frankly, people didn't want to spend money just to watch someone like me play.’"

            "content": "The Premier League is launching a direct streaming service in Asia in a move which could have seismic consequences for the long-term future of football broadcasting.\n\nSingapore will be the first country to experience a direct-to-consumer service called Premier League Plus next season, skipping the need for traditional broadcasters.\n\nIt marks a watershed moment and, if ever replicated in the United Kingdom, it would deal a major blow to live action right holders Sky Sports and TNT Sports.\n\nHowever, at this stage it is a mere trial in one of the league's smaller markets and Daily Mail Sport understands it is extremely unlikely that it will be rolled out in the UK or United States. Sky Sports have been a major profit generator and instrumental to the league's popularity since 1992.\n\nFans will watch keenly for the pricing of the streaming service due to the spiralling costs of subscribing to several networks.\n\nSupporters in the UK will have to fork out £1,350 per year from 2027 if they subscribe to all the broadcasters of Premier League and Champions League football.\n\nThe Premier League is launching a direct-to-consumer streaming platform next season\n\nSingapore will become the first country to experience the platform, skipping the need for traditional broadcasters\n\n'For the first time, we’re going direct-to-consumer in Singapore,' said the Premier League's chief executive Richard Masters at the Financial Times’ Business of Football Summit in London.\n\n'It’s a very long, considered process, carefully chosen. We have a six-year agreement with StarHub, one of the two providers out there.\n\n'So from next season onwards, Premier League Plus – rather than Premflix – finally, it’s going to happen.\n\n'It will be a new app that you can download on your smart TV or laptop. You’ll be able to watch 380 games a season, with lots of shoulder content and a 24/7 dedicated channel.\n\n'Will it be replicable elsewhere? That’s what we’re going to find out.'\n\nMasters first admitted in 2020 that the Premier League were working on a Netflix-style digital streaming channel dubbed 'PremFlix', selling live games direct to fans.\n\nThe expectation is that a single streaming service would be more affordable for fans than the full gamut of broadcast subscriptions.\n\nIt feels inevitable that if the model is a success in Singapore, then the Premier League will look at rolling out Premier League Plus more widely; Masters admitted last year that the football broadcasting world must change.\n\nBut selling the rights market-by-market to different broadcasters around the world has been an incredibly gainful enterprise for the league.\n\nThe domestic rights deal between 2025 and 2029 with Sky Sports and TNT Sports is valued at £6.7billion.\n\nKeep in mind that Sky and TNT also take care of their own marketing, production costs, and dealing with customers, all factors which are expensive.\n\nFans in the United Kingdom will be paying around £1,350 if they want access to every broadcaster from 2027\n\nThe Premier League's chief executive Richard Masters hinted that if could be rolled out further if it proves a success in Singapore\n\nThe Premier League will have to take on those responsibilities in Singapore alongside StarHub, a telecommunications provider.\n\nSky Sports and TNT Sports have also built up years of broadcasting expertise, rapport between talent, and an ability to effectively market their work, which has helped the Premier League boom in popularity.\n\nRunning their own broadcasts in-house would be a major risk for the Premier League, and there are also questions about how they would achieve impartial, rigorous journalistic output.\n\nFor example, would the Premier League be willing to air a critical discussion about clubs' owners in the way that a traditional broadcaster might?\n\nMost major leagues work with external broadcasters but in the summer, Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 went onto a subscription channel after their overseeing body, the LFP, failed to secure a rights deal.\n\nThat came after several seasons of declining interest and collapsing income, ending with a five-year deal with DAZN being terminated after one campaign.\n\nThe instability has led to financial problems among many top-flight clubs, but the LFP's Ligue 1+ service has seen initial success, gaining 1.1million subscribers. Eighty per cent of those have paying commitments.\n\nHowever, they are targeting an additional million subscribers by the end of the 2028-29 campaign to meet clubs' financial needs."

            "content": "Man United's superstitious shot-stopper who does NOT like watching football: Senne Lammens on adapting to life in Manchester, fighting at set-pieces and the American sport he is obsessed with\n\nIt's just as well Senne Lammens was wearing an all-yellow kit amid the scrum of red and blue shirts, otherwise there were moments on Monday night when Manchester United’s besieged goalkeeper might have disappeared from view altogether.\n\nWith Everton players crowding around Lammens at set-pieces in search of an equaliser, and United piling in to protect him, the Belgian’s penalty box turned into all-too-familiar scene in the Premier League these days which he likens to a war-zone.\n\nLammens stood strong even though he admitted afterwards having to step behind his goal-line just to get a run-up to punch the ball clear in the face of Everton’s aerial bombardment at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nThe 23-year-old was unflappable and calm under pressure as Michael Carrick’s side moved back into the top four with a 1-0 win, just as he has been since stepping assuredly into United’s starting line-up in October.\n\nIt was arguably his best performance yet, even though curiously there weren’t that many saves to make. ‘Bloody brilliant’ was the verdict of Everton boss David Moyes.\n\nTwo days on and did Lammens have any bruises to show for his heroics?\n\nSenne Lammens was heroic for Man United against Everton on Monday night\n\n‘Not really, no, it's actually been quite alright,’ he says. ‘I mean, physically it was a big battle, a big game, so I'm still recovering from that. But cuts and bruises, not really, no.\n\n‘It’s just the way it is. It’s the Premier League. It’s been like this all season. They always said to me that it was the most physical and that’s the biggest difference. A bit of a war (in the penalty box).\n\n‘It's always been one of my strengths – even in Belgium which is less physical but the principles are all the same – so sometimes I like the challenge as well.\n\n‘Now there are more bodies in front of you, but my team-mates help me out as well blocking the guys away from me. You have to be big and not easily pushed around, so I think that's also important. My physical features are positive for those kind of situations.’\n\nAt 6ft 4in, Lammens isn’t easy to bully, as Everton discovered. After giving his first sit-down interview to the English press at a school on the outskirts of Manchester, he was straight back to Carrington for more gym work and recovery sessions, not leaving the training ground until after 6pm on Wednesday night.\n\n‘The physical demands are quite big, so you're trying to get yourself ready for that,’ he adds. ‘But, naturally, I've always been, how can you say, a bit bigger, with a bit more weight wise. So it's also a positive thing for me the way the Premier League is.\n\n‘I think also that's why Manchester United were interested in me because they knew how it was going to be. To be honest, if it continues like this, just the physicality in general and those corners, I sometimes even like it, I have to say. I enjoy getting out of my comfort zone a little bit and dealing with those situations.\n\n‘Of course it can get too much sometimes. There have to be certain rules. Maybe there are some situations where the goalkeeper could have been protected more.\n\n‘But it’s not that only one team does it. Everyone's trying to get as many goals as they can, so they try new stuff. We do it as well sometimes, making it hard for the goalkeeper. We’ve scored lots of goals from it, so I understand fully why we do it. You just have to deal with it.’\n\nLammens, pictured with his girlfriend Vanessa Herssens, has been superb since signing\n\nLammens has been dealing with it all remarkably well since moving to Old Trafford from Royal Antwerp on deadline day in a deal worth £18.2million, plus £3.5m in add-ons. At that price, he has to be one of the signings of the season.\n\nUnited wanted a replacement for Andre Onana, and Ruben Amorim was known to favour Aston Villa’s No 1 Emi Martinez.\n\nHowever, goalkeeping scout Tony Coton had watched Lammens extensively and pushed for the young Belgian, even though he had only been first-choice at Antwerp for one season and is yet to win a senior cap for his country.\n\nIn fact, Coton argued that Lammens’ inexperience and down-to-earth nature would be a better fit for the United dressing-room than a bigger ego like Martinez.\n\nThe result was that both goalkeepers were kept waiting anxiously on deadline day before Lammens got the green light to board a private jet to Manchester.\n\n‘I had to wait for a little bit, but I trusted in the move and in myself,’ says Lammens. ‘Even if it didn't work out, I wouldn't mind being longer in Antwerp if that give me a better situation. But United was always my No 1 option in my head, and then I was really happy on the last day it came through.\n\n‘I had quite a while contact with United, especially in the end phase. I think Tony Coton was probably one of the biggest ones.\n\n‘I had a good relationship from the beginning. He was always honest and open with me. He gave me a lot of confidence that it was the right step for me, and everything he said has come true.’\n\nLammens had to wait seven games for his debut as Altay Bayindir began the season in goal and the erratic Onana was shipped out on loan to Trabzonspor. From the moment he came into the team against Sunderland, the former Club Brugge keeper has been almost flawless.\n\nA good shot-stopper who is dominant in the air and comfortable kicking with either foot, he was just what United needed and the fans knew it instantly. ‘Are you Schmeichel in disguise?’ they sang on his first appearance at Old Trafford.\n\nLammens with children at a Manchester school, where he gave a first big interview in England\n\n‘The best feeling there was in the beginning,’ he recalls. ‘They gave me even more confidence to keep going and to make the steps I did after that.\n\n‘There wasn't really a clear path for me. I needed a little bit of time to adapt, especially to this league and this quality. So those first weeks were vital.\n\n‘It wasn't really spoken when I was going have my chance, I needed to prove myself in training. But I knew it was going to be there, if it was in the league or in the cups. The way it went was probably ideal for me. I got my chance and I took it, and since then I haven't really looked back. I couldn't really imagine it going any better.\n\n‘I always knew that I was going be ready for it. Every time I've had to be ready to prove myself a little bit, I always did it, so it is just the same thing now again.\n\n‘Pressure is what you make it. I try to just not really think about it too much and relax and then it's not too bad for me, to be honest.\n\n‘You know it's Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs in the world, but also you have to look through that a little bit. It's still game of football. The game isn't that much different. Of course the quality is better, you have to trust in yourself. There's a reason I'm here, that I made the move.\n\n‘Sometimes at United, I don't really have a to make a lot of saves. It’s a different kind of goalkeeping, but it's also sometimes the most difficult when there are only one or two saves to be made.\n\n‘But I take a lot of pride in doing the other things well. Maybe not always the box-office stuff or the things people look at first.\n\n‘I take pride in being all-round and not really having any flaws. You don't always have the biggest work to do, but it's staying focused and not giving anything to the opponent – not easy things, at least.\n\n‘I spoke a lot about it with Tom Heaton, who's helping me in my time here as well. He talks about not giving things away and keeping your team in the game. If you want to have a long career, especially in these kind of clubs, they have to count on you and you have to be dependable.’\n\nAdapting to being Manchester United’s No 1 off the pitch has been more of a challenge for the boy from the quiet town of Zottegem in East Flanders who is the antithesis of a football star.\n\nLammens smiles as he remembers emerging from a quiet dinner with his long-time girlfriend Vanessa Herssens at The Ivy in Manchester to be met by flashbulbs.\n\n‘That was one of the more special moments. I mean special, like, I couldn't believe it really. It's not always the best feeling. They weren't too bad, but especially for my girlfriend as well. It was the first time and a pretty strange feeling.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n‘They warned me that Manchester United is a different animal, especially social media wise. I mean, it's all positive now, but I know sometimes it can get negative fast so I don't really want to be looking towards it too much.\n\n‘I'm just a normal guy and that is also something I try to show the world. Sometimes there are people who have that mindset and that lifestyle a little bit different than me, and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n‘So it's a bit like my character in general and how I want to be seen next to the pitch. I don't only want to be looked at as a football player, but also just a normal person with his own beliefs and stuff to do next to it.’\n\nWhen Daily Mail Sport spoke to Rik De Mil, Lammens youth-team coach at Brugge, he described a humble young man who liked to discuss economics with him. ‘Senne is an atypical football player, not penthouses and Euros,’ said De Mil.\n\nBrian Vandenbussche, his goalkeeper coach at Antwerp, had concerns about Lammens’ laid-back character so he put together motivational videos of the young keeper in action to ‘bring out the fire’ in him.\n\nBoth remember seeing him working out in the gym after midnight, such was his determination to succeed, just as United insiders say he regularly trains on days off and makes detailed notes after sessions.\n\nThen there are the quirky superstitions. Lammens doesn’t like family or friends wishing him luck keeping a clean sheet in case they jinx him, and likes to put his water bottle in a specific place in the goal.\n\nLammens is seen playing football in a sports hall with children in Manchester\n\nBecause of his dedication to the job, however, Lammens doesn’t like to watch football at home and prefers US sports like the NBA.\n\n‘I don't really, to be honest,’ he says. ‘Everything revolves around football on a daily basis, so you want to switch off a little bit mentally.\n\n‘I'm a big sports guy. I love watching other sports and other athletes do their thing, especially how they prepare the game. With the NBA, for example, you can learn a lot from LeBron James.\n\n‘I read quite a lot about other athletes and about mentality. There are lots of good books about dealing with adversity, stress or stuff like that, which can also help you in this kind of industry.’\n\nLammens has been reading Tiger Woods’ autobiography and says his favourite is The Alchemist, a book about a young Spanish boy who dreams of finding treasure in Egypt.\n\nTo promote World Book Day, he was speaking at Partington Central Academy Primary School after surprising the children. The United keeper took part in a Q&A session before joining in some playground games.\n\n‘It’s a bit new for me, but it's also probably one of my best feelings when you get into those classes and see all those children cheering for you with open eyes. They don't believe it,’ says Lammens. ‘Because I also was there once in my life. It's not that long ago.’\n\n\n\nThe Manchester United Foundation is hosting a children's book appeal throughout March, encouraging fans to donate new and pre-loved books to children in need. The foundation aims to develop and improve the wellbeing and life skills of children aged 5-11."

            "content": "'I lost my Rolex deal after shaving my head': Ex-tennis star Eugenie Bouchard opens up on her 'rebellious' phase after Wimbledon final catapulted her to superstardom\n\nRetired tennis star Eugenie Bouchard has opened up on the chaos that consumed her life - and prompted a 'rebellious phase' - after bursting onto the scene when she made the 2014 Wimbledon final at the tender age of 20.\n\nThe former player retired at the Canadian Open last summer at the age of 31, and has since transitioned to playing pickleball professionally, after calling time on a 16-year career that saw her reach the semi-finals at the Australian Open and Roland-Garros.\n\nBut the high watermark of Bouchard's career came at the beginning of her travails on the WTA Tour, when she played her Wimbledon final against Petra Kvitova in only her second run-out in SW19.\n\nBouchard ultimately lost out to the Czech star but was catapulted into a new realm of fame in the wake of her breakout run.\n\n'After that final, my life became chaotic: media attention, sponsors, changes on every level,' she told the Tennis Insider Club. 'Everything around my changed, which didn't help short-term, plus the weight of expectations.\n\n'Before, winning was amazing and losing normal - now winning was expected, losing a catastrophe. Anything short of a final was failure.'\n\nEugenie Bouchard has opened up on the chaos she felt overwhelmed her after her breakout 2014 Wimbledon run\n\nAlthough ultimately losing to Petra Kvitova, the 20-year-old was thrust into the spotlight\n\nWhile the afterglow of making the final and gaining a career-high ranking of world No 5 sustained her for some time, Bouchard went on to admit that the sky-high expectations the achievement had set took a toll on her mental health in the years which followed.\n\n'After an excellent 2014, 2015 was very difficult for me,' she continued. 'It was tough because mental health wasn't discussed like it is today, and back then I was suffering a lot - I simply didn't dare talk about it.\n\n'Even admitting you saw a therapist was strange. People thought you were crazy or weak. I'm happy it's become a completely normal topic, glad things have changed, but I went through a very difficult period and couldn't talk about it.'\n\nIncreased scrutiny on her form led to Bouchard looking to express herself in different ways, with the Montreal-born star admitting that she tested her rebellious streak by shaving an under-cut into her hairstyle.\n\n'To be fair, I wanted a very small under-cut thing,' she said on the Ok Sweetie podcast. 'I don't know what happened, but it was literally half my head.\n\n'I feel like I look like a cancer patient. I was like, \"This is not the look I was going for\". It was way worse than I intended, but it caused me not to get my Rolex deal renewed.'\n\nBouchard adopted the style while enjoying some downtime in Miami following her second-round exit at the 2016 Australian Open, but the stylistic folly is alleged to have come with long-term consequences.\n\nShe went on to claim that Rolex had emailed her agent to suggest that the new look 'did not align' with the storied watchmakers' public image.\n\nBouchard was ranked No 1 by SportsPro in their 'World's 50 Most Marketable Athletes' list in the year after her Wimbledon success, and was frequently featured in publications outside of the tennis-specific sphere, even taking part in a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition.\n\nSince taking a step back from tennis and switching to pickleball, she has continued to maintain a strong following on Instagram, with over 2.3million followers to her name.\n\nJoin the debate Should sponsors have the right to drop athletes over their personal style choices?\n\nOne of her phases of rebelling against the standards of the tennis world involved shaving part of her head\n\nThe Canadian former professional also admitted that she had found being pigeon-holed for her looks challenging during her playing career\n\nBut Bouchard was keen to stress that she felt like at times she had been pigeon-holed for her looks during her playing career.\n\n'I don't want to be just painted with a broad stroke of, \"OK, that's all she is\",' she continued. 'There are layers and layers and layers.\n\n'Sometimes I just feel like people would label me as \"OK, she just likes to post this on Instagram or something\"… there's so much more to me than that.\n\n'That's not what I think about 24/7. It's a portion of my personality.\n\n\n\n'Just assuming someone is only surface-level, or what they show, that's just the feeling I've gotten sometimes.'"

            "content": "Revealed: Newcastle eyeing wonderkid winger, the truth about Sandro Tonali's future, club make major decision on unpopular 'new crest', where Toon will tour this summer and why Bruno Guimaraes could now miss TEN more matches\n\nUnlock more from Craig Hope inside the Newcastle camp with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight, analysis and more\n\nNewcastle are watching Union Saint-Gilloise winger Anan Khalaili, Confidential can reveal.\n\nThe 21-year-old has been talked about internally and is admired by some of the club’s top scouts, including recruitment chief Steve Nickson. He has an eye for unearthing talent from abroad and we have learnt that Khalaili, with speed and technical ability, is seen as a player of vast potential.\n\nThe Israel international has scored three times in the Champions League this season, including both of USG’s goals in their 3-2 defeat by Marseille in December. He followed up with the winner at home to Atalanta last month.\n\nKhalaili plays on the right wing and already has 15 caps for his country, as well as 136 senior appearances. He played 34 times as USG won the Belgian title last season, scoring five goals.\n\nUnder sporting director Ross Wilson, the club will look to the continent to identify signings of value, and a lot of scouting work has been undertaken in the likes of Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands. With £55million having been spent on right winger Anthony Elanga last summer, the feeling is that, if there is to be an addition in that area, it will be a player of a younger and less expensive profile, such as Khalaili.\n\nOne complication with USG players is that the club is part owned by Brighton owner Tony Bloom, who has a 25 per cent stake. However, last summer did see USG midfielder Noah Sadiki join Sunderland for £15m.\n\nAnan Khalaili has scored three times in the Champions League this season for Union Saint-Gilloise\n\nThe 21-year-old has 15 caps for Israel and won the Belgian title with USG last season\n\nWhy Tonali WON'T be returning to Serie A\n\nSandro Tonali will NOT be returning to Italy, despite continued speculation.\n\nAgain this week there has been talk in his homeland of a summer move to Juventus for the midfielder. However, we understand Tonali does not see Serie A as the stage that will serve his career best in the coming years.\n\nThe 25-year-old appreciates the improvement made in nearly three years at Newcastle playing under Eddie Howe in the Premier League, and attributes some of that to the strength of the English top flight, which has six teams in the Champions League last 16, compared to just Atalanta from Serie A.\n\nTonali’s future on Tyneside is not certain, but Italy would appear an unlikely destination if he were to seek a move.\n\nSandro Tonali won't be returning to AC Milan - where he made 130 appearances from 2020 to 2023 - or any other Serie A club this summer\n\nRevealed: Leaked new crest is ditched - and current badge could stay\n\nNewcastle are set to make an imminent decision on the future of their club crest - but plans for a radical change have been ditched.\n\nConfidential can reveal that the leaked image from last year which was being used during internal presentations is no longer under consideration. The anime-style design was not well received by the majority of supporters.\n\nRather, CEO David Hopkinson and his executive team will decide either to do nothing with the current badge or clean up the design, addressing symmetry and aspect ratio.\n\nThis development comes in the week that Dan Ginger - director of brand, marketing and digital media - has left the club. He was the public face of the project when it was announced that the crest would be changing last year, addressing reporters and later fans during a workshop event.\n\nThe plan was for the new crest to feature on the team's jersey from the start of the 2026-27 season, but that deadline has come and gone. The aim, if there is a change, is now for the 2027-28 campaign.\n\nCreative director Kenny McIver, formerly of Nike, is leading the crest initiative. He is very well thought of within St James’ Park and has been given more responsibility to align the club’s brand across all departments. The club’s mantra on the change of badge has always been evolution and not revolution, but the leaked image and the nature of the consultation process with supporters faced a backlash last year.\n\nNewcastle United Supporters Trust (NUST) expressed concern at a fan survey being ‘framed in an incredibly leading manner throughout, and it is hard to see how any meaningful fan engagement or reliable conclusions can be drawn from it’.\n\nThere was no option to vote for the design being left alone, but we can reveal that possibility is now on the table and no final decision will be taken without further consultation with supporters.\n\nA leaked image of a new crest and the nature of the consultation process with supporters faced a backlash last year\n\nMiley return delayed\n\nLewis Miley’s planned return date has been pushed back, Confidential understands.\n\nThe last communication from the club on Friday was that the 19-year-old would be back within a ‘week or two’. He has been suffering from muscle damage in his thigh, an injury that was originally thought to be a dead leg picked up away at Paris Saint-Germain on January 28.\n\nBut a more likely return for Miley is around the time of the Champions League last 16 ties, which will be against Chelsea or Barcelona. The hope is that he will be back working on the grass early next week, and that means the next three home games against Everton, Manchester United and Manchester City will probably come too soon.\n\nThere is hope that Jacob Ramsey will be OK for Everton this weekend after reporting tightness in his hamstring earlier in the week.\n\nLewis Miley has been suffering from muscle damage in his thigh, an injury that was originally thought to be a dead leg picked up away at Paris Saint-Germain on January 28\n\nToon in a Euro zone this summer\n\nNewcastle’s plan to tour the United States or Far East this summer is set to be shelved in favour of a European camp, Confidential can reveal.\n\nThere were talks at one stage for a glamour friendly in Florida against Wrexham, the high-flying Championship club owned by Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.\n\nHowever, it is now likely that Howe and his players will stay closer to home, with options in Portugal, Austria and Germany under consideration. That break will be followed by a two-game mini tournament at St James’ Park across the weekend of Saturday, August 15.\n\nWith the World Cup taking place in North America, there is a feeling that the audience in the United States could be suffering from football fatigue, especially as pre-season tours would begin the week after the World Cup final in New Jersey on July 19.\n\nAlso, it is likely that most top stars will be on holiday post-World Cup, thus reducing the commercial value of pre-season this time around.\n\nA central European break is now the preferred option, and that will no doubt be welcomed by Howe and his squad, who have journeyed to the Far East during the last two summers. They will play friendlies while abroad.\n\nWill German striker Nick Woltemade now be heading back to his homeland for pre-season this summer?\n\nBruno blow as he's set for mammoth lay-off\n\nBruno Guimaraes met with Brazil boss Carlo Ancelotti this week, and if the latest reports from his home country are accurate then the midfielder could miss another TEN Newcastle matches.\n\n10 GAMES BRUNO COULD MISS Saturday Everton (h), Premier League Wednesday Man Utd (h), PL March 7 Man City (h), FA Cup R5 March 10-11 Champions League last 16 1st leg March 14 Chelsea (a), PL March 17-18 Champions League last 16 2nd leg March 22 Sunderland (h), PL April 11 Crystal Palace (a), PL April 18 Bournemouth (h), PL\n\nThe 28-year-old was allowed to return to South America for treatment on his hamstring injury this month, with the optimistic forecast of a return in early to mid-April.\n\nHowever, Brazilian media believe a return date to be nearer the end of that month, by which time Newcastle could have less than half a dozen fixtures remaining. If they were to progress in the FA Cup and Champions League, it could be as many as 13 games missed.\n\nGuimaraes’ meeting with Ancelotti would likely have been to offer reassurance on both sides of his participation in the World Cup in North America, which kicks off on June 11.\n\nHopkinson closes in on four signings\n\nNewcastle are closing in on the appointment of FOUR senior leaders as David Hopkinson’s influence is felt inside St James’ Park.\n\nConfidential understands the final candidates for the positions of chief people officer, chief revenue officer, chief strategy officer and chief marketing officer have now all been identified.\n\nThe talent under consideration is both local and global and their arrival will have a major impact on the future direction of the club.\n\nHopkinson, following his September arrival, identified areas for growth and improvement during his 100-day review of the club’s workings, and many of those changes and ideas will be seen in tangible form in the coming weeks and months. He wants to create a collegiate feel of one club pulling in one direction.\n\nPerfect timing the secret to Qarabag cruise\n\nOne secret to Newcastle’s success in the first leg of their Champions League play-off win over Qarabag can be disclosed - they stayed on UK time in Azerbaijan.\n\nNewcastle's preparation for Qarabag paid off big time as they thumped their hosts 6-1\n\nRather than adjust their watches and body clocks to the local time (four hours ahead of GMT), the squad worked to the time back home. That meant Eddie Howe and his players went to bed at 2am the night before the game, or 10pm on Tyneside.\n\nThe plan worked and they ran out easy 6-1 winners the following day for what was a 9.45pm kick-off local time. But Howe's watch would have read 5.45pm.\n\nSticking with Qarabag, they did not train at St James’ Park ahead of the second leg - and instead used the home of ninth-tier Newcastle Blue Star. The Northern League club offered their KD Stadium base in Scotswood, in the west end of the city.\n\nAnd the preparations paid dividends, with a 3-2 defeat a vast improvement on the home leg of six days previous.\n\nToon Teaser\n\nIt's Toon Teaser time...\n\nHe wasn't always popular when he returned... but did you remember David Ginola in our last Toon Teaser?\n\nLast time we asked you to name the NINE players to have scored for both Newcastle and Tottenham in the Premier League.\n\nThey were; Stephen Carr, Les Ferdinand, Ruel Fox, David Ginola, Jermaine Jenas, Louis Saha, Moussa Sissoko, Andros Townsend and Kieran Trippier.\n\n\n\nThis week, can you name the ELEVEN players to have scored for both Newcastle and Everton in the Premier League?"

            "content": "Chelsea suffer largest ever pre-tax loss of £350MILLION in 2025 - the biggest in English football history - but here's why the Blues are adamant it is not bad news\n\nChelsea recorded the highest pre-tax loss in English football history in the 2024-25 season, according to financial data revealed by UEFA on Thursday.\n\nThe European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report listed the 10 largest losses for 2025, which showed the club owned by Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly booked a €407million (£350m) deficit. That has only ever been beaten by Barcelona’s total of €555m in 2020-21.\n\nIn the 2024-25 campaign, Chelsea were competing in the Conference League, which they won. They also finished fourth in the Premier League to return to the Champions League before going on to win the Club World Cup in the summer.\n\nIt was during that tournament in the United States that Chelsea were hit with a €31m fine for breaching UEFA's financial rules, with that figure potentially rising to a record-breaking €91m should they fail to comply within the next four years as part of a settlement agreement.\n\nHowever, sources within Chelsea say as a result of their accounting clean-up, the club is now profitable on an operating basis and they are aligned with UEFA’s financial framework.\n\nThe source added their squad cost ratio should sit comfortably within UEFA thresholds, which are considered stricter than the Premier League’s, and they expect to meet all the obligations of their existing settlement agreement with European football’s governing body.\n\nDespite winning two trophies - including the Club World Cup - last season, Chelsea are thought to have recorded a staggering record pre-tax loss\n\nEssentially, Chelsea believe further regulatory settlements going forward will not be required, as they are currently compliant with the parameters which were set.\n\nChelsea’s creative financing has helped their position in the Premier League, such as the infamous internal selling of their women’s team to the club’s parent company.\n\nUEFA’s rules are more stringent, and their report, which was sent to the media on Thursday morning, explained how Chelsea’s squad at the end of the club’s 2025 financial year was, again, officially the most expensive ever assembled with a combined transfer cost of €1.746billion.\n\nThat was up €90m on the record they set the previous year. Manchester City’s squad cost €1.584bn by comparison.\n\n\n\nIt is said Chelsea believe the UEFA report is not reflective of their finances moving forward. On the pitch, the club are pushing to stay in the Champions League, with them currently sitting fifth in the Premier League – a position which is set to be enough to qualify for Europe’s elite competition at the end of this season. They face league leaders Arsenal away next."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe NFL combine is rolling through Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis this week -- a key event in the lead-up to the 2026 NFL draft. More than 300 prospects will converge on Indy, where they will receive official measurements, undergo medical evaluations, interview with teams and work out in front of NFL scouts, coaches and front office executives.\n\nThe on-field drills begin Thursday, and draft experts Mel Kiper Jr., Matt Miller, Jordan Reid and Field Yates are here to break down what they're looking for out of the best players in the class. Which prospects are going to make an impression? Who has the most to prove or gain? Which quarterbacks could turn heads, and of course, who will run the fastest 40-yard dash? NFL reporter Kalyn Kahler also shared one new tweak to the combine workouts that could matter.\n\nDefensive linemen, linebackers and special teams are up first Thursday at 3 p.m. ET. Defensive backs and tight ends perform their workouts at 3 p.m. ET Friday, followed by the quarterbacks, wide receivers and running backs at 1 p.m. ET Saturday. The offensive linemen finish things with their workouts at 1 p.m. ET Sunday.\n\nHere are some top names to watch and what to expect over the next four days.\n\nJump to:\n\nTop workout watch | Prospects with a lot to prove\n\nTop QBs to watch | Fastest 40-yard dashes\n\nExplosive jumps | Measurements that matter\n\nMedicals to watch | Latest buzz | Bold predictions\n\nWhich prospect is going to dominate his combine workout?\n\nMiller: Kenyon Sadiq, TE, Oregon. The buzz surrounding Sadiq's skills has been growing since the junior tight end first took the field as Terrance Ferguson's backup in 2024. Now, the 6-foot-3 245-pounder has his shot to impress scouts and GMs. Evaluators I've spoken to are predicting Sadiq will leap north of 41 inches in the vertical jump and could run the 40-yard dash in the low 4.5-second range. The top tight end in the class, Sadiq has varying grades from teams, with some placing him in the top 20 while others see him in the back end of Round 1. A big week of testing could push him to the top of that range.\n\nReid: Sonny Styles, LB, Ohio State. At 6-foot-4, 243 pounds, Styles has the potential to be the talk of the combine after his workout. Speaking to scouts, the expectation is for Styles to run in the mid-to-high 4.5 range in the 40-yard dash and exceed 40 inches in the vertical jump. Don't be surprised if he touches 11 feet on the broad jump, too. He is already viewed as a potential top-10 pick, but Styles is likely to put on a show not only during the testing portion but also in on-field drills.\n\nKiper: Kadyn Proctor, OT, Alabama. Man, Jordan took mine. Styles is going to light up the vertical and 40. But I'll go with Proctor, who is extremely explosive for his 6-foot-7, 366-pound size. We saw his athleticism on display during the season, as he took a screen pass 11 yards against Georgia and plowed his way to a first down against Missouri. And he has a ton of raw upper-body strength. I think he could post some really good numbers in the combine testing and help make the case that he should stay at left tackle in the NFL -- and go in Round 1.\n\nYates: Monroe Freeling, OT, Georgia. Fans of the \"First Draft\" podcast are familiar with my feelings about Freeling, who is among my top 15 prospects in the entire class. The 6-foot-7, 315-pound tackle is one the best O-line athletes expected to work out in Indianapolis, and he'll have a chance to showcase the smooth movements, transitions and footwork that helped him become a standout pass protector. My sentiment is that Freeling will keep on climbing draft boards, and I wouldn't be stunned if he works his way into the top 10.\n\nWhich prospect has the most riding on his workout?\n\nKiper: Rueben Bain Jr., Edge, Miami. There is no arguing Bain's production (including 9.5 sacks and 71 pressures last season), technique and overall upside. His game is built on sheer power, nonstop hustle and a deep arsenal of pass-rush moves to beat offensive tackles. But his arm length at 6-foot-3, 275 pounds is a question for scouts, and his 40-yard dash time will be key in seeing his true speed. Bain needs a good workout and some solid testing numbers to prove he can be just as dominant in the NFL as he was in college. I have him ranked ninth overall right now, but he could end up going top-five if he puts a stamp on his evaluation in Indianapolis.\n\nYates: Kadyn Proctor, OT, Alabama. Few players have generated as strong of opinions from scouts as Proctor, who at his best is a hulking, powerful, overwhelming tackle with flashes of proactive athleticism that wow you. But he endured difficult stretches throughout his Alabama career, leaving some scouts skeptical that he has the foot quickness to hold up against top NFL pass rushers. As Mel said above, Proctor's workout will be essential in stating the case that he has the goods to hold up in pass protection and secure his spot as a potential top-25 selection.\n\nMiller: Ty Simpson, QB, Alabama. Simpson (QB2 in my rankings) made the right move by deciding to throw at the combine, but a lot is now riding on how he performs there. The junior started only 15 games in college (all last season) and looked noticeably different over the second half of 2025. I want to see what Simpson's arm looks like in person and what type of velocity and drive power he can generate. Listed at 6-foot-2 and 208 pounds, Simpson's measurements will also be scrutinized as scouts home in on his hand size and height.\n\nplay 0:53 Mel Kiper Jr. makes case for Steelers drafting Ty Simpson Mel Kiper Jr. joins \"Get Up\" and breaks down why Ty Simpson would be a good option for the Steelers in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nReid: Caleb Banks, DT, Florida. He came into the 2025 season as a potential top-20 pick, but Banks played only three games because of a foot injury. With plenty of question marks entering the predraft process, Banks revived his draft stock a bit during a strong week of practices at the Senior Bowl. But now scouts will want to see him put it all together at the combine; a strong showing in testing and on-field drills could help him resurface as a mid-to-late first-round pick. He's my No. 29 overall prospect.\n\nWhat do scouts want to see from this quarterback group?\n\nReid: The QB class is wide open after Indiana's Fernando Mendoza. And with Mendoza opting to wait until his pro day on April 1 to throw, there's a prime opportunity for another quarterback to claim the spotlight Saturday. Who will make a statement?\n\nSimpson (Alabama) and Garrett Nussmeier (LSU) are viewed as the potential QB2 and QB3 of this class. After their highly inconsistent seasons, scouts are interested to see how both throw the ball during the throwing session. Simpson is still receiving a mixture of late Round 1 and early Day 2 grades, while Nussmeier's grades are sporadic. Some scouts see him as a Round 3 prospect, while others feel he's a Day 3 dart throw.\n\nCole Payton (North Dakota State) is also gaining steam, and his development is well ahead of the curve despite being a one-year starter. Early Day 3 is still seen as Payton's target area, but Round 3 isn't out of the question if he performs well during the predraft process. Saturday will be key.\n\nWhich quarterback has the chance to rise the most Saturday?\n\nKiper: Taylen Green, Arkansas. The eighth QB on my board has a legitimate chance to toss his name in the wide-open QB3 ring with a good performance this week, though that admittedly speaks more to the uncertainty of the quarterback class beyond Mendoza and Simpson. He looks the part at 6-foot-6 and 224 pounds, he has a big arm to push the ball downfield, and he is a terrific runner with 35 career scores on the ground. But Green's accuracy has been very inconsistent. Consider that his completion rate was below 60% in half of his games last season, and his 11 interceptions tied for 14th in the nation.\n\nGreen needs to run as well as expected and throw with precision Saturday. He can't be missing high and low on passes during the workout, especially with no defenders in coverage. I want to see a jump in his ball location. A good workout could have teams buzzing about a guy with a lot of coveted physical traits.\n\nPick a four-man relay team of prospects who will light up the 40-yard dash\n\nMiller: This was an easy year to pick a 4x40 team. Let's start off with Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love. The 6-foot, 214-pound first-rounder has the runaway speed, as shown by his two 90-plus-yard touchdown runs last season. He will cook in the low 4.4s. We also have to get Mississippi State receiver Brenen Thompson on the team, as he's my pick to run the fastest 40 in Indy. Watch for him to run in the mid-4.2-second range, though I don't think he's catching Chiefs receiver Xavier Worthy (record 4.21 in 2024).\n\nFor the last two, I polled scouts and heard that Iowa wideout Kaden Wetjen (high 4.3s) and Wake Forest running back Demond Claiborne (low 4.4s) are two must-sees when it comes to the best 40 times in this class. If I had to call out a player on defense, I'd keep an eye on Clemson cornerback Avieon Terrell. He can fly.\n\nplay 1:36 Why Louis Riddick considers Jeremiyah Love a massive difference-maker Louis Riddick breaks down why Jeremiyah Love is the biggest offensive difference-maker in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nWhich prospect is going to turn heads with his broad/vertical jumps?\n\nYates: Brandon Cisse, CB, South Carolina. He is one of the most explosive players in the draft, which is apparent when watching his tape. A vertical jump north of 40 inches would come as no surprise (expect an impressive broad jump, too), and he'll blaze the 40 as well. Cisse was a movable chess piece during his college career. A strong week in Indy will strengthen his case to be a first-round selection.\n\nWhich prospects' measurements will scouts really be focused on?\n\nMiller: Rueben Bain Jr., Edge, Miami. The arm length concerns have been loudly rumored when discussing Bain, and we'll get a firm number on just how long his arms are this week. Does it matter? Some teams will knock a player with sub-32-inch arms along the defensive line -- even if that player had 71 pressures and 9.5 sacks like Bain did last season. His weight will also be of interest.\n\nWill he come in at his listed weight of 275 pounds, or will he look to cut or bulk up to force teams into viewing him as either an outside or inside D-lineman? If Bain weighs in at 285 or more, we can assume teams will talk about kicking him inside to tackle. But he could also cut weight to fit more as an edge rusher in the NFL.\n\nWhose medical reports will teams be paying close attention to this week?\n\nReid: If we're strictly ranking this class of receivers by talent, a strong argument could be made that Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson is the best of the bunch. But he has struggled to stay healthy. He never completed a full college season, missing three games in 2025. He's always battling nagging injuries, so there will be teams hesitant in taking Tyson in Round 1.\n\nTennessee cornerback Jermod McCoy sat out last season after tearing his ACL, so teams will want to know more about his recovery. Talent-wise, there's no doubting McCoy is one of the 10 best prospects in this class. He has squeaky-clean technique, as he can turn and run with any receiver while also having the hip mobility to break at any point. And at 6 feet, 193 pounds, he also has great size for a versatile corner. But where is he at in his rehab and timeline to return?\n\nFinally, Penn State quarterback Drew Allar, who broke his left ankle in an October loss to Northwestern, will be one to watch. He's my QB5 right now.\n\nWhat's the best piece of buzz you've heard heading into the combine workouts?\n\nKiper: Missouri's Zion Young could be the first defensive end off the board -- ahead of Bain, Akheem Mesidor, etc. (but not quite in the same class as top outside linebackers Arvell Reese and David Bailey). The 6-foot-5, 262-pound edge rusher plays with strong hands, plenty of quickness and the ability to seal off the run. He's No. 22 on my board, but he has a lot of fans around the league and could push higher -- especially if he has a good week at the combine.\n\nMiller: Penn State guard Olaivavega Ioane could be a top-15 pick and a future All-Pro. The 6-foot-4 330-pounder is a favorite of many evaluators I've talked to since the Senior Bowl. \"He's a mauler with ballerina feet,\" one NFC South area scout said. Guards aren't usually seen as smart investments in Round 1 because of positional value, and the rookie wage scale dictating a high salary for first-rounders, but Ioane is seen as one of the safest picks in this class.\n\nReid: If you're looking for two names that scouts are high on despite not getting much Round 1 buzz, consider Illinois edge rusher Gabe Jacas and San Diego State cornerback Chris Johnson. Jacas (6-foot-3, 275 pounds) has created plenty of momentum after recording 11 sacks last season and followed that up with a strong performance at the Senior Bowl. Don't be surprised if Jacas, my No. 46 overall player, sneaks into the back end of the first round.\n\nJohnson (6-foot, 185 pounds) has been repeatedly brought up by scouts in this deep cornerback class. After a dominant 2025 season that resulted in him earning Mountain West Co-Defensive Player of the Year, the big question mark that scouts want answered is Johnson's straight-line speed. His 40-yard dash time is one to watch very closely. I have him in Round 2 at the moment.\n\nYates: Michigan edge rusher Jaishawn Barham is picking up steam in the scouting community, which I don't expect to slow down anytime soon. He began his college career at Maryland and was a stand-up linebacker for much of his college career, but at 6-foot-3 and 243 pounds, he played a hefty dose of edge snaps in 2025 and showed unique explosiveness. He's a Day 2 prospect now who will only create further intrigue with a big week.\n\nWhat is one way the combine workouts have changed this year?\n\nKahler: The combine has added a new bench press drill -- an isometric hold to measure a prospect's force -- multiple club sources at the combine told ESPN. Prospects will start with elbows bent at 90 degrees and push the barbell as hard as possible for 3-5 seconds. Prospects will do at least two reps, with 60 seconds of rest.\n\nLast year, only 25% of prospects participated in the bench press, where prospects max out reps at 225 pounds. And over the past four years, only 30% of prospects participated in the bench press. The session has been part of the combine since 1985, but it hasn't been popular among prospects or NFL clubs in recent years because it's not viewed as an actual indicator of football strength. The introduction of the isometric hold this year looks to be a move to measure functional strength, instead of the endurance strength of the bench press. And because it is less physically taxing, prospects might be more likely to participate in it. Prospects will still have the opportunity to complete the traditional bench press, as well.\n\nIn 2020, president of National Football Scouting Inc. Jeff Foster told Sports Illustrated that he had discussed options to replace the bench press that year with a committee of five general managers.\n\nGive us your best prediction for combine week.\n\nReid: The buzz coming out of the combine will surround the depth atop the offensive tackle class. I currently have seven players with top-50 grades. Freeling (Georgia), Max Iheanachor (Arizona State) and Blake Miller (Clemson) currently have second-round grades, but I believe all three will firmly be in the Round 1 picture after this weekend. In speaking with multiple scouts and evaluators over the past month, there's no set order on when they're expected to come off the board, but tackles will be selected frequently -- and early.\n\nYates: We're going to come out of this week with a lot of questions on the top players. In recent years, top prospects have bypassed even some of the fundamental tasks of the week (i.e., no drills, no weigh-ins, etc.), and I'm not here to blame them or question them. But in a class with fewer blue-chip prospects than usual, there are players projected to go early who have questions about their size, health, athletic profile or otherwise. Many of those questions will not be answered in Indy.\n\nKiper: Tennessee wide receiver Chris Brazzell II will run something in the ballpark of 4.47 in the 40-yard dash and push himself into the first-round conversation. I love his 6-foot-5 size, sure hands, overall toughness and strength at the catch point. But NFL front offices will be paying close attention to his timed speed. He's quicker than you'd expect out of his breaks at that size, but showing good straight-line speed will round out his scouting report. He's the type of player who might rise over the next few weeks as teams get a closer look at his tape. He's WR6 on my board.\n\nMiller: Ohio State will dominate the combine -- and the draft. We've already seen linebacker Sonny Styles, safety Caleb Downs, edge rusher Arvell Reese, defensive tackle Kayden McDonald and wide receiver Carnell Tate taking top spots at their respective positions in multiple rankings. We should see them all do very well in testing this week, too. Like Jordan mentioned earlier, Styles is a name that pops up frequently with scouts and coaches when talking about potential workout stars. Those five players listed are seen as first-round talents, which is why Round 1 could have a scarlet-and-gray feel to it."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nMore than 300 prospects will be in Indianapolis this week for the combine, but only 32 of them will ultimately go in Round 1 of the 2026 NFL draft on April 23. Let's project those picks with my second mock draft for this cycle.\n\nYou'll notice some similarities to my January predictions; there hasn't been a ton of movement on the board quite yet. But I suspect we will have some big risers during combine workouts, and remember that NFL team needs will change quickly during free agency in March, shaking up the first round. I'm not projecting any trades in this mock draft, but four selections have already changed hands: The Rams have the Falcons' selection, the Jets have the Colts' selection, the Cowboys have the Packers' selection and the Browns have the Jaguars' selection.\n\nHere's my current thinking on how Round 1 could look based on what I'm hearing from execs, scouts and coaches in the league. And for more, check out \"NFL Draft Daily\" at 3 p.m. ET on ESPN2 all week long.\n\nMore on the 2026 NFL draft:\n\nKiper's Big Board | Latest mock drafts\n\nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana\n\nI won't waste a lot of time here: Mendoza to the Raiders seems pretty obvious at this point. The Geno Smith trade didn't solve the post-Derek Carr quarterback problem in Las Vegas, and new coach Klint Kubiak will want a signal-caller to build his offense around. Mendoza is the No. 1 prospect on my board and far and away the best QB in the class. He is competitive and precise with his ball location.\n\nIf the Raiders bring in a receiver or two during free agency and maybe shore up the O-line a bit, this offense could take a step forward with Mendoza, Kubiak, running back Ashton Jeanty and tight end Brock Bowers.\n\nCaleb Downs, S, Ohio State\n\nThis would be the highest draft slot for a safety since Eric Turner went No. 2 in 1991. Downs is worthy, though. He reads the offense so well, and then he has quickness, physicality and ball skills to make plays against both the run and the pass. He can truly impact a defense's ceiling from the back end, with six interceptions, 18 tackles for loss and 22 run stops over his three college seasons. The Jets' defense didn't have a single INT in 2025 -- yes, you read that right -- and only the Cowboys gave up more points (29.6 per game). Plus, Andre Cisco is hitting free agency.\n\nDavid Bailey, OLB, Texas Tech\n\nTough call here between Bailey and Ohio State's Arvell Reese. I have Reese one spot higher on my board, but the Cardinals might opt for the more proven production. Bailey had 14.5 sacks, 23 tackles for loss, 71 pressures and three forced fumbles last season. Simply put, he gets after the QB. That's what the Cardinals need after managing just 30 sacks last season, tied for the third fewest in the NFL.\n\nAnd yes, the team might need a quarterback this offseason if it moves on from Kyler Murray. But it's also too early to reach for the draft class's QB2 when Arizona has other big holes in the roster. I would expect the Cardinals to address their quarterback situation in free agency and turn their attention to defense in Round 1 -- despite new coach Mike LaFleur's offensive background.\n\nArvell Reese, LB, Ohio State\n\nReese's instincts and burst are all over the tape. I'm still ranking him as a linebacker at the moment, and he could help Tennessee there. But new coach Robert Saleh might very well move him to the edge, where he played the majority of the time in 2025. Although the Titans' 42 sacks tied for 12th most last season, 11 of them came from defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons on the interior. The edge is a weakness. Reese could be a high-impact player in this unit no matter where he lines up.\n\nSpencer Fano, OT, Utah\n\nIn January, I had Ohio State receiver Carnell Tate here. I think that's still very possible, as New York needs a WR2 opposite Malik Nabers. But it doesn't matter who Jaxson Dart is throwing to if he doesn't have enough time to get the ball out. Fano started 36 games over three seasons, and he allowed just four sacks (and only one over the past two years once flipping from left tackle to right tackle). His technique and power are outstanding. If free agent Jermaine Eluemunor doesn't return, I like Fano sliding into the RT spot in the lineup, helping keep Dart clean and driving defenders out of the way for running back Cam Skattebo.\n\nCarnell Tate, WR, Ohio State\n\nLike the Giants, the Browns need offensive line and receiver reinforcements. Unlike the Giants, the Browns have two first-round picks. So, although Miami lineman Francis Mauigoa is tempting here, Cleveland would likely take its pick of the entire WR class and kick the can down the order on the OL. Tate is at the top of the receiver list right now, with great hands and savvy route running. Cleveland wideouts combined for just four touchdowns last season, so after an 875-yard, nine-TD season, Tate could step in as the top option for the Browns.\n\nSonny Styles, LB, Ohio State\n\nThis would be the fourth Ohio State player off the board -- the most ever in the first seven picks for one school, per ESPN Research. Styles is getting a lot of love around the league right now, and he's going to be fun to watch at the combine if he works out. The former safety has real speed on a 6-foot-4, 243-pound frame.\n\nWith the Commanders' defense getting crushed for 6.0 yards per play last season (tied for third worst) and potentially losing 35-year-old free agent Bobby Wagner up the middle, this fit makes sense. But also keep an eye on Miami edge rusher Rueben Bain Jr. and the receiver class as a whole if the board falls this way.\n\nMakai Lemon, WR, USC\n\nQuarterback Tyler Shough flashed down the stretch of his rookie season, but now the Saints must help him take the next step in Year 2. I had Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson to New Orleans in my first mock draft, and though I'm sticking with the same position, I'm going with Lemon this time around. He attacks the ball in the air and would be a productive player for Shough after amassing 1,156 yards in 2025. Regardless of whether Chris Olave is in the team's long-term plans, New Orleans could improve the offense with someone like Lemon running routes out of the slot.\n\nWhich teams could draft Jeremiyah Love, Carnell Tate, Jordyn Tyson and Makai Lemon? ESPN\n\nJeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame\n\nLove is No. 2 on my Big Board, showcasing elite-level vision and burst. He can make a house call any time he touches the ball, and with his hands out of the backfield, he can stick on the field on third down. Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt are free agents, and they weren't exactly lighting up the ground game last season anyway. Love -- who had 1,372 rushing yards and 18 rushing TDs in 2025 -- could bring a whole new element to the Kansas City offense.\n\nRueben Bain Jr., DE, Miami\n\nIf Bain is still on the board at No. 10, the Bengals should sprint the card in with his name on it. This has been a very rough defense for a few years now, and things could look a lot worse if Trey Hendrickson leaves in free agency. Last year's Shemar Stewart pick hasn't yielded immediate returns, either. But Bain has the ability to wreck opponent game plans. He brings power, speed and bend, and he had 9.5 sacks in 2025. Defensive coordinator Al Golden could move him around on the D-line to find matchup advantages and turn him loose in the pass rush.\n\nFrancis Mauigoa, OT/G, Miami\n\nThe Dolphins' quarterback situation is unsettled, as they explore trade options for Tua Tagovailoa. But Alabama's Ty Simpson is still a reach here. So, let's instead look at the offensive line. Right tackle Austin Jackson -- the team's last first-round pick on the offensive line back in 2020 -- has struggled to stay on the field, and fill-in Larry Borom is a free agent. Mauigoa comes with 42 starts of experience and a mauling attitude. Plus, he'd be able to keep his parking pass at Hard Rock Stadium as he comes over from the Hurricanes.\n\nIf Jackson stays healthy and takes ownership of the RT spot, Mauigoa could easily kick inside to guard. Some scouts think he's a better fit there, and plenty of attention will be paid to his arm length measurements this week at the combine.\n\nMansoor Delane, CB, LSU\n\nNo team gave up more passing plays of 25 or more yards last season than the Cowboys (46). Trevon Diggs was cut at the end of the season, and DaRon Bland is coming off his second surgery on his left foot in two years. If there weren't already enough signs for Dallas, the entire cornerback class is still available at No. 12 here. Delane can shut down opposing receivers while also making a bunch of plays on the ball. He broke up 11 passes and pulled down two interceptions last season.\n\nJermod McCoy, CB, Tennessee\n\nNo change for the Rams' first pick from my last mock draft. McCoy didn't play at all in 2025 after tearing an ACL last January, and the medical checks this week in Indianapolis will be key for him. But there's no arguing his on-the-ball production. He had four picks and nine pass breakups in 2024.\n\nThe Rams have the sort of roster that can go to the Super Bowl, and quarterback Matthew Stafford is set to return for another season. But cornerback is a definite weak spot; GM Les Snead has to make that position a priority this offseason.\n\nJordyn Tyson, WR, Arizona State\n\nThe Ravens should bounce back in 2026, but they will be looking for a true outside receiver with the hands to soak in a bunch of Lamar Jackson targets. Going with Tyson here would allow Zay Flowers to live in the slot -- where he is at his best -- and lift the whole offense. Tyson caught eight TD passes in 2025, and he excels on contested catches thanks to his 6-foot-2 frame and overall strength.\n\nIt would be the sixth time that Baltimore took a pass catcher in the first round since 2015, but the team clearly needs more options in the pass game. Rashod Bateman has been inconsistent, and DeAndre Hopkins, Isaiah Likely and Tylan Wallace are all free agents.\n\nCJ Allen, LB, Georgia\n\nLavonte David had 114 tackles last season, but he can't play forever. He's 36 years old and joins fellow linebacker Anthony Walker Jr. in free agency this offseason. Allen is a three-down linebacker who mixes speed with power to make plays in coverage, against the run and as a blitzer. He might be LB3 in the class, but he's a top-25 prospect overall. He'd be a good fit under coach Todd Bowles as the Bucs try to retool a bit to reclaim the NFC South.\n\nPeter Woods, DT, Clemson\n\nThe Jets are back on the clock, and after I handed them a difference-making safety in Caleb Downs earlier, I'll go with a Quinnen Williams replacement this time around. Three Jets defensive tackles are hitting free agency, and they've lacked a real impact player in the middle of the D-line since trading Williams at the deadline. Woods didn't have elite production in 2025, but the tape was still really good. He has the power to be a force at 3-technique for New York.\n\nI had the Jets taking Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson here in January. I could still see it. But the Jets have three first-round picks in 2027, when the QB class should be much better. It makes more sense to find a bridge in 2026 and focus on rebuilding the defense before going with someone like Arch Manning or Dante Moore next spring.\n\nZion Young, DE, Missouri\n\nWe've been begging the Lions to add a long-term threat off the edge opposite Aidan Hutchinson for a while now. Al-Quadin Muhammad had a surprise breakout last season with 11 sacks, but he's a free agent. Tyrus Wheat was next best in sacks among pure edge rushers ... with 1.5. So, although the interior offensive line might warrant a look (Penn State's Olaivavega Ioane?), Detroit has to address the lack of depth on the edge. Young has strong hands and good quickness, and he had 6.5 sacks and 46 pressures last season.\n\nDillon Thieneman, S, Oregon\n\nHarrison Smith is 37 years old; he might retire this offseason, and even if he returns, the safety room in Minnesota still has to be replenished. How about a Smith clone? Thieneman might not have Smith's 6-foot-2 size (he's 6-foot), but he reads the QB well and is savvy. That matters a lot in defensive coordinator Brian Flores' defense, which asks a lot of rookies. Plus, Thieneman has versatility to move around the alignment, is a force against the run and had a six-INT season at Purdue back in 2023 before transferring to Oregon. He'd be a seamless fit in the Vikings' defense.\n\nKeldric Faulk, DE, Auburn\n\nThe Panthers took a leap forward last season, but the pass rush is still lagging behind. Their 30 sacks tied for the third fewest in the NFL, and their 26.6% pressure rate was second lowest. I liked what I saw out of second-round rookie Nic Scourton (five sacks), but Carolina needs more. Faulk is a people mover, and although he managed only two sacks last season, he had seven in 2024. If defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero can unlock Faulk's potential, this pick could look like a steal in a few years.\n\nAkheem Mesidor, DE, Miami\n\nIt's an all-defense first round for Dallas -- first cornerback (Mansoor Delane at No. 12), now edge rusher. Of course, Mesidor wouldn't be a one-for-one replacement for Micah Parsons, who was sorely missed in Dallas last season. But with 12.5 sacks in the final season of a six-year college career, Mesidor would at least jump-start the pass rush and start to build that unit back up. Jadeveon Clowney was the lone Cowboys player to crack six sacks in 2025 (8.5), and he's a free agent. Jerry Jones has to commit to using premium picks on the edge, especially with one of the league's tighter cap situations.\n\nTy Simpson, QB, Alabama\n\nThe Steelers have to think about the QB position with a longer-view lens. They could bring back Aaron Rodgers or opt for another veteran stopgap to keep them in contention next season, but even if they go that route, they should still address their future at the position. Simpson has just 15 starts to his name, and his 2025 season was uneven, but his game has a lot of promise. He navigates the pocket well and threw 28 touchdown passes to just five interceptions last season. Pittsburgh could let him learn behind a veteran for a little while before turning the offense over to him.\n\nOlaivavega Ioane, G, Penn State\n\nA lot of the Chargers' offensive line woes can be traced back to injuries to tackles Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater. But the interior had its own problems. Zion Johnson (now a free agent) and Mekhi Becton both struggled at guard. GM Joe Hortiz has to do something to prevent all these hits quarterback Justin Herbert is taking every Sunday, and Ioane has a great combination of sheer power and agility. He hasn't given up a sack since 2023. Plus, Ioane could help open some rushing lanes for Omarion Hampton in the back's second year.\n\nKenyon Sadiq, TE, Oregon\n\nIf Philadelphia doesn't bring back free agent Dallas Goedert, it would be smart to draft a top-end replacement. Quarterback Jalen Hurts found Goedert for a team-high 11 receiving touchdowns last season, and he was the third-most-targeted pass catcher on the roster. In other words, Hurts likes throwing to his TE1. Sadiq had eight touchdown receptions last season, and he's explosive and does a lot of damage after the catch. NFC defenses would have a tough time matching up with him because of his speed and 6-foot-3, 245-pound size.\n\nplay 0:18 Dante Moore throws 21-yard touchdown pass to Kenyon Sadiq Dante Moore throws a 21-yard touchdown pass to Kenyon Sadiq\n\nMonroe Freeling, OT, Georgia\n\nThe Browns went with Carnell Tate earlier, but their entire starting offensive line from last season is unsigned: Cam Robinson, Joel Bitonio, Ethan Pocic, Wyatt Teller and Jack Conklin. And Dawand Jones, who would have started, is coming off a season-ending knee injury. So we know where this pick has to go.\n\nFreeling has started only 18 games, but he's a solid pass protector. He just needs some work as a run blocker. His ceiling is high, and I like the idea of pairing the 6-foot-7 Freeling with the 6-foot-8 Jones as the O-line's bookends.\n\nKayden McDonald, DT, Ohio State\n\nIt's probably a little early for Texas A&M's Cashius Howell, Clemson's T.J. Parker or Oklahoma's R Mason Thomas. The Bears obviously need more edge rush support, but the board just isn't lining up. But with Gervon Dexter Sr. signed for only one more season and Grady Jarrett turning 33 in April, it would make sense to pad the defensive tackle group. McDonald is actually the DT1 on my Big Board, and he has a nose for the football. He had 17 run stops in 2025. Having him on the interior would be huge for a Bears team that allowed 5.0 yards per carry last season (fourth worst).\n\nDenzel Boston, WR, Washington\n\nBoston's hands, catch radius and vision would quickly make him a go-to option for quarterback Josh Allen. He finished with 881 yards and 11 scores last season, bullying opposing cornerbacks along the way.\n\nBuffalo's receiver room has a lot of questions and lacks a true WR1, all due respect to Khalil Shakir. After being called out by ownership last month, Keon Coleman's future with the team is murky. Brandin Cooks and Gabe Davis are free agents. Joshua Palmer was injured and limited to 22 catches on the season. And Tyrell Shavers tore an ACL in the playoffs. So, this one seems obvious.\n\nKadyn Proctor, OT/G, Alabama\n\nProctor's tape is all over the place. The highs are really, really good. The lows raise a lot of questions. But in the right situation, he could become a standout tackle in the NFL. And there might not be a better situation than learning behind one of the best to ever do it in San Francisco. Trent Williams will be 38 by Week 1, and he's entering the final year of his contract. So, Proctor could develop in Year 1 while kicking inside to guard and/or playing a swing tackle role before perhaps taking over for Williams in 2027. He has 40 career starts -- all at left tackle -- and is reliable in pass protection. This would be an upside pick for GM John Lynch.\n\nCheck out 'NFL Draft Daily' on ESPN2 Want to know more about the 2026 NFL draft class?

Join Mel Kiper Jr., Field Yates and other experts for the latest on top prospects.\n\nJadarian Price, RB, Notre Dame\n\nPer ESPN Research, this would be the fourth time two running backs from the same school both went in Round 1 -- and the first time since 2008, when Arkansas' Darren McFadden and Felix Jones were Day 1 selections. But just because Price was second on the Fighting Irish's depth chart to Jeremiyah Love doesn't mean he can't be an RB1 in the NFL. He's a powerful runner who plays a one-cut-and-go brand of football. There are ball security concerns (four lost fumbles over three years), and we haven't seen a ton from him as a pass catcher, but Price is dynamic. He ran for 11 touchdowns, caught two TD passes and scored two more times on kickoff returns last season.\n\nThe Texans lacked juice in the run game. Woody Marks is probably more of a change-of-pace guy, Nick Chubb is a free agent, and Joe Mixon's future is uncertain. Time for an upgrade.\n\nBlake Miller, OT, Clemson\n\nRob Havenstein retired, and Warren McClendon Jr. is entering the final year of his deal. That means there could be a big hole at right tackle. Miller has 54 career starts, and his game just keeps growing on me. In pass protection, he stays square and handles most pass-rush moves with ease. And as a run blocker, he can get to the second level to spring big gains. The blocking is so important to the Rams' excellent run game, and having a savvy right tackle is key.\n\nThe Rams' first pick in this mock draft went to the defense (Jermod McCoy), but I really like the idea of L.A. adding to the offensive line with its second one.\n\nEmmanuel McNeil-Warren, S, Toledo\n\nThe Broncos have two solid safeties in Talanoa Hufanga and Brandon Jones, so this pick might not reap immediate rewards. But neither did the Jahdae Barron pick last April. Denver is planning ahead in the secondary and building something there, as coach Sean Payton focuses on keeping this defense strong.\n\nMcNeil-Warren is a bit of a sleeper right now, but I think he could have been a top-15 pick had he played for a Power 4 team. His performance against Kentucky at the beginning of the season got my attention. He had 11 tackles and a fumble recovery in that game. His tape shows real speed to the football, and he has five interceptions and 12 forced fumbles over his four-year career.\n\nR Mason Thomas, OLB, Oklahoma\n\nAs they try to get back to the Super Bowl with a talented roster, the Patriots could use another solid edge rusher or two. Thomas can get offensive tackles leaning and then beat them with either speed or power. He uses his hands well and shows good bend off the edge. He had 15.5 sacks over the past two years. K'Lavon Chaisson is hitting free agency, so New England would love to have someone like Thomas getting after the quarterback.\n\nAvieon Terrell, CB, Clemson\n\nLet's close out Round 1 with a talented cornerback to replace free agents Riq Woolen and Josh Jobe, giving this Super Bowl champion defense yet another playmaker. The brother of A.J. Terrell Jr., Avieon Terrell can fly in coverage, and he had 27 pass breakups over three seasons. He could slide into the lineup opposite Devon Witherspoon, with Nick Emmanwori in the slot."

Thank all... — Jermaine Johnson II (@ii_jermaine) February 26, 2026\n\nJohnson will be reunited with Titans coach Robert Saleh, who coached the Jets when they selected Johnson with the 26th overall pick in the 2022 draft.\n\nJohnson also will once again play under new Titans defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton, who was his position coach with the Jets his first three seasons.\n\nJohnson, coming off a down year (three sacks), has only one year remaining on his contract and is due to make a guaranteed $13.4 million in 2026, the amount of his fifth-year option.\n\nJohnson generated interest last season before the trade deadline, but the Jets opted to keep him for the remainder of the season. His departure reinforces the belief that the Jets will take an edge player with the No. 2 pick in this year's draft, with Ohio State's Arvell Reese and Texas Tech's David Bailey as the leading candidates.\n\nIn Sweat, the Jets are getting a 6-foot-2, 366-pound interior presence on a team-friendly contract. A second-round pick in 2024, he is signed through 2027 and will count only $1.7 million on the Jets' salary cap.\n\nScheme factored into the trade for both teams. The Jets, who could be using more 3-4 fronts, wanted to add more size up front. The opposite is true for Tennessee, where Saleh's scheme puts a premium on smaller, faster linemen.\n\nSweat, drafted 38th overall in 2024, posted 85 tackles and three sacks in 29 games for the Titans. He suffered an ankle injury in Tennessee's season-opening loss to the Broncos and missed five games last season.\n\nThe Titans are counting on Johnson regaining his form from 2023, when he posted a career-high 7.5 sacks and was named to the Pro Bowl as an injury replacement. His 2024 season didn't last long. In Week 2, at Tennessee, he tore an Achilles tendon and missed the remainder of the season.\n\nJohnson rehabbed to make it back for the start of the 2025 season, but he didn't have the same burst as before the injury. In 14 games, he finished with only three sacks and six quarterback hits, later admitting his performance wasn't up to his standard. Both he and the team acknowledged that the Achilles injury probably affected his performance.\n\nIn four seasons -- 47 games -- with the Jets, Johnson has 13 sacks and 131 tackles.\n\nESPN's Turron Davenport contributed to this report."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nBrady Tkachuk, the Ottawa Senators captain and a Team USA gold medalist, said he didn't appreciate the AI-doctored video released by the White House that made it appear he was disparaging Canadians.\n\nThe video, published Sunday by the White House's official TikTok account, featured doctored footage from a Tkachuk brothers' press conference at the 4 Nations Face-Off last February. While \"Free Bird,\" the goal song for Team USA, played in the background of the video, Brady Tkachuk was made to say, \"They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple syrup eating f---- a lesson.\"\n\nThe clip, which discloses that it used AI-generated media, has 11.1 million views on TikTok and was widely viewed on other social media platforms.\n\n\"Well, it's clearly fake, because it's not my voice, not my lips moving,\" Tkachuk said Thursday in his first media availability in Ottawa since the U.S. defeated Canada for the gold medal in men's Olympic ice hockey in Milan. \"I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. So, I can't do anything about it.\"\n\nTkachuk was asked if he enjoyed the video.\n\n\"It's not my voice. It's not what I was saying,\" he said. \"I would never say that. That's not who I am, so I guess I don't like that video because that would never come out of my mouth and never had that thought.\"\n\nTkachuk also addressed what he didn't say during Team USA's locker room celebration. Some on social media accused Tkachuk of being the person who shouted \"Close the northern border!\" during Team USA's congratulatory call with President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I've been seeing stuff that people think it's me. But if you watch the video, it's not my voice or something that I never say,\" Tkachuk said. \"I don't know how that took a storm on its own when I give everything I have here.\n\n\"It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.\"\n\nOn that call, Trump made a widely circulated comment about the U.S. women's hockey team that also won Olympic gold.\n\nWhen Trump extended an invitation to the men's players to come to Washington for the State of the Union address, he said: \"I must tell you, we're going to have to bring the women's team, you do know that,\" adding with a laugh that if he didn't also invite the women's team, \"I do believe I probably would be impeached.\" Some players laughed along with the joke.\n\nTeam USA star Hilary Knight said Wednesday on \"SportsCenter\" that she felt it was a \"distasteful\" joke that \"unfortunately is overshadowing\" the success her team had in Milan. Boston Bruins goalie Jeremy Swayman, a member of Team USA, said Wednesday that \"we should've reacted differently.\"\n\nLike other American players, Tkachuk detailed a positive relationship between the men's and women's teams in the Olympics, from attending each other's games to hanging out at 3 a.m. in the Olympic Village café after the men returned as champions.\n\nTkachuk said he understood why women's players could feel insulted by that comment.\n\n\"I mean, I get it,\" he said. \"We support them, they support us. You can't control what other people say. It was fun being around them, seeing how they play and the excellence around them.\n\n\"If I see one of them, we'll talk about the excitement of what we can control, which is to be gold medalists.\"\n\nAs for why the men's team laughed at Trump's comment, Tkachuk said the players were \"caught off guard\" a little bit.\n\n\"I don't really have an answer. It's a whirlwind of a moment,\" he said. \"You can't control what somebody says. I guess got caught off guard a little bit. You're talking to the President 10 minutes after you achieve your dream.\"\n\nBrady Tkachuk is one of five Team USA players whose NHL clubs are based in Canada. He partied in Miami with his teammates and then attended the State of the Union Address in Washington, D.C., before returning to Ottawa.\n\n\"It was special,\" he said. \"Being an American citizen, you never really think you're going to see the White House and be in the Oval Office.\"\n\nBut Tkachuk noted the awkwardness of helping the U.S. defeat Canada for the gold medal while being the captain for a team in Canada's capital, a position he's held of the last five seasons in Ottawa.\n\n\"It's just such a passionate fan base,\" he said. \"I said this after 4 Nations: It's a unique feeling when every single day the support from this fan base and then for three weeks they're not cheering for you. It's a crazy feeling.\n\n\"I've given absolutely everything I have as an Ottawa Senator. When you represent the U.S., it's about being an American. It's an honor. There's only three teams that ever won the gold medal. I wanted to achieve my childhood dream and bring a gold medal back to the U.S.\""

            "content": "Check out the highlights from the top 10 college football players entering the season according to ESPN's experts. (1:56)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Good luck finding a better defender than Caleb Downs in this year's NFL draft class.\n\nThe former Ohio State safety is projected to be a potential top-five pick when teams make their selections in April. And amid questions about whether using a premium pick on a safety is worth it, Downs said being the best defender should weigh the most in that consideration.\n\nAnd in his mind, no player in college football was better than him.\n\n\"I feel confident every time I stepped on the field,\" Downs said. \"If I would say I walked on the field and thought anybody was better than me, yeah, that's not true.\"\n\nCaleb Downs says he always has considered himself the best defender on any field he's walked on and believes that should carry weight over positional value when teams in the top 10 are making their selections this year. AP Photo/Eric Gay\n\nLast season, Downs was named the Big Ten's Defensive Player of the Year and also won the Thorpe Award, which is given to the country's top defensive back. He was also a captain for the nation's best scoring defense (9.3 points per game).\n\nIf Downs goes within the top five picks, he'll be the first player to accomplish that feat since Eric Berry was selected fifth overall in 2010. Since 2000, just six defensive backs have been taken within that range.\n\nDowns, who declared for the draft following his third year of college, believes his skills should put him in that conversation.\n\n\"It's not really [about] positional value,\" Downs said. \"It's who affects the game. If you affect the game in a lot of ways, that's what's most important.\"\n\nDowns spent his first season at Alabama before transferring to Ohio State, where he spent his sophomore and junior years. He helped Ohio State win the College Football Playoff championship in 2024.\n\nAnd as the way safeties and defensive backs are used continues to change, Downs is a big believer in being able to play anywhere from deep in coverage to being lined up as a slot cornerback on the line of scrimmage.\n\n\"I feel like being able to play multiple positions is what makes people useful,\" Downs said. \"It makes people special.\"\n\nHowever NFL teams decide to use him, Downs is ready for the challenge.\n\n\"My confidence level is always at the highest when I'm on the field and the belief in myself really never goes down no matter the circumstance,\" said Downs when asked what makes him the best player in the draft class.\n\n\"I feel like my mind really puts me above a lot of people in terms of how I process the game and play with instincts, and I feel like that's what makes me special.\""

No limits.\"\n\nMcCoy, who sustained a torn ACL in January 2025 while training after the conclusion of the previous season, underwent medical exams at the combine but won't perform on-field drills yet. He said he preferred to wait until the Tennessee pro day in order to give himself additional preparation time.\n\nRegarding his decision to enter the draft, McCoy said it was a clear-cut choice despite his injury, his remaining eligibility and the prospect of NIL income. McCoy is expected to be one of the first defensive backs selected.\n\n\"I just feel like when you're ready, you're ready,\" he said. \"I felt ready to come out and talked with my family, my agent, my coaches. They're all on the same boat as me and agree with everything I was seeing.\"\n\nMcCoy began his career at Oregon State in 2023, transferring to Tennessee in 2024. In his one season with the Volunteers, he became a Jim Thorpe Award semifinalist, a first-team All-SEC selection and a second-team Associated Press All-American.\n\n\"I got back to training and I just felt like myself again,\" he said. \"I mean, I made a big impact the year that I played and I was ready.\"\n\nMcCoy said he did entertain returning to the lineup for Tennessee last season. He was cleared to practice, he said, and considered the idea of a comeback. But he ultimately decided against it.\n\n\"I got cleared,\" he said. \"I was doing everything, practicing, everything. I just didn't feel ready yet.\"\n\nESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper lists McCoy as the No. 13 player on his Big Board."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThree-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer has agreed to return to the Toronto Blue Jays, a source confirmed to ESPN's Alden Gonzalez on Wednesday.\n\nThe deal is for one year and $3 million, according to multiple reports.\n\nBringing Scherzer back became a bigger need for Toronto with right-hander Bowden Francis undergoing season-ending Tommy John surgery earlier this month and with Shane Bieber delayed with a bout of forearm fatigue.\n\nScherzer, 41, will join newcomers Cody Ponce and Dylan Cease in the rotation. The Blue Jays could choose to ramp him up slowly, prompting him to join the rotation in-season.\n\nAs Scherzer has pitched into his 40s, he has increasingly lost time to injury. He threw a total of 85 regular-season innings for the Blue Jays in 2025 after accumulating only 43⅓ for the Texas Rangers in 2024.\n\nBlue Jays manager John Schneider raved about Scherzer's competitiveness and preparation, and he threw well enough to earn three big starts for Toronto in the postseason -- in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, when he worked through early-inning trouble to stifle the Seattle lineup, and in Games 3 and 7 of the World Series.\n\nFive years after he throws his final pitch, Scherzer will make a speech in Cooperstown, and presumably his election into the Hall of Fame will be unanimous or close to it. Scherzer has finished in the top five of Cy Young Award voting eight times. He has a career 221-117 record with a 3.22 ERA, and his career Adjusted OPS+ of 131 is equivalent to that of Sandy Koufax.\n\nScherzer was a first-round draft pick of the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2006, and he debuted in the big leagues two years later. His delivery at that time drew a lot of scrutiny because of how he snapped his head to the left as he released the ball.\n\nArizona officials discussed the possibility of turning him into a closer, but the Diamondbacks instead shipped him to the Detroit Tigers as part of a three-team trade with the New York Yankees. With the Tigers, Scherzer flourished, going 82-35 over five seasons while establishing himself as one of the game's premier pitchers.\n\nHe signed with the Washington Nationals after the 2014 season, and he and Stephen Strasburg helped them to a championship in 2019. Over the course of his career, he has grossed nearly $370 million in salary, a reflection of his excellence on the mound.\n\nMLB Network was first to report Scherzer's agreement with Toronto.\n\nESPN's Buster Olney contributed to this report."

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said the US and Iran had shown \"openness to new and creative ideas\" after meeting Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff\n\nUS and Iranian officials have met in Geneva for a third round of indirect talks seen as crucial to averting conflict, with President Donald Trump threatening to strike Iran if a nuclear deal is not reached.\n\nThe discussions come amid the largest US military build-up in the Middle East since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, and with Iran vowing to respond to an attack with force.\n\nTalks resumed on Thursday evening, having been adjourned following a three-hour morning session. But the chances of an agreement remain unclear.\n\nOman's Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, acting as the mediator, earlier said negotiators had exchanged \"creative and positive ideas\", and hoped to make \"more progress\".\n\nWhile Trump has said he prefers to solve the crisis through diplomacy, he has also said he is considering a limited strike on Iran to pressure its leaders to accept a deal.\n\nThe president, however, has done little to explain what he is demanding in the negotiations and why there could be the need to take military action now, eight months after the US bombed Iranian nuclear facilities during a war between Israel and Iran.\n\nIran has rejected the US demand to stop the enrichment of uranium in its territory, but there have been indications that it is prepared to offer some concessions about its nuclear programme.\n\nAs in the previous two rounds of discussions earlier this month, the Iranian delegation is being led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, while the US is represented by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nIn recent weeks, the US has sent thousands of troops and what Trump has described as an \"armada\" to the region, including two aircraft carriers along with other warships, as well as fighter jets and refuelling aircraft.\n\nTrump first threatened to bomb Iran last month as security forces brutally repressed anti-government protests, killing thousands of people. But since then, his focus has turned to Iran's nuclear programme, which has been at the centre of a long-running dispute with the West.\n\nFor decades, the US and Israel have accused Iran of trying to secretly develop a nuclear weapon. Iran insists its programme is only for peaceful purposes, though the country is the only non-nuclear-armed state to have enriched uranium at near weapons-grade level.\n\nThe indirect talks are taking place at the Omani ambassador's residence in Geneva\n\nIn his State of the Union speech to Congress on Tuesday, Trump briefly and vaguely talked about the tensions with Iran, without clearly laying out the case for strikes.\n\nHe said Iran was working to build missiles that would \"soon\" be capable of reaching the US, without giving details. He also accused the country of trying to \"start all over again\" with a nuclear weapons programme following last year's strikes, and said he could not allow the \"world's number one sponsor of terror... to have a nuclear weapon\".\n\nThe US struck three nuclear sites in Iran last June, as it joined Israel in its bombing campaign. At the time, Trump said the facilities had been \"obliterated\".\n\nIran says its enrichment activity stopped after the attacks, although it has not allowed the International Atomic Energy Agency's inspectors to access the damaged sites.\n\n\"They want to make a deal,\" Trump said, \"but we haven't heard those secret words: 'We will never have a nuclear weapon'.\"\n\nHours before the speech, however, the Iranian foreign minister posted on social media that Iran would \"under no circumstances ever develop a nuclear weapon\". Araghchi also said there was an \"historic opportunity to strike an unprecedented agreement that addresses mutual concerns and achieves mutual interests\".\n\nReacting to Trump's address, an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman accused the US of repeating \"big lies\" regarding its nuclear programme, ballistic missiles and the number of protesters killed in the crackdown.\n\nForeign Minister Abbas Araghchi says Iran \"will under no circumstances ever develop a nuclear weapon\"\n\nIran's proposals have not been made public, but the discussions in Geneva could include the creation of a regional consortium for uranium enrichment, which has been raised in previous negotiations, as well as ideas about what to do with Iran's roughly 400kg (880lb) stockpile of highly enriched uranium and verification and monitoring mechanisms.\n\nIn return, Iran expects the lifting of sanctions that have crippled its economy. Opponents of the regime say any relief would give the clerical rulers a lifeline.\n\nBut it remains unclear which conditions Trump could find acceptable for a deal. Iran has already rejected discussing limits to the country's ballistic missile programme and ending its support for proxies in the region - an alliance Tehran calls the \"Axis of Resistance\" that includes Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, militias in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nWhat are Trump's options?\n\nReports in US media, quoting unnamed administration officials, have suggested that Trump was considering an initial strike in the coming days on Iran's Revolutionary Guards or nuclear sites to pressure the country's leaders. If negotiations failed, according to the reports, the president might go as far as ordering a campaign with the aim of toppling the Iranian Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is also said to have warned that strikes against Iran could be risky, potentially drawing the US into a prolonged conflict, although Trump has insisted that Gen Dan Caine believes it would be \"easily won\".\n\nIran, meanwhile, has threatened to respond to any attack by striking American military assets in the Middle East and Israel.\n\nUSS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, left Souda Bay in Crete on Thursday\n\nUS-allied countries in the region are concerned that an attack on Iran could lead to a wider conflict, and have warned that air power alone will not be able to change the country's leadership.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, has warned against a deal that does not include Iran's ballistic missiles and its proxies. Netanyahu has long described Iran as a key threat for Israel, and a source of instability in the region.\n\nAnalysts believe that the prime minister, who visited the White House earlier this month, may be pushing for a campaign with the goal of toppling the Iranian regime.\n\nThe US has the world's second-largest nuclear arsenal. Israel is also believed to have nuclear weapons, although it neither confirms nor denies this.\n\nAhead of the State of the Union, Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivered a classified briefing to the so-called \"gang of eight\", composed of the leaders of both parties in the Senate and House of Representatives and the chairs and ranking members of the intelligence committees of both chambers.\n\nFollowing the briefing, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, gave a brief statement, saying: \"This is serious, and the administration has to make its case to the American people.\"\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

It will have to be ratified by both the UK and European Parliaments.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Executive Director of the Fisheries Commission, Prof. Benjamin Campion, has highlighted the need for insurance cover for fishermen as part of urgent measures to tackle rising piracy and robbery attacks at sea.\n\nSpeaking on JoyNews' The Pulse on February 26, Prof. Campion said authorities are shifting focus beyond security patrols to also cushion fisherfolk against financial losses.\n\n“We’ve received reports from the fishermen themselves, and one of the major efforts we’ve been undertaking in recent times is not only to look at security at sea but also to provide some form of insurance for them,” he stated.\n\nHis comments follow attacks on some fishermen at sea near Senya Beraku, where gun-wielding men robbed the Ghanaian crew of their outboard motors, generators and other valuables.\n\nAccording to him, several fishermen have reported cases where sea robbers vandalised their canoes, seized fishing equipment and made away with their catch.\n\n“Sometimes they vandalise the canoes, take items they are interested in and take their fish away. Some form of insurance will help and give them some level of protection,” he explained.\n\nProf. Campion disclosed that discussions are ongoing with an insurance agency to develop tailored packages for small-scale fishers.\n\nUnlike artisanal canoe operators, industrial trawl and tuna vessels typically have insurance cover and, in some cases, onboard security.\n\nHe, however, admitted that providing individual security for the over 14,000 registered canoes across the country remains a major challenge.\n\n“It will be very difficult providing them individual policing at sea for each canoe,” he said.\n\nAs part of alternative interventions, he said that authorities are collaborating with the Ghana Navy to organise training programmes aimed at equipping fishermen with basic security awareness and survival skills.\n\n“Our canoes have flags and inscriptions and they know each other. If they see a suspicious vessel, they should move away or work together. There is strength in numbers,” he advised.\n\nHe further revealed that naval patrols will be intensified within recognised fishing grounds, particularly within the 12-nautical-mile Inshore Exclusion Zone reserved for artisanal fishers.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that some fishermen venture beyond the designated zone, exposing themselves to greater danger.\n\n“When they move beyond the 12 nautical miles, we also have to look at how to protect them. That is why we are focusing on training and survival skills at sea,” he said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Ranking Member on Parliament's Defence and Interior Committee, Rev. John Ntim Fordjour, has called for the urgent acquisition of offshore patrol vessels to strengthen Ghana’s maritime security following the recent armed attack on fishermen near Senya Beraku.\n\nSpeaking on Asempa FM’s Ekosii Sen show on Thursday, he said the presence of such vessels would serve as a strong deterrent to pirates and other criminal elements operating within Ghana’s territorial waters.\n\nHis comments come in the wake of a violent sea attack on Wednesday, February 25, which left several fishermen stranded after armed men reportedly fired warning shots, held them at gunpoint, and made away with seven outboard motors and other valuables.\n\nSo far, all 71 fishermen have been rescued after fellow fishers towed their disabled canoes back to shore in a collaborative effort which involved the Ghana Navy and Ghana Air Force.\n\nHe stressed that piracy is becoming increasingly frequent and worrying.\n\nHe also expressed concern over delays in appointing a substantive Defence Minister, warning that the situation could expose the country to external threats.\n\n“Piracy is becoming a growing concern. The crisis in the defence sector is alarming. For the past few months, we have urged the President to appoint a substantive Minister of Defence. The failure to do so has made our country vulnerable to external threats. It is reckless and dangerous that the President has taken no action in this regard. The message we are sending to external actors is that we do not take our defence seriously,” he remarked.\n\nAccording to Rev. Fordjour, strengthening naval capacity with offshore patrol vessels is critical to safeguarding Ghana’s waters and preventing future attacks.\n\n“Ghana needs offshore patrol vessels along its borders to counter piracy effectively. The absence of a Defence Minister, who should provide oversight and conduct risk assessments to prevent potential threats, is troubling. Acquiring offshore patrol vessels would serve as a deterrent to those planning attacks in our waters. We need to expedite the procurement of these vessels; further delays are unacceptable.\n\n“Let us equip ourselves with the necessary assets to strengthen Ghana’s maritime defences and effectively ward off any potential pirate threats,” he added.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Atlas has warehouses at cocoa growing areas in Ashanti, Eastern, Western and Central regions,” the statement said.\n\nThe response follows comments made by the MP at a press conference on February 23, where he suggested that Atlas may be operating from facilities belonging to the state-owned Produce Buying Company (PBC), in breach of regulations.\n\nMr Assafuah has raised concerns over possible conflicts of interest involving Atlas and officials of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), arguing that some private firms may be benefiting from access to state infrastructure.\n\nHe cited the Regulations and Guidelines for the Internal Marketing of Cocoa, 2015, which require Licensed Buying Companies to operate only in warehouses registered in their own names.\n\n“Warehouses registered under PBC must not be used by another company for storage, grading, sealing or processing of cocoa,” he said at the time.\n\nAtlas, however, insists it has maintained rented and registered depots in multiple districts since beginning operations in 2018.\n\nAccording to the company, its facilities span several communities in the Ashanti, Eastern, Central and Western South regions, including Effiduase, Kade, Nyakrom, Tarkwa and Bogoso, among others.\n\nThe company said these arrangements are backed by tenancy agreements and are verifiable through records held by the Quality Control Company and COCOBOD.\n\nIt added that it holds sustainability certifications under the Rainforest Alliance programme, which it says reflects compliance with industry standards.\n\nAtlas acknowledged that it temporarily used a PBC depot in Hohoe in December 2025 but described the move as an isolated, district-level arrangement.\n\nThe company said the facility was made available by the local PBC District Manager while Atlas was setting up operations in the Volta Region to prevent cocoa from being smuggled out of the country.\n\n“Access to the PBC facilities was granted at the district level within the context of established operational relationships,” the statement noted, adding that borrowed jute sacks had since been replaced.\n\nWhile Atlas maintains that it operates independently and within regulatory requirements, Mr Assafuah insists that questions remain over access to infrastructure and compliance with cocoa marketing rules.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Instead, GANRAP adopts a structured, gold-backed and reform-driven framework designed to enhance resilience against global economic turbulence while building what he described as an economic war chest to protect stability and sustain long-term growth.\n\n\n\nHe expressed appreciation to Ghanaians for their support and reaffirmed the commitment of President John Dramani Mahama’s administration to safeguarding the country’s economic future.\n\n\n\nGhanaian man and his Nigerian girlfriend found dead in Morocco apartment"

            "content": "Professor Peter Quartey is an economist and a researcher\n\nGhana loses more than GH¢6.2 billion every year due to diseases linked to poor waste management and sanitation, a new study by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research at the University of Ghana has revealed.\n\nThe findings were presented at a high-level stakeholder engagement in Accra, on Thursday, February 26, 2026, where policymakers, Members of Parliament, local government officials, development partners, and private sector actors gathered to examine the economic case for increased sanitation investment.\n\n\n\nThe research, led by Prof Peter Quartey and Dr Kwame Adjei-Mantey, is titled “An Economic Analysis of the Benefits of Adequate Investment in Waste Management and Sanitation in Ghana.” It assessed both the economic and social consequences of current sanitation practices and modelled the potential gains from improved financing.\n\n\n\nISSER calls for tougher measures to deliver growth, jobs targets\n\n\n\nAccording to the study, five diseases closely associated with poor sanitation, malaria, cholera, pneumonia, typhoid fever, and diarrhoea account for nearly 31.9 million lost workdays each year and an estimated 177,222 deaths. The researchers calculated direct medical costs at about GH¢5.8 billion annually, with an additional GH¢650 million lost through reduced productivity, bringing the total burden to over GH¢6.2 billion.\n\n\n\nDespite these losses, Ghana currently spends an average of about GH¢38 per tonne of waste generated. The researchers described this as modest compared to the scale of the health and economic damage linked to poor sanitation systems.\n\nUsing cost-benefit modelling, the team found that under the current business-as-usual approach, every GH¢1 invested in waste management generates about GH¢180 in economic returns. However, under a best-case scenario, where investment rises to approximately GH¢1,028 per tonne in line with lower-middle-income benchmarks, returns could increase to GH¢556 per GHS 1 invested.\n\n\n\nIn total terms, projected national benefits under the enhanced investment scenario could reach about GH¢58 billion in 2025 and rise further to GH¢67.2 billion by 2032. The projected gains are driven largely by sharp reductions in disease incidence, mortality, and productivity losses.\n\n\n\nPresenting the findings, Prof Quartey urged the government to stop treating sanitation as a residual expenditure. He stressed that waste management must be viewed as a high-return development investment capable of protecting public health and strengthening economic growth.\n\n\n\nThe presentation was followed by an extensive question-and-answer session. Participants raised concerns about how much of the disease burden could be directly attributed to waste. The research team explained that their modelling relied on global health data and assumed that about 45 percent of the selected disease cases were attributable to waste exposure. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to test different attribution levels.\n\n\n\nStakeholders also questioned whether the best-case scenario reflected on-the-ground realities, especially in slum and rural communities where waste collection remains inconsistent. Prof Quartey acknowledged that waste management in such areas is more complex and costly due to access challenges. He noted that flexible and smaller-scale collection systems may be required rather than a uniform national model.\n\nOther concerns focused on uncollected waste and dumping in drains and water bodies. The researchers explained that their modelling incorporated standardized ranges for lower-middle-income countries, taking into account infrastructure gaps and collection inefficiencies.\n\n\n\nMembers of Parliament present at the forum emphasized the need for stronger coordination across agencies. While some suggested the creation of a National Sanitation Authority, others cautioned against expanding bureaucracy and proposed strengthening existing institutional structures instead.\n\n\n\nISSER and ICED advocate evidence-based policies to drive national development\n\n\n\nEducation and job creation also featured prominently in the discussion. Prof Quartey highlighted earlier regional research on green jobs and recycling, stressing that investment in skills development and public awareness could help unlock employment opportunities in the waste sector.\n\n\n\nThe research team concluded that Ghana’s annual sanitation-related losses far exceed current spending levels. They called for increased and sustained investment, targeted interventions in high-risk communities, and stronger data and budgeting systems within Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies to ensure sanitation is prioritized as a central pillar of national development."

It is the foundation upon which public trust in the health system rests,” he said in his statement to Parliament.\n\n\n\nHe warned that Ghana’s emergency care challenges are systemic but insisted that systemic pressure cannot excuse preventable loss of life.\n\n\n\n“An emergency service that lacks operational vehicles cannot meet its statutory mandate,” he noted, referencing data that nearly 40 percent of ambulances are currently non-operational.\n\n\n\nAccording to Dr Agyemang, the broader emergency crisis must be addressed through operational efficiency and accountability.\n\n\n\n“The emergency crisis must therefore be addressed through a comprehensive systems reform approach grounded in operational efficiency and accountability,” he stated.\n\n\n\nHe called for strengthened oversight and measurable performance indicators, including ambulance response times and emergency admission rates, to ensure that healthcare professionals are supported but also held to clear standards.\n\n\n\n“When ambulances fail to respond promptly or hospitals are unable to admit critically ill patients, the consequences extend beyond statistics.

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

But absolutely determined to seize the future, and we can do it better together.”\n\nA joint statement highlighted cooperation in the field of “horizon scanning”, describing it as a mechanism that “helps identify emerging global trends in areas like technology, economy and society, by leveraging data”.\n\nIsrael also agreed to allow 50,000 more Indian nationals into the country, where tens of thousands of South Asians have filled construction and caregiving jobs since new restrictions were placed on Palestinian workers at the start of its war on Gaza.\n\nStrategic embrace\n\nModi’s visit, his second since he took office in 2014, has drawn criticism at home, signalling an ongoing expansion of India’s strategic embrace of Israel amid ongoing tensions over Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza, which has killed more than 72,000 people.\n\nConfirming their growing ties, the leaders’ joint statement referenced the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and an April 2025 attack on tourists and civilians in Pahalgam, in Indian-controlled Kashmir.\n\n\n\n“Terrorism cannot be accepted in any form or expression,” said Modi, who has historically supported the establishment of a Palestinian state yet has sometimes abstained from criticism of Israel in international forums, including the United Nations.\n\nEarlier this month, India was among the countries that condemned Israeli measures to effectively deepen its control over the occupied West Bank.\n\nBoth countries also lauded United States President Donald Trump’s plan to advance the “ceasefire” in the Gaza Strip."

            "content": "Despite its public objections to Israel’s actions, the UK is buying spyware developed and tested on Palestinians.\n\nThe United Kingdom’s government is investing in spyware developed and tested on Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank despite its public criticism of Israeli action there.\n\nIn addition to the Corsight facial recognition technology used to track, trace and detain thousands of Palestinian civilians passing through checkpoints in Gaza and the West Bank, the UK government has disregarded its own public concerns over Israel’s war on Gaza and de facto annexation of the West Bank and has purchased spyware from at least two other Israeli-linked manufacturers: Cellebrite and BriefCam.\n\nCellebrite\n\nCellebrite is an Israeli company closely linked to that country’s military. It has developed software that can bypass passwords and security protocols on smartphones and computers and access data from them.\n\nThat software has been used extensively by the Israeli military on Palestinians across Gaza and the West Bank, including to harvest data from the phones of thousands of detained Palestinians, many of whom have been subjected to systematic torture, a report by the American Friends Service Committee said.\n\nCellebrite is also reported to have received support from the United States Department of Defense to work on technology designed to map underground tunnels in the Gaza Strip.\n\nDespite its stated public concerns over Israeli action in Gaza and the West Bank, records show the UK has entered into several agreements to take advantage of the technology used by Israel in Palestinian territory.\n\nAccording to public records, a number of UK police forces have purchased access to Cellebrite software, including the City of London Police, which renewed its one-year contract with the Israeli company for more than 95,000 pounds ($128,600) in June. Leicestershire Police also renewed its contract with the Israeli spyware company in March for 328,688 pounds ($445,300). The British Transport Police, the UK’s Serious Fraud Office, Kent and Essex police, and Northumbria Police have also entered into contracts with Cellebrite.\n\n\n\nInquiries from Al Jazeera to the UK Home Office, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and the UK Police’s commercial agent, Blue Light Services, have all gone unanswered.\n\nHowever, while declining to comment on “specific customer relationships or contracts”, Victor Cooper, Cellebrite’s senior director of corporate communication, rejected the characterisation of the company’s activities as “hacking”, instead saying, “Cellebrite’s solutions are forensic tools used in legally sanctioned investigations and require physical possession of the device. They do not enable remote access.”\n\nRights groups have raised concerns over Cellebrite exporting its technology to hardline states worldwide, including Myanmar, Serbia and Belarus, where it has been used to extract information from the phones of opposition figures, journalists and activists.\n\nBriefCam\n\nThe Israeli-founded company BriefCam, which was acquired by Canon in 2018 and then by the Danish company Milestone Systems last year, has been providing the UK’s Cumbria Police with surveillance software since at least 2022.\n\nA further disclosure by Police Scotland in June confirms that Scotland’s police service is also considering using the service.\n\nBriefCam was founded in 2007 by Shmuel Peleg, Gideon Ben-Zvi and Yaron Caspi based on technology developed at Israel’s Hebrew University.\n\nThe company provides video synopsis programmes to law enforcement agencies, governments and companies. Police forces and private firms can use BriefCam’s Protect & Insights platform to sift through and condense hours of CCTV and home-surveillance footage, making it easily searchable.\n\nThe system includes facial-recognition and licence-plate search tools and allows police to build “watch lists” of specific faces or vehicle plates.\n\nThe technology has been used in East Jerusalem, Palestinian territory illegally occupied by Israel.\n\nAccording to undated files accessed by the research centre Who Profits, a tender document published by the Israeli Ministry of Housing and Construction inviting companies to bid for maintenance contracts for 98 security systems within East Jerusalem specified that the successful bidder must be able to maintain BriefCam’s software. Israeli public records also show that in 2021, Israeli police committed to a contract valued at $1m for BriefCam’s video analysis systems.\n\nA May 2023 report by the rights group Amnesty International documented how surveillance technology, such as that provided by BriefCam, was instrumental in maintaining Israel’s subjugation of Palestinians.\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, the use of surveillance software is critical in maintaining the “continued domination and oppression of Palestinians … [w]ith a record of discriminatory and inhuman acts that maintain a system of apartheid”.\n\nWhile not mentioning BriefCam by name, the report continued: “The Israeli authorities are able to use facial recognition software – in particular at checkpoints – to consolidate existing practices of discriminatory policing, segregation, and curbing freedom of movement, violating Palestinians’ basic rights.”\n\nAccording to the company, the software can also filter footage by a wide range of characteristics, including gender, age group, clothing, movement patterns and time spent in a given location.\n\nAnd that, despite the technology’s links to the oppression of Palestinians, is what makes it attractive to UK police forces.\n\nCumbria Police has said it does not currently use the facial recognition capabilities of BriefCam’s technology.\n\nA spokesperson for Cumbria Police also clarified that the force has been using BriefCam for “several years” and, before introducing the technology, it had “consulted Cumbria’s independent Ethics and Integrity Panel and Strategic Independent Advisory Group”.\n\nA request for a copy of those findings went unanswered.\n\nCorsight\n\nAs previously reported by Al Jazeera, the Israeli company Corsight, through a subcontract with UK company Digital Barriers, has also been selected by the UK Home Office to play a key role in its expansion of facial recognition vans.\n\nIn March 2024, long before the UK government chose to include Corsight within its rollout of facial recognition technology, The New York Times revealed that misgivings over Corsight’s facial-recognition technology in Gaza had led to various members of the Israeli military voicing objections to its use by Unit 8200, Israel’s cyberintelligence branch.\n\nThe expansion of systems such as those marketed by Corsight, Cellebrite and BriefCam is part of a global trade in Israeli spyware, developed and refined through prolonged surveillance of Palestinians, that is now being exported worldwide.\n\nRights groups warned that techniques pioneered in Israel are being used by governments to target activists, journalists and political opponents as concerns deepen over the spread of unregulated cyberwarfare tools.\n\n“The government and police should not be awarding contracts to Israeli spyware firms under any circumstances,” Palestine Solidarity Campaign Deputy Director Ryvka Barnard told Al Jazeera. “These companies develop and test their products through Israel’s regime of military occupation and apartheid against Palestinians. It is unacceptable for public money to be given to these companies, allowing them to profit from and develop new products used to surveil and harm Palestinians.”"

            "content": "The US says it will licence entities to sell the oil to Cuba except those linked to the Cuban government and military.\n\nAfter months of a crippling oil blockade on Cuba imposed by the United States, the fuel-starved country may now see some relief after the US government said it would begin authorising companies to resell Venezuelan oil, even as tensions between the two reach a head.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US Department of the Treasury said it would allow the resale of Venezuelan oil for “commercial and humanitarian use” in Cuba as the small island nation faces one of its worst fuel crises in decades.\n\nVenezuela is the largest provider of oil to Cuba. However, since US forces abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in January and imprisoned him to face drugs and weapons charges in a New York court, the Donald Trump administration has taken control of Caracas’s oil and halted exports to Havana.\n\nWashington has long had frosty relations with Cuba, but Trump’s administration is specifically seeking regime change there by the end of 2026, US media has reported.\n\nThe US’s policy shift this week, however, comes after Caribbean leaders sounded the alarm about the dire situation in Cuba, an island nation of 10.9 million people.\n\nAt a regional meeting of Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries on Wednesday, attended by US Secretary of State and Cuban-American Marco Rubio, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness called on Washington to ease the pressure.\n\n“Today, many Cubans are facing serious economic hardship, energy shortages, and growing humanitarian challenges,” Holness said. Cuba is not a CARICOM member but shares close ties.\n\n\n\n“We are sensitive to their struggles. But we must also recognise that a prolonged crisis in Cuba will not remain there. It can impact migration, security and economic stability across the Caribbean, including Jamaica,” he added.\n\nWhat’s the situation in Cuba now?\n\nCuba’s state-dominated economy was already struggling under a US embargo which has been in place since 1962, dating back to Havana’s alliance with the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n\nSince then, sanctions on Cuba have eased and tightened under various US administrations.\n\nThe long-running sanctions have severely weakened Cuba, causing the country to become highly dependent on imports, and high inflation routinely leads to food and energy shortages. Mass emigration of Cuba’s skilled labour force, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, has added to the country’s difficulties.\n\nWith Trump’s latest oil embargo, the US has added a severe energy crisis to the mix. Widespread power blackouts of up to 20 hours at a time are now being reported across Cuba, impacting hospitals, businesses and households alike.\n\nSurgeries have been suspended, schools have cancelled classes, and waste trucks are parked as rubbish piles up in the streets.\n\nFour United Nations special rapporteurs warned in early February that the situation is contributing to a severe public health problem in the country and said it could lead to a “severe humanitarian” crisis.\n\nCuba has lost 90 percent of its fuel supply, and despite shutting beach resorts and restricting aviation fuel sales, the country could experience a total blackout as early as late February, according to Ignacio Seni, a risk analyst writing for the US-based intelligence firm Crisis 24.\n\nWhy has the US blocked oil deliveries to Cuba?\n\nCuba produces crude oil but does not have the capacity to refine enough to meet domestic demand.\n\nVenezuela was providing as much as 50 percent of Cuba’s oil before the US government took control of its oil industry at the start of this year, about 35,000 barrels per day.\n\nUnder a special barter agreement in place since 2000, Cuba provides support for education, healthcare, and security services in return for discounted Venezuelan fuel. Indeed, about 30 members of Maduro’s security detail who were killed in the operation to abduct him in January were from Cuba.\n\n\n\nThen, days after Maduro was abducted, Trump turned his aim at Cuba itself, warning Havana to “make a deal before it is too late”. He did not, however, give details about what type of deal he wanted.\n\nOn January 29, Trump issued an executive order imposing new trade tariffs on any countries selling oil to Cuba because of what he called the “policies, practices and actions” of the Cuban government, which, he said, pose an “extraordinary threat” to the US.\n\nTrump also claimed, without evidence, that Havana funds “terrorism”.\n\nBesides Venezuela, Cuba was also sourcing oil from Mexico, Russia and Algeria, but all oil imports into the country ceased. Trump’s order, therefore, effectively amounted to a blockade.\n\nThe US has also reportedly seized fuel tankers in open waters transferring oil to Cuba, according to a New York Times investigation into ship movements in the Caribbean Sea published last week.\n\nThe US began building up its naval presence in the area in September last year as it prepared to attack Maduro, and its troops continue to patrol the waters.\n\nIn mid-February, one tanker loaded with Colombian oil was intercepted by the US Coast Guard as it came within 70 miles of Cuba, the Times reported. The vehicle, called the Ocean Mariner, was previously used to covertly transport oil between Venezuela and Iran.\n\nBefore Maduro’s capture, US forces also struck multiple Venezuelan boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean that the US claimed – without evidence – were trafficking drugs.\n\nHow have Cuba and others reacted to the US blockade?\n\nCuban authorities under President Miguel Diaz-Canel have accused the US of imposing collective punishment on the country.\n\nOn Wednesday, it also accused the US of links to armed men who entered the country’s waters on a Florida-tagged speedboat. Four Americans of Cuban origin were killed in the altercation, and two were injured.\n\nIn the past, Havana has said it is open to “reciprocal dialogue” with Washington, but Diaz-Canel has also said Cubans will “defend the Homeland to the last drop of blood”.\n\nMeanwhile, on February 12, a UN expert panel condemned the US’s directive as illegal and said the claim that Havana funds terrorism “lacks credibility and appears designed to justify the use of extraordinary and coercive powers”.\n\n“It is an extreme form of unilateral economic coercion with extraterritorial effects, through which the United States seeks to exert coercion on the sovereign state of Cuba and compel other sovereign third States to alter their lawful commercial relations,” the panel said.\n\nOther countries are trying to help. Mexico has sent two deployments of humanitarian aid to Havana between mid-February and this week, while Russia has floated the possibility of sending fuel to Cuba.\n\nOn Wednesday, Canada pledged food aid with 8 million Canadian dollars ($6.7m).\n\nWhat relief has the US announced now, and will it change anything?\n\nWashington said on Wednesday it would issue companies with special licences to resell Venezuelan oil to Cuba “in solidarity” with the Cuban people.\n\n\n\nThat came after Washington announced $6m in humanitarian aid to Cuba to be distributed by the Catholic Church in early February.\n\nHowever, “persons or entities associated with the Cuban military, intelligence services, or other government institutions” will be barred from obtaining oil sales licences, the US Treasury Department said this week.\n\nTransactions should only support “exports for commercial and humanitarian use”, the statement added.\n\nIt is unclear if the new order will allow Havana to continue buying Venezuelan oil at a heavily subsidised rate as it was previously doing. If it does not, the situation may not ease significantly for Cuba, experts say.\n\n“Without significant oil imports or a relenting of US pressure, Cuba’s economy is unlikely to recover, and the degradation of conditions is likely to accelerate,” Seni, the Crisis 24 risk analyst, wrote."

            "content": "Indian PM throws his weight behind Israel’s Netanyahu even as genocide continues in occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has wrapped up a two-day visit to Israel, which was marked by a welcoming embrace from his counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, and a conspicuous silence about Israel’s genocidal war in occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nDuring the visit, which began on Wednesday, the two leaders lauded their strong friendship, which they said has deepened bilateral ties, and signed agreements on a range of issues, including innovation and agriculture.\n\n“You are a great friend of Israel, … Narendra. You are more than a friend. You are a brother,” Netanyahu told Modi when both leaders addressed the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem on Wednesday.\n\nNetanyahu showed Modi around Yad Vashem, a memorial in Jerusalem to the victims of the Holocaust, and hosted a dinner after they had spoken to the Knesset, where Modi was conferred with the parliament’s highest honour.\n\nThis was the second ever visit by an Indian prime minister to Israel after Modi’s first visit in 2017. That time, he also did not visit Palestine despite India’s long history of supporting the Palestinian cause.\n\nWhile India opposed the creation of Israel in 1948 and formalised diplomatic relations only in 1992, relations between the two countries have improved since then, flourishing particularly since Modi became India’s prime minister in 2014.\n\nSince then, their ties have blossomed, anchored in defence and the shared nationalistic leanings of their leaders.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from Modi’s trip to Israel:\n\nFull support for Israel, silence on Gaza genocide\n\nWednesday was the first time an Indian leader had addressed the Knesset. Modi received a standing ovation after declaring: “India stands with Israel firmly, with full conviction, in this moment and beyond.”\n\n\n\nModi told the Israeli parliament that he carries “the deepest condolences of the people of India for every life lost and for every family whose world was shattered in the barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7” in 2023.\n\n“We feel your pain. We share your grief. India stands with Israel firmly, with full conviction, in this moment and beyond,” he said. “No cause can justify the murder of civilians. Nothing can justify terrorism.”\n\nThe Indian prime minister referred to the Mumbai attacks in 2008, which New Delhi has blamed on neighbouring Pakistan, saying: “Like you, we have a consistent and uncompromising policy of zero tolerance for terrorism with no double standards.”\n\nModi also threw his weight behind United States President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza peace plan, stating that India “supports all efforts that contribute to durable peace and regional stability”.\n\nWhile Modi said he backed “dialogue, peace and stability in the region”, he skipped any mention of the continuing genocide in Gaza, where the Israeli army has killed more than 72,000 Palestinians since October 2023.\n\nAnwar Alam, a senior fellow at the Policy Perspective Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi, said the timing of Modi’s visit is “too poor and has grossly compromised India’s historical pro-Palestine stand”.\n\nAlam argued that while New Delhi, a leader of the anticolonial nonalignment movement, can continue to maintain ties with Tel Aviv, “India cannot allow itself to display such insensitivity to Palestinian sufferings and stand with the coloniser.”\n\nModi emphasises ‘civilisational ties’ with Israel\n\nOne reason Modi, unlike previous Indian leaders, has displayed such warmth towards the Israeli prime minister is the Indian Hindu right’s enthusiasm for the ideology of Zionism, analysts said.\n\nModi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has roots in a philosophy, Hindutva, which ultimately seeks to transform India into a Hindu nation and a natural homeland for Hindus anywhere in the world – similar to Israel’s view of itself as a Jewish homeland.\n\nDuring his speech to the Knesset, therefore, Modi doubled down on what he called the “civilisational ties” between the two nations. He started his address to the Knesset by announcing himself as “a representative of one ancient civilisation addressing another”.\n\n“We are both ancient civilisations, and it is perhaps no surprise that our civilisational traditions also reveal philosophical parallels,” he said, quoting the Israeli “principle of ‘tikkun olam’ about healing the world”.\n\n\n\n“In India, there is great admiration for Israel’s resolve, courage and achievements,” Modi said. “Long before we related to each other as modern states, we were linked by ties that go back more than 2,000 years.”\n\nModi mused about “returning to a land to which I have always felt drawn”. “After all, I was born on the same day that India formally recognised Israel – September 17, 1950.”\n\nWhile India formally recognised Israel in 1950, two years after its formation, it only established diplomatic relations with it in 1992.\n\nDeepening defence ties\n\nThese days, India is Israel’s largest weapons buyer, pumping billions of dollars into Israel’s defence industry each year. In 2024 as Israel waged its war on Gaza, Indian weapons firms sold Israel rockets and explosives, according to an Al Jazeera investigation.\n\nOn Thursday, Modi held talks with Netanyahu focused on further boosting ties in the areas of defence and security along with trade, technology and agriculture.\n\n“We have decided to establish the Critical and Emerging Technologies Partnership. This will give new momentum to cooperation in areas such as AI, quantum, and critical minerals,” Modi said.\n\n\n\nThe two countries are also currently negotiating a free trade agreement.\n\nElevating strategic ties\n\nIndia and Israel are reportedly inching closer to an alliance, along with other global powers, to boost security cooperation.\n\nBefore Modi’s visit, Netanyahu pitched a “hexagon of alliances” that he said would include India, Greece, Cyprus and other unnamed Arab, African and Asian states to collectively stand against what he called “radical” Shia and Sunni Muslim “axes” of adversaries in the region.\n\nModi has not confirmed this plan but did call for cooperation on multilateral projects, including the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and the I2U2, consisting of India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and US.\n\nThe IMEC envisions connecting India with the Middle East and Europe through an integrated rail and shipping corridor. The economic corridor would pass through India, the UAE, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Europe. It was unveiled in September 2023 during a Group of 20 summit in New Delhi.\n\n“IMEC is very ambitious in bringing together these countries in ways that at one point would have been incomprehensible,” said Harsh Pant, vice president of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank. “Today, it has become possible because India’s footprint has grown in the Middle East and in Europe.”\n\nGeopolitical analysts have referred to the I2U2 as “the West Asian Quad” in reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a forum of the US, Japan, Australia and India.\n\nModi also referred to the Abraham Accords, brokered by the US since 2020 for Gulf and North African countries to normalise relations with Israel, and “applauded your courage and vision”.\n\n“Since then, the situation has changed significantly. The path is even more challenging. Yet it is important to sustain that hope,” Modi said.\n\n‘Dehyphenating’ India from Israel-Palestine\n\nPant said, like some Arab nations, India wants to dehyphenate its relations in the region to suit its own strategic interests better. Dehyphenation is a foreign policy under which a country aims to maintain independent relationships with nations that may be in conflict with each other.\n\n\n\n“India’s own relationships have developed to a point where India is no longer hyphenating its relationships in the region,” Pant said.\n\nAnalysts argued New Delhi has bet on Israel for its own strategic interests, even if at Palestine’s expense. From the Indian government’s point of view, “this is the beginning of a new strategic imagination for the region,” Pant told Al Jazeera.\n\nModi remarked in his speech to the Knesset that many Indians have migrated to Israel for work, adding that Indian youth have contributed to the building of modern Israel, including “also on the battlefield”. Thousands of foreign nationals have served in the Israeli military, including nearly 200 soldiers who are dual citizens of India and Israel.\n\nModi, however, did not mention Colonel Waibhav Kale, a former Indian army officer who died in May 2024 when a United Nations vehicle was struck by the Israeli army in Gaza. He was the first international UN worker in Gaza to die in the war.\n\n“India’s stance is clear: Humanity must never become a victim of conflict. A path to peace has been created through the Gaza peace plan. India has fully supported these efforts,” Modi said before departing on Thursday.\n\nHowever, analysts said the divergence from earlier Indian support for Palestine is stark and India will not call out Netanyahu for war crimes in Palestinian territory.\n\nWhile governments before Modi laid the foundations for current bilateral ties, Modi has brought “this relationship out into the open”, Pant said. “What used to be hush-hush behind closed doors is now a matter of fact.”\n\n“India is trying not to make ties with Israel a hostage to the issue of Palestine,” he argued.\n\nAzad Essa, the author of the 2023 book Hostile Homelands: The New Alliance Between India and Israel, said that earlier, India had positioned itself as a friend of Palestine “because it suited its national interests to be seen as pro-Palestine”.\n\nPopular political forces in New Delhi have shifted that stance since then, however. Given the deep defence and security tie-up between Israel and India, Essa said, “It will be very difficult for opposition parties to promise a U-turn because being pro-Israel has become integral to the national interest.”\n\n“To be pro-Palestine is now seen as being against the Indian national interest,” he said. Some have been detained and charged for expressing support for Palestine in India.\n\n“India will have to become far more democratic and break out of the grip of majoritarian politics if it is to change more than just its tone on Palestine,” Essa told Al Jazeera."

            "content": "After the beginning of Trump’s second term, the connections between capitalism, white supremacy and imperial domination became increasingly clear. These have been highlighted through ICE raids as modern-day slave patrols, global criminal operations such as the kidnapping of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, and United States assistance to Israel’s genocide in Gaza as a bipartisan US and transnational corporate experiment.\n\nThe growing understanding that people in the Global South, along with Black, Indigenous and other People of Colour (BIPOC) within the imperial core, face a common enemy has galvanised an anti-colonial, revolutionary movement committed to radical transformation.\n\nAnd then the release of the Epstein files flooded public discourse.\n\nEpstein and the media\n\nJeffrey Epstein was a financier convicted of sex crimes involving minors. After renewed federal charges in 2019, he died in jail (officially ruled a suicide). The case triggered public outrage about ruling class impunity, media focus on unsavoury associations between the political and corporate class and a plethora of conspiratorial narratives about cover-ups.\n\nThe Epstein case became far more than a criminal proceeding; it reflects a symbolic exposure of ruling class impunity and concentrated power and a spectacle of corruption within an empire in deep crisis and decline.\n\nThe Epstein case exposed ruling class criminality while simultaneously displacing structural accountability.\n\nImportantly, “spectacle” does not mean “fake”; it means the organisation of politics through symbolic drama that displaces structural political analysis. With spectacle, social contradictions (inequality, social crises and instability) are dramatised rather than structurally challenged.\n\n\n\nThe enduring media and public fixation on the Epstein files, particularly as their release proceeds with little accountability and continued narratives that discredit and isolate survivors, serves less as accountability and more as a political diversion from systemic injustices: Racism, capitalism, the growth of the police state and ongoing international impunity.\n\nMore troubling still, it marks another step in the erosion of democracy and the consolidation of expansionist, war-driven fascism.\n\nFascist spectacle\n\nIn work by Walter Benjamin, Hannah Arendt, Guy Debord, Umberto Eco and others, fascist spectacle involves anti-intellectual and emotionally driven mass mobilisation around simple moral binaries (pure people v the corrupt ruling class), where action is revered while thought is reviled; the replacement of institutional process with symbolic imagery and drama; and mythic narratives of national decay and rebirth. Political theorist Roger Griffin calls this rebirth “palingenic ultranationalism”, that is, destruction as a precondition for rebirth.\n\nThe function of spectacle is to subvert principled analysis and resistance to oppression with emotion – outrage, disgust, despair and helplessness.\n\nConspiracy theories are the narrative engine of spectacle. They transform systemic crisis and social instability into simple, emotionally gripping stories of social taboo-breaking, centred on hidden and untouchable enemies, laying the groundwork through which authoritarian solutions are marketed as necessary and even redemptive.\n\nWhen structural violence becomes visible, but accountability remains absent, public anger often seeks explanation through personalised and conspiratorial narratives rather than systemic analysis.\n\nAmid growing distrust and corruption in mainstream media and the rise of citizen-driven and alternative social media ecosystems, conspiracy theories surrounding the Epstein case have blossomed: Claims of secret global cabals engaged in immoral sexual criminality, ritualistic fantasies involving human sacrifice, cannibalism and ancient symbolic structures and explicitly racist and anti-Semitic tropes about hidden rulers, among others.\n\nTheories like these, whether wholly true, partially true or false, are not new; fascist movements have historically mobilised around the idea that the nation is being secretly corrupted by a degenerate ruling class, with a radical cleansing necessary to return to a righteous path.\n\nThese narratives do not expose a corrupt system; they obscure and mystify it. By sensationalising corruption into myth and providing explicit, though untouchable, targets for public outrage, they displace rigorous anti-colonial and material analyses of structural exploitation, greed and state violence with collective authoritarian longing for a strongman and the suppression of dissent to restore order.\n\n\n\nThe criminality of Epstein and the powerful figures who orbited him and participated in his abuses have come to symbolise a degenerate ruling class with identifiable names and faces, targets who could be exposed and jailed, thereby clearing the narrative space for a heroic white knight to ride in with promises of salvation.\n\nAs Hannah Arendt warned, conspiracy thinking thrives when trust in institutions collapses. The Epstein scandal intensified the sense of a ruling class operating above the law and of a justice system which protects its own, conditions ideal for authoritarian movements to exploit by insisting the system is irredeemably rigged and that only a strong leader can tear it down.\n\nAs such, the spectacle of the Epstein scandal can absorb and manipulate public outrage, redirecting it away from necessary structural accountability in the form of decolonisation and redistribution of wealth, ultimately reinforcing the very systems it appears to challenge.\n\nIn doing so, it promotes the aesthetics of politics – the spectacle – rather than grounded critiques of capitalism and imperial power. Further, it serves to distract from failures ultimately promoting oppression and war. According to Federico Caprotti, various forms of fascist spectacle produce a “collage” which both expresses and obscures the syncretic ideology of the regime.\n\nThe grand spectacle: War\n\nWhen politics becomes theatre rather than collective progress dependent on accountability, transformation or reform, crisis becomes emotional drama, drama demands release (internal resolution) or escalation and escalation inevitably finds its expression in externalised war, in which the nation performs a grand spectacle of unity and sacrifice on the largest possible stage.\n\nWar acts as a stabilising force when internal contradictions cannot be resolved through collective mobilisation. With its uniforms and marches, war channels discontent by uniting a fragmented, outraged population against an externalised enemy, transforming righteous anger at the violence, oppression and greed of a ruling class into manufactured unity, heroism and meaning through violence against “the other”.\n\nThese dynamics, outlined by Benjamin decades ago, feel alarmingly familiar in the present moment, including in the spectacle surrounding the Epstein scandal.\n\nIn this context, external conflict functions not only as policy but as emotional consolidation, redirecting internal disillusionment towards collective national purpose.\n\nFascist forces deploy such spectacles to distract and mobilise, and are doing so presently; accelerating the dismantling of what remains of US democracy and the post-war international order, to be replaced by a system ruled by force and naked self-interest.\n\nSpectacle politics does not require loyalty to specific leaders but to the emotional narrative they embody, rendering individual figures ultimately expendable.\n\nIn this logic, even Trump could be discarded, sacrificed to clear the way for a “purer” white male strongman (Vance? Pence? Carlson?) who promises to cleanse the ruling class and by extension its foreign so-called “handlers” (enemies like Russia, China and Iran or even allies like Israel and Europe, the latter already being threatened by Trump), of its unsavoury elements, particularly if Trump’s baggage with Epstein proves politically irredeemable.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, liberation and reconciliation and an end to capitalist oppression, with its accompanying genocidal violence and planetary destruction, require a steadfast structural framework aligned with broader leftist, antiracist and anti-colonial principles. Such a framework prioritises systemic transformation over spectacle. Within this view, the Epstein scandal is not treated as the disease itself, but as a symptom of capitalism’s inherent corruption.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."

What potentially justifies paying $129.99 for Razer’s Laptop Sleeve 16” are the pair of wireless charging pads integrated into its cover flap. While you’re out and about, it can protect a laptop up to 16 inches in size, and when you find a remote spot to sit down and work, you can also plonk down and charge your phone and earbuds.\n\nThe padded sleeve has a plush microfiber lining and reinforced edges to help absorb some of the shock of an accidental drop, but it’s thin enough to stick underneath your laptop to protect its underside from scratches. That’s its primary use case as opening the sleeve’s flap positions a Qi2 charging pad next to your computer that can wirelessly power a smartphone at up to 15W rates, and an accessory like wireless earbuds at up to 5W.\n\nThe sleeve adds 410 grams of weight to your laptop, but adds protection from scratches and bumps. Image: Razer\n\nThe sleeve comes with a USB-C cable so you can power the wireless charging pad from your computer, but not all laptops may provide enough power through their USB ports for two devices to wirelessly charge on the pad at full speed."

The new Cricut Explore 5 is 30 percent “more compact” than the Explore 4 that launched a year ago, without reducing the size or types of materials the machine can handle. The new Cricut Joy 2 is an even smaller alternative to the Explore 5 and adds the ability to precisely slice pre-printed materials so you can finally open that Etsy sticker shop.\n\nThe Cricut Explore 5 will be available starting on February 27th for $199 and comes with enough materials to make up to 30 projects. It can also be purchased as part of more expensive bundles that include additional tools and materials. Despite being up to an inch smaller in some dimensions compared to last year’s model, the Explore 5 can still cut over 100 different materials, including cardstock and vinyl, up to 12 inches wide. It’s compatible with six tools, including various cutting blades, and includes an upgraded snap-in pen holder to improve the machine’s writing and drawing capabilities.

            "content": "Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThis is Lowpass by Janko Roettgers, a newsletter on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week.\n\nThese days, if you \n\nWeb data aggregator Bright Data has been pitching streaming service operators on an alternative approach for apps running on Samsung’s Tizen and LG’s webOS platform — one that comes without ads and sky-high fees. All publishers have to do to unlock a new revenue source is integrate the company’s Bright SDK into their TV apps and convince viewers to opt into Bright’s monetization network.\n\n“We don’t do any kind of tracking,” explained Bright Data’s chief product officer, Ariel Shulman, during a webinar for streaming industry insiders two years ago. “We work silently in the background, and completely anonymously. Users don’t actually see or don’t feel anything.”\n\nThe catch? With Bright’s SDK, a viewer’s smart TV becomes part of a massive global proxy network that crawls and scrapes the web. Including apps running on desktop PCs and mobile devices, the company claims to operate 150 million such residential proxies worldwide. Together, these devices gather petabytes of public web data from a wide range of different locations and IP addresses. This approach allows the company to capture localized versions of websites, but also helps to circumvent web crawler blacklists. The gathered data is then resold to companies to train AI models, among other things.\n\nHere’s how Bright’s smart TV partnerships work: When a consumer downloads and installs a participating app, they’ll see an opt-in screen asking them to confirm their willingness to participate in Bright’s proxy network. For instance, for an app called Petflix that was until recently available on the Roku app store, the note reads:\n\n“To enjoy Petflix for free with fewer ads, you are allowing Bright Data to occasionally use your device’s free resources and IP address to download public web data from the internet. Bright Data will only use your IP address for approved business-related use cases. None of your personal information is accessed or collected except your IP address. Period.”\n\n“Our network is based on consensual individual participation,” explains Bright Data spokesperson Jennifer Burns. “All users can opt-out at any time via a fast two-click process.”\n\nOnce a consumer opts in to Bright Data’s network, their smart TV starts downloading publicly available webpages as well as audio and video data, which is then forwarded to Bright’s cloud servers. The company claims to only do so when it doesn’t impact the device’s bandwidth or processing capacities, with Shulman saying that individual devices download only around 50MB of data per day. In reality, there is no way for a user to know whether the SDK downloads web data at any given moment.\n\nIn some cases, your smart TV may even crawl the web for Bright as soon as you turn it on. “On some operating systems, [...] our SDK is given permissions by the user to run in the background,” Shulman explained during his webinar. “This means that our monetization continues even if the app itself is not running.” All it takes for consumers is to run the app once and opt in to Bright’s network, and the device will keep crawling the web every day until they opt out again or uninstall the app.\n\nBright Data is not the only company operating such residential proxy networks. Some of its competitors have come under fire for unsavory business practices. Last month, Google took action against the IPIDEA network, which Google’s Threat Intelligence Group called “the world’s largest proxy network.” IPIDEA worked with a number of SDK providers to distribute its code in third-party apps, including on smart TVs.\n\nOnce devices were enrolled in its network, IPIDEA’s operators allegedly rented out those resources to hacking groups in China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia. “We [...] observe IPIDEA being leveraged by a vast array of espionage, crime, and information operations threat actors,” Google’s Threat Intelligence Group wrote in a January blog post.\n\nTo be clear: Google’s security researchers did not draw any connection whatsoever between IPIDEA and Bright Data, and Bright goes to great lengths to set itself apart from bad actors. “Our SDK, along with all of our technology, is reviewed by Apesteem, Google, McAfee, and more, and audited regularly, most recently by PwC,” says Burns. “Bright SDK implements rigorous partner selection criteria and vets every application through strict compliance processes.”\n\nThe company has nonetheless been impacted by a broader backlash against residential proxy activities. Google has adopted policies against proxy SDKs running in the background, and is now telling developers that they’re only allowed to use proxy services “in apps where that is the primary, user-facing core purpose of the app.” Amazon added a provision to its developer policies that outright bans “apps that facilitate proxy services to third parties.” Roku also bars developers from using Bright SDK and similar proxy services.\n\nAll those changes have made it more difficult to figure out how widespread the use of the SDK on smart TVs actually is. A few dozen Fire TV apps still mention the SDK on Amazon’s app store, but don’t appear to make use of it anymore. I was able to download a few apps from Roku’s store that were still using the SDK, including the aforementioned Petflix app. However, those apps disappeared from the store after I contacted Roku for this story.\n\nNew restrictions against proxy SDKs have had a direct impact on Bright’s addressable market in the smart TV space. The company used to pitch its solution to Roku, Android TV, and Fire TV app developers, but Burns tells me that it no longer supports these platforms. Bright does still list Samsung’s Tizen OS and LG’s webOS as supported smart TV platforms, and has published more than 200 first-party apps to LG’s app store alone. LG spokesperson Léa Lee tells me that Bright SDK is “not officially supported by LG, and their operation on the webOS platform is not guaranteed.” Samsung did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThere are arguably many legitimate use cases for web crawling. “Our network serves exclusively legitimate purposes, supporting journalists, non-profits, academic researchers, cybersecurity companies, and other leading businesses worldwide,” says Burns.\n\nThe problem is that consumers have no idea whether that legitimate purpose is something that aligns with their own personal values. Case in point: Bright Data does support a number of nonprofits, including some that use its proxy network to track hate speech on social media. However, the company also works with AMCHA Initiative. The group maintains an “anti-zionist faculty barometer” and includes student and faculty statements against Israel’s war in Gaza, as well as calls for schools to divest from the country, in its antisemitic incident tracker.\n\nWith AI companies facing scrutiny over their environmental impact, treatment of intellectual property, and potential to replace human labor, some consumers may also feel uneasy about their TVs gathering data to train AI models.\n\nNow, some consumers may decide that such concerns are overblown, and willingly opt in to Bright’s network if it means that they get to watch fewer ads or pay less for their streaming services. I, for one, would rather watch an extra ad break or two."

During an earnings call on Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery streaming head JB Perrette said a global expansion “will start in 2026,” as reported earlier by The Wrap.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery has ramped up its paid sharing initiative in the US over the past year, introducing “more aggressive” prompts in August that push people toward paying an extra $7.99 per month to add another user to their account. Now that HBO Max has launched in several European countries and Latin America, with rollouts planned in the UK, Ireland, and the Asia-Pacific, the streamer likely sees more opportunities to squeeze international subscribers sharing their memberships.\n\n“We are in the second inning of our password sharing enforcement,” Perrette said during the call. “It is just beginning to get scale.” HBO Max added 3.5 million subscribers across the globe during the last quarter of 2025, bringing its total to 131.6 million. Warner Bros. Discovery says it expects to reach 150 million subscribers by the end of this year."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\n160 Democratic lawmakers from across the country are backing a soon-to-be-introduced bill that would reverse the Trump administration’s decision to eliminate IRS Direct File. The Direct File Act, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA), would bring back the option to file taxes directly with the government for free.\n\nThe Biden administration first started testing the IRS Direct File system in select states during the 2024 tax season, and it even expanded the system to 25 states in 2025. But uncertainty surrounding IRS Direct File swirled after President Donald Trump came into office, until IRS head Billy Long confirmed that it’s “gone” last August. The IRS later notified states that Direct File is no longer available.\n\nAccording to Sen. Warren, TurboTax parent company Intuit donated more than $1 million to Trump’s inauguration and has lobbied heavily against the program. (Companies like TurboTax offer similar tax filing services, but for a fee.)\n\nUnder the Direct File Act, taxpayers would not only have the option to file their taxes directly to the IRS, but it would also ensure that the IRS doesn’t enter into agreements that “restrict its ability to provide free online tax preparation or filing services.” The IRS would have to enable “seamless integration” between state tax filing systems and Direct File, as well as publish annual reports on Direct File usage. Additionally, the bill would push the IRS to make Direct File available to at least 50 percent of taxpayers in participating states by the 2028 tax season.\n\nIRS Direct File isn’t to be confused with the agency’s Free File service, which allows taxpayers to file their taxes using one of its partners, such as TaxSlayer and FreeTaxUSA. TurboTax and H&R Block left the Free File Alliance after the IRS began prohibiting services from hiding free filing options.\n\n“Donald Trump canceled Direct File after giant tax prep companies spent millions lobbying to protect their profits,” Sen. Warren says in the press release. “We’re fighting to lower costs for families by bringing Direct File back and making it the law of the land.”"

Nano Banana 2 (also known as Gemini 3.1 Flash Image) is rolling out today across the Gemini app and other Google AI platforms, making knowledge and rendering features that were previously exclusive to Nano Banana Pro available for everyone. Google says the update aims to bring “high-speed intelligence of Gemini Flash to visual generation,” making complex images faster, cheaper, and easier to generate.\n\nLike Nano Banana Pro, the Nano Banana 2 model utilizes real-time information, web search images, and Gemini’s real-world knowledge base. Google DeepMind product manager Naina Raisinghani says that this provides more relevant data for creating infographics or diagrams, and allows Nano Banana 2 to render “specific subjects” more accurately, though examples of such subjects were not provided.\n\nOther features inherited from Nano Banana Pro include the ability to generate images with accurate, legible text, and localized translation. These capabilities previously required a paid subscription to Google AI Plus, Pro, or Ultra to access in Gemini, but now they’ll be expanded to free Gemini users and AI Mode in Google Search.\n\nThis AI “infographic” image example generated with Nano Banana 2 makes me nervous, but hey, at least the text is readable? Image: Google\n\nNano Banana 2 also provides more creative control over generated images compared to the original Nano Banana model. Google says that visual improvements include more vibrant lighting, richer textures, and sharper details, alongside the ability to adhere to complex image requests more strictly. The appearance of up to five characters and 14 objects can also be maintained more consistently in a single workflow, and users get “full control” over aspect ratios and image resolution, ranging from 512px up to 4K.\n\nThe new Nano Banana 2 model will replace the option for Nano Banana Pro across the Gemini app’s Fast, Thinking, and Pro generation modes. Google says AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will still be able to access Nano Banana Pro “for specialized tasks” by selecting the three-dot menu on images to regenerate them. The new model is also rolling out to AI Mode in Search, Google Lens, the Google app, and browsers for mobile and desktop, alongside being the new default image generation model in Google’s AI video tool, Flow."

It will be rolling out soon “across Europe,” starting with results for lodgings, with “flights and other services” following later.\n\nThis update could address one of the core issues the European Commission highlighted when it ruled last year that Google was in violation of the Digital Markets Act, which aims to rein in anticompetitive practices by leading tech companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft. Companies that fail to comply with DMA regulations can face fines of up to 10 percent of their annual revenue.\n\nGoogle initially pushed back against demands for it to rearrange search results, with Google’s head of competition, Oliver Bethell, claiming in a post on LinkedIn last year that early changes to search results forced European users to search longer and pay higher prices. However, Google could potentially face billions of dollars in fines if it doesn’t make adjustments to comply with the DMA."

            "content": "Meeting notetaker Read AI on Thursday launched an AI-powered email-based assistant called Ada, saying it helps users manage their schedules, answer questions based on a company’s knowledge base, and reply to out-of-office emails.\n\nThe company is calling Ada a “digital twin” that handles tasks for you around the clock. Read AI said that the assistant will be available to all users, and they can start configuring it by sending an email to “ada@read.ai” and writing “Get me started.”\n\nWhen you ask Ada to find a time to meet with someone, it replies to the other person in the thread with your availability. If the other person replies that they are unavailable at those times and would like a different time slot, Ada responds with new options. While Ada has access to your calendar through Read AI, it does not reveal the nature of those meetings with other people.\n\nAda can also answer questions using a company’s knowledge base, topics discussed in your prior meetings, and public internet searches. For instance, you can ask, “Ada, can you provide an update on how we are tracking for Q1 goals?” to get information.\n\nIf someone else asks a question in a thread, Ada will prepare a response for you and help you refine it before it is sent to the other person. The startup said that Ada doesn’t reveal any sensitive information without your permission.\n\nRead AI’s VP of Product, Justin Farris, said that the new feature doesn’t rely on MCPs (model context protocols, a technical standard for connecting AI tools to external services), and instead builds a knowledge graph based on meeting data and connected services for more contextual answers. He added that over time, the assistant will also take proactive actions for you. For instance, if you mentioned a follow-up item in a meeting, Ada will ask you to set that up after the meeting with contextual data.\n\n“The way I describe our solution is that when you are bringing on a new employee, you train them. When you add Ada to your workflow and connect more services to give more context, it starts to ramp up and handle more tasks for you,” CEO David Shim told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

He mentioned that the company sees 50,000 sign-ups every day and has a broader base of 100,000 users who consume Read AI’s content, like meeting summaries, without creating an account.\n\nFor Read AI, the U.S. remains the largest market with strong international growth. While 60% of users are outside the U.S., the revenue is split roughly equally.\n\nThe company, which has raised over $81 million in funding, is increasingly adding AI-powered tools to its suite. Last year, it launched Search Copilot for knowledge discovery for users, and last month it added the ability to update customer-service relationship software, send custom emails from within a meeting report, and stay up to date on topics based on internal and web knowledge.\n\nOther meeting notetakers are also offering new tools to extract more insights and actions from meeting notes. Last September, Granola added “recipes” in the form of repeatable prompts to surface knowledge from meeting data. Quill, which came out of stealth with a $6.5 million funding round this week, also connects to various tools like Linear, Notion, and CRMs, and aims to automate tasks."

            "content": "Bumble announced on Thursday that it’s adding a series of AI-driven features intended to help turn matches into lasting connections, including those that offer feedback and guidance on users’ bios, photos, and prompts.\n\nThe dating app’s new AI-suggested profile guidance tool will roll out globally and give “personalized, actionable feedback” on users’ bios and prompts. For users in the U.S., the profile guidance feature can be augmented with an AI photo feedback tool, which can “help you choose the best photos and show up as your most authentic self.”\n\nAccording to Bumble’s blog post explaining these features, it doesn’t seem like the insights from these AI tools are particularly groundbreaking — for example, Bumble says that its AI photo tool might encourage you to ditch photos where you’re wearing sunglasses that cover your face, and add a wider variety of photos, like ones taken outdoors or with friends. It’s advice you could’ve easily gotten from a friend 10 years ago, but it’s still new information to many users.\n\nIn Canada, Bumble is testing another, non-AI feature called “Suggest a Date.” When a conversation stalls, a user can signal that they are open to meeting in person, which the company says is “a simple way to signal that they’re ready to connect offline.”\n\nOf course, another way for people to “signal that they’re ready to connect offline” is to literally ask someone on a date. But realistically, it doesn’t seem like users are taking the plunge, so having an in-app way to indicate interest may motivate some potential couples to move their conversation IRL.\n\n“With Suggest a Date, we’re creating a clear expression of intent and giving members a way to bypass the traditional back-and-forth and move toward meeting in real life,” Bumble CTO Vivek Sagi said in a statement. “When we reduce friction at the moments that matter most, we help people connect with clarity and confidence, and increase the likelihood of meaningful relationships forming offline.”\n\nBumble and other popular dating apps, like Match Group’s Tinder and Hinge, have all embraced AI-powered features in recent months. For instance, in December, Hinge introduced a tool to help generate more interesting conversation starters than “How are you?”\n\nTinder may take things a step further. In Australia, Tinder is piloting a tool called Chemistry, which asks users to provide the app with access to their camera roll, which is a concerning amount of data to feed into an AI tool. Based on a user’s camera roll and answers to a series of questions, the AI can learn more about someone’s interests and personality to supposedly reduce “swipe fatigue” and suggest better matches.\n\nMeta’s Facebook Dating tool does something similar — in October, it launched a feature that asks to use its AI on photos in your camera roll that you haven’t yet shared in order to suggest AI edits.\n\nAs these companies try to come up with new ways to keep users happy, some young people have thrown in the towel on online dating altogether, instead seeking more real-world experiences that are not intermediated by an app."

            "content": "Walmart has agreed to pay $100 million to settle a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over deceptive pay practices within its Spark Driver service, which uses gig workers to deliver online orders from local stores to customers. The retailer was accused of misleading drivers about their potential base pay and tip amounts, and then deceived customers by saying that 100% of tips went to the drivers, when they did not.\n\nIn its original complaint, the FTC was joined by Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin. The lawsuit alleged that Walmart, since 2021, had made false representations about Spark Driver earnings.\n\nAmong these, Walmart was accused of frequently splitting a customer’s order between drivers, which would lead to splitting the tip. Meanwhile, customers were told their driver — as in one single driver — would get the full tip. In batch orders, Walmart would remove tips from some of the orders without informing the driver. Walmart also promised tips to drivers in advance of taking orders, but then failed to collect a tip from the customer, leaving the driver without a tip entirely.\n\nOther issues had to do with reductions Walmart made to drivers’ base pay after they had accepted an offer or other misrepresented incentives that could have provided drivers with extra cash.\n\nWalmart also told customers that drivers would get 100% of their tips, but that wasn’t always true.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that these practices caused drivers to lose millions of dollars they were promised and generated thousands of consumer complaints.\n\nAs a result of the settlement, Walmart will have to implement an earnings verification program to ensure drivers are paid the promised earnings and tips. It’s also prohibited from adjusting the base pay, incentives, or tips after the initial offer, except if the driver fails to provide the service or a customer cancels. Walmart has been banned from misrepresenting earnings in future driver offers as well.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "Einride has secured an oversubscribed $113 million PIPE (private investment in public equity) ahead of its public debut, which is expected for the first half of 2026.\n\nThe Swedish startup is most well-known for building both electric trucks and autonomous pods that are designed to carry freight with no room for a human driver. Einride announced its plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, Legato Merger Corp., last November.\n\nThe deal values Einride at a pre-money valuation of $1.35 billion — down from the $1.8 billion figure initially attached to the SPAC deal. Despite a drop in valuation, there’s still clearly investor appetite for the firm. The PIPE exceeded the company’s earlier target of up to $100 million.\n\nEinride’s PIPE comes from new and existing investors, including a global asset management company based on the West Coast of the United States and Stockholm-based EQT Ventures.\n\nIn total, Einride has secured around $213 million tied to this transaction, including $100 million previously announced crossover financing.\n\nThe SPAC, which will see Einride trading on the New York Stock Exchange, had been expected to deliver roughly $220 million from Legato’s trust account. With the addition of the $113 million PIPE, the companies now project total gross proceeds of about $333 million before redemptions and expenses, though they say they may seek additional capital before closing.\n\nThe proceeds will support Einride’s technology roadmap, global expansion, and autonomous deployments in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\nOutside of Sweden, Einride operates a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE for companies like Heineken, PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has also done limited deployments of its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers, including Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the U.S.\n\nEinride is not the first autonomous vehicle company to have pursued a SPAC merger in recent years for additional funding. Aurora Innovation went public via a SPAC merger valued at $13 billion in 2021 and has since launched a commercial self-driving trucks operation (with a human observer on board). Kodiak AI also took the SPAC road to the public market in 2025."

Some of the affected organizations are said to be critical infrastructure. The company did not provide specifics, but “critical infrastructure” can refer to everything from power grids and water supply to the transportation sector.\n\nSeveral governments, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, warned in an alert that threat actors are targeting organizations “globally.”\n\nU.S. cybersecurity agency CISA ordered all civilian federal agencies to patch their systems by end-of-day Friday, citing an imminent threat and unacceptable risk to the federal government. The federal cybersecurity agency, which is currently running at reduced capacity due to a partial government shutdown, said it was aware of ongoing exploitation.\n\nNeither Cisco nor the governments attributed the attacks to a specific threat group or nation state, if known, but tracked one cluster of activity as UAT-8616.\n\nIn December, Cisco warned of a similarly rated 10.0 vulnerability in the Async software that runs most of its products, which was being actively used to hack into its customer networks."

            "content": "A group of notable open source programmers are joining with a VC investor to launch a nonprofit called the Open Source Endowment in hopes of permanently solving the perennial issue with developing open source software: funding.\n\nBackers of the Open Source Endowment include Thomas Dohmke (the former GitHub CEO who raised a record $60 million for his dev tool startup Entire); Mitchell Hashimoto (founder of HashiCorp, which sold to IBM for $6.4 billion last year); Supabase founder and CEO Paul Copplestone; an NGINX co-founder; the creators of Vue.js and cURL; plus execs from Elastic, Spotify, and others. All told, the project has over 50 donors so far.\n\nThe nonprofit, which just achieved formal 501(c)(3) status, has currently raised more than $750,000 in commitments. But if things go according to the plan of its founder, Konstantin Vinogradov, it will have $100 million in assets within seven years.\n\nVinogradov is a venture investor specializing in open source, AI, and infrastructure software, and was previously a general partner at Runa Capital. As such, he has “some experience with university endowments,” which are some of the largest investors in venture capital funds, he told TechCrunch.\n\nVinogradov says as he scoured the world for open source projects, one complaint kept popping up: “There is no source of sustainable funding for open source maintainers. And that’s a really big problem.” (“Maintainer” refers to the developers who work on open source projects, such as debugging, choosing and verifying features submitted by the community, or programming new features themselves.)\n\nThe endowment will support projects based on criteria such as its number of users, or how many other projects rely on that specific software to operate. It will also choose projects that are not already well-supported by grants, donations, or umbrella organizations such as Linux’s Alpha-Omega. Vinogradov has already assembled a board for the nonprofit.\n\nCash strapped, burned out\n\nThe lack of money in open source is hardly new. Open source software is typically given away, and since the community often contributes time and efforts freely, up to 86% of open source developers are not paid for their work.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nThis isn’t much of a problem for hobbyists or for professional developers paid by their companies to maintain projects, but such a system stands on shaky ground. Open source software is the bedrock upon which the internet stands, and virtually every large company uses open source tools in some way. In fact, open source software accounts for up to 55% of the tech stack in organizations, and is present in everything from databases to operating systems.\n\nWhile it is certainly possible for open source developers to commercialize their free projects to gain wealth beyond their wildest dreams, the odds, to misquote the Hunger Games, are not in their favor.\n\nThere is, and has been for decades, a core of developers who volunteer their time and efforts for free to manage popular, important, and critical projects. And many of them are burned out.\n\nThis issue came into the public’s consciousness briefly in 2014, with the OpenSSL Heartbleed disaster, where a bug was found in an open source security project, used by most of the internet, that was maintained by a single developer.\n\nThere have been many attempts to fix the funding situation over the years. Some projects take donations from corporate sponsors. For instance, The Linux Foundation, which brought in about $300 million last year largely from corporate sponsors, doles out grants to select projects through its Alpha-Omega Project. In 2025, Alpha-Omega issued $5.8 million to 14 projects, it said.\n\nSome projects take donations directly from corporate donors. In January, for instance, Anthropic donated $1.5 million to the Python Software Foundation. While the Foundation said it was thrilled to have that cash, Anthropic itself raised $30 billion this month. Such a donation is couch-change to the AI lab.\n\nStill, not every developer wants to take corporate donations, as there are worries of granting too much influence to donor companies. For instance, there was a big hubbub last year in the Ruby community surrounding some long-time maintainers leaving and its big sponsor Spotify, The Register reported.\n\nThe Open Source Endowment hopes to support projects while displacing such risks.\n\n“The only way to support open source sustainably is private funds,” says Vinogradov.\n\nWhy hasn’t an endowment been tried before? Endowments require patience, Vinogradov says. They invest many of their assets, spending only a fraction of their income in any given year, and require years or even decades to grow to a meaningful size.\n\nBut if done right, that patience will result in an independent fund that could support critical open source projects forever."

            "content": "OpenAI has announced plans to turn its London office into its largest research hub outside of the United States.\n\nThe company—which established a UK office in 2023—says it will expand its London-based research team, scooping up talent emerging from leading British universities. It has not indicated how many researchers it will hire.\n\n“The UK brings together world-class talent and leading scientific institutions and universities, making it an ideal place to deliver the important research which will ensure our AI is safe, useful, and benefits everyone,” said Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI, in a statement.\n\nThe plans bring OpenAI into direct competition for top research talent with Google DeepMind, the AI lab run by British researcher Demis Hassabis, which is headquartered in London. DeepMind has long-running partnerships with Oxford University and the University of Cambridge, where it sponsors professorships, funds research, and works alongside researchers.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former AI researcher who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Joel_Khalili.28.\n\nAt the latest careers fair at Oxford University, the floor was packed with undergraduates looking for technical roles and recruiters hiring for AI-related positions. “The demand and supply is increasing on both sides, even within a year,” says Jonathan Black, director of the careers service at Oxford University. “To have something like this turn up is a really positive sign.”\n\nOpenAI’s expansion in London could have a sort-of flywheel effect, whereby the researchers it hires early in their careers go on to start new labs in the UK, says Tom Wilson, partner at venture capital firm Seedcamp. “We’ve seen many examples over the years,” he says. “That’s where these kinds of announcements can have even more impact than the initial hires … the second-order effects can be great.”\n\nOpenAI’s team in London will continue to contribute to products like Codex and GPT-5.2, the company says, but will now “own” certain aspects of model development relating to safety, reliability, and performance evaluation.\n\nIn a statement, the UK’s science and technology secretary, Liz Kendall, described the announcement as “a huge vote of confidence in the UK’s world-leading position at the cutting edge of AI research.”\n\nThe announcement coincides with a push in the UK to scale the nation’s data center and power infrastructure to meet the voracious demand for compute among AI companies, including OpenAI."

            "content": "Honorable Mentions\n\nDuring the winter, a whole WIRED crew tests ski clothes almost constantly. Here are a few other items that we like.\n\nCourtesy of REI\n\nHestra Fall Line 3-Finger Gloves for $190: I've long admired Hestra gloves from across the lift line, impressed by the Swedish company's elegant stitchwork and thoughtful design touches. This was the year I finally got to try a pair for myself, and the Fall Line are exactly what they look like. There are six sizes available so you can get the perfect fit in this glove. The cowhide is buttery smooth and has already broken in a bit with five days' use. The wrist strap means you never have to fret about dropping your glove from the lift when checking your phone, and they're very warm without making me sweat. If you do sweat, the lining is removable so you can wash it without damaging the leather. —Martin Cizmar\n\nCourtesy of Crab Grab\n\nCrab Grab Snuggler Mitts for $89: These mini sleeping bags for your fingers are packed full of Primaloft insulation and benefitting from a sherpa fleece lining, they are toasty warm, and with a 15K membrane, impressively waterproof too. All-season mittens with durable construction for under $100? Yes Please!\n\nCourtesy of Mons Royale\n\nMons Royale Yotei Merino Classic Long Sleeve for $98: As I type this, I’m nowhere near a mountain, but I’m still wearing the Mons Royale Yotei long sleeve top. It is ridiculously comfortable, made from 190-gsm-weight, 100 percent merino wool, and has a mercifully relaxed cut, so I remain warm, but don’t feel like a sausage. On the mountain however, the merino wool works its magic, wicking away sweat—especially on a hike up to some fresh powder—and keeping me comfortable. Paired with a shell and the Patagonia R1 Thermal Hoodie, I’m warm enough during a bitter arctic blast.\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket and Bib Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket for $498 and Bib for $398: Seniq is another all-women’s outdoor brand that launched in 2024. It's styled a little more Gen Z, leaning into fun color blocking over the monochromatic look. The Seniq Powder Puff Down Jacket has a dry-touch finish. It’s meant for drier days on the mountain, but a PFC-free DWR coating and YKK AquaGuard zippers do provide water resistance. The asymmetric front zipper helps you avoid chin rub when you have the jacket fully zipped. It also features cool asymmetrical quilting lines, side pockets-in-pockets that provide access to your bib (their bibs have a pocket on the front, so you can get in there without unzipping your jacket), an oversized removable hood, a forearm pass pocket, soft and stretchy wrist gaiters, and a large internal pocket that can absolutely handle a sandwich. This jacket was warm, pillowy, and comforting, like a super-soft hug.\n\nThe silky shell bibs are slightly barrel cut, which gives them a flattering shape without being fitted. The adjustable racer back-style straps and low back (with a stretchy waist) also provide a nice shape and breathability. There are two pockets on the front chest, pockets on either leg, two-way zip thigh vents, and a butt zipper for bathroom breaks. These fit easily over my boots, and the instep guards were a nice touch. With a durable three-layer membrane and a 20,000-mm waterproof rating, these will hold up against any and all weather the mountain throws at you. When I wore them on a wet snowy day, they beaded and sloughed off moisture well. —Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket for $259: This puffy hoodie is a great mid-layer for under a shell jacket. The insulation is made from recycled rope scraps, and the outer is coated in wind-resistant PFC-free DWR coating. The hem falls at the hips, and the high collar and tight hood keep most of the face covered. I like wearing this piece under shells for snowboarding, but I know it’ll pull double duty as a comfy hiking and camping jacket, too, so it’s a solid multipurpose investment. It’s exceptionally lightweight and warm, though from a volume standpoint, it is on the bulkier side for a mid-layer and isn’t the most packable piece. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Evolved Air Half Zip for $112: This fleece pullover has a waffle-like texture that traps heat and wicks moisture. With a high zippered collar and cinchable hem, you can adjust the fit to make it more air-tight or breathable. This mid-layer felt wonderfully lightweight while still keeping my toasty. It’s not bulky at all, only a little thicker than a base layer, laid comfortably under my jackets, and moved with me on the mountain. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Lifa Base Layer Long-Sleeve Crew for $115 and Pants for $115: These base layers hit the weight sweet spot; they’re not too thick or thin, but just right. They’re slightly looser than other options on this list, so if you prefer something that isn’t so fitted, these are a great pick (but note that they run long too). These combine merino wool with Helly Hansen’s LIFA fibers, which add more moisture-wicking capabilities. They’re soft, lightweight, warm, and don’t hold onto smells. I love the cute designs and how well they regulate my temperature under insulated jackets and pants. The waist digs in a bit but doesn’t roll, and they stay in place and move well. —Kristin Canning\n\nHow to Layer AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We have a full guide on how to layer, but here are your essentials. Base layer: A good set of thermals is essential in the fight against cold, especially when you’re working hard. The best fabrics wick away sweat as you heat up, which helps regulate your temperature. Merino wool is the best at this, but also the most expensive. Synthetic fabrics are getting better, though, and please avoid cotton at all costs, as it gets wet and stays that way, making you cold and uncomfortable. Mid layer: Whether you choose a hooded fleece or puffer-style jacket, this layer does the bulk of the work in cold conditions. Combined with the base layer, it traps warm air in, while also allowing moisture to be expelled. Synthetic insulation such as Primaloft Gold is brilliant and doesn’t lose its properties if it gets wet. Down jackets offer the best warmth-to-weight ratio, but they don’t pack down as small, and should never get wet. A fleece with an insulated vest is a great option if you really feel the cold. Jacket: While ski jackets with insulation offer bonus warmth in Arctic-like conditions, for most people a waterproof shell will be enough, as it offers protection from both the snow and the wind. A cold wind will chill you to your bones faster than a bit of wet snow. Ideally choose a jacket with a waterproof membrane such as Gore-Tex (make sure it is free from PFAS, or forever chemicals), but also check for taped seams for added waterproofing, plus plenty of pockets for snacks and lift passes, and wrist cuffs and ski skirts to help keep out the snow. Socks: As with your base layer, socks keep you warm and maintain your temperature when you’re building up a sweat. Natural fabrics work well, but a blend of merino wool with synthetic stretchy fibers is the way to go, as they stay up better and can be used for more than a day. Avoid cotton again, and never wear two pairs, as you’ll almost certainly get colder feet. Gloves: You’ll be surprised by how wet ski gloves get when it’s snowing, even if you don’t fall very often. As a result, waterproof options work best in most cases, although well-made leather designs can be almost as waterproof as a pair with Gore-Tex. Mittens are generally warmer than gloves, but what you gain in toasty fingers you lose in dexterity. Check out our Best Ski Gloves and Mittens guide for more information. Waterproofing and breathability ratings: Waterproofing is measured with a hydrostatic head rating, or HH. That means if you put a 1-inch, endlessly long square tube on top of the fabric, you could pour 20,000 millimeters of water before it would seep through. Breathability is rated in how many grams of vapor per square meter can can pass through the fabric in 24 hours. How We Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I've been reviewing winter sports gear for more than 15 years. In that time, I have worn an untold number of jackets, pants, mid-layers, thermals, gloves, and mittens. I called on industry experts and professional skiers, and solicited opinions from fellow winter sport enthusiasts on the WIRED team. While a basic fit check can be done in the office, nothing replaces on-mountain testing in variable conditions. We put in the time on various trips to the French Alps, as well as in resorts in Vermont, Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "The first time Alesandra Madison’s husband incorporated AI into their relationship was in late 2024.\n\nShe’d forgotten to do her “nightly kneeling ritual,” and he asked ChatGPT how to properly discipline her. The large language model suggested “a two-in-one punishment,” she says—write 100 lines of “I will remember to kneel for my Dom every night” while kneeling the entire time.\n\nThough the couple started exploring kink in their marriage 15 years ago—they are in a dominant-submissive relationship—the AI-generated punishment was new territory for them.\n\nSince then, Madison, who is 44 and lives in Los Angeles, says she has come to think of AI as “a powerful enhancement tool” for kink. “A lot of the times in dom-sub dynamics, when the submissive misbehaves—if it’s consented to—you will have a punishment. You want something specific to fit the crime, basically. It’s like a fresh set of eyes on your relationship.”\n\nAI represents a unique evolution in how power is distributed for people into bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism—BDSM. The lifestyle structure, as everyone WIRED spoke to for this story noted, is grounded in the core tenets of consent, safety, communication, and trust. But for those dealing with trust issues, or who simply want a nonjudgmental space to ask questions about BDSM, AI is becoming an increasingly appealing option.\n\n“I’ve gotten value out of AI helping me understand myself better as a submissive. I sometimes ask it questions or describe something that feels confusing to me and ask it to help me understand,” one user posted in the r/SubSanctuary subreddit, where discussions involve topics like impact play, the feeling of “being owned,” and how to move on when the relationship has reached its end. Madison says there are different reasons why AI doms appeal to certain subs. They are always available, easily customizable—“You can make them playful or sadistic,” she noted in a video—and there is low risk to exploring for newbies.\n\nBut not everyone is on board. In the same subreddit, AI doms were blasted for being “hollow entertainment,” “dangerous,” and “dystopian.” “It can feel like a checklist,” says San Francisco–based sex educator Amp Somers, who is 36 and switches between dom and sub roles, of the demands an AI dom gives out.\n\nAs debates swirl and intensify, the marketplace has gone boom. Joi AI is one of the many services—along with Character.AI, Replika, and Soulmaite—that let users create and customize chatbots for BDSM role-play. According to the company, which bills itself as an “AI-lationships” platform, and an antidote to dating apps, its “user base has grown five times in 2025 compared to 2024.” Several sex workers, including Alix Lynx and Jenna Starr, have licensed their likeness to Joi (the company declined to share exact user numbers). Developers are also sprinting to create applications for role-play chatbots that are “not just erotic content spam, but something focused on immersive, intelligent conversation with a dominant persona.” Even Oxy shop, an online BDSM gear retailer for sub men who like to wear chastity cages, has started to offer an AI-driven “BDSM chat” for members, which allows them to indulge in all sorts of dominatrix fantasies; “Surrender to Mandy” or “Submit to Mike,” the page advertises.\n\nWatching porn can be a passive experience, but “an AI chatbot allows people a forum to talk about, express, and articulate their sexual fantasies,” says Carolina Bandinelli, an associate professor at the University of Warwick whose research focuses on the digital culture of love. “The idea that you can program your domination exactly the way you want. That is one of the fantasies underpinning the relationship between humans and AI—the fact that we can shape and model our partner.”"

            "content": "You might think you’ve got enough headphones. Most of us have accrued at least two or three pairs over the years, and might have a few more half-working pairs stuck in a drawer somewhere. But I’m here to tell you, if you haven’t fully explored the fabulous world of specialized headphones that has exploded in the past decade, from open earbuds to sports and travel cans, you’re not maximizing your sonic potential. The best headphones are now so varied that they often depend entirely on what you intend to use them for. That means the best headphones for you probably come in many shapes and sizes, and you might actually want more than one pair.\n\nBalling out on lots of headphones for every one of life's situations doesn’t necessarily mean spending a lot of money. Unless you’re successfully riding the “boomcession,” there’s a fair chance spare cash is tight right now. Luckily, there’s a veritable explosion of impressive budget brands making great stuff, alongside household brands pitching to the cheap seats.\n\nAs an audio reviewer for well over a decade, I’ve tried hundreds of models across every color in the headphone rainbow. Here’s how to shop right so you can get the most out of any and all of them, as well as the best headphones I can think of in every category right now.\n\nNoise-Canceling Earbuds: The 2026 Baseline\n\nLet's start with the modern one-and-done choice: Noise-canceling earbuds are the ultimate jack-of-all-trades. If you only want to own one pair, this is it. The best noise-canceling earbuds sound great, fit neatly in your pocket, and are equally adept at letting in or blocking out environmental sounds to adapt to any situation.\n\nIt’s probably no surprise that the wildly popular AirPods Pro are the best headphones for iPhone owners, thanks to impressive performance, loads of features, and seamless integration with all things Apple. They’re a massive step up from the standard AirPods, which offer similar Apple-friendly features and a touch of noise canceling, but don’t perform nearly as well as even most budget earbuds.\n\nBose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor more phone-agnostic options, Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 are the ultimate noise killers, while Sony’s new WF-1000XM6 offer great sound and utterly natural transparency mode. Technics' EAH AZ100 are among my favorites for sound quality.\n\nIf those are too pricey, fear not! Budget earbud options are varied and plentiful, from Android-optimized midrangers like the Google Pixel Buds 2a to the stylish Nothing Ear (a) or highly affordable Soundcore Space A40. If you’re keeping to one pair, I’d put in all your chips for better performance, but there’s no shortage of great affordable options, and new pairs at all prices keep rolling in.\n\nNoise-Canceling Over-Ears: Comfort Meets Performance\n\nAnyone who’s taken a long flight can probably relate to the fact that sticking something in your ears for five hours-plus isn’t an exercise in comfort. Enter travel headphones like the best noise-canceling over-ears, which have adapted from early models like Bose’s stalwart QC 25 to become among the most advanced and downright luxurious audio products for your money. They’re great for other tasks too, from working in a busy office to commuting or simply chilling at home in tranquil reverie.\n\nAirPods Max Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nThe latest and greatest, like Sony’s WH-1000XM6 and Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra, apply uncompromising noise cancellation, plush comfort for long listening, and a pile of advanced features like pausing when you speak or automatic sleeping and waking. The Ultra are my favorite for sheer comfort, but there are plenty of rivals like Sonos’ equally comfy Ace, the iconic (and heavy) AirPods Max, or the utterly immersive B&W Px7 S3. Cheaper options abound, but some of my favorites include Sony’s high-punching WH-CH720, the crazy-affordable Soundcore Life Q30, or its newer cousin, the Space One. These won’t bring the same level of performance or tranquility, but they still work great for long flights and beyond.\n\nOpen Earbuds: For Keeping Alert\n\nHere’s where things get really fun: Open earbuds have exploded faster than any other audio segment in recent memory, with a kaleidoscope of options from virtually every audio brand. Designed to keep your ears open while delivering satisfying sound, the best open earbuds aren’t ideal for everything you do, but they're fantastic for specialized activities like ebike riding, where wind resistance renders artificial transparency modes useless. Over time, I've found tons of other cool use cases, from walking the dog to sneaking in some Olympics at the bar.\n\nOpen Earbuds come in various design types, from wacky bone-conductors to wraparound models and—my personal favorite—clip-ons. Their light and ergonomic housings aim to essentially disappear on your ears for all-day listening, and it works better than you might think.\n\nYou could spend a lot on pairs like Bose’s excellent Open Ultra, but you really don’t have to, since even the best models are limited in performance. Soundcore’s Aeroclip are my favorite value-to-performance pair, but plenty of cheaper options get the job done, like Acefast’s nearly free Acefit Air or Soundpeat’s Pearclip Pro. Open earbuds are easily my favorite new audio trend.\n\nWorkout Headphones: Keep Moving\n\nThere’s an obvious Venn diagram overlap between open earbuds and workout headphones, but if you don’t like the idea of keeping your ears open, traditional sports models are a great alternative. My favorite is the revamped Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, which offer tons of features in a wraparound design that’s nearly unshakeable. I like that they’re optimized for Apple devices, but still work well for Android, and they come with great noise canceling and transparency mode, but also a high price.\n\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nLike open earbuds, there are plenty of cheap options, including the similarly unshakeable (but much more basic) Jlab Go Air Sport, which run a mere $30 or less on sale. If you’re not into the minimalist thing, WIRED editor Adrienne So swears by the BlueAnt Pump X over-ear headphones for weightlifting, in large part due to their cooling-gel earpads that go in the fridge overnight to keep sweat at bay. They’ve also got noise canceling and plenty of battery life at over 50 hours per charge. For jogging or cycling, open earbuds are likely a better fit, while some folks simply use the AirPods Pro, but it can be nice to just have a dedicated pair in your gym bag.\n\nWired Headphones: Plug It In\n\nCourtesy of Shure Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Shure SE-112GR $69 Amazon $69 Adorama\n\nThe youth delight in resurrecting old tech that the more seasoned among us have long left for dead (cassette tapes?!). In the case of wired headphones, there’s good reason to plug in, starting with improved performance for your dollars. If you’re a content creator, musician, or simply a cash-savvy sound connoisseur, you can get an impressive return from wired options that avoid the sound degradation of many wireless options.\n\nSome of our favorite affordable options include affordable and classic-looking earbuds like Shure’s iconic SE-112 and Sennheiser’s impressive IE200, and studio-friendly over-ears like Audio-Technica’s ATH-M20x, If you’re willing to spend a bit more, the fantastic Sennheiser HD6XX offer the best sound for the money I’ve heard in any headphone segment. Based on the much pricier HD 650, these are open-back headphones that let in exterior sounds, but the performance is incredible. If you want even better sound and design, there are tons of options, but they’ll cost you.\n\nFancy Headphones: The Audiophile Angle\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nCourtesy of Grado Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Grado Signature S750 $1,675 Grado\n\nIf you really want to optimize the wired connection, there’s a whole segment of audiophile headphones made with high-quality materials, innovative speaker technologies, elevated designs, and accordingly elevated pricing. There are a whole bunch of varieties, but for the sake of levity I’ll break them down into two categories: in-ear monitors (IEMs), the fancy version of in-ear headphones, and over-ears.\n\nIEMs generally use dynamic drivers, the traditional driver type in most headphones and speakers, balanced armatures, much smaller and more accurate speakers, or a mix of both. My favorite pairs come from Ultimate Ears, like the UE 18+ Pro, which are customized for your ears using 3D printing and other techniques. (You’ve likely seen these on TV for musicians and broadcasters.) Other IEMs we like include Sennheiser’s IE 900 and models from Campfire Audio.\n\nMeze Poet Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor over-ear headphones, Audeze’s planar magnetic headphones are among my favorites, starting as low as $500 (yeah, I know) in the excellent LCD-S20 closed-back headphones. Another incredible pair I recently tested are Meze’s Poet, which are not only the most gorgeous-looking pair I’ve reviewed, but also offer among the clearest and most articulate sound I’ve laid ears on. There are dozens more to try, as audiophilia is its own journey, but this is a good starting point. We recently reviewed the Grado Signature S750, which have an effortlessly expansive sound that feels like it can't possibly be coming from mere centimeters away from your eardrums.\n\nOther Headphone Types and Upcoming Features\n\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\n\nCourtesy of Best Buy Save to wishlist Save to wishlist SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3P Wireless $110 Amazon $110 Best Buy\n\nAs I’m sure some of you have already noted, there are still more types of specialty headphones, including Gaming Headsets, which are another animal altogether, and even TV Headphones, which quickly transition from the screen's internal speakers to let you listen in silence without latency. I’m currently testing a new TV headphones bundle from Sennheiser, the RS 275, which includes a dedicated pair of headphones in the HDR 275 and Sennheiser’s new BTA1 Auracast transmitter (verdict to come).\n\nSpeaking of Auracast, it’s an increasingly cool new type of Bluetooth protocol that allows connection of an infinite number of devices at up to 100 meters, like an FM radio signal. Its implementation is still in its early stages, but it’s a good feature to look for in new headphones. Other features to consider include an app with an EQ and presets (which the majority of my recommendations include), multipoint pairing to connect to two or more devices at once (again, pretty ubiquitous), and spatial audio features for video formats like Dolby Atmos."

            "content": "Things Fall Apart Rolling out this week, WIRED’s journalistic commissions on technological decommissions—from broken-down electric cars to falling-down space stations.\n\nAccording to the TOP500, which ranks these mega-machines, Sierra was once the second-fastest supercomputer in the world. She was conceived in a Chicago hotel conference room more than a decade ago, at a technical discussion for officials from America’s national labs. The ultimate designer baby, Sierra was assembled from thousands of IBM Power9 CPUs and Nvidia Volta V100 GPUs—a daring, offbeat architecture for Livermore at the time.\n\nLike other supercomputers, Sierra was girthy. She was composed of thousands of compute nodes, stored one on top of another in racks—basically cabinets—that held up her processing innards. She had 240 of these racks, spread across roughly 7,000 square feet. All of this was needed to support her life’s main occupation: performing specialized, super-high-security simulations for the National Nuclear Security Administration. At the time of her death sentence, her processing power ranked a still-respectable 23rd in the world.\n\nNow, why did Sierra have to die? After all, an enormous amount of time and resources went into Frankensteining her together. The leadership of the lab won’t confirm how much she cost to build, but she was expensive—the government spent at least $325 million on her and her fraternal twin, a supercomputer called Summit at the Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee. (Summit was decommissioned in late 2024.) Also, she still totally worked. “At the end of the life of a machine, you could think, Oh, we have all these sunk costs. You should just keep running the machine forever,” says John Allen, the lab’s organizational information security officer. But that’s wrong. “Its good and faithful service is over, and we have to move on.”"

            "content": "I want the future of food to look something like the roast chicken in The Fifth Element. You put a small pellet in a microwave-like box, and in seconds out comes a delicious-looking, home-cooked roast chicken. We've made some progress since the movie came out nearly 30 years ago, but we're not quite there yet. We've had the microwave for a while, but the pellets still need some work.\n\nThe latest attempt at tasty meals from a box is the meal delivery service. These range from meal kits that deliver the ingredients and you cook them, to complete, ready-to-eat meals. The latest I've tried is Factor, which falls into the latter category. Factor's particular spin on that market is that it specializes in high protein meals targeted at anyone on a keto diet, high protein-low carb, or restricted calorie diets.\n\nWhat You Want\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Factor Prepared Meals Shop at Factor\n\nFactor is similar to other meal services in that you subscribe, pick the meals you want, and Factor ships them out on a weekly basis. I went for the completely hassle-free option of Chef's Choice and set some guardrail parameters like high protein and gluten free. The Factor-selected meals arrived at the start of the week via FedEx, though the delivery service will vary by area. These aren't frozen meals, so throw them in the fridge. They will last up to seven days.\n\nThe subscription process walks you through a list of questions that help determine the right meals for you. There are option lists with goals like “Eat more protein,” “Save time in the kitchen,” “Eat a better variety of foods,” and so on. Then you select other things like your spice preference and how many meal you want per week (the options are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 18)."

            "content": "Once the most talked-about TV show in the country, South Park, is on Paramount+. Don’t you want to know what got Trump in such a tizzy?\n\nStream the much buzzed-about South Park, fan-favorite Yellowstone, original series MobLand, and rebooted crime drama Dexter & Dexter on Paramount+. The streaming network has a bingeable TV series for almost everyone. And whether you want to remember Lindsay Lohan’s old face in the classic Mean Girls flick, or wonder just how many more sequels Tom Cruise has left in him with Top Gun: Maverick, there’s a bevy of films to stream, too.\n\nIf you’re like me and have at least half a dozen streaming services, our Paramount+ coupon codes can help you save so you can watch the content you want without having to get rid of one of your other beloved content platforms. (I love pretending the world isn’t full of suffering around me and instead focus on Sylvester Stallone’s ever-changing Play-Doh face in Tulsa King.)\n\nTry Paramount+ Free With a One-Week Trial\n\nIf you’re unsure if you’ll actually want to commit to Paramount+, or if there’s a sports event like March Madness games and you only need to access the content for a little while, Paramount+’s free trial is a great option. The trial lasts one week, is for new subscribers only, and can’t be paired with other offers.\n\nThere are tiered plans, including Essential, which allows for 3 devices, select Showtime series, NFL games, and can be streamed on up to 3 devices at once, but has ads; and Premium, which includes all that except there are no ads, downloadable content, CBS live, and all of Showtime content.\n\nFind the Right Paramount+ Plan Pricing and Get the Latest Deals\n\nIt’s important that you choose the right Paramount+ streaming plan for you so that you can get the best bang for your buck. Lucky for you, all plans come with a 7-day free trial so you can make sure you’re choosing the right plan for you. The first is Paramount+ Essential, which is $8 per month. It has ads included, but you’ll have access to over 40,000 episodes and movies. And you’ll be able to stream on 3 devices at once, be able to watch NFL games on CBS and UEFA Champions League, and select Showtime series are also available. Paramount+ Premium is the next tier (and the most popular choice), which starts at $13 per month (after the free trial ends), and you’ll get everything mentioned in the previous tier, without ads. You’ll have all that as well as the ability to watch in 4K UHD, Dolby Vision or HDR10, downloadable movies and shows, streaming CBS live and all of Showtime’s content library.\n\nCan You Cancel Paramount Plus at any Time?\n\nIf you find the service isn’t right for you, or just need to cut down on subscriptions, you can cancel Paramount+ any time. However, the cancellation process depends on where you signed up. If you signed up directly on the website, you’ll need to go to your account page.\n\nSave on a Paramount+ Subscription With Student and Military Discounts\n\nIf you’re a student now (or have your student ID lying around somewhere), you can get a Paramount+ plan at only $4 a month. All you have to do is verify your student status and you’ll get 50% off any plan of your choosing for the first year. Or if you’re a military member, Paramount+ gives 50% off any subscription for life.\n\nWatch Paramount+ Originals and Fan Favorites\n\nThere’s truly something for everyone in the family, with movies, kids’ shows, and Paramount+ originals included in every plan. If you’re feeling spooky, I’d recommend Dexter: Resurrection, or Yellowjackets, but if you’re looking for something more family-friendly, there’s super popular cartoons like Rango or Sonic the Hedgehog to choose from.\n\nLooking for specific recommendations? I’ve got you. There are tons of great new releases coming to Paramount+ this month, including Landman season 2, new Paramount+ original comedy series Crutch starring Tracy Morgan, and new episodes of (my favorite) newly premiered Ink Master Season 17. There are also tons of new movies, including The Cut, a boxing drama starring Orlando Bloom, dark comedy Shell, and true-crime tale My Nightmare Stalker: The Eva LaRue Story. Plus, Paramount+ will be playing the important NFL holiday games.\n\nCheck out the wide breadth of TV and movie content to choose from on Paramount+ (and use the Paramount+ promo codes above to save on whatever plan you decide).\n\nStream Live Sports and Events on Paramount+\n\nFor better or worse, I’m a Chiefs fan (cue the booing). I usually get a Paramount+ plan during the football season to keep up with my favorite beefy, TBI-ridden men. You can stream all of the NFL coverage you want all season long, plus, 24/7 live channels are now streaming on Paramount+, so you’ll never need to give your brain the time to process the horrors.\n\nStream UFC Fights Live on Paramount+\n\nParamount+ has all the man-on-man action you want, from bloody brawls to KO’s. Paramount+ is your one-stop shop to stream UFC live so you can catch every fight. This includes UFC 326: Holloway vs. Oliveira 2, airing March 7 and UFC Fight Night: Emmett vs. Vallejos, airing March 14.\n\nWatch March Madness With Paramount+\n\nThe annual tournament that determines which men’s and women’s Division I teams will win the NCAA Basketball championships, March Madness, will be streaming on Paramount+ this spring. You can watch any men's March Madness games that are being broadcast on CBS with Paramount+. Let the games begin!\n\nDon’t Miss the Champions League Soccer on Paramount+\n\nIf football (or soccer) is more your jam, Paramount+ also has you covered. You can watch Champions League Soccer at Paramount+, including fan favorites and heated rivalries from Real Madrid, AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Barcelona, and more."

            "content": "As Apple events expand beyond the company's September extravaganza for the latest iPhone release, the company is starting to take different approaches to its product launches. A new \"special Apple Experience\" is scheduled for March 4 at 9 a.m. ET, but the company will likely make several product announcements throughout next week.\n\nApple's invites often contain clues about what might be revealed at the event. Last September's Awe-Dropping event invite teased the new vapor chamber cooling system for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max models and a new pumpkin color.\n\nThe March 4 event invite features a three-dimensional shape composed of thinly sliced yellow, green and blue glass. A popular theory says the image is a nod toward the retro rainbow Apple logo from previous Mac branding, meaning new colorful MacBooks could be a part of the show.\n\nWhile many events are hardware reveals, the \"Apple Experience\" will reportedly be a chance for members of the media to get hands-on time with the new Apple products. A bevy of new Apple products could be unveiled in the days leading up to this event.\n\nWe expect to see a new iPhone and iPad early in the week, followed by new MacBooks before Apple's March 4 event. It doesn't seem like the most radical rumored new product in the MacBook lineup will make its debut during this event. Apple is likely saving some of its big, exciting redesigns for the annual September event.\n\nHere's everything that we're expecting from Apple's March 4 event.\n\nIt's spring refresh season, which means the MacBook Pro is likely to get performance upgrades in the form of M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. Lori Grunin/CNET\n\nMacBook chipset refreshes (and maybe something entirely different)\n\nWe're expecting a whole host of new MacBook computers throughout 2026, but it's unclear whether they'll all be showcased during Apple's next event -- especially since several of the rumored products appear slated for release in the second half of the year. You should expect chip refreshes for the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, as well as a few surprises.\n\nThe bread and butter of this spring product update will likely be the MacBook Pros. The 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro is already available, which means it's just about time for higher-powered MacBook Pros with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips to make their debut. We expect to see chipset upgrades for the standard 14- and 16-inch models on Tuesday, March 3 or Wednesday, March 4.\n\nThe MacBook Air is also rumored to get an M5 chip upgrade during the first half of 2026. While it may not hit store shelves as early as the new MacBook Pros, we might see Apple announce it next week, too.\n\nWe might finally see the long-rumored budget MacBook or the first OLED touchscreen MacBook Pro. Signs point toward the budget MacBook making its debut on March 3 alongside the Pro and Air updates. The OLED touchscreen MacBook Pro is a much bigger deal, and it's rumored to be debuting much later in the year, so it's doubtful that it will be a part of the March event. However, Tim Cook posted a teaser video to X on Feb. 26 with a finger manipulating an Apple logo, indicating that the touchscreen Mac might be introduced on the Monday before the event.\n\nA familiar addition could round out the iPhone 17 lineup\n\nThe follow-up to the iPhone 16E could offer performance upgrades at the same price. James Martin/CNET\n\nApple's annual iPhone unveiling happens in September, so we've had nearly half a year to get acquainted with the iPhone 17 lineup (including the new iPhone Air). But the company's budget-friendly iPhone offering is expected during this spring refresh cycle, once the initial hype starts to die off. The iPhone 16E was revealed this time last year, and rumors indicate the iPhone 17E will almost certainly be an upgrade over that device.\n\nThe iPhone 17E would replace the iPhone 16E while potentially maintaining the same $599 price. It's been reported that the new iPhone could ship with an A19 processor, MagSafe technology and a Dynamic Island design, which debuted in 2022 with the iPhone 14 Pro. We expect to see the iPhone 17E revealed early next week, in the days leading up to the March 4 event.\n\nThe 11th-gen iPad was a simple upgrade over its predecessor, featuring more storage and a faster chip. We expect much the same of the 12th-gen iPad. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nA new generation of iPads could integrate familiar technology\n\nIt's been a year since the 11th-gen iPads were released with their A16 processors. We expect Apple to give these devices a solid performance overhaul for the March event, introducing a new generation of iPads with more powerful chipsets. The iPad Air is also due to be updated with a new processor soon, and it's extremely possible that we'll see that come to fruition during Apple's March event.\n\nThe 12th-generation iPads are rumored to feature A18 processors, making them the first in Apple's tablet lineup to support Apple Intelligence features. It's likely that the new iPads are revealed alongside the iPhone 17E early next week, before the March 4 hands-on press event.\n\nThe iPad Air is rumored to skip an M3 chipset upgrade. Instead, we expect to see an M4 processor in the spring refresh of this product, and there's a very strong chance it's showcased alongside the 12th-gen iPads during the March 4 event.\n\nBe sure to check back with CNET on March 4 for full coverage of everything Apple announces at the event."

            "content": "When I moved into a new home with an aging stove, I faced a big question that morphed into an existential crisis. As a lifelong gas stove user, my instinct was to stick with what I knew, and what all the professional chefs in all the kitchens I've worked in used.\n\nAs a home tech reporter who covers large appliances and the air-quality and health risks of cooking with gas indoors, I found myself reconsidering. Sure, career chefs extol gas, and you'd be hard-pressed to find one who says otherwise, but professional kitchens are bigger, often have industrial ventilation and their inhabitants don't raise children in them.\n\nAn induction cooktop was never part of the plan -- but plans change. Juan Algar/Getty Images\n\nI've dealt with asthma my whole life, one of the conditions that is believed to be worsened by natural gas stove emissions, especially among children. On top of that, my new kitchen sits somewhat cut off from the rest of the home, making ventilation a real concern.\n\nI switched to a smart induction stove, and I couldn't be happier. Samsung/CNET\n\nUltimately, I went with induction -- Samsung's feature-rich smart induction stove. After more than a year of use, peace of mind about my kitchen's air quality is just one of many reasons I'm pleased with the switch. It's faster, safer, cleaner and more energy efficient.\n\nPlus, the stove's smart connectivity recently saved me several hours of driving (more on that later).\n\nAs it stands, I have no intention of going back to gas. Here are the four main reasons why.\n\n1. Air quality factored most in my decision\n\nI was a gas stove purist -- until I wasn't. Alessandro Citterio/Getty Images\n\nWhat pushed me to move on from gas has nothing to do with cooking. Study after study has shown that natural gas stoves pose a real risk of environmental contamination. While the scuttlebutt over whether gas stoves are safe and what regulatory guardrails should be in place has largely quieted, the science remains.\n\nGas stoves are shown to leak more than previously thought and those leaks have been shown to cause respiratory issues, particularly in children. As a lifelong sufferer of asthma and the owner of a new but not-so-well-ventilated kitchen, it didn't seem worth the risk, even if most agree that more research is needed.\n\n2. Induction heat is freakishly fast\n\nMy induction stove boils a 60-ounce pot of water in less than 5 minutes. A gas stove takes about 8. David Watsky/CNET\n\nModern induction heat is fast. Like, really fast. The Samsung Bespoke brings a pot of water to a boil in less than 5 minutes. A gas stove takes closer to 8. That may not seem like a big difference but after returning home from a frantic day and pasta is the only way to turn it around, you'll notice.\n\nThe digital dials took some getting used to but the heat responds with lightning-speed to adjustments. David Watsky/CNET\n\nThe quick heat comes in handy for more than just boiling water. Getting a cast-iron skillet really hot for searing steaks, chicken and burgers takes seconds, not minutes. Calibrating the temperature without a visible flame took some time and practice, but since I got the settings down, there hasn't been an effect on my cooking. Plus, the temperature adjusts instantly with a slide of a finger on the touchscreen.\n\nThe number of oven cooking modes is probably overkill and the air fryer function is just OK. David Watsky/CNET\n\nThe oven is fast, too. It preheats to 350 degrees Fahrenheit in just over 9 minutes. A gentle ding or an alert sent to your phone lets you know when it's preheated or when a timed cooking session is complete.\n\n3. Smart app control saved me hours of driving\n\nI buy into smart home features, here and there, but I'm not one who strives for connectivity in all my home electronics and appliances. My ice maker has app compatibility, for instance, but it's never crossed my mind to use it.\n\nBeing able to monitor certain aspects of your oven and stove remotely, however, is a no-brainer. Case in point: I was recently an hour into a long drive when I became utterly convinced I'd left a pot with food on a still-running burner. So sure was I that I pulled over with the intention of rerouting myself back home.\n\nThat's when I remembered to check the SmartThings app.\n\nThe stove's connectivity saved me hours of driving. Screenshot by David Watsky/CNET\n\nTo my surprise, the app and range were still connected, even though I hadn't logged in for weeks. The view showed all burners set to \"off.\" A sigh of relief and I was back on my way. Even if one had been errantly left on, I could have toggled it off right there from the interstate rest stop.\n\nThere are other, less dire uses for the smart app integration, like preheating the oven or dialing down the heat on a simmering sauce from another room. I admit I don't use my range's remote control daily or even weekly, but in that moment of uncertainty, the stovetop's connectivity paid for itself.\n\nYou can pull up YouTube cooking videos on the touchscreen, although I seldom do. David Watsky/CNET\n\nThe range's touchscreen hub can also connect to your phone via Bluetooth to play music or scan the internet for recipes and YouTube cooking videos, and display them for you as you cook along. I don't find myself engaging often, but I can see why some cooks would.\n\n4. Induction stoves are way easier to clean\n\nConsidering how easy induction stovetops are to clean, there really is no reason to cry over spilled milk. mrs/Getty Images\n\nThe most welcome surprise in my switch to induction is the cleanup -- or should I say, the lack thereof. Anyone who uses gas burners tucked under grates knows there's just no keeping that stovetop clean, no matter how careful you are while cooking.\n\nThe scratch-free range, which has remained scratch-free for more than a year of use, takes no more than a wipe with a damp towel or sponge to clean, no matter how much of that night's recipe rained down upon it.\n\nA year of regular use and there's not a scratch in sight. David Watsky/CNET\n\nAn involved cleanup after a long day, labor-intensive recipe or while hosting a gathering is one of the biggest buzzkills when cooking at home. Eliminating one inevitable and unenviable task is a big boon for induction.\n\nCookware compatibility was not an issue for me\n\nMy existing cookware was all induction-compatible. David Watsky/CNET\n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of switching to induction is the lack of compatibility with cookware. Induction doesn't work (or work well) with copper and aluminum pots and pans.\n\nMost stainless steel, cast iron and ceramic cookware is compatible. I only use pots and pans made from those materials, so I have had no compatibility issues.\n\nQuality kitchen brands always indicate whether their pans are induction-compatible. If you're making the switch to induction, do some research and ensure you don't have to buy new cookware after the fact.\n\nIf I could do it over, I'd skip the in-oven camera\n\nThe Samsung Bespoke Smart induction range I chose costs north of $2,000, about twice as much as a similar, less feature-heavy Samsung model. The key differences are that mine has \"more advanced\" AI-powered cooking modes and an internal oven camera, so you can monitor food remotely via phone and share time-lapse videos. I don't use or rely on either of these.\n\nThe control panels are also different, with the pricier model featuring an LCD Display. In my experience, LCD displays have more issues and glitches than simpler digital interfaces, although mine has been great so far.\n\nIf I could do it again, I'd opt for this far cheaper but slightly less smart induction stove. David Watsky/CNET\n\nFor my money, the $1,100 Samsung Bespoke 30-in Smart Induction Range, which has all the features I care about, as outlined above in this article, is the better buy."

            "content": "Every year, the moment we witness the very earliest signs of spring, CNET takes its cue to decamp to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress.\n\nThis is the world's most important mobile show, and one of the most exciting events in the tech calendar. This year, we're sending a bigger team to bring you all the news from the show as it happens.\n\nIt's set to be a bonanza of new phones and wearables, with the odd robot thrown in for good measure. Sure, some of the fun tech we see at MWC never makes it out into the wider world, but we've also seen some of our most beloved tech debut at the show over the years -- so expect a little of both.\n\nBig themes are set to include AI and 6G, and with keynotes from SpaceX and Qualcomm, we'll no doubt get a solid glimpse of the future of mobile. With Gemini in everything and satellite dominance on the horizon, it's an exciting time for the industry.\n\nHere's more of what we expect to see.\n\nWhat are the key dates for MWC?\n\nMWC 2026 is set to run from March 2 to 5, although we'll be in town a couple of days beforehand to report on some of the big launch events scheduled for this weekend. Don't miss Xiaomi's launch event on Feb. 28 and Honor's event on March. 1.\n\nHow to watch along\n\nNo matter how far away you live from Spain, there's no need to feel like you're missing out. The best place for all the latest MWC news is on our CNET live blog.\n\nWe've been attending this show for decades (this is MWC's 20th year in Barcelona, by the way), and we have a team of experienced reporters and reviewers on the ground.\n\nWe'll show you everything we deem interesting and important, and we're not just admiring new products from afar. We're touching, tinkering with and trying not to drop them, so be sure to follow us across Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, X and YouTube, too.\n\nWhat phones to expect at MWC 2026\n\nFor the past few years, Chinese phone-makers have dominated MWC, and 2026 looks to be no different.\n\nThe first big phone launch event is scheduled for 6 a.m. PT Saturday, Feb. 28, when we expect Xiaomi to unveil its latest camera-focused flagship. We loved the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and the 14 Ultra before it, so we're excited to see what the company has in store for us. A teaser image hints at its partnership with premium camera brand Leica and promises a \"new wave of imagery.\"\n\nThe Honor Magic V6 will be available in red. Honor\n\nNext up, we have Honor on Sunday, March 1, when the company has said it will unveil its Magic V6 phone, alongside the MagicPad 4 and MagicBook Pro 14. Perhaps more exciting still, Honor has said it will give us a first glimpse of a working version of its Robot Phone, and will also unveil a humanoid robot at its event.\n\nFor other phone-makers, MWC is likely to serve as more of a victory lap for its existing devices -- particularly Samsung, which held its own event in San Francisco this week to unveil the flagship S26 series. Motorola will be in town, likely showing off its Razr, which just like the Samsung Galaxy TriFold, has yet to be seen much in Europe.\n\nOn the whole, MWC 2026 is likely to be a big show for foldable phones, which, according to Ben Wood, CMO and chief analyst at CCS Insight, \"is now becoming quite a mature category.\"\n\nAnother major trend in the phone space is likely to be a focus on batteries, particularly silicon carbon-based tech, Wood said in an MWC preview session. \"We're expecting to see phones with some of the biggest batteries we've seen for a long time, [with] fast charging -- perhaps 300-watt charging -- being introduced,\" he added.\n\nWhat other tech to expect at MWC 2026\n\nAfter the early flops that were the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1, we're seeing more companies moving to jump on the wearable AI bandwagon. We expect to see a number of devices and demos pop up at MWC -- perhaps trying to beat OpenAI and Jony Ive to the punch.\n\nThis will include AI- and AR-based glasses, said CCS Insight analyst Ben Hatton during the firm's briefing session. \"We are expecting to see a huge number of glasses on show this year, not just from Meta, but also from the smaller players, [like] TCL and Oppo, looking to take a slice of the pie,\" he said.\n\nOne of the key challenges for these companies will be differentiation, Hatton said. \"Ultimately, there's still a long way to go before these become generally mass market products,\" he added, pointing out that at this stage, compelling use cases are still a bit thin on the ground.\n\nIt's been two years since Samsung launched the Galaxy Ring at MWC, and smart rings have been fairly thin on the ground ever since -- although Oura CEO Tom Hale is slated to speak at the show. We're not necessarily expecting to see any new rings this year, but there's always an outside chance.\n\nMuch more likely to show up are a slew of new laptops and tablets. They rarely get top billing at MWC, but we'll keep an eye out for the most exciting launches. There's also likely to be some intriguing concepts on show from the likes of Lenovo and Samsung Display, which is responsible for the tech behind the new Galaxy S26 Ultra's scene-stealing Privacy Display.\n\nThe big themes: AI, 6G and beyond\n\nNo surprises here that AI will, of course, be a major theme at MWC. For the past few years, Google has dominated the AI conversation at the event by showcasing Gemini's capabilities and its widespread integration. Will this year be any different? Probably not, but that doesn't mean the AI conversation has stalled.\n\nWe expect to see more sophisticated AI agents that are more deeply integrated into wearables, offering live translation, more actionable health insights and more personalized experiences. Some of the biggest players in the AI game will be present, including Nvidia and Qualcomm, on the hardware side. They'll likely have saved some juicy announcements for the show and, hopefully, have some exciting demos we can try out.\n\nWind the clock back a decade, and everyone was talking about 5G and what a dramatic difference it was going to make to our lives. Now that 5G is old news, we're looking forward to 6G. Most discussions about 6G so far have focused on its impact on the industry, but that doesn't mean there's nothing to be excited about.\n\nAt the Web Summit in November, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told me that 6G will make our phones faster than ever and connect us to an \"always-sensing network.\" This could include wearables, smart devices, cars and even robots. No doubt, Amon will expound on this subject further during his MWC keynote, which is all about 6G and AI.\n\nAnother theme likely to be prevalent at the show is the role of satellites in enhancing network connectivity. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell will be on stage to talk about Starlink, and all the world's biggest carriers will have their own booths where they'll show us what they're doing to tap into the latest network technologies."

If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nThe most complex AI models are those powering AI video generators. After spending years developing chatbots and image generators, AI bigwigs like OpenAI, Midjourney and Adobe started building even more advanced tech that could animate photos and create short video clips. But not all AI video companies can rise to that challenge, and there's a big difference in the quality of their outputs. That’s why CNET reviewers have spent time thoroughly testing each program to find the best one for you, no matter your project, budget or creative needs.\n\nPHOTO EDITING SOFTWARE DEALS OF THE WEEK PhotoDirector 365 12-Months Subscription Plan : $40 (save $25)\n\nDirector Suite 365 12-Months Subscription Plan : $100 (save $40) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article.\n\nThe best AI video generators create clips that align with what you want while having as few errors as possible. But hallucinations happen with even the best AI programs, so those with more advanced features and hands-on controls let you further customize your videos, offering better odds of getting the clip you want. Testing a service’s creativity, accuracy and response speed are just the beginning, though. You also ought to consider the legal and ethical ramifications of using creative AI.\n\n\n\nMany creators, publishers and content catalog owners are worried that their content was used to train AI models without their permission or compensation. There are also concerns that AI-generated content could violate existing copyright protections and that AI companies aren’t able to prevent the creation of potentially abusive and illegal AI content. No AI company is immune to these issues, including our top picks below, but some come with less information and protection than others. This is why you should always check a service’s privacy and usage policy before using it and always disclose your use of AI.\n\nThis is everything you need to know to pick the best AI video generator for you. For more, check out the best AI image generators and CNET’s AI essentials.\n\nWhat’s the best AI video generator?\n\nThe best AI video generator for you is going to depend on your skill level, budget and project. The best free AI video generator is Sora 2 from OpenAI, which creates fun clips you can share on the Sora social media app. The best paid AI video generator for cinematic videos is Veo 3 by Google. If you want to use AI videos in your professional work, you’ll want to use Adobe Firefly.

Reviewers spend time using each program to create a wide variety of content. AI video generators are given a battery of tests that measure how well they handle a diverse set of prompts, from photorealistic to fantastical scenarios. We consider a service’s speed, creativity, errors known as hallucinations and its ease of use. We also closely inspect each program’s privacy and usage policies, as these can have a significant impact on how people use (and potentially misuse) each service.

We’ve seen a massive rise in deepfakes and low-quality, weird videos that have been dubbed AI slop. AI companies have guardrails in place intended to stop users from creating illegal, abusive or otherwise inappropriate videos, but we’ve already seen how imperfect these systems are. If you’re using a service that lets you upload reference images, use name brands in your prompts or use another person’s likeness, you need to be extremely careful. You could be infringing on existing legal protections (like copyright) or find yourself in a position where you don’t have the rights to use your AI-generated content or have created content of no value, wasting energy needed to power AI. If you want to make AI videos, some best practices to mitigate your legal and ethical risks include not using someone’s likeness without their permission and avoiding brand names and logos. Two of the best rules of thumb are the simplest, too. If you think you shouldn’t make a certain AI video, don’t do it. And always, always disclose your use of AI when sharing them online and with others.\n\nFactors to consider Accuracy is one of the most important factors to consider when selecting an AI video generator. You want to pick a program that has strong prompt adherence, meaning it is able to do what you ask it to do in your prompt. Writing a good prompt is essential to this process, but the model should be capable of handling nearly any request. AI video generators are prone to errors known as hallucinations, especially when it comes to following the laws of physics. For example, a great AI video generator isn’t going to have a person floating through solid objects or have objects appear from out of nowhere (unless instructed to do so). While every AI program messes up sometimes, a capable generator won’t regularly produce these kinds of errors. Because hallucinations are unavoidable with AI, the ability to edit your content is also important. More creative AI platforms are introducing tools to edit your output, which is great as it gives you more hands-on controls to perfect AI outputs. If many clarifying prompts are required or if you’re not able to edit your content, those are signs you may want to switch to another program. Creativity is also important. Creative AI tools are often used for brainstorming, exploration and planning. The best AI video models can bring a wide variety of artistic ideas to life and build off your reference images. Response speed is another factor. Generating AI videos is a complex task, so most models are able to create them between 2 and 5 minutes. Models that take longer to generate videos may be annoying to use, but if they result in better videos, the trade-off may be worthwhile. On the flip side, a model that produces good results quickly is noteworthy, too. You’re also going to want to read the fine print, meaning a company’s privacy and usage policies. There are a lot of concerns about how AI models are created and whether copyright-protected content was used. Creators, celebrities and public figures have loudly voiced concerns over the ability of AI video generators to make content that’s too indecipherable from reality. This is especially worrisome as we’ve seen how companies’ guardrails against creating illegal and abusive content aren’t perfect. You ought to understand how the AI company is using your data, moderates content and what ownership or rights you retain over the videos -- these vary by service.

            "content": "Google couldn't let Samsung have all the fun and attention this week. The Gemini-maker dropped Nano Banana 2 on Thursday, the second generation of its viral AI image editing tool.\n\nYou might remember Nano Banana from last fall, when it made many fans and shocked AI users with its photorealistic capabilities. It quickly leapfrogged AI image tools from competitors like Midjourney and OpenAI, particularly with its ability to adeptly handle photo edits on top of generating entirely new images. The Pro version came out a few months later and built on those capabilities with better text generation. Now Google is promising that Nano Banana 2 is, like Hannah Montana, the best of both worlds.\n\nNano Banana 2 levels up Google's base AI image model. The company said it should have the speed of the original model with the accuracy and detailed work of the Pro version. It uses the world knowledge that was built into Gemini 3, previously restricted to the Pro model. That means AI images should be more rooted in reality and less likely to be hallucinations.\n\nText generation in images, like when you create greeting cards, should be clearer, too. Character consistency, something that creators have said Nano Banana excels at, is also getting a boost. Google said the new base model \"delivers vibrant lighting, richer textures and sharper details,\" along with the ability to generate in different aspect ratios and in resolutions up to 4K.\n\n\n\nSince Nano Banana's launch, and partly because of it, we're all now anxiously wrestling with the role AI-generated content plays in our online ecosystems. Advanced models like the ones from Google create fabricated images and videos that are nearly indistinguishable from real ones. Low-quality AI content, sometimes called slop, has flooded social media. The vast majority of social media users believe they see AI-generated posts, but less than half (44%) are confident they can spot it, a CNET survey found. Photorealistic images like the kind Nano Banana can make are a big part of that problem.\n\nThe new model is available now everywhere you use Gemini. Nano Banana 2 will replace the original, so you'll have to choose between it and the Pro alternative. If you create AI images with the new model, Google will attach invisible watermarks called content credentials to them. So if you want to know if an image was made with AI, you can upload it to Gemini, and it may be able to identify it. That only works if it was made with Google AI, though."

            "content": "If you're a lifelong coffee drinker, you probably have your routine down, and your small collection of tools for brewing drip, espresso or pour-over. While the brewer is a key component in making consistently good coffee, it's one of many factors that affect what ends up in your mug.\n\nGetting the coffee-to-water ratio right is essential, and experts suggest the golden ratio to do so. Beyond weight and measurements, the fineness or coarseness of the grind is just as important, and it's often overlooked in coffee brewing.\n\nGrinding freshly roasted beans at home is what most experts recommend, but reaching for whatever grinder is in your kitchen could compromise the outcome.\n\nThe best coffee grinders produce evenly ground beans, giving you greater control and a more balanced brew. And when we talk about the best, we're referring to burr grinders.\n\nWhat is a burr grinder, and how does it work?\n\nA burr grinder gives you maximum control over the beans you use to make a cup of coffee -- it's one of the most important coffee tools you can own. Patrick Holland/CNET\n\nUnlike a blade grinder, which grinds coffee beans by slicing them, burr coffee grinders crush them. Burr grinders use two abrasive or notched discs or plates, known as burrs, that rotate either parallel to one another or concentrically.\n\n\"A burr grinder gives you maximum control,\" Kaleena Teoh stresses. Teoh is co-founder and director of education for Coffee Project New York, and praises burr grinders for \"giving you the power to brew the coffee exactly the way you want it to be.\"\n\nBurr grinders are able to grind beans evenly and to a precise coarseness. Kuzmik_A/Getty\n\nAs the coffee beans are squeezed between them, they're crushed to a preset size determined by the distance between the two burrs, which is adjustable to suit both the type of coffee being made and personal preference.\n\nWhen you use a burr grinder, the coffee beans get crushed to a predetermined size -- which is more consistent than a blade grinder.\n\nWhy a burr grinder is preferable to a blade grinder\n\n\"With a blade grinder, there's no way for us to guarantee how the beans move within the grinder, which essentially works like a blender,\" says Teoh. \"You're basically cutting and chopping the beans at different angles,\" as they fly around haphazardly within the chamber of the grinder.\n\nNo matter how long you run the grinder, you're still likely to get a wide variety of particle sizes in the finished grind, \"from really fine powdery sizes to really big boulders in there,\" she says.\n\nBlade grinders don't really grind at all. Rather, they hack and chop the beans at different angles, resulting in uneven grinds. Pablo Jeffs Munizaga, Fototrekking/Getty\n\nBy comparison, the primary purpose of burr grinders is consistency, as the grinder's shape forces beans to move between the burrs in a specific manner. (One of two specific ways, outlined below.) \"You'll always have slightly different particle sizes,\" says Teoh, no matter what kind of grinder you use, \"but for the burr grinder, that range is way smaller compared to a blade grinder.\"\n\nFlat burr grinders vs. conical burr grinders\n\nThere's a slight difference in particle size distribution between conical and flat burr grinders, but both can achieve professional-level results. Created by CNET\n\nBurr grinders come in two forms: flat burr grinders, where the two ring-shaped burrs are stacked on top of one another in a parallel fashion. Beans are then inserted into the inner circle and are forced between the burrs before emerging on the sides. Conical burr grinders consist of one ring-shaped burr, and one conical burr, which work concentrically, with the beans passing between them and coming out through a chute below.\n\n\n\n\"Both flat burrs and conical burrs are able to give you great results, says Teoh, \"as long as you're able to understand how to dial in the grind for your coffee.\"\n\nBurr grinders of either style may be pre-calibrated for specific coffee styles, such as pour-over or espresso, or may offer a wide range of grind sizes. However, all will be adjustable, allowing you to fine-tune the grind to achieve the flavor you want in the finished brew.\n\nThere are two types of coffee grinders you can pick from: burr grinders or flat conical grinders. Patrick Holland/CNET\n\nThere is a slight difference in particle size distribution between flat and conical burr grinders, which mainly comes down to a matter of preference. \"A flat burr gives you a grind where the majority of particles after grinding will be a consistent size, and with a conical burr, it gives you two sets of grind sizes, with one group that is slightly finer and one group that is slightly coarser,\" says Teoh.\n\nThe argument for a conical burr grinder is that this gives you a more complex shot of espresso because of having two different extraction rates; however, \"the Specialty Coffee Association did a lot of research and blind-tasting and determined that it's very difficult for people to tell the difference.\"\n\nThe key to choosing a burr grinder is to select one that matches your use, as some burr grinders are pre-calibrated to produce a specific range of grounds for a particular style of coffee: extremely fine, powdery grounds for espresso or large, sea-salt-sized grounds for pour-over or French press. Some burr grinders offer a wide range of settings for various types of coffee.\n\nBurr grinders: Good brands and average cost\n\nYou don't have to spend a lot of money on a burr coffee grinder, but make sure you pick one from a reputable brand. Chris Monroe/CNET\n\nBurr grinders come in either electronic or hand-crank models and, like any kitchen appliance, you can spend a lot of money on one, but you don't necessarily have to. Teoh says she uses a variety of different grinders with Coffee Project New York; among the professional brands she likes, such as Mahlkönig and Victoria Arduino, there are several she recommends for home use:\n\nThe beans also matter\n\nThe primary purpose of burr grinders is consistency, so it's worth putting one in your kitchen if you're a coffee lover. OXO\n\nIf you're thinking of getting serious about the burr grinder, you should also get serious about the beans. Your average supermarket whole beans are probably not worth the splurge. Notably, for burr grinders, especially hand-crank models, the darker the roast, the more brittle it is and the easier it is to grind. Therefore, factor your preferred roast into your buying decision.\n\nAs far as optimizing consistency and control with a burr grinder goes, \"buy coffee from your local roasters,\" advises Teoh. \"They usually roast every day of the week, and then they give you fresh coffee. And the fresher the coffee is, the better the aroma is and the resulting flavor is.\""

            "content": "They're so sleek, no one even thinks to ask if they're smart glasses. Standing up on a stage about to give a talk at a conference in Rust, Germany, I wore the Even Realities G2 glasses to prove a point. In my field of view, a glowing monochrome 3D text display brought up notes on a teleprompter window. I tapped to navigate with a metallic ring on my right forefinger.\n\nAnd like that, my talking points drifted in a slow scroll to match the moments when I mentioned key terms as I improvised.\n\nThis was my first time trying smart glasses with a teleprompter in a real-life situation where I couldn't risk failure. The $599 G2 glasses only half passed the test. While these camera-free smart glasses have the lightweight framing I want, fit my extremely myopic prescription and have battery life to last a full day and then some, they don't work nearly as fluidly as I'd want. Which is why, midway through my live talk, I basically abandoned the teleprompter function and improvised the rest of the way.\n\nSmart glasses right now are like early smartwatches a decade ago, a wild mix of ideas thrown against the wall by an increasing number of companies, mixing features and AI services and interfaces in different combinations. There are no clear standards for smart glasses yet, like there are for phones, earbuds or even watches.\n\nScott Stein/CNET\n\nWhile Meta has stolen most of the spotlight and market with its AI-enabled and chunky Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses, they're not the only forms in the wild. Meta's glasses have cameras and microphones, and onboard speakers, acting as face-worn recording devices. Only one model right now has a display. The Meta Ray-Ban Displays have a single color display in one eye, and they don't have lenses that can be made for my high-index eye prescription. They also have battery life that can't last a full day, or even just a few hours.\n\nEven Realities' glasses are a totally different story. The second-generation models can fit a wide range of prescriptions, even beyond mine (up to +/-12). The battery life lasts well over a day. They have dual, larger displays in monochrome green. And they don't have cameras at all. Or speakers. Just displays and microphones.\n\nI got fitted for a prescription pair to try, thanks to Even, and have been wearing them on and off since the start of the year (prescription lenses cost at least $159 to add to the glasses). I wore them at CES in Las Vegas, and out to a German immersive entertainment conference called Aurea. I've worn them into New York. And I've been trying them along with a separately sold $249 smart ring, the Even R1, that controls the glasses and doubles as a heart rate-measuring fitness tracker.\n\nI love that these glasses are so trim and compact. So discreet. And that they fit my eyes and have amazing battery life. I just wish the rest of it worked as well as it promised. Some AI features are great, but I wish there were more.\n\nThe Even G2 glasses do have a remarkably compact design. Seen next to them: the separately-sold R1 control ring that's also a fitness tracker. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nEveryday-looking thin glasses\n\nThe most impressive aspect of the Even G2 is its shockingly lightweight frame and design. I've shown these glasses to people, and they had no idea they were smart glasses. They seem too unimposing.\n\nThe frame, in particular, is the standout. The metal frame around the lenses and arms is thin, with the only bulge in small bulb-like parts at the ends of the arms, where you'll find the batteries and touchpads to control the glasses. The display projectors live inside thicker parts of the arm near the lenses, but again, it's really subtle. The glasses are really lightweight, too: at 35 grams, they feel lighter than my regular glasses.\n\nThe G2s are a particular type of glasses design, though. They're small for my taste, and come in either square or round frames. And after a while, those bulky end bits on the metal arms start making my ears uncomfortable. They charge via an included glasses case that's bulkier than the Meta Ray-Bans case, but connects with USB-C the same way and is easy to tuck in a bag.\n\nThe separately sold R1 ring is an odder duck. It's similar to other smart rings like Oura in that it can track steps and heart rate. But the R1 also has a touch bar on one side that acts like a touchpad to control the Even G2 glasses. Double-tapping wakes the screen, swiping moves you through menus, and pressing and holding moves back a menu level.\n\nMe getting ready to talk on-stage, taking a quick selfie. The Even G2s do feel remarkably lightweight. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nThe ring's meant to be worn on your index finger, resting before the first knuckle so you can comfortably use the touchpad with your thumb, and that can get weird. I'm worried it'll fall off. When I was giving that stage presentation with teleprompter mode, as I held a microphone in one hand and a remote to control the slide deck in the other, it was super-hard to click the ring.\n\nLuckily, the glasses have their own touchpad controls, one at the back of each arm. They're often covered with my hair at the back of my ears, but they can navigate more reliably. Then you don't need to get the ring.\n\nAnd sometimes, the ring just stops working. A big problem with both the glasses and the ring is their spotty connectivity, even with multiple firmware updates. Sometimes it feels like a Bluetooth issue. Other times, I wonder if the background connection the glasses forge with my iPhone ends up timing out. Right now, in fact, the ring just stopped functioning as a touch control for some reason. And sometimes the glasses don't auto-dim the green micro LED display, keeping it on far longer than I need and getting in the way of my vision.\n\nThe micro LED display is big and bright enough indoors and in dimmer light, but it gets washed out in bright daylight. It's 3D and shows up across both eyes, looking like panels of green text overlaid on top of the transparent lenses. The small waveguide patches on each lens are subtle but do show up in light, and sometimes the displays can be seen through the lenses, too.\n\nBut the displays are clever, because they fade away when you're not looking at them. It's a bit of peripheral-vision magic because the green displays appear when you look up. But looking down at the rest of my world, like when typing this review, they seem to fade away.\n\nI'd skip the ring and just get the glasses, but even then, I don't think I'd want the glasses in their current software form. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nAI: Bits and pieces\n\nI love that Even Realities' onboard software has a unique application to use AI with, a mode called Conversate. However, it's one of the only useful AI features on the glasses for me.\n\nConversate is a live mode that auto-transcribes a conversation (or whatever you're listening to), displaying the text on-screen as captions while also listening for random key phrases the AI considers noteworthy. Those get pulled out into another pop-up window that defines the term loosely. For instance, as I listened to a presentation on virtual worlds, the term \"biomimicry\" was defined for me on-glasses. When would I get another phrase pulled out? I had no idea.\n\nI used the Even G2 glasses in Conversate mode for most of a whole day, listening to other keynote presentations, and was able to save the transcripts into the Even Realities phone app. None of this used much of the glasses' battery life, impressively, and the onboard microphones had no problem picking up audio from across the room.\n\nThe transcripts include AI summaries and key-term breakdowns, which is helpful. I can also look over the pulled-out terms of note that got defined during Conversate mode. I kind of fell in love with keeping these on as a helpful listening partner, but not having control over Conversate's focus on particular phrases to define wasn't great.\n\nBut it made me wonder about a future where talking with people could generate helpful information to guide me, via subtle pop-up prompts. Even's Conversate mode is a stab in that direction, but crudely. I can't choose other AI services to run on the glasses, just the company's own Even AI, which doesn't clearly list what models it uses to function.\n\nThere's also a dedicated Even AI mode that responds to voice prompts, but it's worse than anything you'd use on your phone. It sometimes answers in a strange way and with less detail than ChatGPT and Gemini. It also relies on relatively limited display screen real estate to show answers, so it's basically a one-question-at-a-time experience. The text replies also roll in pretty slowly for my comfort.\n\nA look at the other side of the lens: the thicker arm part is where the display lives. A small patch on-lens is where the display gets reflected onto, Scott Stein/CNET\n\nEven Realities has an on-glasses maps-based navigation mode called Navigate that provides pop-up turn-by-turn directions. Not having any of these modes hook into existing phone apps or services is a huge downside, though. I have to ask for things from scratch and hope Even AI delivers.\n\nOn-glasses translation can handle 35 languages, far more than Meta's glasses can do. There's no need to download language packs either, but you do have to select the language pairs from the phone app to make it work. Oddly, you can't do it in glasses.\n\nTeleprompter mode is one of my other favorites, and maybe the best next to Conversate. You can cut and paste notes or speeches into the app and then roll them on glasses. It listens in and keeps up with what you're saying, even skipping ahead if you're at a later point. While this worked well generally, in a live stage experience, I couldn't control the ring well enough to get the teleprompter to start up. I had nervous jitters, combined with a less-than-responsive ring touchpad.\n\nAnd that's about it for the Even's features. Seriously. I'm struggling to think of what else I'd even use these glasses for, which is why I'm usually taking them back off again.\n\nThey're not even a good replacement for a smartwatch. Notifications can appear in-glasses, but many still don't pop up for me when paired with an iPhone. Incoming calls don't show up either. I can't respond to texts (or apparently see them). On Meta's Ray-Bans, I can at least answer calls and use the glasses like AirPods. You can't do that on Even's glasses. You can't listen to music. And you can't use them as cameras, because there aren't any.\n\nThe good news is that there are apparently a number of developers working on AI apps for the glasses that could emerge soon. These glasses are trying to be the Pebble watch of smart glasses in that respect. But I need those features and the customization to hurry up and get here. Right now, there's not enough to do to justify wearing them.\n\nThe right form, the wrong function\n\nI've come away from my Even G2 test drive realizing that, yes, smart glasses can be as small and prescription-friendly (and battery life-friendly) as my dreams desire. But that comes at a severe cost to everything else. Phones just don't work well with smart glasses right now, no matter what company makes them. The G2 tries, but its wonky phone app, buggy connectivity, limited customization and lack of deeper phone hook-ins to its AI (and lack of support for other AI services) keep it feeling a step behind.\n\nI can't wait for glasses to actually feel like truly deeper phone extensions, things that could assist people on the terms they choose with the apps they want. Meta hasn't gotten there. Even Realities hasn't. Maybe Google will, with its glasses coming later this year.\n\nI hope other smart glasses have the battery life, prescription lens support and size advantages Even does. It's sorely needed. It's just extremely disappointing that these glasses can't live up to the promise of all the rest yet. I'll check back later if more apps come, and see if they can be the Pebble for my face I was hoping for."
