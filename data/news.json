However, under current circumstances we believe it is best to change managers.\n\n“On behalf of everyone at the club, the board and personally, I would like to thank Frank for his work as head coach and wish him every success in the future.”"

The former Spurs boss will lead the United States of America at their home World Cup this summer, but beyond that campaign, he could be back in the Premier League and has not ruled it out in a recent interview.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPochettino, who managed Spurs between 2014 and 2019, remains hugely popular with the fanbase and is one of several big names linked with the job on a permanent basis. The club are currently in crisis and battling relegation, with former Juventus manager Igor Tudor taking over as interim manager following Thomas Frank's axing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPochettino is set to lead the USA at this summer's World Cup but has refused to rule out a return to his old club, hinting that he's open to all offers.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDuring a radio interview with “Radiogaceta de los Deportes” on RNE in Spain, he said: “I’m always linked (to clubs), to Tottenham, just like at one time I was linked to Espanyol, or to other clubs. In the end, especially because of my past at those clubs, when things aren’t going well, people tend to fall back on emotions and say, ‘Well, with Mauricio we played good football,’ or whatever it may be.\n\n\"But no.

They also reached the Champions League final in 2019, but lost to Liverpool.\n\nPochettino was sacked just months after that showpiece clash with Spurs appointing Jose Mourinho as his replacement. Nuno Espirito Santo, Antonio Conte, Ange Postecoglou and Frank have followed as permanent managers since then.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Tottenham sacked Thomas Frank earlier this month (Image: Joe Toth/Shutterstock)\n\nRoberto De Zerbi, Robbie Keane and Enzo Maresca have been touted as possible alternatives to Pochettino.\n\nOther big names such as Julian Nagelsmann and Carlo Ancelotti could also be available after the World Cup, but Manchester United are more likely to appoint one of those.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWhat division Tottenham are in next season will likely play a huge role in the type of candidate they can appoint.

Their European Club Finance and Investment Landscape assessment has also highlighted the financial dominance of the Premier League in comparison to other major divisions.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat was particularly evidenced by the increase in television revenue to £1.3bn (€1.5b) for English clubs. That staggering figure very nearly amounted to the £1.4bn (€1.6bn) that 53 other European top-division leagues received combined.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite taking a share of that major financial boost, United's specific failures have also been exposed by UEFA, with £692million emerging as their net spend on transfers between 2021 and 2025. Significant losses on the likes of Antony and Paul Pogba have undoubtedly impacted that, even with other Premier League clubs spending more.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMan Utd and Premier League clubs sent warning by UEFA after financial results revealed READ MORE :\n\nMan Utd taking Kobbie Mainoo transfer risk as latest contract stance emerges READ MORE :\n\nThe likes of Chelsea and Arsenal have parted ways with substantial transfer fees over the five-year period, accounting for £656m and £587m, respectively, as their net spends. England's financial dominance has also been demonstrated on the pitch with six teams in the last-16 of this season's Champions League.\n\nFor UEFA to publish their findings, an examination of financial accounts from 2021 to 2025 was conducted. This meant the impact of all transfer activity across the five years was included, encompassing profits on sale, amortisation from earlier transfers and impairments.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn the report, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said: \"After a decade that included one of the toughest periods our sport and our society have faced, European football has come through in a strong position. Club revenues have grown steadily across the board, and top-division income is expected to pass €30bn in the 2025 financial year.\"\n\nThere have been some financial bright spots for United lately, though, with their most recent accounts revealing an operating profit of £32.6million recorded for the opening six months of the fiscal year.\n\nCompared to the £3.9m loss reported during the equivalent period in the previous year, that represents quite the uplift with those improvements fuelled by strategic cost-management measures authorised by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt appeared to be a difficult financial period for United without the inclusion of European football and the substantial funding that accompanies it, but evidently, that has not been the case.\n\nThere has, however, been a predictable decline in commercial and matchday revenue due to fewer fixtures, with the club just over £9million down.\n\nView 2 Images Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada issued an update after the release of the club's latest accounts (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUnited CEO Omar Berrada stated: \"We are now seeing the positive financial impact of our off-pitch transformation materialise both in our costs and profitability.

Manchester United confirmed during January that the midfielder will depart when his contract runs out on 30 June.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCasemiro's agreement contains a clause to extend by a further year, but the club have opted not to retain him for a fifth year. With fewer than six months left on his existing contract, the Brazil international can negotiate a pre-contract arrangement with clubs beyond England.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNo agreement has yet emerged publicly. However, Casemiro is understood to be eager to remain in Europe.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nThe Sun reports sources close to the player have suggested Italy represents a possible destination. They point to his former Real Madrid teammate Luka Modric and his transfer to AC Milan last summer as a precedent.\n\nCasemiro is six-and-a-half years younger than the 2018 Ballon d'Or recipient, who celebrated his 40th birthday in September. He has also devoted the past 13 years of his career to playing European football since departing Sao Paulo in January 2013, initially on loan, for Madrid.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeculation regarding a switch to Italy comes after former United striker Dion Dublin's appeal for Casemiro to remain. He told OLBG that United ought to allocate some of their transfer funds to offer him fresh terms.\n\nView 2 Images Casemiro could follow Luka Modric to Italy this summer (Image: DeFodi Images, DeFodi Images via Getty Images)\n\nDublin said: \"[Casemiro's] been sort of 75% and he's had his dips where people said, 'oh, his legs are gone, oh, his legs are gone, he can't run around anymore, he can't do this, he can't do that. To be honest with you, I retired at 39; my legs went about 33.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"If you can do your job and you're clever with it, then I think you'll have a long time in the game. I retired at 39, so I knew how to manage my body.\n\n\"The managers that I had knew how to manage me,' just do two or three days of training, that's fine,' because they knew what they'd get on a match day. I think it's the same with Casemiro.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"His footballing brain and knowledge are just outstanding. If you watch Casemiro, who tries to play a pass and it gets cut out, and then the other team go and breaks, and they might have had a chance, but if that pass comes up again, he'll try it again.\n\n\"I just think you have to try and find somebody when he goes, that's as brave as him, as clever as him, and as Man United as him, to be honest with you, because he's loved it. Absolutely, I like watching him play.\"\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

            "content": "Nottingham Forest survived a scare from Fenerbahce to book their Europa League last-16 place, winning 4-2 on aggregate despite a 2-1 defeat at the City ground in Thursday's second leg.\n\nVitor Pereira had the luxury of rotation for the knockout play-off tie, having already won 3-0 in Istanbul last week, but the difference in performances could not have been more vast.\n\nForest were the architects of their own difficulties too, and made a seemingly simple task monumentally harder.\n\nThey were first punished in the 22nd minute when Fenerbahce's ruthless break saw Kerem Akturkoglu sweep home to hand the visitors a lifeline.\n\nIt gave Fenerbahce real confidence, with Akturkoglu and Sidiki Cherif squandering glorious chances to level up the tie in the first half.\n\nImage: The game was stopped mere seconds after kick-off after Fenerbahce fans threw flares onto the pitch\n\nForest players forced to dodge Fenerbahce fireworks Forest players were forced to dodge fireworks thrown on to the pitch by Fenerbahce fans.\n\n\n\nMoments after the match kicked off, there was a three-minute delay as sections of a 1,500-strong away end launched several fireworks on to the pitch into the Forest penalty area.\n\n\n\nJair Cunha had to take evasive action as he had his back to them and Neco Williams also had to duck as he tried to carry one away.\n\n\n\nFenerbahce's Archie Brown also had to intervene and carry some of the pyrotechnics off the pitch while urging calm from his side’s fans.\n\nAfter 45 minutes with no shots on target, high turnovers and losing duels, Pereira made four half-time changes - something he called \"difficult\" after the game - bringing on Callum Hudson-Odoi, Igor Jesus, Ola Aina and Ibrahim Sangare.\n\nBut seconds into the second half, another clumsy moment handed Fenerbahce a penalty. Jair Cunha stuck a foot out to catch Akturkoglu and, after a VAR check, the on-field decision stood.\n\nImage: Fenerbahce's Kerem Akturkoglu scores his opener against Nottingham Forest\n\nIt was the forward who stepped up and easily slotted home his second of the evening to give the Turkish side real hope of levelling up on aggregate.\n\nBut Forest soon settled into their rhythm as the substitutes worked their magic, even if the approach of careful possession - as they have done so well in their two games under Pereira so far - did little to calm the nerves of the home fans.\n\nImage: Nottingham Forest's Callum Hudson-Odoi scored at the City Ground on Thursday\n\nAnd as the unhappy whistles began, Forest answered. It was two substitutes who combined as Aina's swinging cross found Hudson-Odoi over on the left of the area. He then sped past his defender before hammering home his first European goal of the season into the far corner.\n\nThe relief was palpable around the City Ground, and it took the remaining puff out of injury-hit Fenerbahce. Forest are now in the draw for Friday's last-16 draw, and will face either Real Betis or FC Midtjylland.\n\nTeam news headlines Only five Nottingham Forest players survived from the weekend's 1-0 defeat to Liverpool - those were Stefan Ortega, Murillo, Neco Williams, Elliot Anderson and Omari Hutchinson.\n\nFenerbache have an injury-hit squad, and only named five outfield players on their bench. The likes of Ederson and Milan Skriniar were among the absentees.\n\nPereira: Changing six players was a risk\n\nNottingham Forest head coach Vitor Pereira: \"When you change half of a team, it's not easy to keep the level, that's my responsibility because we have an important game in three days. By my decision, I try to manage the next game and recover some players. It's not easy. It will change a lot.\n\n\"We are in the moment of the season that we need to think not about one game, but about two games, about the next game. It was a risk because I decided to make six changes in the team. If you have one or two changes the players can be in the middle of the others, and you don't miss the quality.\n\n\"But when you change six players they aren't used to playing 90 minutes. This is the risk and I decide to take this risk. I decide because I need to think about the Brighton game, because it's very important for us. We need to go there with fuel and energy.\n\n\"We conceded a goal and lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at half-time, but I said to the players it's my decision. The game was a dangerous situation for us. They start the second half by scoring the second goal and after we start to play and create.\n\n\"We have a big chance to score the second goal. Ok, this is important to keep in our mind. I know they came here to fight for the result.\"\n\nOn learnings: \"Even for me. If you change five players you don't know what will happen. When the pressure starts to come, under stress it's difficult to be themselves when you don't play every match. In the end, we are in the competition so let's move forward and think about Brighton.\"\n\nVitor Pereira has become the second Nottingham Forest manager this season to lose his first two home games in charge, along with Ange Postecoglou. He's now lost four in a row at home in all competitions (also his last two at Wolves), his worst-ever run as a manager.\n\nHudson-Odoi: We made it difficult for ourselves\n\nImage: Hudson-Odoi scored his first European goal of the season against Fenerbahce\n\nNottingham Forest goalscorer Callum Hudson-Odoi to TNT Sports: \"We made it difficult for ourselves. When you're in the lead and sometimes you can feel a bit comfortable, but we showed a great reaction after they scored the second goal.\n\n\"We wanted to score, which we did. It's important that we're through even if we didn't get the result on the night.\"\n\nOn what Forest needed to do in the second half: \"We needed to up the levels a bit more and focus on what we know is best - that's us on the ball, playing a high press and going to win the ball up high.\n\n\"It was unfortunate to score a second goal straight away in the second half but we reacted very well.\n\n\"In situations like that where they're getting a couple of goals, you've got to calm the game down. They're trying to chase the game, but we had to do what we know best - keep the ball, create more chances and hope to get a goal.\n\n\"When we got the goal, it gave us more breathing space to attack more. We've just got to keep working hard and push ourselves to get results.\"\n\nOn facing either Real Betis or Midtjylland in the last 16: \"No matter who comes, we're going to be prepared and ready for the game.\"\n\nAlthough they have now reached the Europa League last 16 stage, Nottingham Forest have suffered two home defeats in a single major European season for the first time (also lost 2-3 to FC Midtjylland in October).\n\n\n\nFenerbahce registered just their second European away win in England in all competitions (D2 L7), with this their first since beating Man Utd 1-0 in the UEFA Champions League in October 1996.\n\nWhat is the Europa League schedule?\n\nRound of 16 draw: 27 February, 12pm\n\nRound of 16: 12 & 19 March 2026\n\nQuarter-finals: 9 & 16 April 2026\n\nSemi-finals: 30 April & 7 May 2026\n\nFinal: 20 May 2026 (Istanbul)"

The goal, though, lifted an otherwise lacklustre Selhurst atmosphere with spots of empty seats reflective of a collective apathy in south London.\n\nPlayer ratings: Crystal Palace: Henderson (6), Munoz (6), Lacroix (7), Richards (6), Canvot (6), Mitchell (6), Wharton (8), Kamada (7), Sarr (6), Guessand (8), Strand Larsen (6)\n\n\n\nSubs: Hughes (6), Johnson (6)\n\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Wharton\n\nWhile quality was lacking, Palace continued to push a Zrinjski side who had failed to score and therefore win in any of their Conference League games away from home this season.\n\nIsmaila Sarr was denied by opposition goalkeeper Goran Karacic in a one on one as he spurned one of his several chances, as Palace's endeavour proved more than their quality as the game wore on.\n\nHowever, after Tomi Juric had Palace hearts in their mouths late on as he sent a header wide, Guessand ran through and wrapped up the victory in injury time.\n\nWhat's happening in Friday's draw?\n\nThe Conference League last-16 draw will take place on Friday at 1pm UK time in Nyon, Switzerland.\n\nThe draw will confirm the last-16 ties and also allocate a side of the bracket for every team so they know who they could potentially meet in the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final.\n\nEach of the play-off winners face the sides that finished in the top eight (seeded teams) in the league phase.\n\nPalace will play the second leg of the tie against either Larnaca or Mainz away from home.\n\nGlasner: I've been given assurance of staying but sometimes we don't enjoy the noise\n\nCrystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner played down suggestions of a premature Selhurst Park exit but says he has not enjoyed the backlash during his side's difficult spell.\n\nSpeaking to TNT Sports, he said: \"I've had 100-per-cent assurance [of staying on]. For me, the number one is the players, the players believing in the staff and I - and that's the most important thing, otherwise you can pack your suitcase and go home.\n\n\"They have a great togetherness in the group, the staff and it's the same with the chairman and sporting director.\n\n\"They are sometimes wondering - it's the second-best Premier League season ever.\n\n\"The best was last year, so maybe the best two in Palace's history, playing European football for the first time, and there is so much noise so sometimes we really don't understand it.\n\n\"Maybe I gave some interviews which were not really helpful, I have to admit, but I always say what I am feeling and sometimes it's positive, sometimes it's not so positive.\n\n\"That's Oliver Glasner, and in the end, we are in a very good position in the league and now it's up to us with our fans to make a really good season of it.\"\n\nStimac: Palace are my favourites to win the Conference League!\n\nZrinjski Mostar boss Igor Stimac says Crystal Palace are his pick to go on and win the Conference League.\n\n\"Congratulations to Crystal Palace,\" he said.\n\n\"Looking at the teams which are left there. As far as I'm concerned, they are one of the top three favourites in this competition. I wish them the best of luck to win the competition and to go all the way through.\"\n\nQuizzed further on who his top three are, Simac added: \"Crystal Palace is my favourite. Mainz is the second one. I would say we played against them already. And they have an enormous quality in their team also. They have wonderful support and a really, really well-balanced team. Dangerous from each part, each position.\""

            "content": "Celtic salvaged some pride despite exiting the Europa League at the hands of Stuttgart 4-2 on aggregate as Luke McCowan's first-minute strike earned them a first-ever victory in Germany.\n\nTrailing by three goals from the first leg and needing a minor miracle to progress to the last 16, Martin O'Neill decided to rest eight first-teamers against a side fourth in the Bundesliga ahead of a crunch Old Firm game on Sunday, live on Sky Sports.\n\nO'Neill's players did not share his apparent willingness to throw in the towel and stunned the MHPArena with just 28 seconds on the clock as Junior Adamu's slide-rule pass was fired home by McCowan for his first European goal.\n\nCeltic could have had a second when Daizen Maeda got the ball stuck under his feet from an Adamu cross with the home side struggling to settle.\n\nBut once they did settle, there were few signs of an unlikely comeback and stand-in goalkeeper Viljami Sinisalo, making his European debut for the Hoops, made a number of saves to keep the visitors ahead on the night.\n\nThe one time the Finnish stopper was beaten by Deniz Undav, VAR intervened to rule Ermedin Demirovic offside in the build-up and keep Celtic's lead alive and avoid a moment of potential controversy for the fourth official, who had let Demirovic back onto the pitch following an injury moments before receiving the ball.\n\nFollowing a first-leg hammering and an equally disappointing home defeat by Hibs at the weekend, Celtic's narrow win provided a tonic for their delighted travelling support as they bowed out of Europe with a victory, and joined Bayern Munich as the only opposition sides to win in Stuttgart so far this season.\n\nO'Neill given 'food for thought' ahead of Old Firm game\n\nO'Neill admitted he was handed some selection dilemmas ahead of Sunday's showdown with Rangers after goalkeeper Sinisalo shone and a much-changed side secured the historic if academic win over Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo made six saves in his sixth Celtic appearance of the season and several of them were impressive stops.\n\nThe 24-year-old Finland international looked assured throughout and put pressure on Kasper Schmeichel for a place at Ibrox after some inconsistent displays from the Dane in recent months.\n\nO'Neill said: \"I thought he did really well, really well, in the game. I'm delighted for him, he's a lovely lad.\n\n\"Everybody did well in the match. It gives me food for thought. Of course it does, absolutely.\n\n\"It's not as if we've played some 16-year-olds. The players have all played, but some have played less football than others in recent times.\n\n\"I thought everybody came out with flying colours.\"\n\nO'Neill admitted McCowan's early strike had him believing they could pull off a famous comeback.\n\nImage: McCowan was all smiles after scoring\n\n\"I'm delighted with the effort and determination they put into the game,\" added the Celtic manager.\n\n\"We got off to a really great start. We felt as if we don't concede in the first 20 minutes of the match, and maybe even nick a goal, we could still be in the tie.\n\n\"I got carried away with myself [after the goal]. I thought, we're going to do this here. Eventually, we have to create more chances and it wasn't to be.\n\n\"It might have been interesting if Seb (Tounekti) had scored towards the last couple of minutes. It might have been a bit nervy for Stuttgart.\n\n\"I genuinely thought we could do it, but I might be asking a lot.\n\n\"We're playing a very, very good side. A side, from my viewpoint here, capable of winning the competition.\n\n\"But I couldn't be more pleased with the team, couldn't be more pleased with attitude and desire.\""

The referee responded by crossing ​his arms in front of his ⁠face, activating FIFA's anti-racism protocol and temporarily stopping the match.\n\nUEFA has opened an investigation into allegations of \"discriminatory behaviour\" after the game in Lisbon, and Prestianni was handed a one-match suspension, covering the second leg at the Bernabeu.\n\nBenfica appealed the temporary suspension, and Prestianni did travel and train with the squad in Madrid. However, the appeal was dismissed hours before the game on Wednesday.\n\nReal Madrid won the tie 3-1 on aggregate to seal a spot on the last 16. Aurelien Tchouameni said the result was a \"victory for everyone who stands against racism\".\n\nImage: Gianluca Prestianni arrives in Madrid with the Benfica squad (credit Benfica)\n\nMourinho criticised for response over incident\n\nBenfica manager Jose Mourinho did not speak to the media around Wednesday's second leg, with his sending off during the first leg meaning he did not have to carry out his usual media duties.\n\nIt comes after the former Real Madrid boss was widely criticised for appearing to defend Prestianni and the club by questioning the way Vinicius Jr celebrates goals.\n\n\"I told him, when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back. They [Vinicius Jr and Prestianni] told me different things. But I don't believe in one or another. I want to be an independent,\" Mourinho told Amazon Prime following the first leg.\n\n\"When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person [Eusebio] in the history of this club was black. This club, the last thing that it is, is racist.\"\n\nImage: Mourinho spoke to Vinicius Jr after the incident in the Champions League knockout round play-off first leg\n\nMourinho then appeared to comment on previous incidents in which Vinicius Jr has been subject to racist abuse in stadiums.\n\nThe Brazilian has spoken out multiple times against racism he has been subject to inside stadiums. In June 2024, three Valencia fans were jailed for eight months for racially abusing him during a LaLiga game the previous year, in the first verdict of its kind in Spain.\n\n\"There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium,\" said Mourinho. \"A stadium where Vinicius plays something happens, always.\"\n\nMourinho was seen speaking to a visibly upset Vinicius Jr and a member of the Benfica coaching staff was shown a red card during the lengthy stoppage. After a number of discussions between players, coaches and the referee, play then resumed.\n\nReal Madrid held on to win but there was a further short delay late in stoppage time when fans threw objects as Vinicius Jr was attempting to take a corner kick.\n\nImage: Vinicius Junior scored against Benfica in the second leg to round off Real Madrid's win\n\n'Prestianni facing 10-game ban'\n\nSky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:\n\nUEFA has moved very quickly to suspend Prestianni. They appointed an ethics inspector last Wednesday to look into allegations that Prestianni had racially abused Vinicius Jr the previous evening.\n\nThe inspector has already spoken to the relevant parties and forwarded an interim report to UEFA's disciplinary body, recommending Prestianni is suspended for one game while the disciplinary process continues.\n\nThe inspector believes there is prima facie evidence that Prestianni has broken UEFA's regulations on discriminatory behaviour, which carries a minimum 10-game ban.\n\nUEFA says the provisional ban is without prejudice, which means Prestianni can still expect a fair hearing.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Aurélien Tchouaméni praised Vinícius Júnior for his performance against Benfica, after the forward was allegedly subjected to racial abuse during the first leg of their Champions League play-off clash.\n\nVinicius Jr: Racists are cowards\n\nPosting after the first leg, in Portuguese on his Instagram story, Vinicius Jr wrote: \"Racists are, above all, cowards.\n\n\"They need to put their shirts over their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are.\n\n\"But they have, on their side, the protection of others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish. Nothing that happened here today was new in my life and my family's.\n\n\"I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose.\n\n\"I don't like appearing in situations like this, even more so after a great victory and when the headlines have to be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.\"\n\nImage: Vinicius Jr spoke to referee Francois Letexier after Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni appeared to make a comment towards him\n\nIn a statement in Portuguese on Instagram, shared by Benfica on social media, Prestianni denied making racist comments.\n\nHe wrote: \"I want to clarify that at no time did I direct racist insults to Vini Jr, who regrettably misunderstood what he thought he heard.\n\n\"I was never racist with anyone and I regret the threats I received from Real Madrid players.\"\n\nBenfica posted footage of the incident on X, with the comment: \"As the images demonstrate, given the distance, the Real Madrid players could not have heard what they claim to have heard.\"\n\nMbappe explains what he heard\n\nReal Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe said in an interview after the match in Lisbon that he heard Prestianni racially abuse his team-mate and said the Benfica winger should not be allowed to play in the Champions League.\n\n\"I know everything,\" the France international said after the game. \"I will explain everything that happened.\n\n\"Vinicius scored a goal - an amazing goal. He goes to dance and the people boo him. That's something that happens in football. After that, there's a moment of tension with the Benfica players. It's better if it doesn't happen, but this can happen too.\n\n\"It's the Champions League, the best competition in the world for clubs. So, it's normal that people want to win, to give their best for their club and their fans and defend their colours.\n\n\"After that, Benfica's No 25 - I don't want to say his name because he doesn't deserve it - starts to talk badly. You don't accept it but, again, it happens in football and it will continue to happen.\n\n\"He put his shirt here [over his mouth] to say Vinicius is a ****** five times. I heard it. There are Benfica players who heard it as well. And after that point, everything you have seen started.\n\n\"I want to try and explain it calmly. I don't want to speak in a general manner. I have come to Portugal many times. I have been lucky to have many team-mates and friends from Portugal, and nothing has ever happened to me.\n\n\"With these kind of things, it's very important to speak in a very clear way, and to not speak in general, because there are people who haven't done anything wrong. In the stadium, I think there are 70,000 people who haven't done anything wrong. They just wanted to support their team.\n\n\"I have the maximum respect for Benfica and their manager, who is one of the best in history, who has made history at Real Madrid.\n\n\"But this player, for me, doesn't deserve to play in the Champions League anymore.\n\n\"It's a wonderful thing to play in the Champions League. The best competition. Everyone here, all the journalists, loves the Champions League, no? It inspires me as a player, it inspires the people, it inspires children, and we have to give the best possible example to young people.\n\n\"If we let this kind of thing happen, I think all the values of football are worthless, all that we believe is worthless. We have to do something.\"\n\nVinicius Jr's history with incidents of racism\n\nVinicius Jr has spoken out previously about repeated racist abuse he has suffered, saying in 2024 that he felt \"less and less\" like playing football because of the abuse.\n\nIn that same year, three Valencia fans were sentenced to eight months in prison for racially abusing him at a match in May 2023 - in scenes reminiscent of those in Benfica, as the game was also stopped for 10 minutes after Vinicius Jr alerted the referee to fans he felt had abused him.\n\nAfter the game, the Brazilian said LaLiga \"belongs to racism\". But LaLiga president Javier Tebas responded that Vinicius Jr had been \"manipulated\" in calling out the abuse. Tebas later apologised for those comments.\n\nThe three supporters from the Valencia incident were also fined €5,000 (£4,681) and banned from sporting venues for one year for making racist gestures. Valencia were fined €27,000 (£23,581) and had their stadium partially closed for three matches.\n\nSince then, Spain has been punishing supporters for racist abuse towards Vinicius Jr. Four people were convicted for hanging an effigy with his name on it off a highway bridge in Madrid earlier in 2023.\n\nThree of them were sentenced to seven months in prison for hate crimes and threats, while the other was sentenced to 15 months in prison for sharing the images online.\n\nAll four had to take an anti-discrimination training programme to have those sentences suspended, while they were also fined €60,000 and banned from sports venues for two years.\n\nAnd just last year, five Real Valladolid fans were found guilty for racially abusing Vinicius Jr during a match in 2022. They faced one year in prison and were fined up to €1,620 (£1,412) - but again the prison sentences were suspended as long as they did not attend a football match for three years."

            "content": "For 67 minutes, Nottingham Forest were at risk of making unwanted history. At that point Fenerbahce were 2-0 up and full of belief that they could achieve the miracle their head coach Domenico Tedesco had been manifesting since their 3-0 first-leg defeat in Istanbul.\n\nOnly one team in the history of European competition had lost the first leg of a tie by a three-goal margin at home and advanced. Up in the City Ground directors’ box, Evangelos Marinakis, more than an interested party on that occasion, presumably had flashbacks of Olympiakos suffering a 4-1 home defeat by Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Conference League two years ago, only to triumph 6-1 in Serbia in the second leg.\n\nKerem Akturkoglu scored twice to fuel Fenerbahce’s hopes, his second from the penalty spot almost immediately after the half-time restart, but the Forest substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi struck midway through the second half to extinguish the visitors’ dreams.\n\nForest will learn on Friday whether they will face Midtjylland or Real Betis, both of whom they played in the league phase, in the round of 16. Fenerbahce’s hopes of reaching the Europa League showpiece in May, across town in Besiktas, are over.\n\nThe way this game was set up, an early Fenerbahce goal was always going to shift the dynamic of the tie and the Turkish side got one when Akturkoglu applied the finishing touch to a counterattack. Vítor Pereira acknowledged the worst mistake Forest could make was to assume their place in the round of 16 was secure after last week’s triumph in Istanbul and his much-changed side were disjointed and sloppy.\n\nMurillo, who opened the scoring in style after roaming forward from halfway in Turkey, was uncomfortable and erratic after being shunted across to left-back, with fellow Brazilians Morato and Jair Cunha doing little to inspire confidence at centre-back. Luckily, Stefan Ortega, one of five Forest players to keep their spots, was alert in the Forest goal, saving well from Sidiki Cherif on the verge of half-time.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate.

The flares thrown on to the pitch by the Fenerbahce supporters within 30 seconds of kick-off paused the game for a couple of minutes; the visiting captain, Ismail Yuksek, appeared to plead with the visiting fans to stop. Their actions disrupted the game and it all rather made a mockery of the strict measures enforced on the Forest supporters in Kadikoy, where they had to be bussed into the stadium four hours before kick-off. Fenerbahce’s most loyal followers sensed scope for an almighty comeback, even if Tedesco’s side were injury-ravaged and able to name only seven substitutes.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elliot Anderson shoots narrowly wide against Fenerbahce in the first half. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nForest were in an awkward spot from the moment Dorgeles Nene released Cherif down the right channel in the 22nd minute. Suddenly it was two v two and Forest had been pulled out of position. Cherif played the ball across goal, from right to left towards Akturkoglu and while Neco Williams got the slightest touch after sliding in desperation, the Forest full-back then lost his footing and now the Fenerbahce forward just had Ortega to beat. Pereira scratched his head as the away end went ballistic.\n\nMore flares followed. Elliot Anderson was again Forest’s best player by some distance and blasted a brilliant effort wide of a post from close to the byline but Fenerbahce wanted to seize on the hosts’ vulnerability. Cherif rattled an effort against the side netting after a rare stray Anderson pass meant for Morato and then, in first-half stoppage time, Ortega repelled another Cherif effort, from Akturkoglu’s clever backheel.\n\nView image in fullscreen Fenerbahce fans threw flares on to the pitch and delayed the first half. Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPA\n\nPereira attempted to stem the bleeding with a quadruple half-time substitution, introducing Hudson-Odoi, Ola Aina, Igor Jesus and Ibrahim Sangaré. Yet just 25 seconds after the restart, the Italian referee Maurizio Mariani pointed to the penalty spot after Akturkoglu collapsed in the box. Jair Cunha appeared to make little contact with the Fenerbahce striker but was deemed to have tripped Akturkoglu, who made the most of a clumsy challenge. A video assistant referee check came and went and Atkurkoglu promptly sent Ortega the wrong way from 12 yards.\n\nFenerbahce raced the ball back to the centre circle. Forest were faced with exactly the kind of scenario they must have dreaded, though the fear seemed to galvanise them a little. Jair Cunha and Nicolás Domínguez both sent shots at goal and Williams sent a swerving effort wide.\n\nForest began to command greater control and Pereira cut a relieved figure as his side reestablished a two-goal aggregate buffer, a pair of substitutes combining to devastating effect. Aina chipped the ball towards the back post where Hudson-Odoi got the ball under his spell with a brilliant first touch before twisting past Nelson Semedo, a half-time arrival himself, and prodding his shot into the far corner. Pereira punched the air with both fists and the underlying tensions evaporated. Forest, for so long fraught with nerves, could finally rejoice."

            "content": "Chelsea made a financial loss of £355m in the 2024-25 season, according to new data released by Uefa, the biggest deficit ever recorded by an English football club.\n\nAccording to Uefa, Chelsea’s losses were more than double the ­second-worst in Europe, the £171m posted by Lyon. The figures are also about £260m worse than those posted by the Blues in 2023-24.\n\nWhile Uefa’s report does not fully break down Chelsea’s figures, it does show that while they have spent money on a level with the top clubs in Europe, costs have not been matched by revenues. Chelsea’s wage bill is estimated to be the sixth highest in Europe, at £390m a season. Chelsea’s operational expenditure, or day-to-day costs, were the fifth highest in Europe, meanwhile, at £241m. Uefa also calculates that the Blues have the most expensive squad in history, assembled at a combined cost of over £1.5bn.\n\nIn terms of matchday revenue, however, Chelsea made a reported £1.2m less per game than Liverpool, with Stamford Bridge only the 10th biggest ground in last season’s ­Premier League. Commercial revenue fell year-on-year to £207m, about £165m less than the figure reported by Manchester City and at odds with an overall trend for growth in this area. Chelsea did, though, increase their broadcast revenues, from £167m to £193m thanks in large part to their success at the Club World Cup.\n\nChelsea’s finances have been the subject of debate since the club was taken over by the investment vehicle BlueCo in 2021. The men’s team has largely gone without a front-of-shirt sponsor in the intervening years, while the club have also become known for tying their players to long-term contracts, such as the eight-year deal given to the winger Mykhailo Mudryk, reported to be worth £100,000-a-week. The Ukrainian is serving a provisional ­suspension for doping.\n\nThe ownership have also sold hotels on the club’s grounds to related businesses in order to meet the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules.\n\nAlso on the list of Europe’s ­biggest financial losers are Strasbourg. Ranking at No 8 in Uefa’s list, with reported losses of £69m, the Ligue 1 side are also owned by BlueCo and have spent increasingly substantial figures on transfer fees in the past three seasons. Many of those deals have been struck with Chelsea, including nine transfers from London in this season alone."

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final European fixture as a manager. He created such wonderful memories for Celtic’s support in this domain during his first tenure that departing with a smile felt appropriate. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts. “The evening is nothing to do with me,” said O’Neill with needless self-deprecation.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal inside 30 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered unexpected cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half – the hosts had 24 attempts at goal – but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that is worthy of huge credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have delivered a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite either set of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday at the start of a spell that will define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart had managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ragged and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe only goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. “I got carried away with myself,” O’Neill said later. “I thought ‘we are going to do this here’.”\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate.

The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm clash. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident been as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were only 25 minutes from that maiden win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly cancelled for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious as Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement albeit the officials had ushered him back on to the pitch. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "It is a peculiarity particular to Crystal Palace that a season of such upheaval and unrest could still end up with Oliver Glasner’s side winning another trophy. Having left the pitch after last week’s first leg with supporters calling for the Austrian manager to be sacked in the morning, Maxence Lacroix and Evann Guessand made it a much more harmonious evening for Glasner and his side.\n\nAfter being fortunate to escape from last week’s trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina with a 1-1 draw, it could have been very different if Zrinjski had equalised just before Guessand settled the tie late on. But having been demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League after winning the FA Cup last season, Palace’s first-ever European campaign will continue against either Cypriot side Lanarca – who they lost to during the group stages – or Mainz from Germany in the last 16.\n\n“There is so much noise, so sometimes we really don’t understand it, but maybe I gave some interviews that were not really helpful, I have to admit,” said Glasner in reference to his comments after the first leg when he told fans to “stay humble”.\n\n“I just had to express it otherwise I would have exploded. I can’t do it differently. If I feel something, I have to say it. Then I have to face the shitstorm. Everyone hopefully knows everything I say and do is for the best of Crystal Palace.”\n\nPalace rejected a request from the supporters group responsible for the banner directed against Glasner and the club’s board in their last match against Wolves to turn off the music so they could “back the team during the pre-match warm-up” on the grounds that Uefa’s regulations wouldn’t allow it.\n\nBut the presence of a large group of travelling supporters who took up position two hours before kick-off helped to create a decent atmosphere despite a large number of empty seats in the home sections. “40 quid? Palace fans fleeced = empty seats,” read the latest message that was displayed by the Holmesdale Fanatics during the first half.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

Guessand, who was starting for only the second time since his loan move from Aston Villa after scoring the decisive goal against Wolves, couldn’t take advantage of a mix-up between the goalkeeper Goran Karacic and Igor Savic before the latter blocked Daichi Kamada’s goalbound shot.\n\nView image in fullscreen Crystal Palace fans display a banner protesting against ticket prices. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nThe Palace fans were starting to get on the Portuguese referee’s back after a series of decisions went against their side, with Jaydee Canvot and Stand Larsen both cautioned.\n\nBut in a season where defending set pieces has proved to be a major weakness, Glasner punched the air in delight when Adam Wharton’s pinpoint free-kick was headed in by Lacroix.\n\nThe England midfielder has been showing signs of fatigue in recent weeks but is still capable of providing real quality, as well as the occasional mistake. It was Wharton’s slip that allowed Leo Mikic a first sight of goal for Zrinjski just before half-time but his shot was jeered as it sailed wide.\n\nWharton was withdrawn not long after he had been shown a yellow card for a high boot, with Glasner revealing afterwards that the fourth official had warned he was close to a second booking. “Him and Will Hughes are rotating themselves by fouling too much,” he said.\n\nIsmaïla Sarr headed well over from Tyrick Mitchell’s cross in a rare sight of goal as another of Palace’s issues this season – struggling to break down teams employing a low block – returned. Their best chance of extending the lead was from another set piece and Chris Richards should have done better from close range on two occasions from a couple of Kamada free kicks.\n\nView image in fullscreen Evann Guessand doubles Crystal Palace’s lead in stoppage time. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThere was a warning for Palace that the tie wasn’t over when Zrinjski had a goal correctly ruled out for offside with 25 minutes still to play. Yet it was the hosts who should have wrapped up the victory as the chances came thick and fast. Guessand had a golden opportunity to settle it but saw his shot saved by Karacic and Sarr was also guilty of missing two chances that looked easier to score.\n\nZrinjski’s big moment came in the second minute of injury time but the substitute Tomi Juric could only head over before Guessand finally made sure to send Palace into the next round."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says the salvage operation he has taken on at Tottenham is tougher than he envisaged and most likely his hardest job in management.\n\nThe interim coach, who is preparing for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Fulham, has worked with his new squad since the beginning of last week, having replaced the sacked Thomas Frank. Tudor lost his first game 4-1 at home to Arsenal on Sunday, which left Spurs four points above the relegation zone.\n\nAn alarming fitness situation has improved slightly with the return to training of Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso, meaning Tudor will be without eight injured players at Fulham, plus the suspended Cristian Romero, though Micky van de Ven is expected to be fit.\n\nSpurs are without a win in nine league matches and Tudor’s eyes are wide open about the scale of the task. “Probably, yes … I agree with you,” Tudor said when asked whether the role was more difficult than expected.\n\n“It’s very tough … but it is how it is. So daily work, focus, raising in all things we need to do – physical condition, mental confidence, performance – and waiting for the [injured] players to come back.”\n\nTudor started work as a manager in 2013 and is now in his 12th job. Is Spurs the biggest challenge? “Probably,” he said. “If I recognise the difficulties there are, probably, yes. It’s an even bigger challenge, an even bigger motivation to do this and we do it.”\n\nTudor described Spurs’ plight before the Arsenal game as an “emergency situation” and he warmed to the theme before another derby. “It’s not looking to the style at this moment,” he said. “Because now it’s a question of life and death.\n\n“There is not too much time to think about performance or style. Every game needs to be prepared in that way. How we can take these points, one way or the other?\n\n“In Italy, they use the term ‘have the mentality of a small team’. That is the key, to always have motivation when you play big teams. So that’s the start, of course, and we work a lot on that. The players are aware of the situation.”\n\nLike Frank before him, Tudor refused to use the R word – relegation. “I never used it but not because it’s something too scary or it’s a danger word or we won’t sleep,” he said. “It’s about that we need to refocus on ourselves.”"

We’re looking to build a business, but we’re also looking to learn to see how that might be replicable around the world.”\n\nMasters told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London that Premier League Plus would be offered in partnership with the existing rights holder, Starhub, and would be a “24-seven” service.\n\n“It’s going to be a really exciting product, and the big change is I think that the Premier League will have its own customers and means us delving into things like promotion and pricing,” said Masters. “That’s why it’s an important step for us.”\n\nThe idea of a “Premflix” offering has been speculated on for a number of years. Premier League club owners have backed the idea, with Chelsea’s Todd Boehly telling the FT conference last year that the league should sell its global rights direct to the streaming service Netflix. Instead, the Premier League has gone for a trial approach, with Masters telling an audience of industry insiders that international broadcast revenues had grown by 27% through the latest three-year rights cycle.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Premier League’s Richard Masters says its new app is ‘an important step for us’. Photograph: Jon Super/AP\n\nAlso appearing at the conference was the chair of the Independent Football Regulator, David Kogan. He called on the Premier League and EFL to come to a new “long-term sustainable agreement” over financial redistribution, arguing that it would lead to “less regulation” in the future.\n\nKogan also reaffirmed that parachute payments, which have been a barrier to any resolution between the Premier League and EFL, would come under scrutiny as part of the forthcoming State of the Game review. “Parachute payments are not going to vanish overnight,” Kogan said, “[but] the discussion about parachute payments is a fundamental part of the discussion about distribution.”\n\nThe chair of the EFL, Rick Parry, also speaking at the summit, said that parachute payments had represented 6% of EFL turnover when introduced in 1992, but by the 2018-19 season had reached 173% of turnover. The wage bill of clubs in receipt of the payments was more than double that of the rest of the Championship. “The Premier League chase is the most expensive lottery ticket on the planet,” he said.\n\nKogan said he believed the “backstop” option which would allow the regulator to impose a distribution deal would not need to be activated and that the leagues would come to a deal independently. Masters said that while “we’re all agreed we want a strong pyramid”, he thought “it should be left to the organisations to come up with these agreements”."

            "content": "Senne Lammens revels in the “war” of being Manchester United’s goalkeeper in the hugely physical Premier League yet remains bemused at being applauded when entering a primary school classroom on a Wednesday afternoon.\n\nClearly the 23-year-old is still adjusting to a rocketing career trajectory. Following his £18m transfer from Royal Antwerp on 1 September, Lammens made his debut in the 2-0 win against Sunderland on 4 October, and established himself as the first choice with a faultless start that featured five clean sheets in 21 league games.\n\nTo do so in the relentless glare at United is impressive. In Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton, Lammens was again calm and assured, producing vital saves while navigating the hurly-burly of set pieces and corners as players crowded his goalmouth.\n\nView image in fullscreen Senne Lammens is first to the ball while under pressure from Everton’s Thierno Barry as the United goalkeeper keeps another clean sheet. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n\nLammens shrugs when considering the chaos he faces at dead balls. “Physically Everton was a big battle, a big game so I’m still recovering from that,” Lammens says. “It’s been like this. It’s just the way it is – the Premier League, it’s physicality and a bit of war in the 18-yard box.”\n\nAt 6ft 4in and with a robust frame, the young Belgian is built for the game’s demands. “It’s one of my strengths,” he says, “so sometimes I like the challenge as well. Of course it can get too much sometimes but everyone has to deal with it. It’s not like only one team does it, it’s everyone in general.\n\n“As a goalkeeper you have to get used to that and train for it and get better at it. I’ve been doing a good job at it so I’ll continue to do that. The club said to me that it was the most physical. It’s the best league but the physicality is the biggest difference. We do it as well sometimes, making it hard for the goalkeeper.\n\n“In Belgium it’s less physical but still the principles are the same. Here there are a bit more bodies in front of you, but my team has helped me out with blocking guys. You have to be big and not be pushed around easily.”\n\nLammens suggests that greater protection for keepers may have to be considered. “There have to be certain rules,” he says. “You can’t get to the point where it’s too [unfair]. That’s something the Premier League has to look towards.”\n\nLammens made his debut for Club Brugge in July 2021 before moving to Antwerp two years later. He remained uncapped at senior level for Belgium until November’s 7-0 win over Liechtenstein, replacing one of his heroes. “Thibaut Courtois was always a big thing when I was growing up because his saving is just world class,” Lammens says of the 33-year-old Real Madrid goalkeeper.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘You have to be big and not be pushed around easily,’ says the 23-year-old. Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Shutterstock\n\nBayern Munich’s 39-year-old Manuel Neuer was another source of inspiration. “When I was growing up my biggest idol was probably Neuer,” he says. “I take pride in being an all-around goalkeeper and that’s why I was such a big fan because he didn’t really have a weak point, so that’s something I want to take from him. But I try to learn something from everyone because everyone has strong points.”\n\nLammens is speaking at a Manchester United Foundation event at Partington Central Academy for World Book Day. The surprise at being cheered by pupils draws comparison with being ambushed by paparazzi this month when leaving the Ivy in Manchester after dining with his partner.\n\n“That was one of the more special moments. Special, like I couldn’t believe it. It’s not always the best feeling – they weren’t too bad. But for my girlfriend and I this was the first time with paparazzi. Looking back, it was quite funny. The club warned me that Manchester United is a different animal, especially social media wise.\n\n“It’s a bit new for me, but it’s also probably one of my best feelings when you go into [schools] and see all those children cheering for you and they don’t believe it’s you. Because I was there once in my life, it’s not that long ago. I still remember those times.”\n\nAway from the game, Lammens reads – his favourite book is Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist – and follows other sports. “I don’t really watch a lot of football because on a daily basis you’re doing a lot with football,” he says. “You want to switch off mentally. Of course you still have to watch other people play but everyone has his own experiences so the best learning school is yourself, your own experiences.\n\n“I’m a big sports guy. I love watching other sports and other athletes do their thing. Especially how they prepare for the game and think about their game. Like in the NBA and with, for example, Kobe Bryant or LeBron James.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Lammens with the pupils of Partington Central Academy. Photograph: MUFC\n\nAfter being recommended by Tony Coton, United’s goalkeeping scout, as the replacement for the erratic André Onana, Lammens has developed a rewarding working relationship with Tom Heaton, the third-choice keeper. He served early notice of his quality when gathering a corner with authority against Sunderland. It drew a rousing cheer from the Old Trafford faithful.\n\n“It was really nice getting the support from the fans and my teammates, the best feeling in the beginning. And they also gave me even more confidence to keep going and to make the steps I did after that.”\n\nIn an improving campaign under Michael Carrick that has garnered 16 points from the interim manager’s first six games, Lammens wants to maintain consistency. “I don’t really want to look too much into the past,” he says. “It’s been great but I still have to prove myself every week. I just have to keep going now. It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world but also you have to look through that – it’s still a game of football, the game isn’t that much different.”"

            "content": "A number of European football federations fear they will lose money sending their national teams to the World Cup this summer, with an unusual hike in costs and inconsistencies around tax exemptions among the problems Fifa is being urged to rectify.\n\nAlthough Fifa approved record prize money of £539m for the tournament last December it may not be enough to prevent losses, or reduced profits, for competitors who would usually expect a World Cup to generate vital funds. An investigation by the Guardian and PA Media found particular concerns among football associations about the consequences of missing out on money that would largely be reinvested in local initiatives.\n\nAbout 10 FAs are understood to have shared misgivings between themselves, most recently at Uefa’s annual congress in Brussels a fortnight ago. It has also been informally raised with senior Fifa officials, some of whom appear “embarrassed” about the situation according to an executive from one FA.\n\nTeams that qualify receive $9m (£6.7m) each from Fifa and are handed $1.5m in preparation costs. Those numbers are believed to have been the same for Qatar 2022, but the previous daily allowance of $850 per delegation member has been reduced to $600. One FA estimated that this would mean receiving about $500,000 less if its team remained at the World Cup, which has been expanded in length and number, for a month.\n\nSome FAs have calculated that they will make considerably less money in the US, Canada and Mexico than they did in Qatar; one, a fixture at international tournaments, told the Guardian it will in fact lose a sizeable sum in the event of elimination in the group stage or early in the knockout rounds.\n\nOne particularly aggravating element is a perceived unfairness around tax arrangements. Countries bidding for a World Cup are obliged to provide tax exemptions for FAs that qualify; those have been agreed with Canada and Mexico but no such arrangement has been reached with the US, meaning that nations potentially face vastly differing financial outlooks depending on where they were drawn to play.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Qatar World Cup cost less and was more lucrative for teams, with clear tax arrangements. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nState taxes within the US vary wildly. In California, where Los Angeles and San Francisco will host games, the top rate is 13.3%. In New Jersey, whose MetLife Stadium will stage the final, it stands at 10.75%. Teams largely based in states with lower rates, or outside the US, will find themselves at an advantage financially unless an agreement is reached in the next three and a half months. Given that context, there is also frustration that FAs have been left to seek their own tax advice rather than being given specific assistance by Fifa.\n\nOther factors hiking costs include the tournament’s considerable travel demands, unfavourable exchange rates against the dollar, the well-publicised increase in ticket prices and the event’s duration. In Qatar there were four weeks between the opening game and final; this time around the 28-day mark will arrive as the quarter-finals commence.\n\nWhile some figures acknowledge that FAs are responsible for their own bonus structures, which inevitably make for a notable outlay, they point out it would be unworkable to offer a reduced package to that which was promised to their squads in Qatar. Another mitigation offered for this summer’s problems is the potential longer-term benefit of lengthy exposure to the vast North American market. Fifa was contacted for comment."

I asked how he could leave without having a team to join.\n\n“In Korea we created a team for him to join and then he left.\n\n“He seemed to believe that because the European market is large, he could find a team any time.\n\n“That’s why he wanted to go to a bigger place and live closer to his daughter. But if that’s the case, why not stay here?”\n\nAnnouncing his exit from FC Seoul, Lingard wrote: “This wasn’t an easy decision. My time in South Korea has been unbelievable – the football, the atmosphere, and the passion around this club have been top-class.\n\n“The love, support and the appreciation you have shown towards me for these last two years has been truly amazing.\n\n4 The midfielder posted an emotional goodbye to FC Seoul and their fans after announcing his exit in December Credit: Getty\n\n“Playing football here has been an unforgettable experience and one I will always value.\n\n“I want to thank FC Seoul, my teammates, the staff, and everyone associated at the club for trusting me and welcoming me from day one.\n\n\"I’ll always be grateful for the opportunity to play for such a massive club.”\n\nCorinthians are one of the most recognised non-European clubs in world football having been champions of Brazil on 31 occasions.\n\nThey have also won two FIFA Club World Cups and have previously had iconic players including Socrates, Rivelino, Ronaldo Nazario and Carlos Tevez in their roster."

It was very normal that you have a difficult period and it fell for us at Christmas.\n\n3 Coventry are on course to return to the Premier League for the first time since 2001 Credit: Getty\n\n3 Next season would be the first time the CBS Arena, opened in 2005, would see Premier League football\n\n“You’ve got to show a bit of character to get through it. The boys have really switched on and have deserved to turn this little corner.\n\n“It’s so important we keep our feet on the ground. Everybody don’t get excited again because there’s so many points to play for.”\n\nThe Sky Blues’ quest to secure Premier League football for the first time since 2001, sees them face Stoke City next at the Coventry Building Society Arena on Saturday."

Credit: AFP\n\nEngland won all eight matches without conceding, scoring 22 times in the process.\n\n\n\nTheir group matches across the pond sees them face face Croatia, Ghana and Panama in Group L.\n\nWith stars including Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka to call upon, England are fancied by some to go the distance for the first time since 1966.\n\nAnd while former Premier League goalkeeper Brad Friedel fancies England's chances on the other side of the Atlantic, the American has pinpointed one potential knockout game that could prove problematic for the Euro 2024 finalists.\n\nFriedel backing England\n\n\"I rate England's chances very highly,\" Friedel said on White and Jordan on talkSPORT on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"I think they're one of the one of the best teams going into the tournament.\n\n\"The issue for the English team, the same issues for the Scottish team and some of the other European nations, is the climate and the conditions.\n\n\n\n\"I mean, I think if you look at England's brackets, they could possibly have to play in Mexico City against Mexico.\"\n\nFriedel then issued his warning about the possibility of a 'suffocating' showdown with the tournament co-hosts.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah stage five smog alerts, travel, another time zone change and ridiculous heat. You're talking five elements and a home crowd from Mexico,\" the iconic ex-goalkeeper told White and Jordan.\n\n3 England could play a knockout game in Mexico City Credit: Getty\n\n\"Those will be tough games. Are England better than Mexico? Yes, they absolutely are. Can Mexico get there? I don't know.\n\n\"They've had their own troubles, but those are the type of games that could be hard.\"\n\n'It's suffocating'\n\nFriedel then leant on previous experience about playing in Mexico as he continued: \"It's suffocating. I played there in qualifying and they kicked us off at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.\n\n\n\n\"It's 40 degrees on the pitch, and you can't breathe. You have players on oxygen tanks at half time, like Cobi Jones. He had asthma. He's coughing up black soot out of his lungs at half time.\n\n\"It's hard in these elements, and it's no joke. People will watch the game on TV and wonder, 'Oh wow he looks knackered!'\"\n\n3 Tuchel will hope to lead England to World Cup glory for the first time since 1966 Credit: Getty\n\nEngland will play their first matches of 2026 next month when they face Uruguay and Japan at Wembley during the March international break.\n\nTuchel, who recently signed a new deal through to Euro 2028, will then hope to mastermind victory over Costa Rica in a pre-World Cup friendly before they take on Croatia in their Group L opener on June 17.\n\n\n\nEngland then meet Ghana on June 23 before they round off their group stage campaign with a game against Panama on June 27."

It must have been doing faster than 40mph.”\n\nMoments later, the same witness came across the aftermath.\n\nThey added: “As I drove on I saw smoke and mist in the road and then saw bits of car and realised something had happened.”\n\n\n\nMedical tests later found no evidence of drugs or alcohol in Louie’s system.\n\nThe court heard he had left a “note of intention”, with the coroner recording a conclusion of suicide.\n\nMs Brown concluded: “Louie Day from Brentwood died on September 5, 2025, on the A414 near King Street due to multiple injuries (head, chest and abdomen) sustained as a result of a road traffic collision as the driver and only occupant, leaving a note of intent.\n\n“The conclusion is one of suicide.”\n\nLouie had been training with the Metropolitan Police at the time and was working as a response officer on the East Area Command, based in Barking and Dagenham. He had previously served for two years as a PCSO.\n\n\n\nIn a heartbreaking statement, Louie’s family said: “It is with the greatest sadness that we announce the passing of our son, Louie Day, a beautiful soul who has left this world and will be greatly missed by all who loved him.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“We would now like some privacy to grieve in peace.”\n\nHow to get help EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide It doesn’t discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society – from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers. It’s the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes. And men are three times more likely to take their own life than women. Yet it’s rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now.

I can enjoy life, God is good.”\n\nBut even then, he was not off the hook, as he was being held in Bali’s Immigration Detention Centre before being sent back to Chicago.\n\nKerobokan prison chief Hudi Ismono said at the time: “Tommy was released today. He was sentenced to 18 years and received a sentence cut of 75 months and 120 days.\n\n“He has been in prison for 12 years. We handed him over to Immigration.”\n\nWhen Mack was deported back to the US in 2021, she was arrested by the FBI after landing at Chicago’s O’Hare airport.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nShe later struck a plea deal, pleading guilty to one conspiracy charge while the remaining counts were dropped.\n\nSchaefer was named in that same indictment, and now, after dodging the firing squad and getting out of Bali early, he is finally facing justice on US soil."

            "content": "ON a warm August evening in the sleepy Cambridgeshire town of Soham, school pals Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman set off for a sports centre to buy sweets from a vending machine.\n\nThe ten-year-old best friends — inseparable throughout much of the school holidays — had spent the day together playing computer games and listening to music at a family barbecue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey changed into matching Manchester United shirts and black shorts and posed as Holly’s mum, Nicola, took a photograph. The clock behind them read 5:04pm.\n\nStanding side by side, they wrapped their arms around one another and flashed a smile for the camera that captured so beautifully the innocence of youth at the height of summer.\n\nThe girls ate dinner and left for the sports centre just after 6pm.\n\nNinety minutes after the picture was taken, Holly and Jessica were gone — the victims of a crime that shocked the nation to its core.\n\nBy the time I arrived in Soham, as a young reporter, the photograph of the schoolgirls was on every lamppost, in every shop window and on every front page. The ‘missing’ posters read: “Have you seen Holly and Jessica?”\n\nSoham itself was filled with a palpable unease and an overwhelming fear of an unspeakable evil.\n\nMothers held their children close. They stopped on the high street only to talk with other parents, their faces contorted with anguish and despair on behalf of Holly and Jessica’s parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice carried out fingertip searches and commandeered Soham Village College to brief reporters on a daily basis. I was among those who packed inside for the latest updates.\n\nThe hall was a short walk from the house on College Close where caretaker Ian Huntley and his classroom assistant girlfriend Maxine Carr lived.\n\nHuntley, in navy blue polo shirt and blue trousers, was ever present.\n\nHe held the keys to the college, opened it for the police and even laid out the plastic chairs.\n\nThe child killer would stand at the back of the hall — just a few feet away from us — as officers provided the latest information.\n\nAt the end of the briefings, detectives would occasionally give off-the-record guidance.\n\nI have often thought back to those sweltering summer days in 2002 and wondered, in the midst of the mayhem, just how much Huntley gleaned from his access to the very hall the police were now using.\n\nHe went on to give interviews about how he might have been the last person to speak to Holly and Jessica before they went missing. He told one camera crew that the pair looked “as happy as Larry”.\n\nHuntley even helped a police dog handler search the area outside the hangar building where Holly and Jessica’s United tops were later found.\n\nHe said he could not open it because he did not have the keys.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, pressure on the police was growing. Fresh mounds of earth discovered by a jogger on a nearby hill turned out to be badger sets rather than shallow graves.\n\nHolly and Jessica’s parents stayed awake all night waiting for news before receiving a call dismissing it as a false alarm.\n\nHolly’s dad Kevin said the news had brought them a “glimmer of hope” which would give him and Nicola strength to carry on fighting for their daughter.\n\nWe were obviously fearing the worst but we are still here to carry on the fight and while there is still a glimmer of hope, we shall carry that fight on Holly’s dad Kevin\n\nHe said at the time: “It’s been an incredible roller coaster of a night.\n\n“We found out the news officially at about 6.30am. It’s been extremely upsetting.\n\n“We were obviously fearing the worst but we are still here to carry on the fight and while there is still a glimmer of hope, we shall carry that fight on.”\n\nOn the tenth day of the investigation, Det Supt David Beck made a direct televised appeal to the kidnapper.\n\nHe said: “If the children are still with you or you know where they are, then I would encourage you to contact a solicitor or someone else you can rely on.\n\n\n\n“Try to see beyond the next few hours. Keep in mind your future and the next few days and weeks.\n\n“Get in touch with somebody so that we can all get the girls home safely.” He said he had left a message on Jessica’s mobile with details of how to get in touch.\n\nBrutally murdered\n\nHe remained convinced the girls were alive and well and his appeal followed the release of CCTV pictures showing Holly and Jessica walking through the sports centre car park that Sunday.\n\nLater, the town fell silent as two actresses, aged nine and ten, retraced their last known footsteps for a TV reconstruction.\n\nThey were dressed in the same clothes Holly and Jessica were last seen in and had been given identical haircuts.\n\nHolly’s parents had earlier accompanied police and pointed out the routes the girls usually took while walking through the town centre. The information was combined with the last known sightings of the girls but yielded little new information.\n\nThen came the breakthrough. At 6.46pm on the day she disappeared, Jessica’s mobile phone was turned off, automatically sending a signal to a nearby phone mast.\n\nAnalysis showed the mast that pinged could receive a signal only from three places in Soham — and one of those places was directly outside Huntley’s house.\n\nHuntley was now their prime suspect.\n\nIt was Friday afternoon and I wandered back down to College Close, passing Huntley’s home on my right.\n\n\n\nI looked to the car park on my left and could see Det Chief Insp Andy Hebb sitting in a car with three other colleagues.\n\nMinutes later, they led away Huntley and Carr.\n\nHuntley was taken to Huntingdon police station and initially treated as a witness. He was released under covert surveillance as the focus shifted to the school grounds where he had walked as caretaker.\n\nThat night, after the discovery of the girls’ clothes, shredded and partially burned, he was arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nThe town was in deep shock and mourning for two schoolgirls who went out for sweets but never returned home\n\nI pulled up outside his College Close home — which was now being taken apart by scenes of crime officers under floodlights and was later demolished — and remained there all night.\n\nThe next morning, two bodies were discovered 17 miles away in a drainage ditch close to Lakenheath airbase in Suffolk, a place where Huntley often went plane-spotting.\n\nPolice stood guard at the end of a long, straight road which led to the “deposition site”. My heart sank like a stone. Like every other reporter covering it, I had been consumed for days by the intensive search for Holly and Jessica.\n\nI buried the emotion, focused on the job at hand but knew deep down this would not end well.\n\nI am not going to be blamed for what that thing in that box has done to me or those children Maxine Carr\n\nThe following morning, I drove to the church in Soham ahead of its Sunday morning service and watched as the townsfolk filed inside. In that moment the reality of it all suddenly hit me.\n\n\n\nThe town was in deep shock and mourning for two schoolgirls who went out for sweets but never returned home. Two schoolgirls brutally murdered and then dumped in a ditch where they were left for days.\n\nHuntley was known to have taken a sexual interest in young girls and had been accused of sexual assaults in Grimsby, where he had lived before moving south.\n\nHe and Carr went on trial in 2003 at the Old Bailey. Carr admitted she had covered for him that fateful weekend.\n\nGiving evidence in the witness box, she pointed at Huntley in the dock and shouted: “I am not going to be blamed for what that thing in that box has done to me or those children.”\n\nHuntley, who claimed their deaths were accidental, was convicted by an 11-to-one majority verdict and sentenced to a minimum of 40 years.\n\nCarr — pictured in her police mug shot — was jailed for perverting the course of justice.\n\nShe was released in 2004 and went on to marry in 2014.\n\nShe now lives under a new identity as part of a blanket anonymity order.\n\nWhat happened in Soham 24 years ago will stay with me forever."

I shouldn’t say it, but it’s what he deserves.”\n\nRussell is said to have had a brief argument with Huntley before launching into the assault."

Western areas will turn cloudier later in the afternoon with the odd shower.\n\n\"Sunday will be a cloudy and windy day with rain in the north-west, but it will stay largely dry elsewhere.

However, wintry showers are expected to be confined to northern hills.\n\nThe Met Office forecast for March 3 to 12 states: \"Much of this period looks like being largely dominated by high pressure, especially towards the south or southeast of the UK.\n\n\"This will mean many places seeing plenty of dry weather with variable cloud amounts and some sunshine, the best of this towards the south or southeast, but perhaps with some fog overnight.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"However, frontal systems are still likely to affect the north and west of the UK at times though, maybe also briefly affecting other parts, bringing some rain and strong winds, and perhaps a little snow to the high ground in the north.

Fowkes asked a prison officer: “Is he dead? I hope so.” He described Huntley as a “notorious child killer, both inside prison and in society in general”."

This mechanism exists to guarantee the pension remains aligned with broader living standards.\n\nYearly uplifts take effect each April, coinciding with the beginning of the new financial year.

The headteacher had been working there since September 2022 - but was arrested the following year in April by Lancashire Police's online abuse team after making indecent images of children and being in possession of another extreme pornographic image.\n\nMcDonald was suspended by the school on April 25 before resigning on July 25. He appeared in Preston Crown Court on June 20, 2024, and pleaded guilty to three charges of making an indecent photograph of a child and one of possessing an extreme pornographic image - which involves animals. The offences happened between January 2022 and April 2023.\n\nView 2 Images McDonald worked at Bishop Martin Primary School in Skelmersdale (Image: Google Maps)\n\nOn July 24, 2024, McDonald, of Alexandria Drive, St Annes, was sentenced to a three-year community order with 30 days rehabilitation to participate in a suitable accredited programme. He was also handed a sexual harm prevention order for five years.\n\nA former colleague of McDonald's, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Liverpool Echo that he left the school in 2023 and did not return.\n\nThe Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) report, written following a virtual hearing, said: \"There was no evidence that Mr McDonald’s actions were not deliberate. On the contrary, the evidence was that Mr McDonald had actively clicked on links to images and had retained some of them.\n\n\"There was no evidence that Mr McDonald was acting under extreme duress.\" It added that McDonald \"apologised for his actions and stated he had accepted the consequences\", but this was not enough to mitigate the severity of his crimes.\n\nDecision maker Stuart Blomfield said: \"In my view, it is necessary to impose a prohibition order in order to maintain public confidence in the profession. For these reasons, I have concluded that a prohibition order is proportionate and in the public interest in order to achieve the intended aims of a prohibition order. I have gone on to consider the matter of a review period. In this case, the panel has recommended that no provision should be made for a review period.\n\n\"I have considered the panel’s comments 'The panel found that the seriousness of the offending behaviour that led to the convictions were relevant to Mr McDonald’s ongoing suitability to teach', and that 'The panel was not provided with any evidence to be able to assess the risk of repetition in respect of Mr McDonald's conduct'.\"\n\nHe added: \"These elements are the seriousness of the conduct which related to primary age school children, the lack of full insight and the panel's assessment that it had no evidence upon which to determine the risk of repetition. I consider therefore that allowing for no review period is necessary to maintain public confidence and is proportionate and in the public interest.\"\n\nMr Blomfield concluded in his report: \"This means that Mr Ian McDonald is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or 13 children’s home in England.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"Furthermore, in view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against him, I have decided that Mr McDonald shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of his eligibility to teach.\""

I need to find whoever [has] done this to my son's resting place.\n\n\"I try to help as many families as I can with either justice campaigns or helping families through the charity I set up in his memory and some horrid b*****d has done this... to a baby's grave!

Could you please share this post to make sure the person or persons involved are caught and prosecuted? I'm devastated someone could be so cruel and hurtful to my James.\"\n\nJames was just two years old when he was abducted from the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle, Merseyside by Robert Thompson and Jon Venables - both just 10 years old at the time. The 10-year-olds horrifically tortured and murdered the little boy in a crime that shocked the nation.\n\nView 4 Images CCTV footage of James being led away by Venables and Thompson (Image: Press Association)\n\nThis comes after the heartbroken mum shared a warning to officials about her son's killer Jon Venables.

The murderer has been granted another shot at freedom from prison after he was denied parole in 2023.\n\nDenise told The Mirror that she will warn the board that Venables is \"bigger and stronger\" than he was when he tortured and killed her son. She said: \"The parole board must remember, he’s not a 10-year-old anymore. He’s bigger, he’s stronger, he’s got more wits about him. He’s been educated to lie to his back teeth.\n\n\"My worry is that if he’s released, he’ll lose that protection, he’ll be looking over his shoulder the whole time, he'll have a target on his back. He’s not going to like it in the real world. What is he going to do to get back inside?\""

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The cameras were forced to cut away before medics attended to the fighter.\n\nReplays show that late in the first round, the two boxers clashed heads, with George coming away dazed and shaken.

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "Crystal Palace 2-0 Zrinjski Mostar: Oliver Glasner finally finds the formula in Europe with key tactical change - as Eagles unite Selhurst Park despite chaos engulfing the club\n\nRight when they needed them, Crystal Palace's players stepped up as Oliver Glasner's side kept their European dream alive on a huge night at Selhurst Park.\n\nMaxence Lacroix’s first-half header looked to have been decisive for Palace, but after some nervy moments, Evann Guessand confirmed the victory in injury-time to knock out their plucky Bosnian opponents Zrinjski Mostar.\n\n'It was a good and important win,' Glasner said. 'We learned the lessons from the away leg, controlled the game and waited for the moments.\n\n'Not everything is perfect, but we can see the players are feeling better in the way we are playing.'\n\nThere was no doubt this was the biggest night of the Eagles' season given the way their campaign has started to unravel since Glasner announced in January he would be leaving this summer.\n\n2025-26 had promised so much, but an end to the European journey in February, regardless of the acrimony that has followed the Austrian in recent weeks, would’ve been a disaster.\n\nCrystal Palace dispatched Zrinjski Mostar 2-0 at Selhurst Park to reach the UEFA Conference League last 16\n\nEvann Guessand's 93rd-minute strike followed Maxence Lacroix's first-half header\n\nIt is easy to forget that it is just over two months since Palace, not long off a club record unbeaten run, were in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals and about to enter the FA Cup as holders, but such has been the collapse in their form that this felt enormous.\n\nThat jeopardy was added to by Zrinjski manager Igor Stimac, once of West Ham and Derby.\n\nAt his pre-match press conference, he called out Palace's board for a 'lack of ambition', spoke about their weaknesses, and expressed a desire to add to his own history against the club. Stimac was at Derby when they beat the Eagles to gain promotion to the Premier League in 1996.\n\nDespite the recent chaos that has engulfed Palace and the breakdown in relationship between the fans and Glasner as a result of his repeated public outbursts, the home supporters roared their side on from before kick-off and this was a night where harmony returned to Selhurst Park.\n\n'I'm always honest,' the Austrian added when pressed on his recent words. 'I can’t do it differently.\n\n'If I feel something I say it and then I have to take the s***storm that follows. Hopefully everybody knows what I'm saying is for the success of Crystal Palace. Tonight the support was great.'\n\nPalace had won just two of their last 16 matches in all competitions heading into this clash - including a dire performance in last week's 1-1 draw in Bosnia - yet the energy and intensity that had been lacking during that run was back in the first half.\n\nMuch of their European campaign has been hampered by a failure to break down low blocks, but here they zipped the ball around and pressed with intent.\n\nIt was also notable how much more direct they were in their play and Jorgen Strand Larsen, Daichi Kamada and Guessand all went close early on.\n\nZrinjski were dogged, and Stimac’s side used all the tricks they could to slow Palace down and frustrate them.\n\nCrystal Palace 2-0 Zrinjski Mostar (3-1 aggregate) Crystal Palace (3-4-2-1): Henderson (C) 7; Richards 7.5, Lacroix 8, Canvot 7.5; Munoz 7, Wharton 7.5 (Hughes 56 7), Kamada 7.5, Mitchell 7; Sarr 7, Guessand 8; Strand Larsen 7 (Johnson 73 6) Subs not used: Benitez (GK), Matthews (GK), Clyne, Sosa, Devenny, Rodney, Riad, Pino, Cardines Manager: Oliver Glasner 7 Yellow cards: Canvot, Strand Larsen, Wharton Goals: Lacroix 36, Guessand 90+3 Referee: Luis Godinho 5\n\nYet it was Adam Wharton, one of many players to have struggled during the recent run, who whipped in a delightful free kick for Lacroix, the unsung hero of this side, to head home powerfully.\n\nThe atmosphere ramped up a notch and the question was whether the Eagles could capitalise, but Glasner’s side squandered a host of opportunities and the tension ramped up.\n\nIt almost cost them when Tomi Juric agonisingly headed wide for Zrinjski in injury time, although that left the stage for Guessand to settle things after good link-up play with Brennan Johnson as Palace secured their passage to the last-16.\n\n\n\n'Crystal Palace deserved to go through,' Stimac said. 'They played better football in both games.'"

'It's something I thought about a few years back. I probably would like to own a [football] club. I'm at the end of my career, two to three years maximum.'\n\nIt's now been three years.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Ronaldo's roadmap to retirement has become clearer, and he has done exactly what he said he would do.\n\nRonaldo's ownership dream has come to fruition: he has purchased a 25 per cent stake in Spanish second-division side UD Almeria through his CR7 Sports Investments company.\n\nThe purchase figure hasn't been disclosed, but it marks Ronaldo's return to Spanish football after nine trophy-laden seasons at Real Madrid before he left for Juventus in the summer of 2018.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has taken a step toward retirement after a staggering 24-year-long career\n\nRonaldo, 41, has acquired a 25 per cent stake in Spanish side UD Almeria\n\n'It has been a longtime ambition of mine to contribute to football, beyond the pitch,' the Al-Nassr and Portugal captain said in a statement.\n\n'UD Almeria is a Spanish club with strong foundations and clear potential for growth. I look forward to working alongside the leadership team to support the club's next phase of growth.'\n\nIt is the latest hint that Ronaldo's historic playing career could soon be at an end, with this a clear indication of him setting up a life for when he eventually decides to hang up his boots.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d'Or winner has already stated that the World Cup this summer will 'definitely' be his last, and while he is still 'enjoying the moment' when it comes to playing football, he believes he only has a further year or two left in the legs.\n\nThey are the same legs that he joked he could play 10 further years in just last year, but even the most in-shape 41-year-old you will ever see in football knows that he can't play on forever.\n\nRonaldo has made it clear as day for years now that he has wanted to move into ownership, and the legwork for his new venture arguably began back in 2022 after his acrimonious exit from Manchester United.\n\nReports suggest that Mohamed Al Khereiji, a Saudi businessman, played a role in finalising Ronaldo's big-money move to Al Nassr, and the pair have remained close ever since.\n\nAl Khereiji leads the Saudi investment group, SMC, which last year acquired Almeria from Turki Al-Sheikh, who is a Saudi government official and now plays an influential role in setting up boxing's biggest fights.\n\n'We are very pleased that Cristiano has chosen our club to invest in,' said Al Khereiji. 'He is regarded as the greatest to ever play the game, he knows the Spanish leagues very well and he understands the potential of what we are building here both in terms of the team and the academy.'\n\nFollowing retirement, coaching and punditry are normally the two viable career options for players. It is very rare for ex-players to venture into ownership.\n\nHowever, much like David Beckham, who owns MLS side Inter Miami, and Real Madrid star Kylian Mbappe, who has a majority stake in SM Caen, Ronaldo has both the personal brand and financial power to assume an ownership position.\n\nRonaldo's lucrative career had led him to a stratosphere of his own financially. He is the best-paid player in the sport's history, being paid an annual salary of £177million.\n\nIt is said that he is worth £1.04bn after finance experts Bloomberg took a deep dive into his career earnings, investments and endorsement deals and they were all adjusted for prevailing tax rates and market performance.\n\nThey have previously reported that Ronaldo's astronomical money in Saudi Arabia has 'catapulted him to the top of the rankings for highest-earning sportspeople'.\n\nHe is the first footballer in their new Bloomberg Billionaires Index and they note that his wealth now significantly eclipses long-time rival Lionel Messi after the Argentine opted to move to the US with Inter Miami.\n\nRonaldo's links to Saudi Arabia spanning back to 2022 may have helped him secure his dream of becoming a club owner\n\nRonaldo has a lifetime deal with Nike, reported to be worth £745m in total - by far his biggest agreement with any company. There are partnerships with Tag Heuer, Armani, PokerStars, Samsung, Unilever, Louis Vuitton and many, many more.\n\nHe is also currently building an extraordinary, sprawling complex back home costing £28m, of which the lavish renderings have been shared and is often seen draped in the world's most expensive jewellery and watches, including a Franck Muller Invisible Baguette Diamonds Imperial Tourbillon - worth £1.13m.\n\nRonaldo's longevity, of course, has only helped him add to his fortune, but he's more than happy to splash the cash he's rolling in. While it is yet to be known how much he is investing in Almeria, it's likely to be just pocket money for one of the sport's best-ever players.\n\nHe has also invested in a property on the Portuguese Riviera with the dream of building a 'hospital-sized' mansion in Quinta da Marinha - but the project is over two years behind schedule.\n\nA number of CGI images of what the property might look like when completed have been shared by Ronaldo's supporters, eager for a glimpse of the future, but for now, the project remains a building site, as well as a nuisance to his neighbours.\n\nRonaldo's mansion is set to include a giant glass swimming pool with an underwater walkway, and a master bedroom measuring 1,000 square feet as part of what is believed to be Portugal's most expensive property development.\n\nThe comfortable life of luxury off the pitch shows no sign of slowing down, while he continually builds his portfolio off it.\n\nRonaldo's step into club ownership comes 14 months after he hinted at one day delving into that role at Manchester United.\n\nSpeaking at the Dubai Globe Soccer Awards in December 2024, he said the club's struggles weren't just down to on-pitch issues - with the problems far greater than that.\n\n'[The] Premier League it's the most difficult league in the world,' he said. 'All the teams are good, all the teams fight, all the teams run, all the teams are strong. Football is different right now. There's no easy games any more.\n\n'They need, I said this one year and a half ago, and I will continue to say it: The problem is not the coaches, it's like... I always give this example... it's like an aquarium.\n\n'If you have the fish inside and he's sick and you take him out and you fix the problem and you put him again in an aquarium, you will be sick again. The problem of Manchester United is the same. The problem is not always the coach. It's much more than that.\n\nRonaldo (pictured with fiancee Georgina Rodríguez) has built a life of luxury outside of football due to his fortune\n\nRonaldo is believed to worth £1.04bn which means a small stake in Almeria will likely cost him just pocket change\n\n'If I will be the owner of the club, I will make things clear and adjust things that are bad there.'\n\nThose words followed his TalkTV interview with Piers Morgan in 2021 that served as the final nail in the coffin for his second spell at United, where Ronaldo alleged co-owners Joel and Avram Glazer 'don't care' about the club.\n\n'The owners of the club, the Glazers, they don't care about the club,' he said. 'I mean, professional sport, as you know this, Manchester (United) is a marketing club.\n\n'They will get its money from the marketing - the sport, they don't really care, in my opinion.'\n\n\n\n'You have some things inside the club which don't help Manchester (United) reach the top level as City, Liverpool and even now Arsenal, for example... which is complicated, it's difficult.'"

            "content": "Vitor Pereira's honeymoon period as Nottingham Forest head coach has lasted precisely 225 minutes. That was all it took for the home fans to show their disgust with their team.\n\nThey may have squeezed through to the Europa League last 16 but in Pereira’s third game at the helm, Forest were far from convincing and were booed off at half-time, trailing to Kerem Akturkoglu’s strike.\n\nIt threatened to become worse when Akturkoglu converted a penalty early in the second half but by then Pereira had sent on his main men and one of them, Callum Hudson-Odoi, scored in the 68th minute to seal a 4-2 aggregate victory. Forest will face either Real Betis or FC Midtjylland in the next round – even though they took on both clubs in the league phase.\n\nThanks to their 3-0 first-leg win in Istanbul last week, this should have been a comfortable evening for Forest. But like Nuno Espirito Santo, Ange Postecoglou and Sean Dyche before him, Pereira is learning there is a huge gap in quality between Forest’s best 13 or 14 players, and the rest of the squad.\n\nPereira made six changes to his starting XI and none of those players are likely to be included for Sunday’s crucial Premier League clash at Brighton.\n\nThe travelling Fener fans hurled multiple flares on to the pitch in the first minute, causing a brief stoppage in play. Captain Ismail Yuksek pleaded for calm yet it was Forest who looked jittery.\n\nNottingham Forest survived a second leg scare in the Europa League, before Callum Hudson-Odoi's goal gave the Premier League side a 4-2 win on aggregate against Fenerbahce\n\nVitor Pereira's side had earned a 3-0 win in the first leg away from home, all but sealing the tie\n\nBut Kerem Akturkoglu struck in the 22nd minute of the game to make it 3-1 on aggregate\n\nThe Fenerbahce star then netted from the penalty spot after the break to set up a nervy finish\n\nNerves are one thing, competence is another. When he arrived, Pereira talked about using his whole squad. How does he stick to those words after this? Morato, James McAtee and Lorenzo Lucca looked way out of their depth and Forest were lucky to be only 1-0 down at the interval.\n\nWhen Morato slipped on the halfway line in the 22nd minute, Forest were left two-on-two at the back. Neco Williams failed to cut out Sidiki Cherif’s cross, allowing Akturkoglu to steady himself and finish from close range. Trying to respond immediately, Elliot Anderson collected a pass from Omari Hutchinson and fired a fraction wide from a narrow angle.\n\nCherif – twice – and Akturkoglu failed to profit from Forest mistakes and when the whistle went for half-time, the home fans made their feelings known.\n\nForest made four changes at half-time only for Fener to win a penalty within 25 seconds of the restart when Jair Cunha tripped Akturkoglu and the Turkey international converted confidently from the spot. And when Cunha had the chance to make amends soon afterwards, Tarik Cetin saved his effort.\n\nDespite the second goal, the arrival of first-team regulars Ola Aina, Ibrahim Sangare, Igor Jesus and Callum Hudson-Odoi revived Forest a little, and it was Hudson-Odoi who lowered the collective heart rate inside the City Ground when his angled shot from 10 yards crept into the corner midway through the second half. Igor Jesus and Hutchinson then wasted chances to level it on the night as Forest edged through."

            "content": "Unai Emery gives his backing to Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins as the England international bids to find top form against strugglers Wolves\n\nUnai Emery has backed Ollie Watkins to find his best form in time to haul Aston Villa into next season's Champions League.\n\nWatkins has looked well below-par for much of this season, yet he has still managed eight goals in the league.\n\nYet with Tammy Abraham making an impressive start to his second spell at Villa, Watkins is now under pressure for his starting place for Friday's meeting at Wolves, the Premier League's bottom club.\n\nEven though he chose Jhon Duran and Marcus Rashford ahead of Watkins at different times last season, this term Emery has been unwavering in his support of the 30-year-old.\n\nHe said: 'There are still matches to play and I believe he will achieve his objective, scoring goals and adding more assists.\n\n'We have enough matches to play. Our challenges are collective, but the players must get them by producing individual numbers for the team.\n\nOllie Watkins has rarely found top form yet he has still scored eight times this season\n\n'I have massive respect for Ollie Watkins and massive respect for Tammy Abraham. They are both fantastic strikers.\n\n'Whoever plays tomorrow (Friday), or if they play together, they must perform and focus on our gameplan to achieve three points.\n\n'Our challenge is to help our offensive players score more goals. It's not only about them. It's about the structure we have, to help them to feel comfortable and confident, and create more in the attacking third.'\n\nEmery also warned Villa not to be complacent against the Premier League's bottom club - due to his own winless record at Molineux.\n\nThe Spaniard has never won at Molineux as manager of Arsenal or Villa, losing three of his four games there and drawing the other.\n\n'We've been together three-and-a-half years, and we've drawn twice at Molineux and lost once,' recalled Emery. 'When I was at Arsenal, we were 3-0 down at half-time (before losing 3-1).\n\n'We beat them 1-0 earlier in the season and we didn't deserve to win. They've lost some other games, against Chelsea and Bournemouth, where they haven't deserved to lose.\n\n'In their last home game, they drew with Arsenal, the best team in the Premier League and maybe the world.\n\n\n\n'Everything we have analysed makes us feel it is not an easy game, and it's also a derby. They will want to show what they can do in front of their own fans.'"

Ryan Yates suffers horror finger injury during Nottingham Forest's Europa League clash with Fenerbahce - and plays on anyway!\n\nNottingham Forest captain Ryan Yates suffered a sickening finger injury against Fenerbahce - but played on all the same.\n\nThe midfielder dislocated his pinkie finger after falling and landing awkwardly barely seven minutes into the second leg of Forest's Europa League play-off.\n\nYates, 28, was in clear pain and required immediate attention from Forest's medical team at the City Ground.\n\nTNT Sports considered the incident too grisly to show a replay of due to Yates' finger being bent at a 90-degree angle.\n\nBut the Englishman simply soldiered on from there in a show of toughness.\n\nCommentator Darren Fletcher said: 'The fact he's just gestured to the physio and said, \"Can you come and just sort this out,\" is remarkable.\n\nNottingham Forest captain Ryan Yates dislocated his finger after landing awkwardly during their Europa League clash with Fenerbahce\n\nHe called over medical attention and, once patched up, simply carried on playing\n\n'They'll just stick it back in.

We're not going to show you it because it can put you off your tea.'\n\nForest's fans were impressed by their skipper's determination, with one writing on X: 'Ryan Yates is rock 'ard isn't he?'\n\n'Hard as nails.

            "content": "Chelsea recorded the highest pretax losses in English football history in the 2024-25 season — but club sources insist it will not force them into selling their biggest stars.\n\nThe European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report listed the 10 largest losses for 2025 and revealed how the Blues, who are owned by Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly, booked a €407million deficit. That has only ever been beaten by Barcelona, who fell into a €555m hole from the 2020-21 campaign.\n\nHowever, Chelsea insiders speaking anonymously insisted to Daily Mail Sport that the reported loss does not reflect their true health, saying it is the result of non-cash accounting adjustments as required by UEFA regulations and tied to the acquisition of the Blues. That includes asset impairments, settlements related to historical matters under the previous ownership, and the resolution of legacy contracts.\n\nThose same sources say, after an internal reset, the club is now profitable on an operating basis and aligned with UEFA as they expect to meet all the obligations under their existing settlement agreement with European football’s governing body. They entered into that agreement after previous financial breaches.\n\nCrucially for supporters, Daily Mail Sport has been told there is no requirement for Chelsea to start selling key players such as Cole Palmer or Moises Caicedo in order to meet regulatory thresholds.\n\nWe are assured there is no financial pressure on them to offload any key members of the squad they do not wish to lose this summer, and that their approach to player trading will be strategic rather than reactive.\n\nDespite winning two trophies - including the Club World Cup - last season, Chelsea are thought to have recorded a staggering record pre-tax loss\n\nChelsea have taken to structuring player contracts with performance incentives tied to Champions League participation, which would help cover the cost of missing out on Europe’s elite competition.\n\nNaturally, they do not hope that scenario occurs at the end of this season, with the Blues still in contention for a top-five finish in the Premier League as they travel to face Arsenal this Sunday.\n\nUEFA’s figures covered the 2024-25 season when Chelsea were competing in the Conference League, which they won. They also finished fourth in the Premier League to return to the Champions League before going on to win the Club World Cup in the summer.\n\nChelsea’s creative financing has helped their financial position in the Premier League, such as the infamous internal selling of their women’s team to the club’s parent company. UEFA’s rules are more stringent as they do not take income into account."

            "content": "Ian Wright suggested that some of Tottenham's biggest stars are unwilling to give new interim manager Igor Tudor a chance, after Micky Van de Ven appeared to blank him during the north London derby.\n\nAppointed following the overdue sacking of Thomas Frank earlier this month, Tudor arrived with the challenging brief of ensuring that Spurs avoid relegation.\n\nThe Europa League champions currently sit 16th and only four points away from 18th-placed West Ham - and Tudor's arrival in the capital was made no easier by his first match in charge being the north London derby.\n\nAs Spurs fell 4-1 to Arsenal at home, Tudor was spotted apparently giving vocal instructions to Van de Ven from the sidelines, only for the defender to fail to acknowledge him.\n\nFor Wright, the fact that the players were not eager to engage with their new head coach was a troubling sign.\n\n'Against Arsenal I saw Igor Tudor try to speak to Van de Ven, he blanked him, totally blanked him,' Wright said to his co-hosts on The Overlap's Stick To Football podcast.\n\nIgor Tudor appeared to be ignored by Micky Van de Ven just days into his tenure as Tottenham interim head coach\n\n'That says to me they have checked out already.'\n\nGary Neville thought that Wright's verdict was a 'harsh' one, while Roy Keane argued that the players 'did that with' Frank, but the Arsenal legend was in no mood to back down.\n\n'This guy is new, he wants him to come up and Van de Ven just looks at him and stays there,' Wright continued. 'You think to yourself, that doesn't look good. That does not look good.'\n\nFor his part, Tudor denied conflict between himself and Van de Ven on Thursday afternoon, sharing that he had been addressing the whole team.\n\n'If you watch carefully, I don't speak to him (in that moment),' Tudor said in his pre-Premier League weekend press conference. 'Afterwards, I said to him to come closer, and he comes closer.\n\n'We didn't talk about it because nothing happened. He's a fantastic professional and a fantastic guy, he would not do something like (ignoring me).'\n\nBelgium head coach Roberto Martinez stressed that whatever Tudor can do to ensure Spurs do not spend next season in the Championship, his first order of business should be 'accepting where they are' at this stage in the campaign.\n\n'When I was at Wigan you almost prepared for that last third of the season because that is your opportunity,' Martinez said. 'The last third for us was that we are going to get out of trouble.\n\n'The problem is when you are going into the last third hoping you are not going to get dragged down into a relegation battle because your club wasn't ready for that. This is where it becomes very, very dangerous.\n\nThe stop-gap manager has a challenging task attempting to keep Spurs from the drop - and began his reign with a dismal north London derby\n\n'What happens now is that you should forget about these general terms that \"we shouldn't get dragged down\", what does this mean to a player (looking to hear) \"do I need to run more, less\".\n\n'It is basic language (you use to a player) about everything you can control, \"you have to do 12km, six sprints into the box and run to the near post\". Everything has to be so measurable. It is about winning the next game.'\n\nSpurs' torrid winter has been only exacerbated by a number of injuries to key players leaving their squad painfully short.\n\nBut Martinez was keen to warn that Spurs cannot wait for stars to return and simply expect fortunes to change.\n\n'I think Spurs will get one or two players back from injury, you win a game and then you have got too much (of a gap),' he added.\n\n'The problem is there are no easy games in the Premier League. As a player at Spurs you might think there are easy games we can win, no - there are no easy games. It is about reducing that to, it is the next game and you have an opportunity to get points rather than if you don't win and you are out.\n\n'The moment that the club see it as \"wow, if we don't win...\" - the mindset is so negative and it drags you down. We have seen teams that are \"too good to go down\" go down because they weren't prepared for that final third of the season.'\n\nSpurs will stay in London for their next Premier League test, travelling to Craven Cottage to play Fulham on Sunday."

            "content": "Team USA hockey star Brady Tkachuk has fumed over an AI-doctored video released by the White House that suggests he made a vile comment about Canadians.\n\nTkachuk helped America claim a gold medal at the Winter Olympics in Italy, with a dramatic overtime victory over rivals Canada getting them over the line on Sunday.\n\nAfter becoming Olympic champions, the Ottawa Senators captain joined his national teammates at Donald Trump's State of the Union speech and the White House this week to celebrate their achievement.\n\nYet before he made the trip to Washington, Tkachuk was the subject of a TikTok video shared by the White House that had been altered by AI.\n\nThe clip, which has more than 11 million views on TikTok, was doctored to make it seem like he said about Canadians after Sunday's win: 'They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple-syrup-eating f***s a lesson.'\n\n'Well, it's clearly fake, because it's not my voice, not my lips moving,' Tkachuk said Thursday. 'I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. So, I can't do anything about it.'\n\nUSA hockey star Brady Tkachuk has fumed over an AI-edited video posted by the White House\n\nWarning - strong language below\n\nWhen asked if he enjoyed the video, he added: 'It's not my voice. It's not what I was saying.\n\n'I would never say that. That's not who I am, so I guess I don't like that video because that would never come out of my mouth and never had that thought.'\n\nTrump also sparked controversy after footage of his phone call with the victorious men's team surfaced on social media.\n\nWhile congratulating them on winning gold, the President joked that he was also 'going to have to bring the women's team' to Washington after they too got past Canada in the final.\n\nHe then added that he 'probably would be impeached' if he didn't extend the invitation to America's female hockey champions.\n\nThe women's team subsequently turned down Trump's invitation due to 'scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games.'\n\nAnd Tkachuk said he understood why they could have felt insulted by his locker-room joke, which some have labeled misogynistic.\n\nDonald Trump has sparked outrage in the wake of both the men's and women's team's wins\n\nMembers of the men's Olympic hockey team still attended his address to Congress on Tuesday\n\n'I mean, I get it,' he said before detailing the positive relationship between the men's and women's teams. 'We support them, they support us. You can't control what other people say. It was fun being around them, seeing how they play and the excellence around them.\n\n'If I see one of them, we'll talk about the excitement of what we can control, which is to be gold medalists.'\n\nTkachuk was also accused by some of shouting 'Close the northern border!' during the congratulatory call with Trump, but he stressed: 'It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.'\n\nDuring his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Trump announced that the USA women's team will still be visiting the White House at a later date despite rejecting his first invitation.\n\n\n\n'They beat a fantastic Canadian team in overtime, as everybody saw. As did the American women who will soon be coming to the White House,' he told a filled chamber of Congress."

But if you watch the video, that's not my voice.\n\n\"It’s something that I’d never say. I don’t really know how that kind of took a storm on its own when I play here (in Ottawa) and give everything I have here.\n\n\"I just think that's something that I never thought would happen in my head, and especially would never say.

Asked why they laughed, Tkachuk said: “Honestly, it was just a whirlwind of a moment that (you) can't really control what somebody says, and it's just caught (me) off guard a little bit.\"\n\nWomen's team captain, Hilary Knight, deemed the comment \"distasteful and unfortunate\", which Tkachuk understood, saying: \"I mean, I get it.

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe NHL needs two things for an entertaining trade deadline: demanding contenders who have delusions of Stanley Cup grandeur, and enough teams willing to part with their current players to provide supply.\n\nThere are roughly eight teams that are probably out of the playoff hunt as the March 6 trade deadline approaches.\n\nThe New York Rangers already sent their letter to fans signaling a \"retool\" and traded Artemi Panarin to the Los Angeles Kings. Teams around the league are waiting to see how dramatically the Calgary Flames, St. Louis Blues and Vancouver Canucks compensate for disappointing seasons.\n\nMeanwhile, a change in recent fortunes for some teams might change their thinking. Take the Columbus Blue Jackets, who have surged up the standings under new coach Rick Bowness. A month ago, players like Boone Jenner and Charlie Coyle would have been found in the trade tiers below. Now, it sounds like there's a better chance they could be extended than moved -- or at least kept around for a playoff push.\n\nThis list was compiled through conversations with league executives and other sources, as well as media reports. ESPN insiders, including Emily Kaplan, added their input as well. Salary figures are from PuckPedia.\n\nWith huge names such as Quinn Hughes and Panarin already off the board, let's start with some other shocking possibilities before diving into pending free agents, players with term left on their deals and some glue guys.\n\nJump ahead: Shockers\n\nElite pending free agents\n\nElite forwards with term\n\nElite D-men with term\n\n25-and-under tier\n\nGoalies | Glue guys\n\nShocking possibilities tier\n\nSergei Bobrovsky, G, Florida Panthers\n\nJordan Kyrou, RW, St. Louis Blues\n\nElias Pettersson, C, Vancouver Canucks\n\nMorgan Rielly, D, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nRobert Thomas, C, St. Louis Blues\n\nAlex Tuch, RW, Buffalo Sabres\n\nThe Panthers had an 18% chance of making the playoffs coming out of the break, according to our latest NHL Bubble Watch. Much of that depends on if and when star center Aleksander Barkov returns, and the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions can put together a run to make the postseason, where they'll remain inherently dangerous thanks to a deep roster and, of course, \"Playoff Bob\" Bobrovsky.\n\nBut what if, by the deadline, they decide the math isn't \"mathing\"? Is it possible Bobrovsky becomes someone else's playoff hero? ESPN's Kevin Weekes said it's a situation worth watching, particularly because Bobrovsky is a pending unrestricted free agent who has yet to receive a contract extension. He has two Vezina Trophies and two Stanley Cup wins to his credit. He makes $10 million against the salary cap, but only $6 million actual dollars this season, with trade protection. He's also 37 years old.\n\nWhat do the Panthers want to do here? A short-term contract to backstop a veteran team that's back to full strength next season would seem like one avenue. But they do have 26-year-old Daniil Tarasov -- who, for what it's worth, has outplayed Bobrovsky this season. As Weekes said, this is something to watch.\n\nSergei Bobrovsky backstopped the Panthers to two straight Stanley Cups. Could he be traded? Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nIt's hard to gauge how deep Blues GM Doug Armstrong is willing to cut into his roster during a disastrous season. Is Thomas' name in circulation only because other teams hope that the 26-year-old No. 1 center might become available? Or would the Blues offer up Thomas, provided he waives his trade protection, for the kind of package that could launch a retool? Thomas' contract has an $8.125 million average annual value, but his annual salary declines or plateaus every season after this one.\n\nKyrou would only be shocking because the window seems closed on when the Blues could deal the 27-year-old winger. His no-trade clause started this season, and he remains in St. Louis despite some reports about his availability heading into last season's draft. Kyrou is signed at $8.125 million annually through 2030-31.\n\nAll of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now\n\nIt would be shocking if the Canucks finally did trade Pettersson considering his contract AAV ($11.6 million through 2031-32) and protection (full no-move), as well as the fact that he may no longer be considered an offensive star in the NHL. Even after Vancouver removed the friction of the J.T. Miller situation, Pettersson still hasn't hit his marks: His past two seasons were his lowest in points per game for his career.\n\nRielly is one of several Maple Leafs with trade protection, in his case a full no-movement clause. He's signed through 2029-30 at a $7.5 million AAV. He has 31 points in 54 games, skating 21:34 of ice time per game. Could the Leafs decide to reshape their blue line by convincing the 13-year veteran it's time to move on, as another member of the \"Core Four\" leaves Toronto? As Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment president and CEO Keith Pelley told season-ticket holders on Wednesday in a letter: \"We will do whatever is needed for this team to make the next step.\"\n\nThen there's Tuch. The Sabres are in a playoff seed after 57 games. Tuch has 22 goals and 26 assists in 56 games, playing in every situation and is an absolute catalyst for the team. He's saying things like, \"We're not just going to go for the playoffs, we're going to go for the Cup.\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine Buffalo trading that kind of player while seeking their first postseason berth since 2011, but Tuch and the Sabres have been talking contract for a long, long time with no long-term extension to show for it: first with former GM Kevyn Adams, now with Jarmo Kekalainen. Even without that extension, one assumes the Sabres would be comfortable keeping Tuch through the deadline with the playoffs in reach. But Kekalainen has always been a pragmatist.\n\nElite pending free agent tier\n\nJordan Eberle, RW, Seattle Kraken\n\nPatrik Laine, LW, Montreal Canadiens\n\nEvander Kane, LW, Vancouver Canucks\n\nNick Schmaltz, C, Utah Mammoth\n\nJaden Schwartz, F, Seattle Kraken\n\nKane is going to be traded, and the Canucks are going to gobble up a chunk of his $5.125 million AAV to make it happen. He has a 16-team no-trade list, but the only requirement for Kane to agree to a move to his sixth NHL franchise is that it's a playoff team. The Dallas Stars have been a frequently mentioned fit, but don't discount a move back East for Kane, either.\n\nThe Kraken's playoff bubble is starting to burst, with a 41.2% chance of making the cut in the latest Bubble Watch, buoyed by Money Puck's outlier of a 68.4% probability. So what then happens to their unrestricted free agents, as GM Jason Botterill attempts to put his stamp on the team? Eberle ($4.75 million AAV, no-trade clause) and Schwartz ($5.5 million AAV, limited no-trade clause) seem primed for a move to a contender seeking scoring help on the wing. Eberle is the team captain and leading scorer through 54 games, with 20 goals and 38 points.\n\nplay 0:18 Jordan Eberle tallies goal vs. Devils Jordan Eberle tallies goal vs. Devils\n\nSchmaltz is a funny one. He has clearly endeared himself to Mammoth fans and has played a huge role in their push for a playoff seed with 53 points in 57 games, centering star Clayton Keller. But the 30-year-old is in line for a significant raise from his $5.85 million AAV, and talks haven't exactly been sunshine and roses in the past. Dave Pagnotta of Daily Faceoff noted that last summer, Schmaltz and the Mammoth discussed possible trade destinations where he'd be willing to sign an extension. Given Utah's playoff potential, it likely only makes sense to deal Schmaltz in a \"hockey trade\" for a significant roster upgrade.\n\nWhat is Laine's value right now? He was limited to five games this season due to injury after a nice comeback season in 2024-25 with Montreal (20 goals in 52 games). The Canadiens would obviously have to pick up part of his $8.7 million AAV to facilitate a trade. Laine is nearing a return from the IR. Is there someone who believes in a potential return to form enough to overlook his inability to remain in the lineup?\n\nElite forwards with term tier\n\nBlake Coleman, C, Calgary Flames\n\nJake DeBrusk, LW, Vancouver Canucks\n\nConor Garland, RW, Vancouver Canucks\n\nNazem Kadri, C, Calgary Flames\n\nJonathan Marchessault, C, Nashville Predators\n\nRyan O'Reilly, C, Nashville Predators\n\nBrayden Schenn, C, St. Louis Blues\n\nSteven Stamkos, C, Nashville Predators\n\nRyan Strome, C, Anaheim Ducks\n\nOwen Tippett, RW, Philadelphia Flyers\n\nVincent Trocheck, C, New York Rangers\n\nYou could build two pretty good center groups with the players available in the middle at this deadline -- in theory, at least.\n\nTrocheck wasn't here in our last trade board because the Rangers were still feigning to be a contender at that point. Now that they're in the retool again, it's hard to imagine they won't move Trocheck for the benefit of both parties. He's as versatile a player as you'll find: someone who can average 0.76 points per game over the past two seasons, but also be a key defensive player, a role he served well in helping the United States win Olympic men's hockey gold.\n\nSpeaking of which: More than a few observers around the NHL believe Trocheck will end up with the Minnesota Wild, a team with a need in the middle and a general manager in Bill Guerin who built the aforementioned Team USA. Trocheck has a 12-team no-trade list.\n\nVincent Trocheck played a critical role in Team USA's gold medal run at the Olympics. Erick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n\nThe biggest name here is Stamkos, the 36-year-old star who started the season horrifically (one goal in 14 games) and then caught fire right as the Predators started moving up the standings. He had 16 points in 13 games leading up to the Olympic break and now has 28 goals on the season, proving his worth both to Nashville and the rest of the league. Complicating things is his contract: $8 million annually through 2027-28. \"I have a full-move clause, so I get to make a decision whenever it comes down to that. But I haven't had any conversations about that,\" he told The Athletic recently.\n\nBreaking News from Emily Kaplan Download the ESPN app and enable Emily Kaplan's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here.\n\nThe Predators have two other big names in the middle. Marchessault has a full no-movement clause and makes $5.5 million against the cap annually through 2028-29. He has 17 points in 38 games and has skated to a minus-18 in 38 games. His defensive game has deteriorated in Nashville, but the 2023 Conn Smythe winner can add some offensive pop to a contender.\n\nO'Reilly, Nashville's other Conn Smythe winner, has a friendly cap hit ($4.5 million AAV) on a contract with two years left on it. While the 2019 Cup winner doesn't have trade protection, GM Barry Trotz will work with O'Reilly on finding a preferred destination. O'Reilly has been awesome this season: 20 goals and 36 points in 57 games, winning 55.3% of his faceoffs, on par with his career mark. He's 35 years old but could be a \"final puzzle piece\" guy for the right contender.\n\nKadri is another \"last piece\" guy as a second-line two-way center with snarl, which is what he provided the Colorado Avalanche in winning the Stanley Cup in 2022. The 35-year-old makes $7 million against the cap annually through 2028-29. He has a 13-team no-trade list but didn't exactly shoot down reports that he would be open to working with the Flames to facilitate a swap. Calgary loves what Kadri brings to the team, but the time might have come to maximize his return.\n\nComplicating things: The Flames have only one slot to retain salary, after keeping a percentage in the Rasmus Andersson and Jacob Markstrom trades. If they use that for Kadri, they couldn't use it on Coleman. The 34-year-old forward has two years left at $4.9 million annually, and a 10-team no-trade clause. He has 13 goals in 44 games and can help kill penalties, having won two Stanley Cups with the Lightning.\n\nplay 0:48 Nazem Kadri tallies goal vs. Maple Leafs Nazem Kadri tallies goal vs. Maple Leafs\n\nSchenn has a 15-team no-trade clause, making $6.5 million against the cap annually through 2027-28. He has been in St. Louis for nine seasons and has 24 points in 57 games this season, skating to a ghastly minus-25. That said, the 34-year-old Stanley Cup winner is a coveted player around the league for his leadership, toughness and offensive upside. Assuming the Blues are in seller mode, he'll have plenty of attention and the Blues could get a hefty return for him.\n\nDepending on how deep the trading goes in Vancouver, Garland and DeBrusk could be part of it. Garland hasn't even started the six-year, $36 million deal he signed in July. He has 25 points in 46 games for Vancouver. DeBrusk, 29, has a full no-move clause and five more years on his contract at $5.5 million AAV. He's not having the offensive season he had in 2024-25 (28 goals), but he's a solid winger that can slide into a team's middle six.\n\nIs Tippett's name being out there just noise or something more palpable? His trade protection kicks in during the 2026-27 season. He makes $6.2 million against the cap annually through 2031-32. He has had three straight 20-plus-goal seasons and has 19 goals in 56 games this season. Everything we've heard is that the Flyers might move him in the right \"hockey trade\" to help the club.\n\nWhenever a veteran's ice time dramatically falls, one assumes a trade can't be too far off. Strome, the 32-year-old who has another year left at $5 million AAV, averaged 16:41 last season and is down to 12:05 this season, with eight points in 32 games.\n\nElite defensemen with term tier\n\nJustin Faulk, D, St. Louis Blues\n\nDougie Hamilton, D, New Jersey Devils\n\nRasmus Ristolainen, D, Philadelphia Flyers\n\nMacKenzie Weegar, D, Calgary Flames\n\nTyler Myers, D, Vancouver Canucks\n\nThe Devils were poised to trade Hamilton before Luke Hughes went down with an injury in late January -- please recall Hamilton being scratched in favor of defenseman Johnathan Kovacevic earlier in the month. With their season all but over and Hughes nearly back, one assumes Hamilton Watch begins again.\n\nHe has a 10-team trade list and a $9 million cap hit that the Devils probably have to keep a portion of to facilitate a deal. (Although he's only owed $13.65 million in real dollars over the last two years of his contract.) Hamilton isn't the offensive player that he once was, but he could easily fill someone's need for a veteran puck-moving defenseman on their second pairing. One intriguing possibility: a reunion with the Carolina Hurricanes, whom Hamilton left as a free agent in 2021.\n\nDougie Hamilton has history with the Hurricanes. Gregg Forwerck/NHLI via Getty Images\n\nSpeculation around Weegar has really heated up, as Calgary has reportedly fielded calls about the defenseman but has yet to approach him about a trade. The 32-year-old blueliner is signed through 2030-31 with a $6.25 million annual cap hit and he has a full no-trade clause. He has 20 points in 56 games this season, skating 23:10 per game on average. The Ottawa Senators were rumored to be in the market for Weegar, but he might want someone a bit closer to Cup contention in order to waive for them.\n\nRistolainen might be an alternative to Weegar. The 31-year-old right defenseman has no trade protection and two years left on his deal at $5.1 million AAV. Anthony Di Marco of Daily Faceoff reports an uptick in interest for the Flyers defenseman during the Olympic break, as he was doing his thing for Team Finland.\n\nFaulk has been in St. Louis for seven seasons. He has two years left at $6.5 million AAV (with some trade protection), but his front-loaded contract means he's making $4.5 million in actual dollars this season and next. He has 30 points in 57 games, skating 22:29 per game on average. Three teams to wonder about there: Boston, Detroit and Dallas.\n\nMyers is signed through next season with a minuscule $3 million annual cap hit, but has a no-movement clause that he's reportedly not keen on waiving. One wonders if that would include a potential trade to the Flyers and a reunion with former Canucks head coach Rick Tocchet.\n\nThe 25-and-under tier\n\nBrad Lambert, C, Winnipeg Jets\n\nAlexis Lafreniere, LW, New York Rangers\n\nMason Lohrei, D, Boston Bruins\n\nPavel Mintyukov, D, Anaheim Ducks\n\nBrennan Othmann, LW, New York Rangers\n\nNick Robertson, F, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nBraden Schneider, D, New York Rangers\n\nJesper Wallstedt, G, Minnesota Wild\n\nShane Wright, C, Seattle Kraken\n\nSome of these players aren't likely to move unless it's to bring something significant back to their teams. Players such as Lohrei, Wallstedt and Wright -- whose availability has been trumpeted by Nick Kypreos of Sportsnet -- fit that description.\n\nIt gets a little more complicated for Lafreniere and Schneider, who could end up being part of the solution for whatever the Rangers' retool produces. Schneider is a restricted free agent this summer -- please recall the team traded defenseman K'Andre Miller last summer before having to do the RFA dance with him. Lafreniere, the first overall pick in 2020 who has yet to find another level in his NHL career, is in the first year of a seven-year extension that carries a friendly cap hit ($7.45 million AAV) and an eight-team no-trade list. Othmann is also in this boat.\n\nLambert and Mintyukov have both expressed a desire for a change of scenery. Robertson's tenure has always been tenuous.\n\nThe goalie tier\n\nJordan Binnington, St. Louis Blues\n\nMichael DiPietro, Boston Bruins\n\nElvis Merzlikins, Columbus Blue Jackets\n\nSam Montembeault, Montreal Canadiens\n\nAlex Nedeljkovic, San Jose Sharks\n\nStuart Skinner, Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nThink about this: Canada lost in the gold medal game to the United States -- and no one was saying it was Jordan Binnington's fault? Not many would have predicted that, given all the hand-wringing over the Canadian goaltending depth and Binnington's putrid season in the NHL, where Money Puck had him at minus-24.9 goals saved above expected in 32 games.\n\nHe's a big-game goalie. The Blues won't be playing any of those this season. But teams like the Hurricanes, Oilers, Golden Knights, Canadiens and Ducks all might. Binnington has a 14-team no-trade list and a $6 million AAV. He has one more year on his deal after this one, with his salary dropping to just $4.5 million.\n\nBinnington won the Stanley Cup with St. Louis back in 2019, and has played well in big games for Canada. Brian Babineau/NHLI/Getty Images\n\nMontembeault could move in a trade and has one more year on his contract. Nedeljkovic is a pending UFA for the Sharks and makes $2.5 million.\n\nOne of the most interesting names here: Skinner, whom the Penguins acquired from the Oilers in the Tristan Jarry swap. Does Pittsburgh keep him around for their playoff push or do they trade the pending UFA, hoping that his extensive playoff experience outweighs other concerns for acquiring teams?\n\nHelp up front tier\n\nMichael Bunting, F, Nashville Predators\n\nPaul Cotter, F, New Jersey Devils\n\nJason Dickinson, C, Chicago Blackhawks\n\nWarren Foegele, F, Los Angeles Kings\n\nRyan Hartman, C, Minnesota Wild\n\nErik Haula, C, Nashville Predators\n\nCalle Jarnkrok, F, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nJesperi Kotkaniemi, C, Carolina Hurricanes\n\nAndrew Mangiapane, F, Edmonton Oilers\n\nMatias Maccelli, F, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nIlya Mikheyev, LW, Chicago Blackhawks\n\nGustav Nyquist, F, Winnipeg Jets\n\nEvan Rodrigues, C, Florida Panthers\n\nYegor Sharangovich, F, Calgary Flames\n\nEeli Tolvanen, F, Seattle Kraken\n\nThree players in particular getting buzz lately:\n\nHaula had an outstanding Olympic tournament for Finland, with three goals and three assists in six games, including a big one against Canada in the semifinal. The 34-year-old has a six-team no-trade list and can be a boon to someone's bottom-six forward group.\n\nKings GM Ken Holland basically said that he would \"work the phones\" for Foegele, a nine-year veteran whose been scratched this season a bunch. He had back-to-back 20-goal season prior to this one. He has a 10-team no-trade list and a $3.5 million AAV through next season.\n\nRodrigues was a solid player on the Panthers' back-to-back Stanley Cup winning teams. He has no-trade protection and a $3 million AAV through next season. Sportsnet speculated that the veteran forward could be moved so Florida can create cap space, should the Panthers believe they still have a shot at the playoffs this season.\n\nHelp on the blue line tier\n\nBrandon Carlo, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nIan Cole, Utah Mammoth\n\nMario Ferraro, San Jose Sharks\n\nJohn Klingberg, San Jose Sharkss\n\nTimothy Liljegren, San Jose Sharks\n\nConnor Murphy, Chicago Blackhawks\n\nJamie Oleksiak, Seattle Kraken\n\nLuke Schenn, Winnipeg Jets\n\nBrady Skjei, Nashville Predators\n\nZach Whitecloud, Calgary Flames\n\nIt wouldn't be a proper trade deadline if Schenn's name wasn't floated. The 18-year NHL veteran has played for nine teams in his career, including five since 2021, because he's a quintessential defensive defenseman with two Stanley Cup rings from the Lightning.\n\nThe enhanced ESPN App Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now\n\nAnother strong defensive defenseman is Carlo, whom the Maple Leafs acquired last trade deadline when ... well, when Toronto was in a different mode of contention. Carlo has an eight-team no-trade list with a $3.485 million AAV through next season. They've checked the market on him.\n\nFerraro used to be in our elite tier until enough people told us that was a misclassification. He's likely to remain in San Jose, but he's a pending free agent with a $3.25 million cap hit.\n\nOne more defenseman to watch: Whitecloud, whom Calgary acquired from Vegas in the Rasmus Andersson deal. There's probably a market for a 29-year-old right-shot defenseman with a Stanley Cup ring and a $2.75 million AAV through 2027-28 if the Flames want to explore it.\n\nBargain-beauty contracts tier\n\nSimon Benoit, D, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nTeddy Blueger, C, Vancouver Canucks\n\nErik Gustafsson, D, Detroit Red Wings\n\nDavid Kampf, C, Vancouver Canucks\n\nScott Laughton, C, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nRyan Lomberg, LW, Calgary Flames\n\nBobby McMann, F, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nLukas Reichel, LW, Vancouver Canucks\n\nLogan Stanley, D, Winnipeg Jets\n\nKevin Stenlund, C, Utah Mammoth\n\nOskar Sundqvist, C, St. Louis Blues\n\nAll the players in this tier make $2 million against the cap or less. Their king, Kiefer Sherwood, was traded earlier this season by the Canucks. But Vancouver has three more low-AAV forwards to offer up at the deadline: Blueger ($1.8 million), Kampf ($1.1 million) and Reichel ($1.2 million), who is buried in the AHL but played well for Germany in the Olympics.\n\nThe Leafs have three interesting options, too. Laughton was sought after last trade deadline for having a low cap hit ($1.5 million) with term; now, he's got a low cap hit with an expiring contract. Benoit is a big, physical defenseman who is signed through next season at a $1.35 AAV. But it's McMann who has gotten the most attention. The late bloomer (age 29) is on the verge of a second straight 20-goal season. The versatile forward makes just $1.35 million on an expiring contract. That could help a contender.\n\nAnd there are so many contenders right now. But as the tiers above indicate, there is plenty of supply to meet their demand."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nTORONTO -- The post practice dressing room is a tableau of controlled chaos. Toronto Maple Leafs players skirt each other -- and the local media -- to shed equipment, sip smoothies, share a few laughs and try not to interfere with the staff wiping down skate blades and packing bags.\n\nThe surroundings grow quieter as players slip behind closed doors in search of a meal before heading home. Some linger in the locker room to meet with the media. Through it all, one stall remains empty.\n\nNo. 91, John Tavares, is still on the ice.\n\nIt's been 25 minutes since Leafs coach Craig Berube called it a day. To Tavares, that was merely the end of regulation.\n\n\"John does like to stay out there,\" came an almost apologetic observation from a PR staffer.\n\nFinally, he calls it quits. Those extra minutes on his own are among Tavares' sacred rituals, to stay on top of his physical and mental well-being. Even after 17 years in the NHL, there are skills to hone, shots to perfect, faceoff techniques to fine-tune or details to extract.\n\nThere's an inevitable finish line looming, and Tavares, 35, is determined to keep working hard until the end of his career.\n\n\"I know I've got a lot of good hockey left, but I know I'm not on the front nine,\" Tavares said. \"I think it's just like anything in life, when you mature and you experience things, you just appreciate things more and more. I just continue to love to play. I have that same feeling I did as a kid. The passion, not just for playing and competing, but how you feel once you step on the ice for a game. That's what pushes me forward.\"\n\nTavares has undergone a renaissance in his mid-30s, producing in recent years like he hadn't since arriving in Toronto ahead of a career-best 2018-19 season (47 goals and 88 points in 82 games).\n\nThat recent evolution for Tavares goes beyond what he does on the ice. Tavares is investing more of his time and resources in causes around the city that resonate with him -- such as mental health. For years, Tavares hoped to create a platform where he could leverage his name and status to bring awareness toward issues he believed were not getting enough attention. It took longer than he wanted but that platform would become the John Tavares Foundation, which was established in 2020.\n\nJohn Tavares has eclipsed 500 goals and 1,100 points in his NHL career. Terence Lewis/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nThe summer Tavares landed with the Leafs, he experienced a whirlwind of emotions. He was an unrestricted free agent for the first time and decided not to re-sign with the New York Islanders, who drafted him No. 1 in 2008 and for whom he had played his first nine years in the league. He was going home. To Toronto, where he would become the Leafs' captain one season later. Toronto also was where he could spend the remainder of his playing days chasing a Stanley Cup championship with his hometown team.\n\nIslanders' fans still boo Tavares to this day.\n\nTavares and the Leafs have experienced difficulties in their efforts to hoist that elusive Cup. As part of what was long dubbed the club's \"Core Four\" (with Auston Matthews, William Nylander and former teammate Mitch Marner), Toronto has been an excellent regular-season squad, with playoff appearances in each campaign that Tavares has been on board. But the Leafs have advanced only twice past the first round.\n\nLast season's stumble was especially painful, watching a 2-0 second-round series lead over Florida evaporate on the way to Toronto's elimination in seven games.\n\nThat didn't sit well with Tavares. Losing never does. Deciding the outcome of a game won't ever be solely in his control. But discipline? That's all him. It's why those idiosyncrasies are so important.\n\nBecause the results speak for themselves.\n\nSOME OF TAVARES' BEST WORK in Toronto has come after significant changes in Leafs Land. After Tavares shouldered the Leafs' captaincy for five seasons, GM Brad Treliving asked him to cede that role to Matthews in August 2024. It was an ending to allow for new beginnings.\n\nTavares handed the \"C\" off to Matthews and quietly got back to business. Tavares punched in 38 goals during the 2024-25 season, eclipsing the 30-goal mark for the third time in the past four seasons. He has been a point-per-game contributor in two of his past three campaigns. This season, he had 20 goals and 47 points in 57 games going into the league's Olympic break. And when Tavares scored his 500th career goal on Oct. 29, he became one of only 49 NHL players to hit that mark.\n\nAll of ESPN. All in one place.

When his contract was about to expire last summer, there were several suitors ready to offer him a more sizable deal. But they were in for a letdown. Tavares took a discount to remain in Toronto on a four-year, $17.52 million extension that will take him through the 2028-29 season.\n\nSimultaneously, the veteran also captured the attention of a wider hockey audience. Tavares made the list of 42 invitees to Team Canada's orientation camp last August, leading up to the winter roster reveal for the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. Tavares played for Canada at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, where he sustained a tournament-ending knee injury, but still earned a gold medal with his countrymen. He hoped for another chance to compete, but that those opportunities dwindled when the NHL denied its players an opportunity to participate in the Games in 2018 and 2022.\n\nTavares wasn't selected to the 25-man group for this year's Olympics. It was \"absolutely disappointing\" he wasn't chosen, but Tavares took the rejection with reflection.\n\n\"It was going to be a difficult team to make,\" he said. \"I felt like I was in the conversation. And I was really excited to be invited to the Olympic camp and be on the radar at this stage. It was unfortunate, and it was tough, but there's only so much you control, and so I always say I'm very fortunate that I got to win a gold medal at least once.\"\n\nplay 0:40 John Tavares scores career goal No. 500 John Tavares scores career goal No. 500\n\nIt's a testament to Tavares' preparation that he was considered for the roster. He is known for his multipronged routines that include stretching to light therapy to saunas. While almost every player has a regimen, the sheer volume of what Tavares attempts to keep his mind and body sharp has been a talking point among his peers.\n\n\"I'd heard about it in the past, that he was, like, such a pro with that stuff,\" said Nicolas Roy, who joined the Leafs from Vegas as part of their return trading Marner last June. \"Everything he does is crazy, but seeing it yourself, and actually being his teammate, you appreciate what he does away from [outside] eyes. He's taking care of his body, working out and stretching after practice. For doing everything he can around hockey, he's got to be No. 1 for guys that I've played with. He's the hardest working guy, taking care of all his details.\"\n\nBreaking News from Emily Kaplan Download the ESPN app and enable Emily Kaplan's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here.\n\nDoing so now requires more effort and flexibility for Tavares than in the past. He's a father to three with wife, Aryne, and being present for their family takes precedence over fitting every activity into his workout program. Instead, Tavares focuses on what elements pay the biggest dividends and tacks on any extras he can fit in.\n\nWhether at the office or at home, Tavares has learned to embrace the flow.\n\n\"I try to take a lot of pride in how I take care of myself,\" he said. \"But there's certainly some days with young kids where the randomness of it all just takes over and you have to manage things in a different way. [Sleep] is always priority No. 1 -- get to bed at a good time so you can get a good night's rest. That's your mental clarity and energy for recovery. After that, it's my hydration and my nutrition. If I can add anything to that, it's some of the body movement stuff to stay primed and ready for the gym or to get on the ice. That's really important to me, too.\"\n\nTavares has had an impressive scoring touch in recent seasons, perhaps due to his focus on taking care of himself mentally and physically. Alika Jenner/Getty Images\n\nTavares' obsession with longevity extends beyond what he does to be game-ready. For years before he landed in Toronto, there was the thought put into the totality of his legacy inside and outside the sport. What more could Tavares do with his name and platform that would keep him inspired and serve communities and causes that drew his attention?\n\nThe questions sparked a conversation between the Tavares and Aryne, back when he was still suiting up on Long Island and before the couple had children. The high school sweethearts had connected early over their shared love of children and the Special Olympics; giving back had been a tentpole of their relationship. They discussed how to create a charitable arm that could help represent some of the people and causes closest to their hearts. They drafted designs and logos for a still-hypothetical foundation. Their passion project was starting to take shape.\n\nTiming was an issue. Tavares was then a looming free agent. It didn't make sense to go through the process of building out their vision until Tavares signed his next deal and knew what laws of state or country they would reside. Once he and Ayrne were committed to Toronto in 2018 -- and officially to one another with a wedding that summer -- bringing the foundation to life was next on their list.\n\nAfter jumping through hoops necessitated by the Canadian Revenue Agency -- an operation that took more than a year to complete -- The John Tavares Foundation was set to make its debut.\n\nThe universe had other plans.\n\n\"We were all ready to launch, like 'OK, let's put this in motion,'\" Aryne recalled. \"And then we were held off again because suddenly everyone was asking, 'What is COVID?'\"\n\nARYNE'S FINGERPRINTS ARE all over the foundation. The former physiotherapist left her job after the birth of their second son to become the full-time, volunteer CEO of the Tavares' family foundation in 2020. She is their \"heartbeat,\" the one wearing multiple hats and making decisions while her husband is often away during hockey season.\n\nThe nature of her work is credit enough for Aryne -- even if it's rarely simple. That was evident from the get-go with the world shutting down right when their foundation was opening.\n\n\"All any of us could do was figure out, 'What is this pandemic? What does this mean?,'\" she said. \"In order to run a foundation, you have to bring in dollars. If you can't bring in dollars, you can't host events. And you use your time and your person ... John as a physical person ... to bring in money, to be able to support programs and other initiatives and all that. So that was a bit of an interesting time.\"\n\nAryne and her team of volunteers figured out how to press on, and she and Tavares continued to pursue partnerships that resonated with their values.\n\nMost recently, that was coming together with The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Canada's largest mental health teaching hospital and a leading research center. The Tavares' passion for aiding children, in particular, drew them to collaborate with CAMH in December, when the John Tavares Foundation donated to CAMH's work with youths.\n\nWhile visiting the center, there was one person capturing the Tavares' attention for how he and his family were navigating a difficult diagnosis with help from CAMH.\n\n\"We had a fellow named Alex who stood up with his mom and told us their story and their experience with CAMH,\" Aryne said. \"It was so touching. Alex had said he came to CAMH because he wasn't in control of his mind. And your mind is such a powerful tool. If you don't know how to use it properly, or it's not being used properly, you can't make that physical connection with the body. His mom said she was just struggling because she could see Alex [hurting]. And as a mom, you trust your intuition, your gut, and it was like, 'How do I fix this?' She didn't have the tools, but CAMH provided her with all those.\"\n\nAdded Tavares: \"It was just amazing to see someone who was going through some pretty significant mental health challenges being able to speak about his experience at CAMH and basically how in some ways it saved his life. Certainly, it changed his life, and how optimistic and positive he is now about how he is living day to day, how he manages some of the things that he had to deal with...you could see the joy they have now.\"\n\nTalking about feelings with their own children is an important pillar for the Tavares' family. In his own work life, Tavares acknowledges a shift too in being able to articulate problems less apparent than a broken arm or torn ACL.\n\n\"There's more recognition now,\" he said. \"We see the challenges anyone can face in daily life. We recognize certain signs now. It's continued to improve and get better.\"\n\nTHE FOCUS ON PLAYERS' mental health has been long overdue. The stigma surrounding mental health hasn't completely eviscerated, but it has lessened because players are stepping forward to discuss it. Carey Price entered the NHL/NHLPA's player assistance program in 2021 to address his mental health, and Samuel Girard did the same in 2023. Edmonton's Sam Poulin has been vocal about seeking help.\n\nIn December, Ottawa Senators' goaltender Linus Ullmark entered the player assistance program. In an interview with TSN's Claire Hanna in January, Ullmark said his mental health had been \"piling on\" until it ultimately \"overflowed\" after he was pulled from a game on Dec. 27 in Toronto.\n\n\"I was not myself,\" Ullmark told Hanna. \"As soon as that game was over, I called [player assistant program] Dr. [Joel] Gold and I said, 'Hey, I'm f---ed up. I need help.' And together with the program, together with the organization, we set up a plan and I went through the motions and I took the absence of leave.\"\n\nLinus Ullmark took a leave of absence from the Senators following a game on Dec. 29, returning to action on Jan. 31. Richard A. Whittaker/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nUllmark's departure prompted speculation online. Several rumors Ullmark heard involved attacks on his family. That reaction to him stepping away underscored for Ullmark why discussing mental health has been taboo in sports circles and why he felt compelled to speak out.\n\n\"People wonder why hockey players -- professional athletes -- are not talking,\" Ullmark told Hanna. \"Why we're not showing any sort of emotions? Why mental health in men and in women are a stigma? This is just the proof I have now that I understand why people are shutting themselves in and tend to do other things than to ask for help.\"\n\nThe enhanced ESPN App Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now\n\nThe NHLPA doesn't provide figures on how many players have entered its program. Tavares can attest colloquially about a recent change when it comes to player empowerment to take care of their mental health as well as they do their bodies.\n\n\"There is much better awareness in knowing the importance of being able to ask for help, that it is OK,\" Tavares said. \"That doesn't mean it can't be a very difficult thing to do, especially as a professional athlete, when you're playing physically in a demanding sport and guys want to seem like they are pretty tough. Guys take a lot of pride in being able to play through injuries or manage the physical nature of the game, the bumps and bruises will come with that, but there's a lot of things that you deal with internally that can be challenging at times, and it's OK to recognize that, to ask for help and to seek out resources and things that can help support you.\"\n\nAryne has an outsider's perspective on the mental health narrative for athletes -- except when it comes to Tavares' self-help methods -- but it is apparent to her how this generation of players is more evolved in how they protect themselves and their teammates.\n\n\"Before, it was all 'push it aside, push through, bury it,' and that's just very unhealthy,\" she said. \"I just don't think [the topic] came up enough. I don't think players were just voluntarily saying, 'I need to take a mental break here,' or 'I need help.' It's very hard for anybody to be able to say that. And I think that's part of just breaking the stigma, and that's one of the biggest things that CAMH has tried to do. And then we're obviously helping to hopefully shed light on it and break that just as much as they are.\"\n\nBecoming a father was integral to how Tavares approaches his rough patches in a high-pressure career. As with most things, Tavares puts in the effort to keep himself balanced mentally.\n\n\"John controls his emotions very well,\" Aryne said. \"Over the years, he's matured and been able to see the game as it is. Coming home now with kids is even better for him because you can't just go over [a loss] in your head. The kids just bring a little bit of light and laughter and smiling and all these things that just help you heal, help you feel lighter. He does a great job at managing his mental load and mental performance, and when he does seem overwhelmed, he manages that in his own private ways, which are very good.\"\n\nTavares' family life has helped put his \"day job\" in perspective. Mark Blinch/NHLI via Getty Images\n\nThey've had to be particularly strong this season, given how the Leafs have floundered. Toronto entered the Olympic break seventh in the Atlantic Division and six points out of the Eastern Conference's second wild-card spot. There is a long road ahead for Tavares & Co. to find their way back into the playoff picture. Tavares is looking for an individual reset as well, having only two goals and four points in his past eight games.\n\nThe pause was an opportunity to reset physically and mentally. Tavares said he can see the bigger picture of it all more clearly now. Hockey is a part of life but not the root of his purpose. That's through introducing what he does to loved ones -- and investing in people and places that are helping reshape and redefine the world around them.\n\n\"It's been a real blessing to be where I'm at and have a young family and share the game with my kids,\" Tavares said. \"You're always trying to get a little better, stay sharp, so you can do it [for them] as long as you can. And you look at what we're doing [at the foundation], to help people find the tools and resources to maximize who they are and their potential and to have a life they feel that they can thrive in and become who they want to become. We're really proud to bring awareness to what [places like CAMH] do. It's our privilege.\""

(2:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Miami Dolphins ranked first overall in the NFL Players Association annual report cards, according to survey results obtained by ESPN. The Minnesota Vikings finished second overall in 2026, followed by the Washington Commanders in third.\n\nRegarding the Dolphins, the NFLPA survey wrote: \"Players consistently describe the organization as 'the best in the NFL.'\"\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished in last place for the first time in the four-year history of the union's survey. Last year, the Steelers ranked 28th. The Arizona Cardinals finished 31st in the 2026 survey, after a last-place finish in 2025, and the Cleveland Browns finished in 30th, the same as in 2025.\n\nThe NFLPA is not making the report cards public this year following a grievance filed by the NFL, which claimed the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. Earlier this month, an arbitrator agreed with the league, saying the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses for report cards even if it can't publish them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment. An NFL spokesperson also declined to comment, saying that as in previous years, the league had no knowledge of the survey.\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A-plus to F-minus on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and it was conducted from Nov. 2 to Dec. 11.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" the survey said.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest-rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" the survey said. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers' locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers' training room lacks updated recovery technology and \"modalities.\" Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, though the training staff ranked first.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A-plus to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the survey. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nBrady Tkachuk, the Ottawa Senators captain and a Team USA gold medalist, said he didn't appreciate the AI-doctored video released by the White House that made it appear he was disparaging Canadians.\n\nThe video, published Sunday by the White House's official TikTok account, featured doctored footage from a Tkachuk brothers' news conference at the 4 Nations Face-Off last February. While \"Free Bird,\" the goal song for Team USA, played in the background of the video, Brady Tkachuk was made to say, \"They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple syrup eating f---s a lesson.\"\n\nThe clip, which discloses that it used AI-generated media, has 11.1 million views on TikTok and has been widely viewed on other social media platforms.\n\n\"Well, it's clearly fake, because it's not my voice, not my lips moving,\" Tkachuk said Thursday in his first media availability in Ottawa since the U.S. defeated Canada for the gold medal in men's Olympic ice hockey in Milan. \"I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. So, I can't do anything about it.\"\n\nTkachuk was asked if he enjoyed the video.\n\n\"It's not my voice. It's not what I was saying,\" he said. \"I would never say that. That's not who I am, so I guess I don't like that video because that would never come out of my mouth, and never had that thought.\"\n\nTkachuk also addressed what he didn't say during Team USA's locker room celebration. Some on social media accused Tkachuk of being the person who shouted, \"Close the northern border!\" during Team USA's congratulatory call with President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I've been seeing stuff that people think it's me. But if you watch the video, it's not my voice or something that I never say,\" Tkachuk said. \"I don't know how that took a storm on its own when I give everything I have here.\n\n\"It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.\"\n\nOn that call, Trump made a widely circulated comment about the U.S. women's hockey team, which also won Olympic gold.\n\nWhen Trump extended an invitation to the men's players to come to Washington for the State of the Union address, he said: \"I must tell you, we're going to have to bring the women's team, you do know that,\" adding with a laugh that if he didn't also invite the women's team, \"I do believe I probably would be impeached.\" Some players laughed along with the joke.\n\nTeam USA star Hilary Knight said Wednesday on \"SportsCenter\" that she thought it was a \"distasteful\" joke that \"unfortunately is overshadowing\" the success her team had in Milan. Boston Bruins goalie Jeremy Swayman, a member of Team USA, said Wednesday that \"we should've reacted differently.\"\n\nLike other American players, Tkachuk detailed a positive relationship between the men's and women's teams in the Olympics, from attending each other's games to hanging out at 3 a.m. in the Olympic Village café after the men returned as champions.\n\nTkachuk said he understood why women's players could feel insulted by that comment.\n\n\"I mean, I get it,\" he said. \"We support them, they support us. You can't control what other people say. It was fun being around them, seeing how they play and the excellence around them.\n\n\"If I see one of them, we'll talk about the excitement of what we can control, which is to be gold medalists.\"\n\nAs for why the men's team laughed at Trump's comment, Tkachuk said the players were \"caught off guard\" a little bit.\n\n\"I don't really have an answer. It's a whirlwind of a moment,\" he said. \"You can't control what somebody says. I guess got caught off guard a little bit. You're talking to the president 10 minutes after you achieve your dream.\"\n\nBrady Tkachuk is one of five Team USA players whose NHL clubs are based in Canada. He partied in Miami with his teammates and then attended the State of the Union Address in Washington before returning to Ottawa.\n\n\"It was special,\" he said. \"Being an American citizen, you never really think you're going to see the White House and be in the Oval Office.\"\n\nBut Tkachuk noted the awkwardness of helping the U.S. defeat Canada for the gold medal while being the captain for a team in Canada's capital, a position he has held the past five seasons in Ottawa.\n\n\"It's just such a passionate fan base,\" he said. \"I said this after 4 Nations: It's a unique feeling when every single day the support from this fan base and then for three weeks they're not cheering for you. It's a crazy feeling.\n\n\"I've given absolutely everything I have as an Ottawa Senator. When you represent the U.S., it's about being an American. It's an honor. There's only three teams that ever won the gold medal. I wanted to achieve my childhood dream and bring a gold medal back to the U.S.\""

(2:13)\n\nChris Bosh said that he's \"lucky to be alive\" after a recent health scare that resulted in him waking up \"covered in my own blood.\"\n\nThe Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer shared details of the event in a social media video over two minutes long on Wednesday.\n\n\"It was crazy. It was fast. It was instant. There was no warning. I didn't have any time to prepare for it,\" he said. \"I was getting ready to go on a date with my wife and the next thing you know I was on the ground.\"\n\nBosh, who retired from the NBA in February 2019 because of blood clot issues, declined to go into specifics in the video and when reached by ESPN's Brian Windhorst. He said that he's still recovering and won't try to hide it, showing the lack of blood under his eyes.\n\nBosh explained that he has no recollection or memory of what happened and that \"it was just darkness.\" The scary moment led to him having a different outlook on life. Whether it's wanting to go on vacation or starting a business, he emphasized not waiting to take action before it's too late.\n\n\"No matter what it is, make sure you don't wait. That's the thing that I get from this. Don't wait to take action because it could come fast. It could come quick. And I'm lucky to be alive, and I feel great about that,\" he said. \"And now I'm thinking about how I live my day-to-day life. That's really it. But don't wait.\"\n\nThe former Miami Heat star first dealt with a blood clot in February 2015, when a clot formed in one of his legs and traveled to a lung, leading to a multiday hospitalization. He was released from the hospital and wound up playing 53 games in the 2015-16 season -- the final campaign of his 13-year NBA career.\n\nBosh was diagnosed with a second blood clot in his leg in February 2016 and missed the remainder of the season. He revealed in \"Rebuilt,\" his documentary released that September, that Heat doctors told him his basketball career was \"probably over\" after the second diagnosis.\n\nHe intended to play in the 2016-17 season, but the Heat, where Bosh played for six seasons, failed him for a physical ahead of training camp. Miami officially waived him July 4, 2017, then retired his No. 1 jersey March 26, 2019.\n\nBosh won two championships with the Heat and averaged 19.2 points and 8.5 rebounds across his NBA career. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2021 and reflected on his early retirement during his speech.\n\n\"After finally making it to the mountaintop with so much more to do, in my mind, so much more work to do, it all stopped,\" he said. \"I eventually came to realize that we all have it in our power to make the most out of every day despite what happens, to turn setbacks into strengths.\""

            "content": "Adam Schefter breaks down the Jets' decision to trade Jermaine Johnson to the Titans for T'Vondre Sweat. (1:03)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nThe Jets and Titans agreed to a rare player-for-player trade Thursday, with New York sending pass rusher Jermaine Johnson to Tennessee for defensive tackle T'Vondre Sweat, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nThe trade can't be processed until the start of the league year on March 11.\n\nThe deal marks the latest move in a protracted teardown of a once-formidable defense for the Jets, who also traded away defensive stars Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams -- both former first-round draft picks -- in November.\n\nEight of the Jets' 11 first-round picks from 2015 to 2022 have been traded.\n\nJohnson acknowledged the trade in a social media post later Thursday, saying New York \"will always hold a special place in my heart.\"\n\nNew York, thank you for everything truly. The love I've been shown here for the past 4-5 years has been nothing short of amazing, both on and off the field. Y'all will always hold a special place in my heart. Wish all of my former coaches and former teammates the best!! Thank all... — Jermaine Johnson II (@ii_jermaine) February 26, 2026\n\nJohnson will be reunited with Titans coach Robert Saleh, who coached the Jets when they selected Johnson with the 26th overall pick in the 2022 draft.\n\nJohnson also will once again play under new Titans defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton, who was his position coach with the Jets his first three seasons.\n\nJohnson, coming off a down year (three sacks), has only one year remaining on his contract and is due to make a guaranteed $13.4 million in 2026, the amount of his fifth-year option.\n\nJohnson generated interest last season before the trade deadline, but the Jets opted to keep him for the remainder of the season. His departure reinforces the belief that the Jets will take an edge player with the No. 2 pick in this year's draft, with Ohio State's Arvell Reese and Texas Tech's David Bailey as the leading candidates.\n\nIn Sweat, the Jets are getting a 6-foot-2, 366-pound interior presence on a team-friendly contract. A second-round pick in 2024, he is signed through 2027 and will count only $1.7 million on the Jets' salary cap.\n\nScheme factored into the trade for both teams. The Jets, who could be using more 3-4 fronts, wanted to add more size up front. The opposite is true for Tennessee, where Saleh's scheme puts a premium on smaller, faster linemen.\n\nSweat, drafted 38th overall in 2024, posted 85 tackles and three sacks in 29 games for the Titans. He suffered an ankle injury in Tennessee's season-opening loss to the Broncos and missed five games last season.\n\nThe Titans are counting on Johnson regaining his form from 2023, when he posted a career-high 7.5 sacks and was named to the Pro Bowl as an injury replacement. His 2024 season didn't last long. In Week 2, at Tennessee, he tore an Achilles tendon and missed the remainder of the season.\n\nJohnson rehabbed to make it back for the start of the 2025 season, but he didn't have the same burst as before the injury. In 14 games, he finished with only three sacks and six quarterback hits, later admitting his performance wasn't up to his standard. Both he and the team acknowledged that the Achilles injury probably affected his performance.\n\nIn four seasons -- 47 games -- with the Jets, Johnson has 13 sacks and 131 tackles.\n\nESPN's Turron Davenport contributed to this report."

The post said the event was being held to honor the women's hockey team and other female athletes, with details to follow. The message featured a picture of the U.S. women's hockey players celebrating in a circle.\n\nA publicist for Flavor Flav confirmed the event without providing further details.\n\nThe women's players worked on their own to accept the invitation, without input from USA Hockey, a person familiar with discussions told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private.\n\nThe person added that while the team is excited to attend, it's unclear if the entire 23-player roster will be on hand because of potential scheduling conflicts.\n\nThe team has yet to determine whether to visit the White House after USA Hockey cited logistics and travel issues in politely declining President Donald Trump's invitation to join the U.S. men's gold medal-winning team at his State of the Union speech on Tuesday.\n\nFlavor Flav is a longtime supporter of women's sports and attended various Olympic competitions this month. He posted his invitation on Monday, shortly after the women turned down the trip to Washington.\n\n\"If the USA Women's Hockey team wants a real celebration and invite ,,, I'll host them in Las Vegas. Do some nice dinners and shows and good times,\" he wrote. \"I'm sure I can get a hotel and airline to help me out here and celebrate these women for real for real.\"\n\nThe event came together quickly after that. Brands swarmed the comments expressing interest: \"Let's talk,\" said a reply from Alaska Airlines.\n\nThe GIST, which prides itself on providing equal coverage to men's and women's sports and reaches roughly 1 million newsletter subscribers, will serve as the official media and content partner for the weekend, co-founder Jacie deHoop said. The company had reached out to the rapper after seeing his post.\n\nAccording to deHoop, the celebration was born as a direct response to Trump's joke on a phone call to the victorious men's team that he would also have to invite the women to the White House or face impeachment.\n\n\"It was really disheartening to see,\" deHoop said. \"I think it definitely came across as that the women's team is an afterthought, and I think women's sports has been in this position too many times where the women have to play second fiddle and are being treated as kind of second-class citizens.\"\n\nThe women's team was originally scheduled to fly commercially to New York on Monday, but was forced to reroute through Atlanta because of a snowstorm in the Northeast. The timing and storm made it difficult for the women to change plans as they returned to their Professional Women's Hockey League and college teams.\n\nTeam USA won gold after beating Canada in the Women's Ice Hockey final. EPA/FAZRY ISMAIL\n\nThe PWHL schedule resumed on Thursday with Montreal playing at New York following a monthlong Olympic break, while college players open their conference playoffs this weekend.\n\nTrump said Tuesday night that plans were in the works to have the women's team visit the White House, though it's unclear when that could happen, USA Hockey said. The earliest the team could travel to Washington would be in late spring after the conclusion of the PWHL season.\n\nThe president initially invited the women late Sunday, when he called to congratulate the men for their 2-1 overtime win over Canada. The women's team was still in Milan, three days after also beating Canada 2-1 in overtime.\n\n\"We're going to have to bring the women's team, you do know that,\" Trump said to the men's team.\n\nU.S. women's captain Hilary Knight on Wednesday referred to the comment as \"distasteful and unfortunate.\"\n\n\"I think just the way women are represented, it's a great teaching point and really shines light on how women should be championed for their amazing feats,\" she said."

            "content": "Adam Schefter joins \"SportsCenter\" and breaks the news that the Indianapolis Colts have given Anthony Richardson permission to seek a trade. (1:00)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- The Colts have given quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr. permission to seek a trade, his agent told ESPN on Thursday, the latest twist in the young player's complicated career.\n\nRichardson lost a preseason position battle with veteran Daniel Jones before last season, relegating him to the No. 2 spot. Now, with the Colts committed to trying to re-sign Jones as their starter for the foreseeable future, Richardson faces an uncertain path forward in Indianapolis.\n\nAgent Deiric Jackson having the ability to explore a trade gives Richardson the potential of finding a new start after three tumultuous seasons in Indianapolis. The 2023 fourth overall draft pick has started 15 games for the Colts, throwing 11 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Injuries have stymied him throughout his career, with Richardson missing 13 games after shoulder surgery as a rookie in 2023 and four games to multiple injuries in 2024.\n\nLast season, Richardson sustained a fractured orbital bone in a freak pregame warmup incident. That injury left Richardson on injured reserve, where he finished the season.\n\nRichardson, who is still just 23, had his vision impacted by the injury. But recent consultations with doctors indicate his vision has been restored, Jackson said. One physician noted his vision in a recent test to be 20/20 when using both eyes.\n\nColts general manager Chris Ballard said Tuesday that the vision issues were \"trending in the right direction\" and that Richardson was \"cleared to play.\" But he did not indicate the issues were fully resolved.\n\nThe Colts are expected to move forward this year with Jones and 2025 draft pick Riley Leonard at 1 and 2, respectively, on their quarterback depth chart. Jones sustained a torn Achilles tendon in early December but is on schedule to return for the start of next season, Ballard said this week. Jones is a pending free agent, but Ballard said Tuesday that he remains hopeful the Colts can re-sign him to a new deal without having to use the franchise tag.\n\nBallard said \"I still believe in Anthony\" when asked about the player's future this week, but it has been clear for quite some time that Richardson did not have a clear role with the team in 2026. The Colts' decision to bench him temporarily in 2024 undermined their statements about their belief in him. And the decision to go out and sign Jones as a free agent last spring created additional doubt about Richardson's long-term viability with the franchise.\n\nThe decision to allow conversations with other teams was communicated during a meeting with Ballard and Richardson's camp on Thursday. In that meeting, Ballard expressed a willingness to work with Richardson to find a suitable landing spot. That's why the decision to allow Jackson to speak with other teams and find a match works in the player's favor.\n\nRichardson has one season remaining on his rookie contract unless his 2027 fifth-year option is exercised. He has a $1.145 million base salary, plus a $4.24 million roster bonus that is due in August. The Colts would save $5.385 million in salary cap space with $5.43 million in dead money if Richardson is traded before June 1."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Russia says it has handed over the remains of 1,000 soldiers to Ukraine and has received the bodies of 35 Russian soldiers in return.\n\nIt comes as Ukraine's chief negotiator met with US President Donald Trump's envoys in Geneva to discuss economic plans for Ukraine's reconstruction after the war.\n\nNegotiators were also preparing for a third round of US-led talks aimed at ending the conflict, which has entered its fifth year, including a trilateral meeting involving the Russian side, too.\n\nHours before the Geneva talks, Russia launched 420 drones and 39 missiles in six different regions of Ukraine, injuring dozens of people, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said.\n\nVladimir Medinsky, a top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced the exchange of bodies in a brief Telegram post. He gave no details, but included an image showing bodies being unloaded from a truck.\n\nHours later, Ukraine said it had received 1,000 bodies, which, \"according to prior information from the Russian side, may belong to Ukrainian defenders\".\n\nThe two sides have exchanged thousands of soldiers' bodies over the course of the conflict that began with Putin's decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022.\n\nThe exchange is based on an agreement reached by the two sides during negotiations in Istanbul in June 2025. Moscow and Kyiv agreed to return the bodies of up to 6,000 soldiers each, as well as all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war and those aged under 25.\n\nKyiv and Moscow regularly publish estimates of the other side's losses, but do not detail their own.\n\nZelensky recently admitted 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed on the battlefield - a figure Western observers describe as an underestimate, as it does not include those missing.\n\nAnd from public sources, the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 186,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine. The true death toll is generally accepted to be much higher, as many deaths on the battlefield are not recorded.\n\nSo even though estimates suggest more Russians are dying every day, Moscow has returned more bodies to Ukraine overall than it has received.\n\nNo one has explained the discrepancy, even though Russia has previously accused Ukraine of not abiding by the Istanbul agreement, and Ukraine has alleged Russian body returns were irregular and sometimes included Russians' remains - a charge Moscow has rejected.\n\nOne possible explanation is that Russia captures more Ukrainian bodies, given its troops have been on the attack most of the time and, therefore, are more able to retrieve them from the battlefield.\n\nOn the eve of the Geneva talks, President Zelensky had a telephone conversation with Trump and said he expected the Geneva meeting would lead to trilateral negotiations at the beginning of March - thus creating \"an opportunity to move talks to the leaders' level\".\n\n\"President Trump supports this sequence of steps,\" Zelensky said, adding: \"This is the only way to resolve all the complex and sensitive issues and finally end the war.\"\n\nPutin, for his part, has refused to meet Zelensky, describing him as illegitimate - an argument centring on the fact that no presidential election has been held in Ukraine, despite the expiry of Zelensky's term in March 2024.\n\nHowever, Ukraine's constitution bars holding elections under martial law - imposed in the wake of Putin's invasion of his neighbour.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The history of writing down thoughts and feelings could be tens of thousands of years older than previously believed, surprising archaeologists who made the discovery.\n\nThe researchers discerned patterns of meaning in lines, notches, dots, and crosses on objects such as mammoth tusks, as old as 45,000 years, found in caves in Germany.\n\nTraditionally, historians date the first written words to proto-cuneiform scripts from around 5,000 years ago in ancient Iraq (Mesopotamia).\n\nThe precise meaning of the symbols in Germany remains a mystery.\n\nThe objects are from just before Homo sapiens moved from Africa to Europe, where they interacted with Neanderthals.\n\nUntil now, it was thought that writing developed in Mesopotamia around 3,000 BCE, followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt and later in China and Mesoamerica.\n\n\"The Stone Age sign sequences are an early alternative to writing,\" says Prof Christian Bentz from Saarland University, an author of the new research.\n\nThe work suggests that Stone Age people were as clever as modern-day humans, according to researcher Ewa Dutkiewicz from Berlin's Museum of Prehistory and Early History.\n\n\"So far, we've only scratched the surface of what can be found in terms of symbol sequences on a wide variety of artefacts,\" she says.\n\nThe team analysed more than 3,000 characters on 260 objects to uncover what they call the DNA of writing.\n\nSome of the objects are from a 37-km-long cave system called the Lonetal in Baden-Württemberg, southern Germany.\n\nThe so-called \"adorant\" has a human-like figure and several rows of notches and dots.\n\nOn a small mammoth carved from tusk, the researchers analysed carefully engraved rows of crosses and dots.\n\nAnd on an artefact called \"adorant\" from the Geißenklösterle cave in the Achtal valley, they identified rows of dots and notches on an ivory plaque showing a lion-human creature.\n\nThey believe the arrangement of the marks, in particular the dots on the back, show the patterns acted as communication.\n\nThe researchers believe that Stone Age people deliberately carved these symbols to communicate messages, meaning, and convey thoughts.\n\nA proto-cuneiform tablet from around 3350 years ago\n\n\"Our results also show that the hunter-gatherers of the Palaeolithic era developed a symbol system with a statistically comparable information density to the earliest proto-cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia – a full 40,000 years later,\" says Bentz.\n\nThe clue to finding meaning is in the density of the symbols. They found high repetition of the signs and predictability in the subsequent symbols that is \"comparable to much later proto-cuneiform,\" according to Bentz.\n\nThey found denser patterns on figurines than on tools.\n\nThe team say that it shows that communicating information was very important for Palaeolithic people.\n\n\"They were skilled craftspeople. You can tell they carried the objects with them. Many of them fit very well in the hand, just the right size to fit in the palm,\" says Dutkiewicz.\n\nThe research is published in the journal PNAS.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Nollywood actor Daniel Etim Effiong has shared a deeply personal and dramatic account of how being rusticated from the Federal University of Technology – Minna became the turning point that launched his acting career.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Flame TV, Effiong recounted the emotional turmoil he faced as an engineering student who felt called to the arts but had no clear path forward.\n\n“I was at the University of Technology in Minna, and I didn't know how I was going to move from this engineering major to the arts. I knew nothing but acting in church. One day I was praying about it in the field. We used to go to the field in FUT Minna to pray, and I heard the Lord say to me that you would make films,” he said.\n\nHe admitted he struggled to understand how that promise could materialise.\n\n“I was like, how would these things be? Immediately he gave me another word. He said the way the bones are formed in the womb of a mother, the way a baby is born in the womb of the mother – you do not know. So you do not know the way of God. You don't know how the spirit of God will bring these things to pass, but it will come to pass.”\n\nSoon after, events took an unexpected turn. Effiong revealed that during his first semester at the 300 level, the university published a list of 150 alleged cult members to be expelled, and his name appeared on it.\n\n“The school came up with a list of 150 cult members to be expelled from the university. My name miraculously found its way on the list. It was just me and God. My friends had exams to write, so everyone was like, 'Daniel, this is so terrible but I will be back with you; I have to go study for the exam,' he explained.\n\nHe described how his parents rushed to the school to seek clarification, only to be told he would face disciplinary hearings.\n\nWhile dealing with the uncertainty, Effiong came across an audition form for the second season of the reality show Amstel Malta Box Office, a Nigerian reality series that trains performers. He decided to apply.\n\n“While all of that was happening, I saw a reality TV show form, and I picked it up. I watched season one and thought maybe I should apply for season two. I just filled out the form,” he said. Immediately after I got expelled from school, I got invited for an audition. It was like a dream.”\n\nHe progressed through multiple stages of selection.\n\n“They shortlisted 20 of us from all across Nigeria. After that they shortlisted 10 people to go into the show, and I made the shortlist of 10 housemates,” he recalled. “On that show, we were trained in acting, dancing, performance and singing.”\n\nLooking back, Effiong, who made his directorial debut with Nigeria's best cinema movie of 2025, 'The Herd', believes the experience was the answer to the prayers he had made months earlier.\n\n“At the back of my head, I knew it was an answer to prayers. I knew it was God leading me, but everything was happening so fast. It was like a dream. It did not feel real at all. It was years later that it occurred to me that this is the way the spirit of the Lord was leading me to bring this thing to pass. But I could not see it at the time.”\n\nToday, Daniel Etim Effiong is regarded as one of Nollywood’s notable leading men, known for his performances across film and television. His story offers a glimpse into the uncertainty behind many creative journeys and how setbacks can unexpectedly open new doors.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo has become a co-owner of Spanish second-division side Almeria by acquiring a 25% stake in the club.\n\nThe 41-year-old Al-Nassr forward has bought his stake in Almeria, who are owned by a Saudi Arabian investment consortium led by Mohammed Al-Khereiji, through his recently formed CR7 Sports Investments company.\n\nWhile the financial details have not been disclosed, Ronaldo said in a statement he was looking forward to working with the leadership team \"to support the next phase of the club's growth\".\n\nThe Portugal international added: \"It has been a long-held ambition of mine to contribute to football, beyond the pitch.\n\n\"UD Almeria is a Spanish club with strong foundations and clear potential for growth.\"\n\nPresident Al-Khereiji said: \"[Ronaldo] is regarded as the greatest to ever play the game, he knows the Spanish leagues very well and he understands the potential of what we are building here both in terms of the team and the academy.\"\n\nLast year, Al-Khereiji's SMC Group acquired Almeria from Turki Al-Sheikh, who is chairman of the General Entertainment Authority (GEA), a Saudi government department.\n\nRonaldo spent nine successful years in Spain playing for Real Madrid, winning La Liga twice and lifting the Champions League four times before joining Italian side Juventus in 2018.\n\nHe has played for Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League since 2022 and is the best-paid player in football history with an annual salary of £177m.\n\nAlmeria, founded in 1989, are third in Segunda, two points off leaders Real Racing with 15 games to go.\n\n'The portfolio keeps expanding' - analysis\n\nBy Guillem Balague, BBC Sport Columnist\n\nA little over a decade ago, Cristiano Ronaldo did not want to contemplate life after football.\n\nThose close to him warned he was living on a treadmill, and that when he retired, he might collapse unless he had built something to sustain him. He listened, and business became a way to remain relevant while also giving his family, who had put their own ambitions on hold, projects aligned with their passions.\n\nThe first step was symbolic. In 2016, Ronaldo partnered with a hotel group to open a property in Madeira.\n\nGradually, he began not only investing his wages but enjoying the process, the meetings, the strategy.\n\nHe still harboured dreams of making a Hollywood film, but discovered a similar satisfaction in building companies - applying the same discipline he had devoted to his body.\n\nOn the pitch, that obsession turned him into the most prolific goalscorer in history after the age of 30. Off it, it was shaping a second career.\n\nAccording to the 2025 Forbes ranking, Ronaldo generated almost £210m on and off the field. Of that, just over £50m came from his non-football business interests - a very diverse portfolio.\n\nHe has increasingly channelled his activity through his investment and lifestyle companies, with holdings in a water brand, a healthy-living app and a recovery products company, as well as underwear, fragrances and footwear.\n\nAs well as ownership stakes, he has high-profile partnerships with leading brands, has opened gyms across Portugal and Spain, and launched a range of watches.\n\nAnd the portfolio keeps expanding.\n\nRonaldo co-founded a hair-transplant clinic group that now operates in Spain, Portugal, Oman, and Italy. One of its clients was his mother, Dolores Aveiro.\n\nWhat began with that first hotel in Funchal evolved into a joint venture launched in December 2015 and initially valued at more than £65m. There are now properties in Lisbon, Madrid, New York and Marrakech.\n\nIn December 2024, at the Dubai Globe Soccer Awards, Ronaldo said if he ever owned a club, he knew how to fix structural flaws he saw in some of Europe's giants.\n\nAnd now he has taken a 25% stake in Almeria, owned by Al Khereiji, which is key to his move to Al-Nassr following his exit from Manchester United.\n\nThe treadmill was always going to stop one day, but he now has something to replace it.\n\nThe incident comes after Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr alleged he was racially abused by Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni during the first leg in Lisbon.\n\nThe 25-year-old Brazilian, who scored the only goal of the game, informed the referee he had been racially abused by Prestianni and the game was halted for 10 minutes after he and his Madrid team-mates left the pitch.\n\nArgentine winger Prestianni was subsequently handed a provisional one-match ban and missed the second leg after UEFA rejected Benfica's appeal against his suspension.

            "content": "Ghana Institution of Surveyors welcomes 277 new members at 21st Surveyors’ Week AGM\n\nManaging Director of Petra Trust Company Ltd, Kofi Fynn, has said billions of cedis in pension and insurance funds are available for investment in Ghana’s housing and infrastructure sectors, but warned that unlocking the capital depends on credible and well-coordinated land and real estate systems.\n\nSpeaking at the 21st Week celebration and 57th Annual General Meeting of the Ghana Institution of Surveyors in Tema, Fynn stressed that institutional investors are prepared to finance large-scale development projects if professional standards within the land and property sector inspire confidence.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, Ghana’s housing and infrastructure ambitions will largely depend on professional integrity, collaboration, and accurate surveying practices.\n\n\n\n“Billions of cedis in pension and insurance funds are ready for investment, but institutional capital demands precision, clear land titles, and strong professional standards,” he said.\n\n\n\nFynn described surveyors as central to national development, noting that virtually every infrastructure or real estate transaction relies on accurate surveys and credible valuations.\n\n\n\n“No road, building, or financial transaction succeeds without reliable surveys and valuations. The work of surveyors forms the foundation upon which investment decisions are made,” he added.\n\nHe explained that with pension and insurance funds now holding tens of billions of cedis in long-term capital, significant opportunities exist to address Ghana’s housing deficit and expand infrastructure development.\n\n\n\nHowever, he cautioned that investors require certainty and transparency before committing funds.\n\n\n\n“Institutional capital flows where systems are trusted. Precision, ethical conduct, and professional collaboration are essential to attracting long-term investment,” Fynn stated.\n\n\n\nThe event also marked the induction of about 275 new members into the Ghana Institution of Surveyors and the elevation of 28 professionals to fellowship status, a development organisers described as strengthening professional capacity within the sector.\n\n\n\nPresident of the Ghana Institution of Surveyors, Surveyor Kofi Obeng-Ayirebi, used the occasion to underscore the importance of professional discipline, warning that members who remain inactive for three consecutive years will be expelled from the institution.\n\n“Our profession plays a critical role in Ghana’s development, and maintaining active professional participation is essential to safeguarding standards and public trust,” he said.\n\n\n\nHe reiterated that surveyors remain key actors in Ghana’s development agenda, particularly in ensuring land administration efficiency, infrastructure planning, and sustainable urban growth.\n\n\n\nWith hundreds of new professionals joining the institution alongside experienced fellows, the Ghana Institution of Surveyors says it is positioning itself to play an even stronger role in supporting Ghana’s journey toward sustainable development.\n\n\n\nA total of 275 Professional Members and 2 Technician Members were inducted and admitted as new members of the Ghana Institution of Surveyors during its 21st Surveyors’ Week Celebration and 57th Annual General Meeting."

President Mahama had announced that TOR would officially resume crude oil refining by the end of October 2025, describing it as a major step toward reviving the facility after years of inactivity.\n\n\n\nHowever, Nana Kay questioned the credibility of the announcement, citing the latest report from the Bank of Ghana, which he said indicated that no crude oil had been imported for refining as of the reporting period. He argued that the absence of crude imports casts doubt on the refinery’s readiness to resume operations as scheduled.\n\nHe stressed that given TOR’s strategic importance to Ghana’s energy sector, there must be greater accountability in how oil supplies are secured and managed. The refinery’s prolonged inactivity has heightened concerns about Ghana’s energy independence and its continued reliance on imported refined petroleum products.\n\n\n\n“The citizens deserve to know how these resources are handled, especially at such a sensitive and pivotal time for Ghana's energy sector,” Nana Kay stated.\n\n\n\nHis call for an investigation comes amid growing public concern over the adequacy and fairness of petroleum supply chains, as well as their impact on national fuel prices and the broader economy.\n\n\n\nHe further questioned the integrity of the processes employed by TOR’s leadership and the implications of their operations for consumers and businesses across the country."

These officials demonstrated how the insights gained into Japan’s unique modernization and development paradigms are being applied to solve local challenges and enhance public administration in Ghana.\n\n\n\nShifting the Paradigm: From \"Aid\" to \"Co-creation\"\n\n\n\nIn his keynote lecture, Prof. SHIRATO, outlined major global shifts affecting Africa-Japan relations. Drawing on international data, he explained that the world is undergoing rapid multipolarization, while relative economic weight of traditional powers -the United States, Europe, Japan- gradually declining, while emerging economies continue to rise.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, African countries have moved from being passive aid recipients to active political and economic actors shaping the international system.\n\n\n\nProf. SHIRATO emphasized that Africa’s demographic dynamism—rapid population growth and a young workforce— drives corporate interest, including Japanese firms, and argued that future engagement should shift from a traditional donor–recipient approach to an equal, co‑creative partnership.\n\n\n\nHe also noted that domestic fiscal pressures and “anti‑aid” public sentiment in developed countries underscore the need for more sustainable, mutually beneficial cooperation models.\n\nLeading the World with Trust: JDS Alumni as the “Bridge”\n\n\n\nIn his concluding remarks, Prof. SHIRATO sent a powerful message to the JDS alumni that as individuals who deeply understand both Japan and Africa, you are the key to unlocking this Co-creative Partnership.”\n\n\n\nIn line with its vision, “Leading the World with Trust,” JICA remains committed to fostering these \"bridges\" between the two nations. By empowering Ghanaian officials with both Japanese insights and local expertise, JICA aims to create tangible developmental outcomes and strengthen the economic ties between Japan and Ghana."

The case has been adjourned to March 26, 2026.\n\n\n\nAmong the accused are Col Kwadwo Damoah (Rtd), a former Customs Commissioner and sitting MP for Jaman South; Emmanuel Kofi Nti and Ammishaddai Owusu-Amoah, both former Commissioner-Generals of the Ghana Revenue Authority; Isaac Crentsil, former Customs Commissioner; Evans Adusei, CEO of SML; and the company itself.\n\n\n\nAll have pleaded not guilty and are currently on bail.\n\nThe case stems from a revenue assurance contract awarded to SML under the previous administration.\n\n\n\nThe contract later sparked national controversy and was eventually cancelled following a directive by President John Dramani Mahama.\n\n\n\nIn the charge sheet, the Special Prosecutor alleged that the accused persons orchestrated a “criminal enterprise” beginning in 2017 to use the SML contract to unlawfully benefit the company, despite what he described as no genuine need for the services it purported to provide.\n\n\n\nHe stated: “The criminal enterprise was commenced in 2017 by the first, third, seventh, and eighth accused persons, with the other accused persons joining the adventure at various times. The criminal enterprise was characterised by no genuine need for contracting the eighth accused company for the obligations it purported to perform, and the contracts were secured for the eighth company through self-serving patronage and promotion by the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth accused persons based on false and unverified claims.”\n\nThe OSP further accused the accused persons of engaging in prohibited acts and “acted with increased emboldened impunity as they freely abused their public offices by using the offices for private benefit.”\n\n\n\nHe added that the six former officials enabled SML to “largely pretend to perform the services under the various contracts leading to immense financial loss to the republic of about one billion, four hundred and thirty-six million, two hundred and forty-nine thousand, eight hundred and twenty-eight cedis, fifty-three pesewas (GH¢1,436,249,828.53).”\n\n\n\n“The accused persons based their actions on their false claims that the eighth accused company possessed technical expertise and capability in revenue assurance, and that the technical expertise and capability of the eighth accused person had greatly increased revenue for the republic; and further that the eighth accused company exclusively possessed the only patented and proven technological systems in the world for value chain transaction audits, external price verification and measurement audit services in the downstream petroleum, upstream petroleum and minerals sectors,” the OSP added.\n\n\n\nNA/AE\n\nGhanaian man and his Nigerian girlfriend found dead in Morocco apartment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TrendingGH: Love or Pressure?

Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "Associates of one of the passengers killed in the alleged raid attempt said he sought to overthrow Cuba’s government.\n\nCuban authorities have accused 10 men on a speedboat sailing from the United States of attempting to carry out a campaign of violence to destabilise the island’s government.\n\nFour of the 10 men on the boat were killed in a shootout with Cuban border agents this week.\n\nOn Thursday, Cuban authorities confirmed that the six remaining crew members were receiving medical treatment for their injuries. At least one Cuban officer was also hurt in the gunfire.\n\nCBS News also reported that at least one US citizen was among the dead, citing White House officials.\n\nStill, Cuban officials defended their government’s response and alleged the speedboat passengers shot first at border agents.\n\n“Cuba will defend itself with determination and firmness against any terrorist and mercenary aggression that seeks to affect its sovereignty and national stability,” Cuban President Manuel Diaz-Canel said in a social media post.\n\nThe incident comes during a period of heightened tensions between Cuba and the US, which has made repeated threats against the island’s communist government.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has also ratcheted up measures meant to worsen economic conditions there, including by imposing a fuel blockade on Cuba in late January.\n\nOnly one of the four men killed has been identified by the Cuban government so far: Michel Ortega Casanova.\n\nOne of Casanova’s associates told the news service AFP that he sought to overthrow the government in Havana.\n\n“His goal was to go and fight against a criminal and murderous narco-tyrannical [government], to see if that would spark the people to rise up,” said Wilfredo Beyra, head of the Cuban Republican Party in Tampa.\n\n\n\nFamily members of Casanova said that they were not aware of his plans but that he was motivated by the “great suffering” of people under the Cuban government.\n\n“No one knew,” Misrael Ortega Casanova, his brother, said. “My mother is devastated.”\n\nHe identified his sibling as part of a group concerned about rights abuses on the island.\n\n“They became so obsessed that they didn’t think about the consequences nor their own lives,” Misrael added.\n\nUS officials have said that they will investigate the incident and denied any government involvement. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the US embassy in Havana is seeking more details, including whether US citizens are among those detained.\n\n“We have various different elements of the US government that are trying to identify elements of the story that may not be provided to us now,” he said.\n\nThe US has worked with Cuban exiles against the country’s government in the past, including by supporting campaigns of clandestine infiltration, violence and sabotage.\n\nBut activist groups in South Florida have also emerged, some of them running small speedboats and planes to and from the island to ferry out Cuban nationals.\n\nCuban authorities have used US intervention as a pretext for the country’s steep restrictions on political dissent and a slate of security measures that rights groups say have been wielded against critics.\n\nCuban authorities identified seven of the 10 passengers, including Conrado Galindo Sariol, Jose Manuel Rodriguez Castello, Cristian Ernesto Acosta Guevara and Roberto Azcorra Consuegra. Cuba’s government said that one of the four killed was Michel Ortega Casanova. Three more have yet to be identified.\n\nThe Cuban government also stated that two of the passengers, Amijail Sanchez Gonzalez and Leordan Enrique Cruz Gomez, were wanted by law enforcement authorities “based on their involvement in the promotion, planning, organisation, financing, support or commission of actions carried out in the national territory or in other countries, in connection with acts of terrorism”."

            "content": "The new announcement from Quito follows an initial 30% tariff imposed by the Andean nation in early February.\n\nClick here to share on social media\n\nThe Ecuadorian government has declared that it will significantly raise tariffs on imports from Colombia, increasing the rate from 30 percent to 50 percent starting March 1.\n\nThe decision, announced on Thursday, represents a major escalation in the intensifying trade and security dispute between the two neighbouring Andean countries.\n\nEcuador’s right-wing president, Daniel Noboa, has been pressuring his left-wing counterpart in Colombia, Gustavo Petro, to crack down on border security.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Ecuador has seen a surge in violence linked to the expansion of organised crime in the country.\n\nNoboa, echoing President Donald Trump in the United States, has blamed Petro for not acting aggressively enough to combat narcotics trafficking. Colombia has, for many years, been the world’s largest source of cocaine.\n\nAnd like Trump, Noboa has increasingly relied on tariffs against Colombia to force adherence to Ecuador’s national security strategy.\n\nHis government has accused Petro’s of failing to cooperate with border security measures. The two countries both sit on the Pacific coast, and they share a land border that stretches roughly 586 kilometres, or 364 miles.\n\nQuestions about electricity\n\nThursday’s announcement follows an initial 30 percent tariff imposed by Quito in early February.\n\nEcuadorian officials have also justified the protectionist measures by citing a growing trade deficit.\n\nAccording to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, a data analysis firm, nearly 4 percent of Colombian exports go to Ecuador, worth roughly $2.13bn. Ecuador imports significant quantities of medicines and pesticides from Colombia.\n\n\n\nFewer exports go from Ecuador to Colombia, though. Roughly 2.3 percent of Ecuador’s exports abroad go across the shared border, amounting to a value of $863m.\n\nEcuador’s trade deficit with Colombia sits at roughly $1.03bn through 2025, according to government data, excluding oil.\n\nBut in spite of the anticipated tariff hike, it is unclear whether Ecuador will apply the new tariffs to Colombian electricity — a critical resource for the country.\n\nIn a retaliatory move following the initial tariffs, Colombia suspended all energy sales to its neighbour.\n\nThat suspension risks fuelling tensions in Ecuador against Noboa’s government. Recent droughts have created disruptions to Ecuador’s hydroelectric dams, which provide nearly 70 percent of the country’s power.\n\nThose disruptions have caused widespread power outages in recent years, which in turn have prompted antigovernment protests. In the past, Noboa has responded by buying electricity from Colombia.\n\nPipeline standoff\n\nThe transportation of fossil fuels has also become a flashpoint between Ecuador and Colombia in the aftermath of February’s tariffs.\n\nNoboa’s government has hiked fees for Colombian crude delivered through the Trans-Ecuadorian System Oil Pipeline (SOTE) by 900 percent.\n\nThat raises the cost to approximately $30 per barrel. Colombia has responded by halting all oil shipments through the line.\n\nDespite high-level diplomatic efforts, tensions between the neighbouring countries remain at an impasse.\n\nOfficials representing foreign policy and security held a meeting this month in Ecuador, but the gathering concluded without a breakthrough.\n\nIn announcing the latest tariff hike, Ecuador’s Ministry of Production and Foreign Trade levelled criticism at Colombia for failing to implement “concrete and effective” measures to curb drug trafficking along the border.\n\nOnce considered a bastion of stability, Ecuador has seen a spike in homicide and other violent crimes.\n\nAccording to the Geneva-based Organized Crime Observatory, the Andean nation recorded a homicide rate of approximately one murder every hour last year."

He was named as Hussein Mohsen al-Khalaf and was killed in a strike on Kfar Dan near Baalbek, the L’Orient news outlet reported.\n\nAt least 13 air strikes were recorded, four in Shmestar, five in Boudai, two in Harbata and two in the Hermel and Nabi Chit mountains, according to NNA. Several shops were damaged in the Baalbek Souk in Tallet al-Ajami.\n\nThe Israeli military said it targeted eight camps belonging to Hezbollah’s special operations unit, the Radwan Force. It said weapons and missiles were stored there and training was conducted “as part of preparations for emergency situations, and to plan and execute terrorist plots”. It said this activity was a “violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon”.\n\nCeasefire violations\n\nIsrael’s military has continued to carry out attacks in Lebanon, despite a November 2024 ceasefire with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah that sought to bring an end to more than a year of fighting. More than 300 people have been killed since then, including 127 civilians, according to the United Nations.\n\nLast week, at least 12 people were killed in Israeli strikes on the Bekaa Valley and the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp near the city of Sidon. Israel said it was targeting Hezbollah and Hamas command centres.\n\n\n\nLebanon filed a complaint with the UN in January, detailing a total of 2,036 Israeli violations between October and December 2025 alone. It called on the UN Security Council to compel Israel to end these actions and to fully withdraw from its borders.\n\nIsrael continues to occupy parts of Lebanon, blocking the reconstruction of border villages and preventing people from returning to their homes.\n\nLebanon’s government has said it has almost completed its ceasefire commitment to disarm Hezbollah south of the Litani River. It said it will need four months to complete the second phase.\n\nHowever, Hezbollah has rejected this, saying it believes the disarmament in the ceasefire agreement only applies to areas south of the river."

            "content": "Albanese, a supporter of Palestinian rights, has faced US sanctions since July over her criticism of Israel.\n\nThe family of United Nations human rights rapporteur Francesca Albanese has sued the administration of United States President Donald Trump over the sanctions it imposed upon her.\n\nAlbanese’s husband and child filed the lawsuit on Thursday. It argues that the sanctions are an effort to punish Albanese for bringing attention to rights abuses Israel has perpetuated against Palestinians.\n\nSince 2022, Albanese, a legal scholar, has served as the special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza, where she monitors human rights abuses against Palestinians. The UN Human Rights Council selected her for the position.\n\nThe Trump administration, however, sanctioned her last July, calling her “unfit” for her role and accusing her of “biased and malicious activities” against the US and its ally, Israel.\n\nIt also highlighted her work with the International Criminal Court (ICC), which — at the recommendation of Albanese and other experts — issued an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes in Gaza.\n\nAlbanese’s family, however, defended her comments as an expression of free speech, protected under the First Amendment of the US Constitution.\n\n“Francesca’s expression of her views about the facts as she has found them in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and about the work of the ICC is core First Amendment activity,” the lawsuit says.\n\nA role chronicling abuses\n\nAlbanese, an Italian citizen, has long fielded criticism from the Israeli government and its allies in the US for her criticisms of the violence committed against Palestinians.\n\n\n\nHer international profile has grown since Israel launched its genocidal war on Gaza on October 8, 2023. More than 75,000 Palestinians have died in that conflict, according to experts and local health officials.\n\nIn March 2024, six months into the war, Albanese testified in a report that she had “reasonable grounds to believe” that the standards for genocide had been reached in Gaza, as outlined in the UN Genocide Convention.\n\nIsrael rejected the findings. Albanese, meanwhile, said she faced threats after making her statement to the UN.\n\nHer public role and blistering condemnation of Israeli abuses have made her a subject of frequent ire for Israeli and US authorities.\n\nBut in Thursday’s lawsuit, Albanese’s family members questioned whether US sanction power should be used to stifle allegations of human rights abuses.\n\nThey also highlighted Albanese’s situation as the mother of a US citizen.\n\n“At its heart, this case concerns whether Defendants can sanction a person — ruining their life and the lives of their loved ones, including their citizen daughter — because Defendants disagree with their recommendations or fear their persuasiveness,” the court filing said.\n\nThe US Department of State, however, has waved aside the lawsuit as “baseless lawfare”. It maintains that the sanctions against Albanese are “legal and appropriate”.\n\nA wider campaign in the US\n\nSanctions generally freeze the US-based assets of an individual and prevent anyone else in the US from doing business with them.\n\nSince returning for a second term, Trump has used sanctions as penalties for several critics of Israeli and US actions, even beyond Albanese.\n\nLast June, the Trump administration sanctioned four ICC judges for taking “illegitimate and baseless actions” against the US and Israel. Then, in August, two more ICC judges, plus two prosecutors, were also slapped with sanctions.\n\nAs recently as December, another pair of ICC judges were added to the list for their involvement in the investigation of alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza.\n\nA growing number of scholars, rights groups and international organisations have said that Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to genocide.\n\nIsrael and the US, however, have largely refuted that assessment. They have also questioned whether the ICC has jurisdiction in their countries.\n\nThough the US and Israel are not party to the Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding document, both have been accused of rights abuses in countries that are members.\n\nIn Albanese’s case, the US government has accused the rapporteur of anti-Semitism and criticised her for pushing for boycotts of US companies implicated in Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories.\n\n\n\n“We will not tolerate these campaigns of political and economic warfare, which threaten our national interests and sovereignty,” the US State Department said in its sanctions announcement.\n\nBut Albanese has indicated that she remains committed to her work regardless of the disruptions to her life.\n\n“My daughter is American. I’ve been living in the US, and I have some assets there. So of course, it’s going to harm me,” Albanese said after the sanctions announcement.\n\n“What can I do? I did everything I did in good faith, and knowing that, my commitment to justice is more important than personal interests.”"

            "content": "Condemnation has poured in after Columbia University in New York said United States immigration enforcement agents “made misrepresentations” to gain access to one of the school’s residential buildings to detain a student.\n\nA statement from Columbia University’s acting president, Claire Shipman, said federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) entered the building about 6:30am (13:30 GMT) on Thursday.\n\n“Our understanding at this time is that the federal agents made misrepresentations to gain entry to the building to search for a ‘missing person’,” Shipman said. “We are working to gather more details.”\n\nShe added that “all law enforcement agents must have a judicial warrant or judicial subpoena to access non-public areas of the University, including housing, classrooms, and areas requiring [identification badge] swipe access.\n\n“An administrative warrant is not sufficient,” she said, referring to an internal document that the DHS has used to justify searches for undocumented immigrants that are not approved by a judge. Advocacy groups have called the practice a violation of constitutionally protected rights.\n\nThe Columbia statement did not identify the detained student, but the student newspaper, the Columbia Spectator, said Ellie Aghayeva, a neuroscience researcher, had been targeted.\n\nAt 3:18pm local time (17:00 GMT), New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani announced he had spoken with President Donald Trump about the situation.\n\n“I shared my concerns about Columbia student Elaina Aghayeva,” Mamdani wrote of his meeting with Trump. “He has just informed me that she will be released imminently.”\n\n\n\nAghayeva subsequently posted on her Instagram account that she was “safe and okay” and on her way home.\n\n“I need a little bit of time to process everything. I will come back soon. But please don’t worry,” she wrote.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a DHS agency, previously confirmed Aghayeva’s detention to several US media outlets but did not immediately respond to an Al Jazeera request for more information.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, the agency said Aghayeva’s student visa had been terminated in 2016 “for failing to attend classes”. The statement added that the “building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment”.\n\nProtesters had gathered on Thursday on the campus, which was the site of mass pro-Palestine demonstrations in 2024.\n\nMass deportation drive\n\nIn a student group chat, Aghayeva wrote to fellow students early on Thursday: “DHS illegally arrested me. Please help,” according to the Columbia Spectator.\n\n“They are trying to take me away,” she wrote. “Can someone help me.”\n\nThe Trump administration has targeted a number of students in its mass deportation drive, which immigration advocates said has relied on increasingly drastic tactics to meet high detention quotas.\n\nShortly after Trump’s return to office in January 2025, his administration targeted several Columbia students for their pro-Palestine advocacy, including US residents Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi. The Columbia Spectator reported that the targeting of Aghayeva was the first time since Khalil’s March detention that it had detained someone affiliated with Columbia at a property owned by the university.\n\nIn June, Columbia University reached an agreement with the Trump administration after it threatened to withhold $1.3bn in funding over the university’s response to pro-Palestine protests and diversity, equity, and inclusion programmes.\n\nCritics said the deal infringed upon academic freedom and tacitly supported the administration’s conflation of pro-Palestine protests with anti-Jewish sentiment. The university had previously come under fire for expelling and suspending students who took part in the protests.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul was among the elected officials condemning immigration agents’ actions on Thursday.\n\n“Let’s be clear about what happened: ICE agents didn’t have the proper warrant, so they lied to gain access to a student’s private residence,” she wrote on X as she urged state lawmakers to pass a law that would “ban ICE from entering sensitive locations like schools and dorms”.\n\n\n\nRepresentative Jerry Nadler, a Democrat, accused ICE of “terrorising our neighbours and ripping students from their homes”."

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nLess than 24 hours before the deadline in an ultimatum issued by the Pentagon, Anthropic has refused the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted access to its AI.\n\nIt’s the culmination of a dramatic exchange of public statements, social media posts, and behind-the-scenes negotiations, coming down to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s desire to renegotiate all AI labs’ current contracts with the military. But Anthropic, so far, has refused to back down from its two current red lines: no mass surveillance of Americans, and no lethal autonomous weapons (or weapons with license to kill targets with no human oversight whatsoever). OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to the new terms, while Anthropic’s refusal had led to CEO Dario Amodei being summoned to the White House this week for a meeting with Hegseth himself, in which the Secretary reportedly issued an ultimatum to the CEO to back down by the end of business day on Friday or else.\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, Amodei wrote, “I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community.”\n\nHe added that the company has “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner” but that in a “narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values” — going on to specifically mention mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons. (Amodei mentioned that “partial autonomous weapons … are vital to the defense of democracy” and that fully autonomous weapons may eventually “prove critical for our national defense,” but that “today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons.” He did not rule out Anthropic acquiescing to the military’s use of fully autonomous weapons in the future but mentioned that they were not ready now.)\n\nThe Pentagon had already reportedly asked major defense contractors to assess their dependence on Anthropic’s Claude, which could be seen as the first step to designating the company a “supply chain risk” – a public threat that the Pentagon had made recently (and a classification usually reserved for threats to national security). The Pentagon was also reportedly considering invoking the Defense Production Act to make Anthropic comply.\n\nAmodei wrote in his statement that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” He also wrote that “should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.”"

The company will shrink from more than 10,000 people to less than 6,000, Dorsey says in a post on X. And the reason why? AI.\n\n“We’re not making this decision because we’re in trouble,” Dorsey says. “Our business is strong. Gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving. But something has changed. We’re already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. And that’s accelerating rapidly.”\n\nDorsey opted to do a big layoff instead of gradual cuts because “I’d rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome.”\n\nThe layoffs were announced on Thursday as part of the company’s Q4 2025 earnings. In a shareholder letter, Dorsey says that “We believe Block will be significantly more valuable as a smaller, faster, intelligence-native company. Everything we do from here is in service of that.”"

I want extra battery and magnets, and I’m willing to sacrifice thinness to get it. Phones are thin enough already, except for the ones that fold.\n\nAnd if Samsung took charge of the magnets like Apple, and replicated Apple’s standard pattern and strength, maybe the magnet case I use with my Galaxy S25 would properly and firmly hold onto magnetic battery packs without them rotating in place. Since there’s no magnets inside my phone, I’m at the mercy of casemakers.\n\nBut I get it. Why make the tradeoff if someone will pay for a case anyhow?

            "content": "Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\n\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nSurprise guests at Prada pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 26, 2026\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\n\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\n\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you."

The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.\n\nCompanies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob DeMillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monnin — have a different approach.\n\nThe company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.\n\nWhile technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a similar realization.)\n\nSophia, an Nvidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are 1 meter by 1 meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, DeMillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

DeMillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute.\n\nFirst, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include Earth-observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks.\n\n“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” DeMillo told TechCrunch."

            "content": "A rise in the need for computers and data centers to power AI is causing a massive shortage of RAM, driving memory prices sharply higher. Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest single-year dip in more than a decade.\n\nEarlier this year, IDC reported that manufacturers shipped 1.26 billion devices in 2025. The firm predicts that figure will drop to just 1.12 billion this year.\n\n“The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping the long‑term TAM [total addressable market], the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, in a statement.\n\nImage Credits:IDC\n\nPopal said that because of memory shortage, the average retail price of a smartphone is expected to rise by 14%.\n\n“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, smartphone ASP [average selling price] is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she added.\n\nPopal also noted that rising component costs could make the sub-$100 smartphone “permanently uneconomical,” pricing out phone makers that manufacture devices at that price point.\n\nThe firm said that, because of this trend, shipments in the Middle East and Africa will drop more than 20% year-over-year. China and the broader Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan) will also see declines of 10.5% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The ‘more specs for less money’ model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.\n\n“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei added."

Now AI companies are trying a new tactic to get their tech to stick by partnering with consultants.\n\nOn Thursday, French AI research lab Mistral AI and global consulting giant Accenture announced a multiyear partnership. The deal entails the two companies working together to develop enterprise tech powered by Mistral’s AI models for clients.\n\nFinancial terms and duration of the deal were not disclosed. TechCrunch reached out for more information.\n\nThis deal also includes Accenture becoming a Mistral customer and rolling out its technology to its underlying employees.\n\nWhile Mistral is often seen as a smaller European peer to the sprawling U.S. AI “startups,” the partnership proves that Mistral can still land the same sizable customers, given that OpenAI and Anthropic recently announced deals with Accenture as well.\n\nThe agreement comes as AI companies are increasingly partnering with consultants. For instance, OpenAI just announced its “Frontier Alliance” initiative with four large consulting firms, including Accenture, on Monday to help push its new OpenAI Frontier AI agent governance platform to enterprise customers. Anthropic is also partnered with IBM and Deloitte.\n\nWill partnering with consulting firms be the trick to finding more enterprise AI adoption? It’s unclear, but what is clear is that AI companies are definitely trying to find out."

            "content": "AI agents like OpenClaw have recently exploded in popularity precisely because they can take the reins of your digital life. Whether you want a personalized morning news digest, a proxy that can fight with your cable company's customer service, or a to-do list auditor that will do some tasks for you and prod you to resolve the rest, agentic assistants are built to access your digital accounts and carry out your commands. This is helpful—but has also caused a lot of chaos. The bots are out there mass-deleting emails they've been instructed to preserve, writing hit pieces over perceived snubs, and launching phishing attacks against their owners.\n\nWatching the pandemonium unfold in recent weeks, longtime security engineer and researcher Niels Provos decided to try something new. Today he is launching an open source, secure AI assistant called IronCurtain designed to add a critical layer of control. Instead of the agent directly interacting with the user's systems and accounts, it runs in an isolated virtual machine. And its ability to take any action is mediated by a policy—you could even think of it as a constitution—that the owner writes to govern the system. Crucially, IronCurtain is also designed to receive these overarching policies in plain English and then runs them through a multistep process that uses a large language model (LLM) to convert the natural language into an enforceable security policy.\n\n“Services like OpenClaw are at peak hype right now, but my hope is that there’s an opportunity to say, ‘Well, this is probably not how we want to do it,’” Provos says. “Instead, let’s develop something that still gives you very high utility, but is not going to go into these completely uncharted, sometimes destructive, paths.”\n\nIronCurtain's ability to take intuitive, straightforward statements and turn them into enforceable, deterministic—or predictable—red lines is vital, Provos says, because LLMs are famously “stochastic” and probabilistic. In other words, they don't necessarily always generate the same content or give the same information in response to the same prompt. This creates challenges for AI guardrails, because AI systems can evolve over time such that they revise how they interpret a control or constraint mechanism, which can result in rogue activity.\n\nAn IronCurtain policy, Provos says, could be as simple as: “The agent may read all my email. It may send email to people in my contacts without asking. For anyone else, ask me first. Never delete anything permanently.”\n\nIronCurtain takes these instructions, turns them into an enforceable policy, and then mediates between the assistant agent in the virtual machine and what's known as the model context protocol server that gives LLMs access to data and other digital services to carry out tasks. Being able to constrain an agent this way adds an important component of access control that web platforms like email providers don't currently offer because they weren't built for the scenario where both a human owner and AI agent bots are all using one account.\n\nProvos notes that IronCurtain is designed to refine and improve each user's “constitution” over time as the system encounters edge cases and asks for human input about how to proceed. The system, which is model-independent and can be used with any LLM, is also designed to maintain an audit log of all policy decisions over time.\n\nIronCurtain is a research prototype, not a consumer product, and Provos hopes that people will contribute to the project to explore and help it evolve. Dino Dai Zovi, a well-known cybersecurity researcher who has been experimenting with early versions of IronCurtain, says that the conceptual approach the project takes aligns with his own intuition about how agentic AI needs to be constrained."

            "content": "Hearing someone talk about digital censorship in China is always either extremely boring or extremely interesting. Most of the time, people are still regurgitating the same talking points from 20 years ago about how the Chinese internet is like living in George Orwell’s 1984. But occasionally, someone discovers something new about how the Chinese government exerts control over emerging technologies, revealing how the censorship machine is a constantly evolving beast.\n\nA new paper by scholars from Stanford University and Princeton University about Chinese artificial intelligence belongs to the second category. The researchers fed the same 145 politically sensitive questions to four Chinese large language models and five American models and then compared how they responded. They then repeated the same experiment 100 times.\n\nThe main findings won’t be surprising to anyone who has been paying attention: Chinese models refuse to answer significantly more of the questions than the American models. (DeepSeek refused 36 percent of the questions, while Baidu’s Ernie Bot refused 32 percent; OpenAI’s GPT and Meta’s Llama had refusal rates lower than 3 percent.) In cases where they didn’t outright refuse to answer, the Chinese models also gave shorter answers and more inaccurate information than their American counterparts did.\n\nOne of the most interesting things the researchers attempted to do was to separate the impact of pre-training and post-training. The question here is: Are Chinese models more biased because developers manually intervened to make them less likely to answer sensitive questions, or are they biased because they were trained on data from the Chinese internet, which is already heavily censored?\n\n“Given that the Chinese internet has already been censored for all these decades, there's a lot of missing data” says Jennifer Pan, a political science professor at Stanford University who has long studied online censorship and coauthored the recent paper.\n\nPan and her colleague’ findings suggest that training data may have played a smaller role in how the AI models responded than manual interventions. Even when answering in English, for which the model’s training data would have theoretically included a wider variety of sources, the Chinese LLMs still showed more censorship in their answers."

            "content": "Silicon Valley has always prized “high-agency” individuals—people who impress their ideas upon the world by thinking for themselves and taking action without being told what to do. But as the performance of AI coding tools has surged, so has the industry’s emphasis on humans being \"agentic\" themselves.\n\n“Today’s agents might already be more capable than all three of us here in the room,” says Akshay Kothari, cofounder and chief operating officer of the $11 billion productivity startup Notion. “Taste is something we think is pretty unique to Notion, but you can imagine agents getting pretty good at that too. Eventually, the only thing left for humans is agency.”\n\nThat idea might sound outrageous to most people, but it will come as no surprise to many in Silicon Valley. A viral Harper's essay brought the subject to a head recently. It followed a few young people in San Francisco and concluded that being agentic has less to do with productivity and “more to do with constantly chasing attention online.” But in my conversations with founders, researchers, and investors, I came to a different conclusion.\n\nThe tech industry is grappling with a very real shift in how software engineers do their jobs. Millions of developers are using AI coding agents like Claude Code and Codex to automate much of their work (some tech companies are even requiring it). For many, a massive piece of their value is now tied to deciding what AI coding agents should work on. The shift is unsettling to those who enjoyed the act of sitting down and actually writing code, but for some of the industry’s most “agentic,” it’s an opportunity.\n\nSimon Last, another Notion cofounder, uses AI coding agents more than anyone I’ve ever met. He coded for nearly two decades—then abruptly stopped. Now, he’s using up to four AI coding agents at any given time (he prefers Codex to Claude Code). If he’s at a party or sleeping, Last gets what he calls “token anxiety” if he doesn’t have agents working in the background. He doesn’t like to use more than four, though, because he says it causes “context overload” on his human brain.\n\n“Knowing how to harness these agents is now the most important skill in the world, and it’s not really something you can train for,” says Last. “You have to be very open-minded, curious, and willing to try whatever the newest thing is. The value of that sort of person is going up exponentially, because the value they can create, by extension, is going up exponentially.”\n\nTo be fair, Last is kind of describing himself. He acts as a “super IC” for Notion, and he doesn’t manage humans, only agents. But the way he manages them is not unlike how a manager oversees employees. Last is constantly delegating work to AI agents, then closely reviewing and fixing their code.\n\nKothari says Notion has always hired people with high agency, but the value of doing so has gone up dramatically in recent months. Even though the company is using AI agents to automate work, Notion is busier than ever. Employees are shipping products at a higher velocity and doing more work overall, the cofounders claim. Notion isn’t downsizing its team because of AI, but it is hiring differently. “There's more value in the Valley today to have a few Simons than thousands of engineers,” says Kothari. He says the people Notion hires need to understand “the new way of working.”\n\nIf you’re not a software engineer, this can be a little hard to process. AI agents aren’t very useful for people in many industries. A recent survey from Gallup found that most Americans still don’t use AI much in their jobs, though the number of people who do is rising. Kothari is increasingly convinced the “new way of work” will eventually hit finance, legal, creative, and other industries. If and when that happens, you can imagine more Americans beginning to ask themselves, am I agentic?"

            "content": "Honorable Mentions\n\nDuring the winter, a whole WIRED crew tests ski clothes almost constantly. Here are a few other items that we like.\n\nCourtesy of REI\n\nHestra Fall Line 3-Finger Gloves for $190: I've long admired Hestra gloves from across the lift line, impressed by the Swedish company's elegant stitchwork and thoughtful design touches. This was the year I finally got to try a pair for myself, and the Fall Line are exactly what they look like. There are six sizes available so you can get the perfect fit in this glove. The cowhide is buttery smooth and has already broken in a bit with five days' use. The wrist strap means you never have to fret about dropping your glove from the lift when checking your phone, and they're very warm without making me sweat. If you do sweat, the lining is removable so you can wash it without damaging the leather. —Martin Cizmar\n\nCourtesy of Crab Grab\n\nCrab Grab Snuggler Mitts for $89: These mini sleeping bags for your fingers are packed full of Primaloft insulation and benefitting from a sherpa fleece lining, they are toasty warm, and with a 15K membrane, impressively waterproof too. All-season mittens with durable construction for under $100? Yes Please!\n\nCourtesy of Mons Royale\n\nMons Royale Yotei Merino Classic Long Sleeve for $98: As I type this, I’m nowhere near a mountain, but I’m still wearing the Mons Royale Yotei long sleeve top. It is ridiculously comfortable, made from 190-gsm-weight, 100 percent merino wool, and has a mercifully relaxed cut, so I remain warm, but don’t feel like a sausage. On the mountain however, the merino wool works its magic, wicking away sweat—especially on a hike up to some fresh powder—and keeping me comfortable. Paired with a shell and the Patagonia R1 Thermal Hoodie, I’m warm enough during a bitter arctic blast.\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket and Bib Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket for $498 and Bib for $398: Seniq is another all-women’s outdoor brand that launched in 2024. It's styled a little more Gen Z, leaning into fun color blocking over the monochromatic look. The Seniq Powder Puff Down Jacket has a dry-touch finish. It’s meant for drier days on the mountain, but a PFC-free DWR coating and YKK AquaGuard zippers do provide water resistance. The asymmetric front zipper helps you avoid chin rub when you have the jacket fully zipped. It also features cool asymmetrical quilting lines, side pockets-in-pockets that provide access to your bib (their bibs have a pocket on the front, so you can get in there without unzipping your jacket), an oversized removable hood, a forearm pass pocket, soft and stretchy wrist gaiters, and a large internal pocket that can absolutely handle a sandwich. This jacket was warm, pillowy, and comforting, like a super-soft hug.\n\nThe silky shell bibs are slightly barrel cut, which gives them a flattering shape without being fitted. The adjustable racer back-style straps and low back (with a stretchy waist) also provide a nice shape and breathability. There are two pockets on the front chest, pockets on either leg, two-way zip thigh vents, and a butt zipper for bathroom breaks. These fit easily over my boots, and the instep guards were a nice touch. With a durable three-layer membrane and a 20,000-mm waterproof rating, these will hold up against any and all weather the mountain throws at you. When I wore them on a wet snowy day, they beaded and sloughed off moisture well. —Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket for $259: This puffy hoodie is a great mid-layer for under a shell jacket. The insulation is made from recycled rope scraps, and the outer is coated in wind-resistant PFC-free DWR coating. The hem falls at the hips, and the high collar and tight hood keep most of the face covered. I like wearing this piece under shells for snowboarding, but I know it’ll pull double duty as a comfy hiking and camping jacket, too, so it’s a solid multipurpose investment. It’s exceptionally lightweight and warm, though from a volume standpoint, it is on the bulkier side for a mid-layer and isn’t the most packable piece. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Evolved Air Half Zip for $112: This fleece pullover has a waffle-like texture that traps heat and wicks moisture. With a high zippered collar and cinchable hem, you can adjust the fit to make it more air-tight or breathable. This mid-layer felt wonderfully lightweight while still keeping my toasty. It’s not bulky at all, only a little thicker than a base layer, laid comfortably under my jackets, and moved with me on the mountain. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Lifa Base Layer Long-Sleeve Crew for $115 and Pants for $115: These base layers hit the weight sweet spot; they’re not too thick or thin, but just right. They’re slightly looser than other options on this list, so if you prefer something that isn’t so fitted, these are a great pick (but note that they run long too). These combine merino wool with Helly Hansen’s LIFA fibers, which add more moisture-wicking capabilities. They’re soft, lightweight, warm, and don’t hold onto smells. I love the cute designs and how well they regulate my temperature under insulated jackets and pants. The waist digs in a bit but doesn’t roll, and they stay in place and move well. —Kristin Canning\n\nHow to Layer AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We have a full guide on how to layer, but here are your essentials. Base layer: A good set of thermals is essential in the fight against cold, especially when you’re working hard. The best fabrics wick away sweat as you heat up, which helps regulate your temperature. Merino wool is the best at this, but also the most expensive. Synthetic fabrics are getting better, though, and please avoid cotton at all costs, as it gets wet and stays that way, making you cold and uncomfortable. Mid layer: Whether you choose a hooded fleece or puffer-style jacket, this layer does the bulk of the work in cold conditions. Combined with the base layer, it traps warm air in, while also allowing moisture to be expelled. Synthetic insulation such as Primaloft Gold is brilliant and doesn’t lose its properties if it gets wet. Down jackets offer the best warmth-to-weight ratio, but they don’t pack down as small, and should never get wet. A fleece with an insulated vest is a great option if you really feel the cold. Jacket: While ski jackets with insulation offer bonus warmth in Arctic-like conditions, for most people a waterproof shell will be enough, as it offers protection from both the snow and the wind. A cold wind will chill you to your bones faster than a bit of wet snow. Ideally choose a jacket with a waterproof membrane such as Gore-Tex (make sure it is free from PFAS, or forever chemicals), but also check for taped seams for added waterproofing, plus plenty of pockets for snacks and lift passes, and wrist cuffs and ski skirts to help keep out the snow. Socks: As with your base layer, socks keep you warm and maintain your temperature when you’re building up a sweat. Natural fabrics work well, but a blend of merino wool with synthetic stretchy fibers is the way to go, as they stay up better and can be used for more than a day. Avoid cotton again, and never wear two pairs, as you’ll almost certainly get colder feet. Gloves: You’ll be surprised by how wet ski gloves get when it’s snowing, even if you don’t fall very often. As a result, waterproof options work best in most cases, although well-made leather designs can be almost as waterproof as a pair with Gore-Tex. Mittens are generally warmer than gloves, but what you gain in toasty fingers you lose in dexterity. Check out our Best Ski Gloves and Mittens guide for more information. Waterproofing and breathability ratings: Waterproofing is measured with a hydrostatic head rating, or HH. That means if you put a 1-inch, endlessly long square tube on top of the fabric, you could pour 20,000 millimeters of water before it would seep through. Breathability is rated in how many grams of vapor per square meter can can pass through the fabric in 24 hours. How We Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I've been reviewing winter sports gear for more than 15 years. In that time, I have worn an untold number of jackets, pants, mid-layers, thermals, gloves, and mittens. I called on industry experts and professional skiers, and solicited opinions from fellow winter sport enthusiasts on the WIRED team. While a basic fit check can be done in the office, nothing replaces on-mountain testing in variable conditions. We put in the time on various trips to the French Alps, as well as in resorts in Vermont, Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "The first time Alesandra Madison’s husband incorporated AI into their relationship was in late 2024.\n\nShe’d forgotten to do her “nightly kneeling ritual,” and he asked ChatGPT how to properly discipline her. The large language model suggested “a two-in-one punishment,” she says—write 100 lines of “I will remember to kneel for my Dom every night” while kneeling the entire time.\n\nThough the couple started exploring kink in their marriage 15 years ago—they are in a dominant-submissive relationship—the AI-generated punishment was new territory for them.\n\nSince then, Madison, who is 44 and lives in Los Angeles, says she has come to think of AI as “a powerful enhancement tool” for kink. “A lot of the times in dom-sub dynamics, when the submissive misbehaves—if it’s consented to—you will have a punishment. You want something specific to fit the crime, basically. It’s like a fresh set of eyes on your relationship.”\n\nAI represents a unique evolution in how power is distributed for people into bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism—BDSM. The lifestyle structure, as everyone WIRED spoke to for this story noted, is grounded in the core tenets of consent, safety, communication, and trust. But for those dealing with trust issues, or who simply want a nonjudgmental space to ask questions about BDSM, AI is becoming an increasingly appealing option.\n\n“I’ve gotten value out of AI helping me understand myself better as a submissive. I sometimes ask it questions or describe something that feels confusing to me and ask it to help me understand,” one user posted in the r/SubSanctuary subreddit, where discussions involve topics like impact play, the feeling of “being owned,” and how to move on when the relationship has reached its end. Madison says there are different reasons why AI doms appeal to certain subs. They are always available, easily customizable—“You can make them playful or sadistic,” she noted in a video—and there is low risk to exploring for newbies."

            "content": "You might think you’ve got enough headphones. Most of us have accrued at least two or three pairs over the years, and might have a few more half-working pairs stuck in a drawer somewhere. But I’m here to tell you, if you haven’t fully explored the fabulous world of specialized headphones that has exploded in the past decade, from open earbuds to sports and travel cans, you’re not maximizing your sonic potential. The best headphones are now so varied that they often depend entirely on what you intend to use them for. That means the best headphones for you probably come in many shapes and sizes, and you might actually want more than one pair.\n\nBalling out on lots of headphones for every one of life's situations doesn’t necessarily mean spending a lot of money. Unless you’re successfully riding the “boomcession,” there’s a fair chance spare cash is tight right now. Luckily, there’s a veritable explosion of impressive budget brands making great stuff, alongside household brands pitching to the cheap seats.\n\nAs an audio reviewer for well over a decade, I’ve tried hundreds of models across every color in the headphone rainbow. Here’s how to shop right so you can get the most out of any and all of them, as well as the best headphones I can think of in every category right now.\n\nNoise-Canceling Earbuds: The 2026 Baseline\n\nLet's start with the modern one-and-done choice: Noise-canceling earbuds are the ultimate jack-of-all-trades. If you only want to own one pair, this is it. The best noise-canceling earbuds sound great, fit neatly in your pocket, and are equally adept at letting in or blocking out environmental sounds to adapt to any situation.\n\nIt’s probably no surprise that the wildly popular AirPods Pro are the best headphones for iPhone owners, thanks to impressive performance, loads of features, and seamless integration with all things Apple. They’re a massive step up from the standard AirPods, which offer similar Apple-friendly features and a touch of noise canceling, but don’t perform nearly as well as even most budget earbuds.\n\nBose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor more phone-agnostic options, Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 are the ultimate noise killers, while Sony’s new WF-1000XM6 offer great sound and utterly natural transparency mode. Technics' EAH AZ100 are among my favorites for sound quality.\n\nIf those are too pricey, fear not! Budget earbud options are varied and plentiful, from Android-optimized midrangers like the Google Pixel Buds 2a to the stylish Nothing Ear (a) or highly affordable Soundcore Space A40. If you’re keeping to one pair, I’d put in all your chips for better performance, but there’s no shortage of great affordable options, and new pairs at all prices keep rolling in.\n\nNoise-Canceling Over-Ears: Comfort Meets Performance\n\nAnyone who’s taken a long flight can probably relate to the fact that sticking something in your ears for five hours-plus isn’t an exercise in comfort. Enter travel headphones like the best noise-canceling over-ears, which have adapted from early models like Bose’s stalwart QC 25 to become among the most advanced and downright luxurious audio products for your money. They’re great for other tasks too, from working in a busy office to commuting or simply chilling at home in tranquil reverie.\n\nAirPods Max Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nThe latest and greatest, like Sony’s WH-1000XM6 and Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra, apply uncompromising noise cancellation, plush comfort for long listening, and a pile of advanced features like pausing when you speak or automatic sleeping and waking. The Ultra are my favorite for sheer comfort, but there are plenty of rivals like Sonos’ equally comfy Ace, the iconic (and heavy) AirPods Max, or the utterly immersive B&W Px7 S3. Cheaper options abound, but some of my favorites include Sony’s high-punching WH-CH720, the crazy-affordable Soundcore Life Q30, or its newer cousin, the Space One. These won’t bring the same level of performance or tranquility, but they still work great for long flights and beyond.\n\nOpen Earbuds: For Keeping Alert\n\nHere’s where things get really fun: Open earbuds have exploded faster than any other audio segment in recent memory, with a kaleidoscope of options from virtually every audio brand. Designed to keep your ears open while delivering satisfying sound, the best open earbuds aren’t ideal for everything you do, but they're fantastic for specialized activities like ebike riding, where wind resistance renders artificial transparency modes useless. Over time, I've found tons of other cool use cases, from walking the dog to sneaking in some Olympics at the bar.\n\nOpen Earbuds come in various design types, from wacky bone-conductors to wraparound models and—my personal favorite—clip-ons. Their light and ergonomic housings aim to essentially disappear on your ears for all-day listening, and it works better than you might think.\n\nYou could spend a lot on pairs like Bose’s excellent Open Ultra, but you really don’t have to, since even the best models are limited in performance. Soundcore’s Aeroclip are my favorite value-to-performance pair, but plenty of cheaper options get the job done, like Acefast’s nearly free Acefit Air or Soundpeat’s Pearclip Pro. Open earbuds are easily my favorite new audio trend.\n\nWorkout Headphones: Keep Moving\n\nThere’s an obvious Venn diagram overlap between open earbuds and workout headphones, but if you don’t like the idea of keeping your ears open, traditional sports models are a great alternative. My favorite is the revamped Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, which offer tons of features in a wraparound design that’s nearly unshakeable. I like that they’re optimized for Apple devices, but still work well for Android, and they come with great noise canceling and transparency mode, but also a high price.\n\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nLike open earbuds, there are plenty of cheap options, including the similarly unshakeable (but much more basic) Jlab Go Air Sport, which run a mere $30 or less on sale. If you’re not into the minimalist thing, WIRED editor Adrienne So swears by the BlueAnt Pump X over-ear headphones for weightlifting, in large part due to their cooling-gel earpads that go in the fridge overnight to keep sweat at bay. They’ve also got noise canceling and plenty of battery life at over 50 hours per charge. For jogging or cycling, open earbuds are likely a better fit, while some folks simply use the AirPods Pro, but it can be nice to just have a dedicated pair in your gym bag.\n\nWired Headphones: Plug It In\n\nCourtesy of Shure Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Shure SE-112GR $69 Amazon $69 Adorama\n\nThe youth delight in resurrecting old tech that the more seasoned among us have long left for dead (cassette tapes?!). In the case of wired headphones, there’s good reason to plug in, starting with improved performance for your dollars. If you’re a content creator, musician, or simply a cash-savvy sound connoisseur, you can get an impressive return from wired options that avoid the sound degradation of many wireless options.\n\nSome of our favorite affordable options include affordable and classic-looking earbuds like Shure’s iconic SE-112 and Sennheiser’s impressive IE200, and studio-friendly over-ears like Audio-Technica’s ATH-M20x, If you’re willing to spend a bit more, the fantastic Sennheiser HD6XX offer the best sound for the money I’ve heard in any headphone segment. Based on the much pricier HD 650, these are open-back headphones that let in exterior sounds, but the performance is incredible. If you want even better sound and design, there are tons of options, but they’ll cost you.\n\nFancy Headphones: The Audiophile Angle\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nCourtesy of Grado Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Grado Signature S750 $1,675 Grado\n\nIf you really want to optimize the wired connection, there’s a whole segment of audiophile headphones made with high-quality materials, innovative speaker technologies, elevated designs, and accordingly elevated pricing. There are a whole bunch of varieties, but for the sake of levity I’ll break them down into two categories: in-ear monitors (IEMs), the fancy version of in-ear headphones, and over-ears.\n\nIEMs generally use dynamic drivers, the traditional driver type in most headphones and speakers, balanced armatures, much smaller and more accurate speakers, or a mix of both. My favorite pairs come from Ultimate Ears, like the UE 18+ Pro, which are customized for your ears using 3D printing and other techniques. (You’ve likely seen these on TV for musicians and broadcasters.) Other IEMs we like include Sennheiser’s IE 900 and models from Campfire Audio.\n\nMeze Poet Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor over-ear headphones, Audeze’s planar magnetic headphones are among my favorites, starting as low as $500 (yeah, I know) in the excellent LCD-S20 closed-back headphones. Another incredible pair I recently tested are Meze’s Poet, which are not only the most gorgeous-looking pair I’ve reviewed, but also offer among the clearest and most articulate sound I’ve laid ears on. There are dozens more to try, as audiophilia is its own journey, but this is a good starting point. We recently reviewed the Grado Signature S750, which have an effortlessly expansive sound that feels like it can't possibly be coming from mere centimeters away from your eardrums.\n\nOther Headphone Types and Upcoming Features\n\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\n\nCourtesy of Best Buy Save to wishlist Save to wishlist SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3P Wireless $110 Amazon $110 Best Buy\n\nAs I’m sure some of you have already noted, there are still more types of specialty headphones, including Gaming Headsets, which are another animal altogether, and even TV Headphones, which quickly transition from the screen's internal speakers to let you listen in silence without latency. I’m currently testing a new TV headphones bundle from Sennheiser, the RS 275, which includes a dedicated pair of headphones in the HDR 275 and Sennheiser’s new BTA1 Auracast transmitter (verdict to come).\n\nSpeaking of Auracast, it’s an increasingly cool new type of Bluetooth protocol that allows connection of an infinite number of devices at up to 100 meters, like an FM radio signal. Its implementation is still in its early stages, but it’s a good feature to look for in new headphones. Other features to consider include an app with an EQ and presets (which the majority of my recommendations include), multipoint pairing to connect to two or more devices at once (again, pretty ubiquitous), and spatial audio features for video formats like Dolby Atmos."

            "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board has changed its tune after Paramount Skydance's most recent effort to thwart the Netflix merger-acquisition. On Tuesday, Feb. 24, Paramount submitted a revised all-cash bid of $31 per share to buy WBD in its entirety. Warner Bros. has reviewed the proposal and, on Thursday, announced that its board of directors finds the offer to be \"superior\" to the Netflix agreement. Netflix has four days to respond.\n\nIf this new bid is approved, Paramount would not only pay $31 per share in cash, but it'd also be on the hook for a $2.8 billion termination fee that WBD would owe Netflix for backing out of their agreement. Additionally, the company would also be responsible for paying \"a daily ticking fee equal to $0.25 per share per quarter beginning after September 30, 2026,\" according to WBD, and pony up $7 billion should the deal not pass regulatory requirements.\n\nNetflix, meanwhile, has been formally notified and can choose to revise its offer -- or walk away. Should the streamer move to amend its deal, WBD's board and team of financial and legal advisors will decide which of the two companies ultimately has submitted the best proposal. Paramount's deal is backed by cash from Larry Ellison, the billionaire father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nThe merger-acquisition plan between Netflix and WBD was originally announced Dec. 5 for $83 billion (stocks and cash), which would enable the streamer to attain HBO, HBO Max and the Warner Bros. studio business. The deal has since seen several takeover bids from Paramount, prompting Netflix to switch to an all-cash deal in January while Paramount engaged in a back-and-forth to acquire all of WBD's assets.\n\nToday's announcement arrives on the day of WBD's Q4 earnings call, and the same day that Netflix's co-CEO visited Washington, DC, to meet with officials amid the Paramount bid. While 11 state attorneys general have expressed opposition to the WBD-Netflix deal, during a pre-Super Bowl interview with NBC, President Trump stated he would not get involved in this ongoing fight over WBD."

            "content": "Samsung has introduced three new S26 handsets at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of the year: the S26, the S26 Plus and the uber premium S26 Ultra. The S26 Ultra continues the company's tradition of Ultra handsets that offer top-of-the-line features that are lacking from the rest of their respective series. And this year, the Ultra's Privacy Display is the clear highlight feature, allowing you to customize how visible your phone is to others around you.\n\nAside from that, the S26 Ultra's other improvements are somewhat marginal. Yes, it's now made out of aluminum, the screen is a touch bigger, a 16GB RAM option is available, the processor is improved and the charging speeds are faster, but the rest of the S26 Ultra's features are similar to that of the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Even the price remains the same at $1,300.\n\nHere is how the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra compares with the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nWatch this: First Look at the Galaxy S26 Ultra: Camera, Battery and AI Updates 02:56\n\nDesign and display\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra only has a marginally larger screen compared to the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Both the S24 Ultra and the S25 Ultra have 6.8-inch AMOLED screens with 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution, while the new S26 Ultra has a 6.9-inch AMOLED display also with a 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution. All three screens have a 1 to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate.\n\nBut it's the pixel-level Privacy Display that's particularly impressive with the S26 Ultra. When activated, the display will remain visible when looking directly at the phone while making it difficult to impossible to see what's on screen from the side. In addition to letting you turn the feature on and off for different apps, you can even have the Privacy Display activate exclusively for notifications while keeping the rest of the screen plainly visible.\n\nThe S26 Ultra's screen uses Gorilla Glass Armor 2 cover glass, while the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra both use Gorilla Glass Armor. Gorilla Glass Armor 2 is said to be more scratch and drop resistant compared to its earlier version.\n\nSize-wise, the S26 Ultra is a touch bigger but also a touch thinner compared to its predecessors. CNET Senior Reporter Abrar Al-Heeti describes the new design as feeling thinner and lighter than prior Ultra phones during her hands-on time. It measures 6.44 by 3.07 by 0.31 inches, while the S25 Ultra's dimensions are 6.41 by 3.06 by 0.32 inches and the S24 Ultra measures 6.4 by 3.11 by 0.34 inches. Also, the S26 Ultra has an aluminum frame. That's a departure from the titanium frame found on both the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nThe cameras on the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nCameras\n\nWhile the S26 Ultra certainly has the best camera hardware of the S26 lineup, it has the same exact camera specs as its predecessors. All three Ultra phones have four cameras: a 200-megapixel wide, a 50-megapixel ultrawide, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and a 50-megapixel 5x telephoto. That said, the S26 Ultra does have larger apertures and to capture better low-light photos. They also all have a 12-megapixel front-facing camera.\n\nMany of the S26 Ultra's camera upgrades come from software. There's the Horizontal Lock feature that'll keep the horizon steady while shooting video, selfies can now capture more natural skin tones and screenshots will now be sorted into its own categories within the Gallery.\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nBattery, processor and RAM\n\nAll three Ultra phones have a 5,000 mAh battery, but the charging speeds differ. The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra have 45W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, while the new S26 Ultra has 60W of wired charging and 25W wireless charging. Just like the S25 Ultra, the S26 Ultra does not include magnets but can support magnetic charging accessories when using a case that includes them.\n\nThe processors in the Ultra phones also get progressively faster and more efficient with each generation. The S24 Ultra has Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the S25 Ultra uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy and the S26 Ultra ships with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy.\n\nWhile all three Ultra handsets come in three storage capacity options -- 256GB, 512GB and 1TB -- the S26 Ultra is the only one with a 16GB RAM option. (This ships with the 512GB and 1TB options.) The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra only ship with 12GB of RAM.\n\nCheck out the below chart to compare more details between the S26 Ultra, S25 Ultra and S24 Ultra."

            "content": "Dell sells a wide variety of laptops, and many models are available in multiple configurations to match your performance and budget needs. If you need help finding the right Dell laptop, we can help. Here are the main considerations to keep in mind when shopping for a new laptop.\n\nPrice\n\nThe search for a new laptop for most people starts with price. If the statistics chipmaker Intel and PC manufacturers hurl at us are correct, you'll be holding onto your next laptop for at least three years. If you can afford to stretch your budget a little to get better specs, do it. That stands whether you're spending $500 or more than $1,000. In the past, you could get away with spending less upfront with an eye toward upgrading memory and storage in the future. Laptop makers are increasingly moving away from making components easily upgradable, so again, it's best to get as much laptop capability as you can afford from the start.\n\nGenerally speaking, the more you spend, the better the laptop. That could mean better components for faster performance, a nicer display, sturdier build quality, a smaller or lighter design from higher-end materials or even a more comfortable keyboard. All of these things add to the cost of a laptop. I'd love to say $500 will get you a powerful gaming laptop, for example, but that's not the case. Right now, the sweet spot for a reliable laptop that can handle average work, home office or school tasks is between $700 and $800, and a reasonable model for creative work or gaming is upward of about $1,000. The key is to look for discounts on models in all price ranges so you can get more laptop capability for less. Like other vendors, Dell is constantly running sales on laptops on its site.\n\nSize\n\nIf you'll be taking your laptop with you to class or work or just down to your local coffee shop most mornings, then you'll want a smaller and lighter laptop -- something with a 13-inch or 14-inch screen. If you're buying a laptop for your home or work and don't plan on traveling with it with any great frequency, then it might serve you well to get a larger 15-inch, 16-inch or even a 17-inch display that gives you more room to work, play and multitask.\n\nDisplay\n\nWhen deciding on a display, there are many considerations: How much you need to display (which is surprisingly more about resolution than screen size), what types of content you'll be looking at, and whether you'll be using it for gaming or creative endeavors.\n\nYou really want to optimize pixel density; that is, the number of pixels per inch the screen can display. Although other factors contribute to sharpness, a higher pixel density usually means sharper rendering of text and interface elements. (You can easily calculate the pixel density of any screen at DPI Calculator if you don't feel like doing the math, and you can also find out what math you need to do there.) We recommend a dot pitch of at least 100 pixels per inch as a rule of thumb.\n\nBecause of the way Windows can scale the display, you're frequently better off with a higher resolution than you'd think. You can always make things bigger on a high-resolution screen, but you can never make them smaller -- to fit more content in the view -- on a low-resolution screen. This is why a 4K, 14-inch screen may sound like unnecessary overkill, but may not be if you need to, say, view a wide spreadsheet.\n\nText and the edges of images can look fuzzy on a lower-resolution display. Look for a Full HD 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution at a minimum -- or a 1,920x1,200-pixel resolution on laptops with 16:10 aspect ratios that are taller than traditional 16:9 widescreen displays and provide more vertical screen space for work without significantly increasing the footprint. A Quad HD resolution of 2,560x1,440 pixels (2,560x1,600 on a 16:10 display) will result in crisper text and images and will likely suffice on a 13- or 14-inch laptop display -- you don't necessarily need a 4K display.\n\nProcessor\n\nThe processor, aka the CPU, is the brain of a laptop. Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows laptops, with Qualcomm as a new third option with its Arm-based Snapdragon X processors. Both Intel and AMD offer a staggering selection of mobile processors. Making things trickier, both manufacturers have chips designed for different laptop styles, like power-saving chips for ultraportables or faster processors for gaming laptops. Their naming conventions will let you know what type is used. You can head to Intel's or AMD's sites for explanations so you get the performance you want. Generally speaking, the faster the processor speed and the more cores it has, the better the performance will be.\n\nBattery life has less to do with the number of cores and more to do with CPU architecture, Arm versus x86. Apple’s Arm-based MacBooks and the first Arm-based Copilot Plus PCs we’ve tested offer better battery life than laptops based on x86 processors from Intel and AMD.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics processor, or GPU, handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up a lot of graphics-related (and increasingly, AI-related) operations. For Windows laptops, there are two types of GPUs: integrated or discrete. As the names imply, an iGPU is part of the CPU package, while a dGPU is a separate chip with dedicated memory (VRAM) that it communicates with directly, making it faster than sharing memory with the CPU.\n\nBecause the iGPU splits space, memory and power with the CPU, it's constrained by the limits of those. It allows for smaller, lighter laptops, but doesn't perform nearly as well as a dGPU. There are some games and creative software that won't run unless they detect a dGPU or sufficient VRAM. Most productivity software, video streaming, web browsing and other nonspecialized apps will run fine on an iGPU, though.\n\nFor more power-hungry graphics needs, like video editing, STEM and design applications as well as gaming, you'll need a dGPU; there are only two real companies that make them, Nvidia and AMD, with Intel offering some based on the Xe-branded (or the older UHD Graphics branding) iGPU technology in its CPUs.\n\nMemory\n\nFor memory, we highly recommend 16GB of RAM, with 8GB being the absolute bare minimum. RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and SSD, which is slower. A lot of sub-$500 laptops have 4GB or 8GB, which, in conjunction with a slower disk, can make for a frustratingly slow Windows laptop experience. Also, many laptops now have the memory soldered onto the motherboard. Most manufacturers disclose this, but if the RAM type is LPDDR, assume it's soldered and can't be upgraded.\n\nSome PC makers will solder memory on and leave an empty internal slot for adding a stick of RAM. You may need to contact the laptop manufacturer or find the laptop's full specs online to confirm. Check the web for user experiences, because the slot may still be hard to get to, it may require nonstandard or hard-to-get memory or other pitfalls, including voiding the warranty.\n\nStorage\n\nYou'll still find cheaper hard drives in budget laptops and larger hard drives in gaming laptops, but faster solid-state drives have all but replaced hard drives in laptops. They can make a big difference in performance. Not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper laptops typically have slower drives. If the laptop only has 8GB of RAM, it may end up swapping to that drive, and the system may slow down quickly while you're working.\n\nGet what you can afford, and if you need to go with a smaller drive, you can always add an external drive or two down the road, or use cloud storage to bolster a small internal drive. The one exception is gaming laptops: We don't recommend going with less than a 512GB SSD unless you really like uninstalling games every time you want to play a new game."

As revealed on Thursday by the company's chief digital officer in an interview with The Verge, the fast-food chain is adding Patty, an AI chatbot, to the headsets some of its employees wear as part of a 500-location pilot later this year.\n\nThe Patty chatbot will assist with work tasks but will also monitor manners, ensuring employees use phrases such as \"please\" and \"thank you\" in customer interactions.\n\n\"This is meant to be a coaching tool,\" Burger King's Thibault Roux told The Verge.\n\nPatty, not to be mistaken for the Krabby Patty burger from SpongeBob SquarePants, will also perform tasks such as alerting the inventory management system when an item is out of stock. Patty is part of a larger AI-driven system called BK Assistant that will be in all Burger King restaurants by the end of the year.\n\nWhile Burger King will be using AI in headsets, Roux said it's not quite ready to use the technology for taking orders yet, although other fast-food chains have tried. While AI seems to be taking over entire industries, businesses such as Taco Bell have found that rolling out AI to hungry customers is a lot harder than it sounds. A pilot for AI ordering from McDonald's ended in 2024, unsuccessfully.\n\n\"Not every guest is ready for this,\" Roux said."
