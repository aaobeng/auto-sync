            "content": "THE KINGS of London derbies face another challenger to their crown on Sunday – but the stats show that Arsenal should once again have the better of Chelsea.\n\nThe Gunners have only lost one of their last TWENTY-FIVE London derbies in the Premier League, winning 18 and drawing six, with the solitary defeat coming at home to West Ham last February.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, in their last 44 derbies in the competition, the Gunners have scored in 42, with the Hammers the only side to prevent them from scoring in that run, with a 2-0 win in December 2023 and last February’s 1-0 success.\n\nAnd against the Blues, their record is also phenomenal, with Mikel Arteta losing just two of his 16 games in all competitions against the West London side.\n\nThe first of those losses came in his second game in charge of the Gunners in December 2019, and the other a 2-0 loss at the Emirates in August 2021, when Romelu Lukaku and Reece James were on target.\n\nThe current run of eight Prem games without a win against the Gunners (D3, L5) is their longest since the pre-Jose Mourinho days, when the Blues – not the force they would become – went 19 matches and TEN YEARS without victory from May 1995 until August 2005.\n\n\n\nIt even took Mourinho three attempts to beat the Gunners in the league when he arrived in 2004, with Didier Drogba’s strike ending their long run without a win.\n\nThe omens just keep getting worse for the Blues when you factor in that the two sides have already met in 2026, with the Gunners winning both legs of their Carabao Cup semi-final tie – 3-2 at Stamford Bridge and 1-0 in the return.\n\nThose games are the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered so far in his Blues reign, winning eight and drawing two of the other 10.\n\nBut the Blues boss has made a positive start in the league, winning both of his first two away matches at the helm.\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nAnd he could be the first English manager to win his first three on the road in the league for 12 years, since Tim Sherwood enjoyed wins at Southampton, Manchester United and Swansea in December 2013 and January 2014 as Tottenham manager.\n\nThey also do not have a good record when playing sides at the top of the table – losing eight of their last nine away from home, the exception a 2-1 win at Manchester City in May 2021.\n\nThey have travelled to face Arsenal nine times in the top flight when the Gunners have been in top spot, winning just once in March 1948.\n\nAnd the Blues’ discipline has been called into question after Wesley Fofana’s red card against Burnley last weekend, which was their sixth in the league this season – the most of any side and already their joint-most in a Prem campaign.\n\nMoises Caicedo was sent off when the sides met earlier this season, the seventh time a Chelsea player has been red carded against Arsenal – only against Liverpool (eight) do they have more.\n\n\n\nAnd that could be one of the reasons why the Blues have found it tough to hold on to a lead, dropping a whopping NINETEEN points from leading positions in the Prem.\n\nOnly West Ham (20) have done so more, although it’s much more of a problem at home for Chelsea, having dropped 17 of those points at Stamford Bridge, including in their last two games where they were pegged back by Leeds and then Burnley.\n\nThe Blues must also be wary of Eberechi Eze, who netted twice in Arsenal’s 4-1 win at North London rivals Tottenham last weekend.\n\nEach of his last 11 Prem goals – five for Crystal Palace and all six so far for Arsenal – have been scored in London.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nAnd those six in red have all come in London derbies too, one against his former club and five against Spurs.\n\n\n\nThe last Gunners player to net more than six London derby goals in a season was Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in 2018-19 (seven), while no player has ever scored more in a season without scoring outside of a London derby."

You’re good friends, right?\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nJOAO PEDRO: Our relationship will build more and more, we play here in Chelsea and with the national team. We travel together and train together. I spend more time with them than with my family.\n\nANDREY SANTOS: It is true!\n\nJP: We are always close in the training ground, outside also we always try and do something together. Because we are Brazilian, we came here to do the same thing.\n\nAS: This relationship is very important to us, Joao is the big brother!\n\n\n\nESTEVAO WILLIAN: We have a lot of time together. I love you!\n\nMy adaptation was a lot easier because you guys were here to help me and they try to help me every day.\n\nJR: Brazil to London is a long way to come for a teenager, how have you found it?\n\nEW: The best thing about London, I used to live in Sao Paulo and it is similar to London and a very busy city that has everything. The worst thing is the weather… I am too cold.\n\nJP: He will adapt! I like London and living here, I learned everything here. Different kinds of food, I learned Spanish, English…\n\nAS: French now!\n\n\n\nJP: Yeah, I try to learn French now. The culture here helped me to grow up, I came when I was a kid. I like to live here and now that I am in Chelsea.\n\nJR: Joao, we’re told you had too much passion when you started at Watford, trying to fight everyone, has that changed?\n\nAS: He is still the same!\n\nJP: I am. If I lose this, I need to stop playing football. South American players are similar. Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez, we are very similar because we have that fire inside. Everyone wants to win.\n\n\n\nJR: Estevao, the fans got behind you quickly and chant ‘Estevao, uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it!’ But what do you think of your nickname, ‘Steve’?\n\nEW: I can’t believe it! But I don’t mind what the fans call me because I love to see the way they sing about ‘I like it’.\n\nJP: When I came to England people couldn’t say my name properly. I was called John!\n\nJR: Liam Rosenior has had a big impact on all three of you, but Andrey you worked with him at Strasbourg . . .\n\nJP: His father, his father!\n\n\n\nAS: Since he came, it is much easier for me because I worked already with him, I know him and he knows me. Our relationship is so good and I am so happy to work with him.\n\nJP: He is very open. If he sees something, he goes straight to the player and asks. The first week I think I spoke with him four times in one week!\n\nHe is a very straight coach and me and the other players love that.\n\nJR: Joao, the manager also says you can be one of the world’s best strikers — can you?\n\nJP: Hopefully!\n\nAS: Of course he can do it.\n\n\n\nEW: Of course! For sure, you’re our No 9!\n\nJP: The group also believes in me, I have a good relationship with everyone. I have just tried to work hard every day. I know there is a lot of talk about me now but I am the same guy since I moved to England.\n\nI believe in my potential. When you score and things go well, people are going to talk and say that but I want to stay humble and just do my job.\n\nJR: Estevao, you have already had quite a few big moments in a Chelsea shirt, but is there a standout?\n\n\n\nEW: Liverpool!\n\nJP: Everyone enjoyed that goal, it was during his first weeks here in a big game and it made a big impression. For him to come on and score the last goal, I celebrated like he was my family. Everyone is happy with him, we just need to give him time to let him enjoy the moment.\n\nJR: Joao and Andrey, you won a trophy in America last summer at the Club World Cup. How are you all feeling about going back there for the World Cup finals with Brazil this summer — and just how hard will it be with their weather?\n\nAS: It was so hard last summer.\n\nJP: It was very hard because the pitch was fire, the games were very intense and we couldn’t lose because we would have been out of the tournament. But everyone enjoyed it and hopefully… we won the last time we were there so we can win again.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nEW: I am nervous but very excited, it is a dream for me hopefully to be in the Brazil squad.\n\nJP: With this relationship, soon we can achieve at least one more trophy with Chelsea, this is what we and the fans want. Then this year we have the World Cup and we’re hoping we can go together and do a great job."

            "content": "WHO needs Erling Haaland anyway?\n\nSkipper Bernardo Silva admitted earlier this year that Manchester City have almost become known as ‘Haaland FC’ at times this season.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Leeds-born forward missed out on a return ‘home’ – his first absence in the Prem this season – due to a training ground injury picked up on Thursday.\n\nTheir top scorer was missed – of course he was – but they got there in the end thanks to a goal right on half-time from Antoine Semenyo.\n\nWhen the Ghana international signed from Bournemouth in January, Haaland joked the new £62.5million signing was coming for his Golden Boot.\n\nHe’s got some distance to make up, eight more to be exact, but the big Norwegian will not want to miss too many games – although City have won 14 and lost two of 18 Prem games, averaging 2.4 points per game, without Haaland since he joined in 2022.\n\n\n\nHaaland – like everyone at the Etihad – knows about the quality and energy which the former man has brought over the last two months.\n\nWithout the main man, City rode their luck at times – but eventually put the heat right back on to Arsenal with a huge three points.\n\nElland Road under the lights is no place for the faint-hearted – although you could say the same about anywhere Leeds play during the hours of darkness.\n\nThey had not lost their last 25 games which have kicked off after 5pm – a run dating back almost three years.\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nAnd City knew it could be curtains for their title hopes if they became the latest victims.\n\nArsenal would have the chance to put some clear daylight at the top on Sunday afternoon if their nearest rivals slipped up.\n\nDaniel Farke’s men certainly lived up to it early on – giving the visitors one hell of a fright.\n\nBrendan Aaronson’s cross from the right fell perfectly an unmarked Dominic Calvert-Lewin but he slid his shot the wrong side of the post.\n\nThe former Everton man scored at the Etihad in November to kickstart a run of goals – he really should have had another there.\n\n\n\nBut Leeds had started on the front foot and there was a brief pause after 13 minutes to allow City’s three Muslim players – Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Omar Marmoush – to break their Ramadan fast.\n\nIt was explained on the big screens around the stadium – but was still roundly booed by many Elland Road fans who were enjoying the way their team had started.\n\nYet it didn’t put Leeds out of their stride with Calvert-Lewin shrugging off Marc Guehi then rolling a shot across the face of goal and wide.\n\n\n\nAll the big chances were coming for the home team with Gianluigi Donnarumma called into action to save from James Justin.\n\nThen Aaronson could not quite direct a low cross from Omar Bogle on target with his shot going the wrong side of the post.\n\nThey were not done yet either as American burst clear on to a pass from Ethan Ampadu but he never looked confident and Donnarumma dashed out to close him down.\n\nFinally Karl Darlow – who had been a virtual spectator – was called into action at the other end as he made a fine reaction stop to keep out Nico O’Reilly’s powerful header.\n\nThe England ace was starting to have an impact on the game and he almost created a chance for himself with a delightful turn on to Ait Nouri’s cross but was crowded out.\n\n\n\nThe balance of play was just starting to shift – and right on half-time the visitors went ahead.\n\nCherki and Ait Nouri combined delightfully down the left-hand side and the Algerian’s low cross was turned in by Semenyo.\n\nIronically, it was in the time added on so that the two Rayans could get some food and drink inside them that the goal came.\n\nThat is six goals in 11 appearances for City now – what an impact he has made.\n\nThe home crowd were sick and no wonder – the half-time lead certainly flattered the visitors.\n\n\n\nLeeds did not chuck in the towel though and Matheus Nunes made a terrific last-ditch tackle to block another effort from Calvert-Lewin.\n\nBut the game was more open now and a low cross from Nunes was turned over the bar by Marmoush a few minutes later.\n\nThen the Egyptian stretched to get on the end of a mis-hit shot from Ruben Dias but could not direct his effort on target.\n\nCity were making the best chances now and Darlow showed great agility to claw away a header from Guehi which was just sneaking in the corner.\n\nYet they had not put the came to bed and the home side finished as they started by putting the visitors under the cosh.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nSub Jaka Bijol got on the end of a corner but his header was inches wide with Donnarumma almost certainly not getting there.\n\nTempers flared after the full-time whistle as a furious Farke stormed on to the pitch to confront ref Peter Bankes, who immediately brandished a red card to the raging German."

Leeds boss Farke stormed over to Peter Bankes after the referee blew for full-time at Elland Road.\n\nBefore the German even reached Bankes, he pulled out his red card. Farke, 49, continued to remonstrate with Bankes about a number of decisions, and he had to be pulled away by Leeds goalkeeper Karl Darlow.\n\nBoth sets of players were then involved in somewhat of a melee. City manager Pep Guardiola had to intervene while Farke chose to do a lap of the pitch and applaud Leeds' fans.\n\nLeeds assistant Eddie Riemer replaced Farke at Leeds' post-match press conference and explained: \"I just had a short chat with him...

The result extended Leeds' run without a win to three games, with Farke's team only six points above the relegation zone.\n\nSemenyo hailed City's win, telling Sky Sports: \"Definitely a big one.

The deadlock was broken in the dying embers of the first half when Semenyo ghosted in between Leeds' centre-halves to finish a slick move from six yards.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSemenyo's strike proved to be the game's decisive moment as neither City or Leeds were able to find the net in the second half. Here are Mirror Football's big talking points from the game...\n\nErling Haaland OUT of Man City vs Leeds clash in injury blow for Pep Guardiola READ MORE :\n\nVAR gets EVEN MORE power as football lawmakers make controversial rule changes READ MORE :\n\n1) No Haaland, no problem\n\nThe big talking point pre-match was the absence of Erling Haaland: Manchester City's imperious Leeds-born striker who would have almost certainly led the line for Pep Guardiola's side. Step forward, Semenyo.\n\nCity's January acquisition from Bournemouth predominantly played centrally to try and plug the gap left by Haaland and it was his sixth goal since moving to The Etihad which nudged the visitors in front.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHaaland exudes main character energy and, barring any major change in circumstances, will be City's main man for a long time to come. But Semenyo's impact since linking up with City has been significant - and he's quickly becoming an important figure in this team.\n\n2) O'Reilly worry\n\nView 4 Images Nico O'Reilly impressed again for Manchester City against Leeds (Image: Oli Scarff/AFP)\n\nSemenyo may have caught the eye for City recently, but he's far from alone on that front. And Nico O'Reilly produced another impressive display in an advanced midfield position as he continues to build a compelling case to make England's World Cup squad.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nExcellent filling in at left-back, O'Reilly was at the heart of plenty of good things here, even if he was unable to continue his fine scoring run after plundering three goals in his last two games.\n\nThe sight of him hobbling off the field in the second half, then, was the only sour note on an evening which could prove to be pivotal in the title race. City will hope O'Reilly's issue is nothing serious.\n\n3) Calvert-Lewin and Leeds fail to fire\n\nView 4 Images Dominic Calvert-Lewin led the line for Leeds against Manchester City (Image: Justin Setterfield)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDaniel Farke quipped that Calvert-Lewin was 'the only striker to come close' to Erling Haaland after anointing the City man as the world's best centre forward. And with the Norwegian missing, Calvert-Lewin took centre stage.\n\nThe former Everton man has enjoyed a renaissance at Elland Road and already had 10 goals to his name before Saturday evening's big game. He had two golden chances to add to that tally in the opening 20 minutes but was unable to take either of them.\n\nHe was, though, a constant thorn in the City defence's side and will have a key role to play in Leeds' bid to beat the drop.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n4) City stand firm\n\nWhile it's Semenyo who leaves with the headlines, another of City's January signings, Marc Guehi, played his part here alongside Ruben Dias the rest of the backline.\n\nIt's now two clean sheets in three for City, who have chalked up four straight wins. That should come as no surprise as this is generally the stage of the season where Guardiola's team starts to pur...\n\n5) Game on in title race\n\nView 4 Images Pep Guardiola and Manchester City are closing in on Arsenal (Image: Simon Stacpoole/Offside)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNot for the first time in recent weeks, the onus is on Arsenal to respond after City potentialy propelled themselves to within a game of the league leaders.\n\nArsenal play tomorrow, of course, and could restore the five-point gap that existed between the two teams at the start of the weekend.

He has always seemed too cool to be a badge-kisser but that is what it looked like the captain was doing after his header provided early confirmation of an incoming Liverpool win.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThis troubled title defence has hurt Van Dijk, make no mistake. He has been the player who has had to field the criticism. He has been the voice of a dressing-room under scrutiny. His own performances have not been immune to negative inspection, Wayne Rooney the most prominent pundit to suggest the centre-half had not been at his imperious best.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd Rooney's remarks were not baseless. No Liverpool player - apart, maybe, from Dominik Szoboszlai - has been exemplary this season. Even here, Van Dijk was not flawless, blindsided by Tomas Soucek for the goal that gave West Ham United a semblance of optimism early in the second half.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut Van Dijk's third goal in the last six Premier League games was crucial in ensuring Liverpool maintained momentum in the battle for Champions League spots. It doubled the lead that had been provided by Hugo Ekitike's 11th Premier League goal of an encouraging first campaign and also highlighted Liverpool's startling set-piece resurgence.\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE! Latest Reds news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nLiverpool surprise transfer confirmed as late deal done in Trent Alexander-Arnold repeat READ MORE :\n\nFrom a corner routine later in the first half, Alexis Mac Allister scored the third. And even though Soucek's sharp thinking brought Nuno Espirito Santo's side a well-deserved reward, it turned out to be one of two consolation efforts in a slightly odd encounter.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn open play, for long periods of the contest, West Ham were more than a match for the Premier League champions but their defending - of set-pieces in particular - was pretty abysmal. Liverpool took full advantage to produce a scoreline that was far more convincing than the performance.\n\nThe fourth goal was an individual effort from Cody Gakpo but continued the theme of abject defending. It was a theme Liverpool warmed to, with Van Dijk and his teammates allowing a Jarrod Bowen corner to bounce before it was headed home by Taty Castellanos.\n\nBACK THE MIRROR! Ensure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Virgil van Dijk made it 2-0 against West Ham (Image: Dan Mullan/Getty Images)\n\nAnd before an Axel Diasi own goal gave the final winning margin a look that distinctly did not reflect the balance of play, Crysencio Summerville wasted a great chance to give Liverpool a really nervous finale. But while the scoreboard flattered Arne Slot's side, this was a third Premier League win on the spin and, from the manager’s point of view, there were some encouraging performances.\n\nThe cameo from Jeremie Frimpong, who was returning from a month's absence and who forced the Disasi mistake, was particularly eye-catching. There was also one dazzling moment from another substitute, Rio Ngumoha, and the noticeable contribution of the 17-year-old, and of Frimpong, actually highlighted another quite frustrating afternoon for Mohamed Salah.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOf course, when you are part of a side that wins 5-2, you should not be THAT frustrated but Salah has now gone 10 Premier League games without scoring. And quite frankly, he did not look like scoring in a game where most people looked like scoring.\n\nView 3 Images Mo Salah hasn't scored a Premier League goal since November (Image: Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\nThere can be no doubt the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold and the restructuring of the attacking system had a negative impact on Salah's form, and too often, he cut an isolated figure. But he also looks to be lacking in physical and mental sharpness, too often taking the wrong options.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLate on, he ignored a goal-threatening run from Frimpong to take on a thankless task of his own and that did not go unnoticed by the home crowd. While his team are winning, Slot will not be overly concerned and Ngumoha is, right now, probably best suited to the role of impact substitute.\n\nBut if Liverpool are to go deeper in the Champions League and maintain their Premier League push, they are going to need Salah to respond to the critical attention. In the same way that Virgil van Dijk has.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The new Formula 1 season is scheduled to kick off at the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit on Sunday, March 8 at 4am GMT.\n\nHowever, approximately 2,000 team and organisational staff have had to alter their routes after Doha and Dubai - which are significant stopover hubs for Qatar and Emirates airlines - were closed on Saturday. Due to airport closures, F1 travellers have been rerouted onto flights via Hong Kong and Singapore, whilst others are taking direct flights to Perth and Qantas.\n\nAn F1 spokesperson said: \"Our next three races are in Australia, China and Japan, not in the Middle East - those races are not for a number of weeks. As always, we closely monitor any situation like this and work closely with relevant authorities.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! All the best sports news and much more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nDespite F1 bosses maintaining that the Australian, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia Grand Prix will proceed as scheduled in April, it's understood that they have backup plans ready should there be a need to alter venues.\n\nMeanwhile, F1 tyre supplier Pirelli has called off their two-day wet tyre test in Bahrain. In a statement to PlanetF1.com, Pirelli said: \"The two days of development tests for wet-weather compounds, scheduled for today and tomorrow at the Bahrain International Circuit, have been cancelled for security reasons following the evolving international situation.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"All Pirelli personnel currently in Manama are safe in their hotels. The company is working to ensure their safety and arrange their return to Italy and the UK as soon as possible.\"\n\nFootball\n\nFIFA have announced that they will \"monitor developments\" in Iran following US action in the region. The country has qualified for the 2026 World Cup and is set to play several group stage matches across North America, but FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom has indicated that their situation will be monitored in the lead-up to the tournament.\n\nSpeaking at the International Football Association Board's annual general meeting in Cardiff on Saturday, Grafstrom said: \"I read the news [about Iran] this morning the same way you did. We had a meeting today, and it is premature to comment in detail, but we will monitor developments around all issues around the world.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images USA and Israel's conflict with Iran is developing (Image: Getty)\n\n\"We had the finals draw in Washington in which all teams participated, and our focus is on a safe World Cup with all the teams participating. We will continue to communicate as we always do with three [host] governments, as we always do in any case. Everybody will be safe.\"\n\nElsewhere, Richard Keys was pulled off air at beIN Sports following the UK government's advice for British nationals in the Middle East to \"take immediate shelter.\" The presenter, who has been based in Qatar for over a decade, was unable to broadcast due to the strikes on Iran, leading beIN to switch to coverage based in London.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nKeys wrote on X: \"Thank you all for your messages. It was a bit lively earlier. I don't have space to express my feelings about that idiot Trump. No show today. You'll be in the capable hands of our colleagues in London. Thoughts and prayers for everyone in our region. Ramadan Kareem.\"\n\nThe broadcaster's decision was based on advice from the Foreign Office, which read: \"Due to reported missile attacks, British nationals in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates should immediately shelter in place. Remain indoors in a secure location, avoid all travel and follow instructions from the local authorities.\"\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite the ongoing conflict, the Saudi Pro League's round of matchweek 24 fixtures will proceed as scheduled, including Cristiano Ronaldo's match for Al-Nassr against Al-Fayha at the AL Majma'ah Sports City. Persian Gulf Pro League matches between Mes Rafsanjan and Aluminium Arak, Zob Ahan and Persepolis, and Esteghlal Khuzestan and Malavan, however, have been postponed. Matches in the Qatar Stars League have also been cancelled.\n\nElsewhere, Graeme Souness was left stranded at Abu Dhabi Airpot after flying in three weeks ago for duties as an ambassador for Liverpool. Taking to Instagram, he wrote: \"Currently in the Middle East, in Abu Dhabi Airport, I'll give you a quick glimpse of where I am.\n\n\"That is my plane. That I am meant to be catching to go back to the UK. My mum said to me - bear with me - when I was a little boy, 'wherever you are, there's never a dull moment.' So I was thinking this weekend, the biggest game of the season for me, Rangers-Celtic, a game that if Rangers win, that'll put the cat among the pigeons in a big way.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"My mum said, 'wherever you are son, there's never a dull moment', well, I'm at this airport, and we're hearing some pretty loud bangs going off, and that is anti-missiles taking out missiles that are being fired at some American base.\"\n\nHe added: \"Chaos continues. The flight's been cancelled, still hearing explosives, so we give up. We're just going to check into a hotel for a couple of nights and see where we are. Hopefully, this will settle down and we'll get back on our flight.\n\n\"You get grumpy - well I do - when you get delayed and stuff at airports but I think we should think of people that maybe at this point might die. Anyway, I'll keep you posted.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTennis\n\nWhile there was uncertainty over the doubles final of the Dubai Tennis Championships, the event ultimately took place. Henry Patten and Harri Heliovaara achieved a 7-5, 7-5 victory over Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic to secure their second title in as many weeks, following triumph at the Qatar Open earlier this month.\n\nDaniil Medvedev, meanwhile, claimed the men's singles final with a walkover of Tallon Griekspoor, with the Dutch competitor withdrawing due to a hamstring injury. Elsewhere, Holger Rune - who is in Doha today - posted on X to confirm that he was safe.\n\nView 3 Images Qatar Airways made the decision to temporarily suspend flights (Image: Getty)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe wrote: \"Doha today. We are all safe,\" whilst sharing images of missile trails in the sky above. Medvedev and his competitors have also been left stranded in Dubai, due to flights out of the country being suspended for the time being.\n\nMotoGP\n\nFollowing Qatar Airways' announcement that all flights are temporarily grounded owing to airspace restrictions, MotoGP journalist Simon Patterson shared on X how this might affect drivers and teams. He claimed: \"MotoGP's airline of choice is Qatar. A lot of the paddock are scheduled to be on tomorrow night's Bangkok to Doha flight.\"\n\nThe Thailand GP is due to take place at 8am at the Chang International Circuit on Sunday, March 1.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\nBoxing star Chris Eubank Jr shared alarming footage of Dubai ablaze after air raid warnings echoed across the city. At least three explosions have been reported in the area, with Eubank Jr posting on Instagram afterwards to appeal for people to \"be safe\".\n\nHe posted: \"Explosions going off on the Dubai Palm right now.

            "content": "Ashley Barnes saw an equaliser for Burnley vs Brentford ruled out for handball deep into added time during a chaotic defeat for his side at Turf Moor. At 4-3 down, it was a case of last chance saloon for Scott Parker's Clarets, as Maxime Esteve launched the ball into the Brentford box from his own half eight minutes into additional time.\n\nJoe Worrall then connected to put the ball on a plate for Barnes, with the late super sub firing home from close range to level matters as the home crowd erupted in jubilation. However, celebrations were short-lived as VAR swiftly stepped in to scrutinise the build-up, identifying that Barnes had handled the ball before his strike.\n\nIn heart-breaking fashion, referee Sam Barrott then announced his decision to rule to goal out, shortly before the full-time whistle sounded and Burnley left the encounter empty-handed despite their best efforts. Explaining his decision, Barrott was head saying on the field: \"After review - 35 [Ashley Barnes], accidentally handles the ball. That leads to a direct goal. My final decision will be defensive free-kick to Brentford.\"\n\nIt's a decision that Burnley co-owner JJ Watt rued, given the former NFL star was in the stands at Turf Moor to cheer on the Clarets. Taking to X in the aftermath of Barrott's announcement, he wrote: \"If it takes 10 minutes, it’s not clear and obvious...\" in a huge dig toward VAR.\n\nIt will come as a bitter pill to swallow for Burnley fans, considering Parker almost engineered the comeback of the season for his side. Mikkel Damsgaard opened the scoring for the Bees just nine minutes into the match, before Igor Thiago and Kevin Schade incited fears that it may be another stuffing on Burnley's part with further goals ahead of the break.\n\nMichael Kayode gave Burnley fans a slight glimmer of hope with an own goal three minutes into stoppage time, before Parker and his side returned to their dressing room with a mountain to climb if they harboured any hopes of taking anything from the game.\n\nJaidon Anthony reduced the deficit to just one just two minutes into the second-half, as Burnley emerged from the tunnel seemingly invigorated from Parker's pep talk. And Turf Moor erupted when Zian Flemming levelled matters 60 minutes into the encounter, before Burnley pressed on for a much-needed winner.\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\nIt was Damsgaard who ultimately sealed the deal for Brentford on the afternoon, however, putting the game to bed three minutes into additional time to secure all three points. The result means that remain 19th in the Premier League standings, staring down the barrel of imminent relegation to the Championship.\n\nWith just 10 games remaining of 2025/26, the Clarets are eight points from Safety, with 17th-place Nottingham Forest holding a game in hand. The Tricky Trees return to league action on Sunday afternoon, when they play Brighton at the AMEX Stadium.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now\n\nUp next for Burnley is a trip to Hill Dickinson Stadium against a high-flying Everton on Tuesday, March 3 at 7.30pm.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

There's a lot of very difficult shots. But I'm up there where I want to be. I've had a few chances to win this tournament, and hopefully I can convert it tomorrow.\"\n\nLowry was second in 2022 when the event was still called the Honda Classic, losing the lead in a most bizarre fashion at the end - getting caught in a deluge that wreaked havoc on the final hole. Sepp Straka wound up winning by one shot, and Lowry wound up getting soaked.\n\nHe tied for fifth at PGA National a year later, had the solo lead going into the final round of the Cognizant before finishing tied for fourth in 2024, then tied for 11th last year.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Wayne Riley suits up as a bear to explain why the Cognizant Classic's 'Bear Trap' is so difficult for even the most experienced golfers!\n\n\"There wasn't much wind out there, so there's certain things that aligned today to make it play easy enough, wind direction being one of them,\" Lowry added.\n\n\"But you still need to go out there and hit the shots. The greens are firm. It can get away from you if you're not hitting the ball well. I felt like I did everything pretty good today.\"\n\nIt seemed like things tried to get away from Smotherman - who led after the first two rounds but he held it together just enough to finish knotted for the top spot.\n\nBack-to-back bogeys on the par-4 sixth and the par-3 seventh threatened to throw his round off-stride, but a birdie-birdie finish might have given him a little momentum headed into Sunday as he seeks what would be his first PGA Tour victory.\n\nImage: Austin Smotherman shot an outstanding 62 in the first round but has struggled to replicate his success since (Photo by Doug Murray/Icon Sportswire) (Icon Sportswire via AP Images)\n\nNico Echavarria (66) and Taylor Moore (67) were a shot back at 12 under, and Jimmy Stanger - who'll earn a check on tour for the first time since April 2024, after spending the last two years dealing with serious elbow issues - is alone in fifth at 11 under after shooting a 65 Saturday.\n\n\"It just feels good to be back,\" Stanger said. \"It feels good to be playing a weekend. It's been a couple years. It's good to be healthy. It's just a cherry on top to be in contention here this week.\"\n\nLowry's 63 tied Patton Kizzire for the round of the day moving the American up 45 spots into a tie for ninth at eight under, while Keith Mitchell and Beau Hossler both shot 64s to join Kizzire, sat five shots behind the leaders."

Maswanhise took a blow to the ribs from Vicko Sevelj's elbow and a penalty was given.\n\nMaswanhise was fully recovered in time to send Ashley Maynard-Brewer the wrong way.\n\nMotherwell went direct to trouble United - and that was the route to their second goal.\n\nWatt's free-kick from his own half found Maswanhise on the edge of the United penalty area and a great take and turn allowed him to fire towards goal. A deflection was enough to beat the goalkeeper.\n\nMaswanhise was released again in the 50th minute but he sent his hat-trick chance bobbling wide.\n\nGoodwin made a quadruple substitution just after the hour and one of those introduced, Kristijan Trapanovski, hit the far post direct from a corner.\n\nThat apart, Motherwell and their fans enjoyed playing with a lead.\n\nThe excellent Slattery whipped a superb attempt inches wide from 25 yards, while at the other end Stephenson got in behind the defence, only to clip an effort just past the far post.\n\nWhat the managers said...\n\nMotherwell boss Jens Berthel Askou:\n\n\"It's fantastic to have a player [Maswanhise] who can score a penalty every time, then know he'll get chances during the game.\n\n\"He was a little bit lucky, but you have to play the luck and force the luck by having a go.\n\n\"He deserved a goal or two. He does so well to break free of the tight marking and physical duels that go on around him, which can be a mental test.\"\n\nDundee Utd boss Jim Goodwin:\n\n\"A decision like that really takes it out the players. A coming together of two players like that happens 100 times in football.\n\n\"But that's what we're used to this season with the way games are being refereed.\n\n\"Players in general have to take some responsibility.\n\n\"We had a similar incident against Hearts when the Hearts player went down holding his face like he'd been hit hard and conned the ref.\n\n\"And Maswanhise went down like he'd been punched with full force in the ribs.\n\n\"It gives VAR something to look at, but I'd love a referee to see it again and say 'that's not a penalty' and play on.\n\n\"He obviously didn't deem it violent conduct because he gave him [Sevelj] a yellow.\n\n\"It's not a penalty and I wouldn't want penalties like that given.\n\n\"We seem to be saying the same things about refereeing in this country. It's going from bad to worse.\""

The wing-back got on the end of Tanser's delivery and his looping header hit the top of the cross bar.\n\nIn a lively first half, chances came at both ends of the pitch.\n\nImage: Livingston's Brooklyn Kabongolo scores to make it 1-1 against St Mirren\n\nMandron swept a left-footed shot from distance just over after the Lions got caught trying to play out before Livingston striker Robbie Muirhead drove an effort wide from inside the area.\n\nBoth of these teams have struggled for goals this term so it was no surprise that they were wasteful in the final third.\n\nThe same theme continued when Scott Pittman whipped a first-time shot wide from 15 yards in what was a promising position after being teed up by Liam Smith.\n\nSt Mirren goalkeeper Shamal George was then called upon to repel a stinging Smith drive after Alex Gogic made a mess of trying to head the ball back.\n\nBut it was the away team that stormed ahead a minute before the break through Nlundulu.\n\nThe striker was involved in the build up and was accused of handling the ball after falling to the ground just outside the box.\n\nSaints recycled the ball and Richardson played in Mandron down the side of the area and his cross was headed back across goal by the striker.\n\nIt was a familiar feeling for Livingston as the second half restarted although the home team should have drawn level through Muirhead.\n\nThe striker found himself in space from a Macaulay Tait pass but his right-footed shot from an angle was pushed behind by George.\n\nThe second period was not so open with the battle becoming more confined to the middle of the pitch.\n\nLivingston kept fighting and their perseverance paid off in the 76th minute with another goal from Kabongolo.\n\nSubstitute Barrie McKay swept a deep cross into the area the unmarked Kabongolo showed great composure to direct his header into the corner of the net from 10 yards.\n\nFellow substitute Joel Nouble then headed a McKay corner over from close range in what was the last meaningful chance of the game.\n\nWhat the managers said...\n\nLivingston boss Marvin Bartley:\n\n\"It's seven points at this moment in time, with nine games to go. It's something that can be turned around really, really quickly.\n\n\"We'll keep chipping away until we get to the split and then we'll see where we're at.\n\n\"But this team's more than good enough to do so.\n\n\"You know we will not give up. We will get out of this situation we're currently in.\n\n\"We spoke to the players when I first came in to take over as manager that we need to get as close as we possibly can by the split. And then after the split, we'll see where we're at but we're a point closer.\"\n\nSt Mirren boss Stephen Robinson:\n\n\"It's a point gained. It was a disappointing goal we conceded because I didn't see Livingston scoring.\n\n\"It's a long loopy ball into the box, that is again another poor individual decision and we get punished by it.\n\n\"It's a really poor goal but there were a lot of positives in it.\n\n\"I thought the first half we were good. We pressed much better, we looked a lot more solid and we hit the crossbar.\n\n\"But ultimately it takes us another point away from Kilmarnock and another point closer to the teams above us as well.\""

I think it would be a big achievement just staying in this league, so getting a sixth place - and we're not there yet, but that's where we are right now - I think it's a big achievement.\n\n\"It would be absolutely huge, probably the biggest achievement of anything that we've done previously.\n\n\"The standard is much, much higher than where we've been and the guys have responded and reacted to it enormously, adapting to it early and recognising that they were good enough to be in the league.\n\n\"That belief and confidence is just growing and growing and growing, and to go on and do that type of performance today is awesome.\"\n\nKilmarnock boss Neil McCann:\n\n\"I can only apologise to the fans here today. We filled out our section and I'm so sorry to them that we have put on that type of performance. That's not acceptable.\n\n\"We haven't served up that type of performance in my time here.\n\n\"It's very raw right now. I'm not going to get personal with any of the players.\n\n\"What I would say though is that we've collectively let the club down today. It's the first time I've felt so disappointed by the performance.\n\n\"Sometimes you've just got to accept that the other team were better on the day - and Falkirk were.\""

Great credit to David Gray, who made some really positive changes. The changes spooked us a little bit.\n\n\"We'd shown great composure with the ball for 80 minutes and then we just lost our way a little bit.\n\n\"Losing the two goals, I think it's easy for a team to go under but we responded again in amazing fashion.\n\n\"It said a lot about the group and the spirit that after that setback we managed to salvage a point so I couldn't be prouder.\"\n\nHibernian boss David Gray:\n\n\"It's real mixed emotions to be honest for me. I think it feels, because you lose a goal in the last second, like a defeat.\n\n\"I think that's natural because it is the last kick of the game.\n\n\"Take nothing away from the strike that got Dundee the point, I thought it was a fantastic hit, I was right behind it, I knew as soon as he hit it, it was going in.\n\n\"But I think the story of the day for us is the fact we've come to a really difficult place and we've had to score three goals to get a point because that's where we've let ourselves down, the defensive side of it.\n\n\"You can always affect it. I'm not saying there's nothing you can do, there's always things you can do, situations to stop things happening earlier in the process.\n\n\"But, unfortunately the feeling we've got right now is that we've been in this position before and it's something we'll address, we'll look at it.\n\n\"The other side to that is if we had scored in the last minute and got a point, the feeling that comes with that.\n\n\"So I have to be careful as the players are very low because of the manner of losing that goal in the last minute.\n\n\"But there is accountability across the board to make sure we learn from the experience and try to get better from it.\""

            "content": "For those wondering if Manchester City are overreliant on Erling Haaland, they offered a riposte at Leeds. It was neither a fluid nor entertaining victory but importantly it closed the gap at the top to two points, increasing the pressure on Arsenal in the process.\n\nIt helps that when the league’s top scorer is absent, City can rely on the third man in the charts. Antoine Semenyo scored his 14th of the season on a difficult night for Pep Guardiola’s side, making the full-time euphoria well deserved after what felt like a significant win. A number of City players sunk to the turf once the whistle went, having called on all their reserves to get over the line.\n\nEmotions boiled over at the end as the ferocity of the match had taken its toll. Guardiola blew kisses and waved to the home fans who had aimed abuse at him while Daniel Farke made his views clear to the officials over perceived timewasting and the opponents confronted one another. The Spaniard was rewarded with more abuse and the German a red card, two inevitable outcomes on a night where nothing could be taken for granted.\n\nMaybe it was the lack of Haaland, whose return has no timeframe, or the vociferous nature of the home crowd but Leeds were the dominant force in the opening stages. There was more aggression and intent in their play, leading to Dominic Calvert-Lewin having a glorious chance to open the scoring but he skewed Brenden Aaronson’s cross wide.\n\nThere was a stoppage in play after 13 minutes to allow the Muslim players to break their fast at sunset. This resulted in a chorus of jeers at Elland Road despite it being clearly indicated on the big screen why the match was paused. It created an incredibly uncomfortable atmosphere, especially for Rayan Aït-Nouri, Rayan Cherki, Omar Marmoush and Abdukodir Khusanov, who are observing Ramadan.\n\nCalvert-Lewin and James Justin came close as City struggled to match their opponents’ tempo. Without Haaland, Semenyo and Marmoush were playing as a wide strike partnership, eager to run in behind but they were witnesses rather than participants in the game. Semenyo ran through and flashed a shot over but it was a rare moment of threat from City.\n\nView image in fullscreen Marc Guéhi is denied by a fine Karl Darlow save. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters\n\nCity mistakes were becoming more problematic; Rodri, most trusted in possession, gave the ball away on the halfway line, ultimately allowing Aaronson through on goal. Gianluigi Donnarumma was the salvation on that occasion but something needed to change for Guardiola’s side.\n\nNico O’Reilly, playing in an advanced midfield role, forced the previously unoccupied Karl Darlow into a fine save from a powerful close-range header. It was the first sign of panic in the Leeds box and City needed more of it. Cherki was completely anonymous in the opening 45 minutes, in a team short of space and creative ideas, despite enjoying three-quarters of possession.\n\nWith 10 seconds of first-half injury time remaining, Cherki announced himself, inching through a pass for Aït-Nouri to play across for Semenyo to slide home as artistry outshone industry. It was an undeserved lead but City had weathered the storm and Leeds were possibly the victims of their own exertions, switching off at a key moment.\n\nTiring out Leeds was the cunning City plan as they kept the ball, moving the hosts about. The physical demands were too much for Joe Rodon, who felt his hamstring but was able to continue.\n\nNeither goalkeeper was troubled for a lengthy period after the break as dangerous positions evaporated through poor passing and finishing. The match became relatively scrappy with quality lacking on both sides amid a collection of niggly fouls. It took until the 72nd minute for Darlow’s alertness to be tested when Marc Guéhi headed a corner at goal, only for the goalkeeper to palm it out.\n\nIt was the briefest moment of concern from Leeds, who knew they needed to re-energise, sending on Daniel James and Wilfried Gnonto with a quarter of an hour to go. The changes lifted the team and the crowd. City spent spells backed into a corner but showed plenty of fight as they battled to maintain their slender lead. Guéhi and Rúben Dias put their bodies on the line to head and block the ball as they endured adversity to achieve glory."

            "content": "Benjamin Sesko’s career at Manchester United breaks into two distinct periods. In the first, he played 1,404 minutes of football and scored two goals. In the second, he has played 274 minutes and scored six goals: 702 minutes per goal and then 45 minutes 40 seconds per goal.\n\nThere’s a very obvious explanation. On 4 January, Sesko toiled in a 1-1 draw at Leeds. He didn’t manage a shot on target. He completed only 76% of his passes. He didn’t attempt a dribble but still lost possession five times. He was caught offside twice. On 5 January, Ruben Amorim was sacked.\n\nOn 6 January, Sesko scored both goals in a 2-2 draw at Burnley. It seems a little unfair to compare Amorim, who always came across as a thoroughly pleasant and decent man, to the White Witch from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, but the similar thawing impact of their removals is undeniable. The snows are melting, the flowers are blossoming and creatures that had been turned to stone are becoming flesh and blood once again.\n\nUnited, of course, have been here before, with an upturn under a beloved former player. The Ole Gunnar Solskjær experience means there is such a determination not to get carried away that there are some around United – fans and pundits – who are adamant Michael Carrick should not be given the job on a permanent basis almost whatever he achieves between now and the end of the season.\n\nBut there is a qualitative difference to what happened in 2019. Back then, there was a sense that United had decent players but they were diminished by the toxicity of the later part of José Mourinho’s reign. This season, there were doubts about how many of United’s players were any good at all.\n\nIt turns out, though, that a manager can make a huge impact by picking players in their best positions, restoring a hugely promising young midfielder ostracised because he didn’t fit a specific profile, and imbuing his charges with confidence.\n\nView image in fullscreen Benjamin Sesko’s early appearances showed a heavy touch and poor movement. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nAfter Sesko came off the bench to score the winner at Everton on Monday, he spoke of the importance of his sense that “everyone believes in me”. Which raises the obvious question of why that wasn’t true before. Did Amorim not rate him? Did Amorim not want him? Or was Amorim just bad at conveying to players on the fringes of the team how he saw them developing? And this is to do with Amorim. It’s not that Carrick is some sort of specialist Sesko-whisperer. The post-Amorim transformation was immediate, the Slovene scoring three goals in his two games under Darren Fletcher as interim manager.\n\nEvery day that has passed since Amorim left the club has made the decision to appoint him look worse. But the villain here is not Amorim, who told everybody he would always play 3-4-2-1 and then always played 3-4-2-1 at least until the very end, when fielding a back four felt like some sort of passive-aggressive act of defiance. The fault, rather, lies with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the process that imposed him on a disparate squad united only by their unsuitability for a manager who would play only 3-4-2-1, over the warnings of the then sporting director, Dan Ashworth, who left his role as a result. Amorim’s biggest fault was taking the job; little wonder he looked suddenly so much younger, so much more relaxed after being relieved of it.\n\nUnited’s upturn in form still doesn’t justify United spending £200m on three forwards in the summer when there were such obvious deficiencies in other areas – although recent events have shown how Ratcliffe struggles with numbers, so that perhaps offers some explanation – but it least it now appears that money was spent on players who may be part of a successful future. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have clicked up a level since Carrick took over, but it’s in Sesko that the starkest improvement has been seen.\n\nLast summer was characterised by Premier League clubs spending big money to sign orthodox strikers, with mixed results. Hugo Ekitiké has impressed. Alexander Isak, after his acrimonious move to Liverpool disrupted his pre‑season, was seemingly never at full fitness even before his broken leg. Rory Delap has struggled with injury at Chelsea. Even after his goals for Arsenal in the north London derby last Sunday, opinion is divided on Viktor Gyökeres.\n\nBut until early January, Sesko looked the most questionable of the lot. Allowances have to be made for the fact he is only 22, but he did not look in those early appearances like a £70m striker. His touch was heavy, his movement poor. But that’s the difference confidence and playing a coherent system can make.\n\nA simple video session with Fletcher before the 2-2 draw with Burnley was enough to restore in Sesko a basic faith in what he has done until now in his career. Sesko excels at making runs in the blind spot of defenders, which is exactly what brought both his goals that day: the first, because his run on to Bruno Fernandes’s through ball wasn’t tracked; the second, because, although Bashir Humphreys knew Sesko was behind him, he didn’t know whether he was going to go left or right to meet Patrick Dorgu’s cross.\n\nHe got away from Kenny Tete to score the winner against Fulham. He got in front of Axel Disasi for his remarkable finish to equalise against West Ham.\n\nView image in fullscreen Benjamin Sesko makes it 1-1 deep in stoppage time at West Ham. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA\n\nSesko’s movement is perhaps his greatest gift, but his physical attributes are obvious: he is good in the air, but also rapid over medium-to-long distances, as he showed in his winner on the break against Everton, confidence evident in every stride as he approached Mbeumo’s pass.\n\nHe’s less effective when given time to think but, given his age, that may come. And in his instincts to find space and finish, he’s already a hugely exciting talent, even if he is for now used mainly from the bench. It is remarkable what can happen when a manager uses a player in ways that accentuate his strengths rather than petrifying him with the wand of conformity to a strict tactical blueprint.\n\nNobody can pretend the background problems have gone away, but the tactical winter is over and Sesko is the frolicking avatar of the post-Amorim spring."

Bremen missed a host of chances before Jovan Milosevic scored from Romano Schmid’s cross in the 57th minute, and an own goal from Hennes Behrens in stoppage time confirmed Bremen’s first win after three defeats under their new coach, Daniel Thioune. It was enough to lift Bremen above Wolfsburg into the relegation playoff place. Wolfsburg, who haven’t won any of their past six games, visit Stuttgart on Sunday.\n\nHeidenheim remained bottom, nine points from safety after St Pauli held on for a 1-0 win at high-flying Hoffenheim. Mathias Pereira Lage scored for St Pauli before the break, lifting the Hamburg-based club out of the relegation zone after its third win from four games.\n\nKevin Diks scored a stoppage-time penalty for Borussia Mönchengladbach to beat Union Berlin 1-0 and end Galdbach’s seven-game winless run. Jarell Quansah scored late for Bayer Leverkusen to salvage a 1-1 draw with Mainz, canceling Sheraldo Becker’s second-half volley for Mainz. But the draw is a blow to Leverkusen’s hopes of reaching fourth place in the race for Champions League qualification. Leverkusen remained sixth, and both Stuttgart and Leipzig could pull further away. Leipzig visit Hamburg on Sunday.\n\nLamine Yamal scored the first hat-trick of his career as Barcelona beat visitors Villarreal 4-1 on Saturday to move four points clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. Barcelona have 64 points while second-placed Real are on 60 points before they host Getafe on Monday. Villarreal remain a distant third on 51.\n\nLamine Yamal put the hosts ahead in the 28th minute after Fermin Lopez robbed Pape Gueye and slipped a pass down the right for the 18-year-old to finish low inside the left post. He doubled the lead nine minutes later with a dazzling solo run, controlling a long ball on the right wing before cutting inside past Sergi Cardona and Alberto Moleiro to curl an unstoppable shot into the top corner.\n\nView image in fullscreen Lamine Yamal with the match ball fat the final whistle. Photograph: Toni Albir/EPA\n\nGueye pulled one back from close range in the 49th minute, but Villarreal missed chances to equalise and paid the price as Lamine Yamal completed his hat-trick in the 69th minute with another counter attack. Robert Lewandowski came off the bench to add a fourth in added time, tapping in from Jules Koundé’s low cross from the right.\n\nLater on Saturday in Spain, Atlético Madrid, in fourth, travel to bottom-placed Oviedo.\n\nInter’s lead in Serie A is already up to 10 points and can stretch that to 13, albeit having played a game more, by winning at home against Genoa. Second-placed Milan visit Cremonese on Sunday.\n\nRomelu Lukaku’s first goal of the season with the last kick of the match ended Napoli’s winless run on Saturday.\n\nLukaku, who had played just 41 minutes this campaign following a serious preseason thigh injury , pounced in the sixth minute of stoppage time to help Napoli win at bottom club Hellas Verona 2-1.\n\nHe appeared to tear up when the final whistle blew seconds later. His last goal was on May 23 followed by a terrible few months. Shortly after his torn thigh, his father died suddenly in September at 58.\n\n“On a personal level soccer gives you a lot. It has given me everything but losing my father like I lost him weighs on me every day,” Lukaku told DAZN while struggling to hold back tears. “But it is what it is and I carry on for my daughters, for my brother and for Napoli which has given me so much.”\n\nNapoli got off to a great start as Rasmus Højlund’s looping header from 12 meters gave it the lead after less than two minutes.\n\nHowever, Højlund was also involved in the equalizer in the 65th. He attempted to clear a Verona corner but it came out to Jean-Daniel Akpa Akpro, whose shot was deflected in by Højlund. The goal was credited to Akpa Akpro as the initial shot was on target.\n\nIn France, Paris Saint-Germain travel to Le Havre seeking to extend their one point lead at the top after second-placed Lens were held 1-1 at Strasbourg on Friday night.\n\nPSG’s Ligue 1 match against Nantes next month has been delayed to give the Champions League holders more rest between the two legs of their last-16 tie with Chelsea. PSG were due to face struggling Nantes on the weekend of 13-15 March, between their first leg against Chelsea on 11 March and the return match at Stamford Bridge on 17 March. Liam Rosenior’s Chelsea will play a difficult Premier League match against Newcastle three days before the second leg."

            "content": "The contrasting strengths of Liverpool and West Ham are reflected on the balance sheet, the team sheet and ultimately the score sheet. Arne Slot’s side improved their prospects of Champions League qualification with a peculiar victory at Anfield, the winning margin far more resounding than the performance.\n\nIn the week Liverpool announced record overall revenue of £703m in their latest accounts, most of it ploughed back into the bank balances of a title-winning team, West Ham warned that players will have to be sold this summer whether they stay up or not having suffered a £104.2m loss in the same financial year. Their prospects of avoiding relegation look bleak in the context of such a heavy defeat yet, strange as it seems, Nuno Espírito Santo could take encouragement from elements of West Ham’s display.\n\nThe visitors had a better xG than Liverpool but found Alisson in fine form and the champions devastating at set pieces. West Ham must have known it was not going to be their day when their bus got stuck on a ramp while attempting to leave the team hotel. “If I say it was a good performance I sound silly,” said Nuno. “But that’s what I saw.”\n\nAnd yet this game was effectively over by half-time. As damning as that was for West Ham, they retained hope of getting back into the contest before Alexis Mac Allister extinguished it in the 43rd minute. The midfielder’s brilliant volley was the third Liverpool goal to originate from a corner as Slot’s side continued their metamorphosis into the Premier League’s set-piece specialists.\n\nPoor at defending them and scoring from them in the first half of the season, resulting in the departure of the set-piece coach Aaron Briggs in December, Liverpool have now scored more set-piece goals than any other team in the division – excluding penalties – in 2026. West Ham were defensively weak as Liverpool took their set-piece goals total to eight for the calendar year.\n\nHugo Ekitiké gave the hosts an early lead after El Hadji Malick Diouf had cleared the first corner of the afternoon. Ryan Gravenberch returned a fine ball into the France international, who took his shot early and saw it nestle into Mads Hermansen’s bottom corner via a slight deflection off Konstantinos Mavropanos. Both the West Ham centre-half and goalkeeper could have done more.\n\nThe visitors responded well to their first setback. Mateus Fernandes and Crysencio Summerville were to the fore as Liverpool were opened up frequently, but West Ham could not find a finishing touch. Mavropanos scooped wildly over when a Jarrod Bowen corner landed at his feet and Mac Allister worked tirelessly to cut out a dangerous counterattack led by Summerville. The threat from West Ham was growing, then Liverpool scored another simple goal from a corner.\n\nView image in fullscreen West Ham captain Jarrod Bowen looks dejected after Cody Gakpo scores Liverpool’s fourth goal. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nVirgil van Dijk headed home Dominik Szoboszlai’s delivery after bumping aside Soungoutou Magassa and beating Tomas Soucek to the ball. It was the Liverpool captain’s second set-piece goal in three games and his team’s seventh of the year. Number eight was executed brilliantly. Mohamed Salah took a corner from the right, Van Dijk flicked on at the near post, Ekitiké cushioned the ball out to Mac Allister and he volleyed into the roof of the net via the head of Aaron Wan-Bissaka. The ball did not touch the ground from the moment it left Salah’s foot.\n\nWest Ham had their moments before the third goal, Alisson saving well from Soucek and gratefully from Bowen after hitting a clearance straight at the visiting captain, but were in for a long afternoon. To their credit, Nuno’s side did not concede to the inevitable. Soucek reduced the arrears early in the second half when sliding in to convert Diouf’s low cross.\n\nAnfield became noticeably edgy as errors crept into the Liverpool display and both Fernandes and Summerville drew good stops from Alisson. But Cody Gakpo restored the host’s three goal cushion when his low shot struck Wan-Bissaka and deflected into the far corner.\n\nWest Ham responded once again when Bowen’s corner sailed over a crowded six-yard box and Taty Castellanos scored with a free header at the back post. But a late, unfortunate own goal by Axel Disasi, who deflected a low cross from the Liverpool substitute Jeremie Frimpong beyond Hermansen, compounded a punishing day for West Ham. “You’re going down with Prince Andrew,” taunted the Kop.\n\nSlot reflected: “I’m very pleased with the set pieces, firstly because that is the reason we won and secondly because we played OK-to-good. We’ve played better this season and lost. We’ve started scoring from set pieces and things look brighter and better than when you don’t.”"

            "content": "As rain fell, incessantly, Eddie Howe wandered around the pitch alone. The final whistle had just gone and, with Everton celebrating a deserved win, Newcastle’s lingering hopes of a top-six finish were also blown.\n\nNewcastle look shattered, mentally as much as physically, by a Champions League campaign that will soon pit them against Barcelona and their Premier League form is suffering accordingly.\n\nAdmittedly it took a stunning stoppage-time save from Jordan Pickford to deny Sandro Tonali a late equaliser, but Newcastle’s players have forgotten how to defend, are far too careless in possession and seem alarmingly low on creativity.\n\n“It’s really hard to explain,” said Howe, after Newcastle lost a third consecutive home game for the first time since February 2021 under Steve Bruce; they have kept only two clean sheets in 21 league games. “It’s hugely frustrating, desperately disappointing.\n\n“We think we’re a good team, but we’re wildly inconsistent, even within games. I don’t see players not trying, I sometimes see them over-trying, but they’re not playing smart enough. Chasing the game took a lot out of us. It’s not a good look for us.”\n\nNewcastle were slapdash from the start and swiftly paid the price at a set piece. Jarrad Branthwaite’s expertly flicked header from James Garner’s corner was dispatched from the tightest of angles, brushing the unguarded far post en route into the back of the net.\n\nBranthwaite excelled in central defence, not something that can be said of his Newcastle counterparts. They have not kept a clean sheet in the 11 games since they beat PSV Eindhoven 3-0 here on 21 January, conceding 23 goals along the way. Small wonder cries of “Wake up!” echoed around the ground.\n\nView image in fullscreen Thierno Barry improvises to score the winning goal off his backside. Photograph: Richard Lee/Shutterstock\n\nHowe once again began with the England winger Anthony Gordon at centre-forward and his ineffective £69m Germany striker, Nick Woltemade, in an attacking midfield role. With Gordon struggling to make an impact against his former club, Howe quickly shifted Woltemade to No 9 and Gordon to the left.\n\nA slightly improved Newcastle equalised when Jacob Ramsey’s shot took a hefty deflection off Branthwaite, wrong-footing Pickford.\n\nA bad error on Nick Pope’s part enabled Everton to regain the lead after the keeper spilt a fairly routine shot from the impressive Dwight McNeil straight into Beto’s path. Everton’s No 9 gleefully accepted the invitation to stroke the ball into the empty net. Beto is often criticised for a perceived litany of shortcomings and would later miss a glorious chance, but he reacted with alacrity, moving far more rapidly than any of the defenders.\n\nNewcastle faced further disruption at the outset of the second half, when, after emerging from the tunnel for the restart, Ramsey vomited repeatedly on the pitch, prompting his replacement by Joe Willock.\n\nIt was not long before Anthony Elanga and Woltemade made way for Jacob Murphy and Harvey Barnes as Gordon reverted to centre-forward.\n\nBeto, making his first start since December, left Malick Thiaw for dust and found himself clean through with only Pope to beat. A third Everton goal beckoned, but his shot hit the bar and left Beto standing in isolation, his hands covering his face.\n\nSoon he was replaced by Thierno Barry and on, too, came Yoane Wissa, the hitherto overlooked £55m former Brentford centre-forward.\n\nHome spirits revived, albeit briefly, when Murphy’s slightly deflected volley from Joelinton’s cross flew past Pickford, but Everton recaptured the lead in barely a minute. Gordon’s concession of possession prefaced Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall squaring for Barry to bundle the ball across the line.\n\nIn stoppage time, Pickford reminded everyone why he is England’s goalkeeper. Tonali let fly on the volley and an equaliser seemed inevitable but Pickford tipped the ball over the bar.\n\n“Tonali’s technique was textbook,” said a delighted Moyes, whose side’s away Premier League record is bettered only by Arsenal’s. “Jordan’s save was out of this world.”"

            "content": "Scott Parker was left sad and disappointed by more video assistant referee controversy after Burnley’s spirited comeback came to nothing. The home side were 3-0 down in 34 minutes and facing hostility from their own fans, but fought back to level before having a fourth goal ruled out after Jaidon Anthony was adjudged to be a shoulder-width offside.\n\nMikkel Damsgaard then put Brentford back in front three minutes into injury time only for Ashley Barnes to net and spark scenes of jubilation, but his apparent equaliser was also chalked off, for handball, after a long delay.\n\nParker said: “Maybe a little bit of injustice. I’ve not watched it back. I saw it on the big screen and I was thinking it looks like his hand is beside his side. It looks so, so harsh.\n\n“We’ve gone and scored five goals in the space of 60 minutes, which is quite incredible. The world we’re in, we’re all looking for perfection. The game is looking for perfection.”\n\nLoud boos greeted the final whistle, but there had also been jeering and chants against Parker and the Burnley owner, Alan Pace, during and at the end of a woeful first half for the home side. They have not won at home in the league since October and ire towards team and hierarchy has been growing, but Parker hopes the response of his side will have won over some of the dissenters.\n\n“Walking in from half-time, it wasn’t nice,” he said. “Everyone has choices to vent how they want to vent. The fans were brilliant in the second half, but that was down to us. I understand the frustration of course, we’re all frustrated at 3-0 down.\n\n“There’s one thing our supporters can see leaving here , and you can be critical in certain moments, but the one thing you can’t be critical of is this group and what this shirt means, what playing for this team means and what we stand for. I hope the fans can see that.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Ashley Barnes reacts in shock after his late goal is disallowed. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA\n\nThe Brentford manager, Keith Andrews, who signed a new long-term deal this week, said he would not have been happy had the VAR decisions gone against his side, but felt they were ultimately correct.\n\nOn his team’s performance, he said: “The first half we were very good, played with a lot of conviction, we attacked with real speed and venom and belief.\n\n“The own goal just changed it a little bit and I knew we’d have to start the second half really well. I thought they’d make changes, they did, changed the system a little bit, and we didn’t deal with that particularly well. This was never going to be an easy game. If I’d been asked [beforehand] if I would accept a 4-3 victory, I would have taken it. It’s come in very crazy circumstances.”"

            "content": "Sir Alex Ferguson watched on as Hearts defeated Aberdeen 1-0 to move seven points clear of Rangers at the top of the Scottish Premiership.\n\nFerguson, the last manager to win the title with a team that was not Celtic or Rangers when his Aberdeen side were back-to-back champions from 1983-85, was at Tynecastle as a guest of the Hearts coach, Derek McInnes, and he saw Cláudio Braga score what proved to be the only goal of the game just before the half-hour mark.\n\nHearts had enough chances to have won more convincingly, but their supporters greeted the full-time whistle with jubilation as they stretched their lead over Rangers and Celtic, who face each other at Ibrox on Sunday.\n\n“It felt like a big game, I think the fans made it that, and the situation in terms of the context of the league made it that,” said McInnes. “It looks like a tight scoreline but I thought it was a very good performance. It was exactly the type of performance we needed it to be. We had more crosses in today’s game than we’ve had for a long time. It was the type of performance I was hoping for.\n\n“In an ideal world, you would want a second goal to enjoy that last part, but it was a good three points, no more than we deserved.”\n\nQuick Guide Scottish Premiership: Motherwell close on Celtic Show Motherwell moved a point behind third-placed Celtic with a comfortable 2-0 win at home to Dundee United. Tawanda Maswanhise scored either side of the interval as Motherwell extended their unbeaten league run to 11 games. The breakthrough came from Vicko Sevelj conceding a penalty for an off-the-ball altercation with Maswanhise. Dundee and Hibernian shared a six-goal thriller as their Dens Park clash ended in a 3-3 draw. Cam Congreve struck a fantastic equaliser for Dundee in the fifth minute of stoppage time after Hibernian had taken the lead through Owen Elding. Dundee led 2-1 through Simon Murray and Luke Graham, but Hibernian looked on the way to three points after Ante Suto and Jamie McGrath scored in the final 10 minutes. Falkirk all-but secured a top-six berth by thrashing relegation-threatened Kilmarnock 5-1, who remain firmly in relegation danger. An Ethan Brown own goal got the ball rolling before Dylan Tait and Barney Stewart bagged doubles, while Killie's consolation came from Greg Kiltie. Brooklyn Kabongolo scored for the second game running as bottom-placed Livingston drew 1-1 at home to St Mirren, who had led through Dan Nlundulu's powerful header on the stroke of half-time. PA Media Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nMcInnes said of the former Manchester United manager Ferguson’s presence at Tynecastle: “He sat in the office for about an hour before the game. It was nice for him to see Tynecastle the way it was and see a winning performance. He’s watched us a lot this season and he’s quite tuned in to what we’re doing so I’m grateful that he’s made the effort to come and see us today.”\n\nHearts were supposed to be going to Dubai on Monday for a warm-weather training camp but those plans have been shelved amid escalating hostilities in the Middle East.\n\n“We woke up this morning and were resigned to it that we’ll not be travelling,” said McInnes. “I think there’s more important things going on. It’s disappointing obviously, but we might push it down the line because there’s going to be opportunities between now and the end of the season where we could maybe just do a similar booking. But we’ll just train as normal in Edinburgh this week.”\n\nThere were two changes to the Hearts side that started last weekend’s victory over Falkirk as Jamie McCart and Landry Kaboré replaced Stuart Findlay and Islam Chesnokov. The Aberdeen interim manager, Peter Leven, made three changes to the side that started Tuesday’s 0-0 draw at Dundee United as the goalkeeper, Per Kristian Bråtveit, Tom McIntyre and Kenan Bilalovic were replaced by Dimitar Mitov, Liam Morrison and Topi Keskinen.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sir Alex Ferguson takes his seat in the stands at Tynecastle. Photograph: Steve Welsh/PA\n\nAberdeen had not won at Tynecastle since May 2017 and they swiftly found themselves on the back foot as Hearts, backed by a pumped-up home support, started strongly. Tómas Magnússon had the hosts’ first chance in the fourth minute when he headed wide from Blair Spittal’s cross.\n\nAlexandros Kyziridis then had a shot deflected into the arms of Mitov before Braga’s low effort from just inside the box was saved by the Dons keeper. Braga threatened again when he glanced a header over from Harry Milne’s cross.\n\nHearts were playing some scintillating football and they had a huge chance in the 21st minute when Kaboré got himself clean through but the forward’s lob over the advancing Mitov drifted agonisingly wide. Aberdeen had a rare foray forward in the 26th minute which resulted in Toyosi Olusanya lashing wide from Keskinen’s cross.\n\nThe breakthrough came for Hearts in the 28th minute when Marc Leonard sent Kaboré scampering down the right and the Burkina Faso striker rode the challenge of Morrison before cutting the ball back for Braga to steer home from six yards out.\n\nSpittal then rasped an effort just over from the edge of the box in the 36th minute as the league leaders had to be content with a one-goal advantage at the end of a first half they had dominated.\n\nFour minutes after the break, Kaboré had a ferocious shot pushed out by Mitov. Aberdeen countered and Nicky Devlin had an effort scrambled behind by McCart after being set up by Olusanya. From the resulting corner Kevin Nisbet volleyed narrowly wide. At the other end, Spittal had an effort deflected behind from the edge of the box before Braga was denied by the legs of Mitov.\n\nHearts’ failure to find a second goal meant they had to endure a stressful finale before closing out another crucial victory in their quest for a first league title since 1960."

            "content": "Football’s lawmaking authority, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), is to conduct a two-year review of the video assistant referee to ensure the technology is being used “to its best”. The announcement on Saturday came alongside a flurry of enhancements to the rulebook before the World Cup, including expanding the use of VAR into determining corner kicks.\n\nAnother proposal could mean punishments for players obscuring their mouths being fast-tracked for implementation at this summer’s tournament, after the alleged racist abuse of Vinícius Júnior by Benfica’s Gianluca Prestianni.\n\nThe VAR review was confirmed by the technical director of Ifab, David Elleray, on the 10th anniversary of the decision to first trial video technology. “We have agreed today that after 10 years we should be reviewing VAR to see where we want to go with it in the future,” Elleray said.\n\n“There is a very interesting debate over what direction VAR should go in because within football there are two contrasting philosophies: some that want as far as possible perfect decision making … and those who say we have to accept that refereeing errors are part of the game.”\n\nBefore the outcome of any review, Ifab confirmed that VAR’s powers are to be extended into three new areas. The first will give official permission to check and review any red card decision that comes from a “clearly incorrect second yellow card”. Second, they will be able to intervene when the referee punishes the wrong team for an offence.\n\nFinally, VAR will be able to review a “clearly incorrectly awarded corner kick”, albeit only under the condition that the review “can be completed immediately and without delaying the restart”.\n\nView image in fullscreen VAR will now be able to review a ‘clearly incorrectly awarded corner kick’. Photograph: Sebastian Frej/Getty Images\n\nAll of these developments are to be in place by June and it is expected that Ifab will confirm new disciplinary measures related to discriminatory behaviour too. There is to be a fast-tracked consultation over incidents where players “cover their mouth when confronting opponents during matches” or “unilaterally decide to leave the field of play as an act of protest” as in the case of the Senegal national side during this year’s Africa Cup of Nations final. Both actions are likely to be punished with a yellow card.\n\nThe first “semi-live” trial of VAR was conducted in 2016 during a men’s international friendly between France and Italy. A decade later video technology is now embedded in the top echelons of the game but has driven widespread dissatisfaction due to delays in decision making and matches being determined by marginal outcomes.\n\nThe English FA’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said it was key that rulemakers continued to innovate in their application of VAR. “There is a review going on looking at how we use VAR to its best,” he said. “If you look at the innovations that Fifa have brought through, particularly in semi-automated offside, I think they’re fantastic.\n\n“The speed with which decisions are made, and the accuracy, takes a big amount of frustration away from fans. The other interesting area is looking at what can we learn from other trials being done? The football video support system gives the coach a challenge system. Are there elements of that we should consider adopting for the future? Because that reduces the amount of times when there is a VAR intervention and effectively puts the emphasis on the coach.”\n\nView image in fullscreen The Fifa referees committee chair, Pierluigi Collina, spoke at the AGM. Photograph: David Davies/PA\n\nAt the AGM in his role as chair of the Fifa referees committee, Pierluigi Collina encapsulated the first decade of VAR with a metaphor. “In Italy we are used to saying that, in every wonderful marriage, there is a crisis after seven years,” he said. “So it might be possible that people fell in love with the VAR and then after some years, as with your wife, you have a small crisis.”\n\nIn addition to the extension of VAR protocols, the Ifab brought in new measures to tackle time-wasting and the disruption of tempo in matches. The successful introduction of the eight-second rule for goalkeepers has encouraged Ifab to go further on efforts to stop players slowing the game.\n\nReferees will be given the power to start a five-second countdown if they feel players are taking too long over throw-ins and dead-ball goal kicks, with the throw-in reversed or a corner kick the sanction for delaying. Substitutions must be completed in no more than 10 seconds, otherwise the substitute must stay off for at least one minute."

            "content": "AMERICA and Israel blitzed Iran with shock strikes as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei held talks with henchmen in his presidential palace.\n\nIsrael’s Mossad spies infiltrated Khamenei’s regime and knew where and when three meetings were taking place.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperation Epic Fury was then unleashed in daylight — knowing the targets would be suspecting night attacks, like previous raids.\n\nLast night President Donald Trump confirmed Khamenei, 86, had been killed.\n\nHe posted on Truth Social: “Khamenei, one of the most evil people in History, is dead.”\n\nIsrael’s Channel 12 quoted senior military officials declaring Khamenei’s body had been found in the rubble of his palace.\n\nHis son and heir Mojtaba was also killed, it was claimed.\n\nEarlier Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi appeared on the US’s NBC News to insist Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian were safe “as far as I know”.\n\nOther reports had said the Ayatollah, Supreme Leader since 1989, may have fled to Sudan.\n\n\n\nPM Sir Keir Starmer said Britain played no role in the strikes but slammed the “abhorrent and murderous” regime in Tehran.\n\nMossad spies had discovered Iran’s senior leadership figures were due at talks inside the palace at 9am local time (6am UK time).\n\nMissiles reduced the building to a blackened crater as black smoke billowed from the rubble.\n\nUS media claimed at least 40 senior leaders had been killed.\n\nThey included Defence Minister Amir Nasirzadeh, Revolutionary Guards Commander Mohammed Pakpour, National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani and Supreme Leader Military Secretary Mohammad Shirazi.\n\n\n\nAnd Israel claimed Gholam- Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, head of Iran’s Islamic Republic Judiciary had been handed an “expeditious death penalty”.\n\nMossad said he was punished for sentencing protesters to death following the January state crackdown feared to have claimed 36,000 lives.\n\nForeign Minister Araghchi played down the toll saying: “We may have lost a few commanders, but that’s not such a big problem.”\n\n\n\nIran’s Red Crescent Society said 201 people had died across the country in the raids including 80 at a girls’ school in Minab. At least 747 people were injured, it claimed.\n\nThe US military reported no casualties after Iran launched missiles and drones in retaliation.\n\nMore than 200 warplanes backed by Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from warships attacked 500 targets in the mission, dubbed Operation Roaring Lion in Israel.\n\nCommander-in-Chief Trump, in a USA cap, announced the strikes were under way eight minutes after the first salvo.\n\nHe warned “the lives of American heroes could be lost”, and urged Iranians to rise up against their cruel rulers. The Islamic Republic of Iran has existed since 1979.\n\n\n\nTrump said: “For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted ‘Death to America’ and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed.\n\n“It’s been mass terror, and we’re not going to put up with it any longer. Iran is the world’s No 1 state sponsor of terror and just recently killed tens of thousands of its citizens on the street as they protested.\n\n\n\n“After that attack, we warned them never to resume their malicious pursuit of nuclear weapons, and we sought repeatedly to make a deal. But Iran refused, just as it has for decades and decades.\n\n“They’ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions. And we can’t take it anymore.”\n\n“We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally, again, obliterated. We are going to annihilate their navy.\n\n“And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.”\n\nTrump issued a stark warning to Iran’s revolutionary guards: “Lay down arms or face certain death.”\n\n\n\nIsrael Defence Forces officials confirmed an attempt had been made to decapitate the regime — and suggested Iran was hiding the scale of its losses.\n\nA military official said: “The attack was based on an operational plan developed over several months, centered on an intelligence effort to identify an opportunity when senior regime officials would convene.\n\n“Three sites where gatherings of the Iranian terror regime were taking place were struck simultaneously, and several senior figures essential to the regime’s governance were eliminated.”\n\nExplosions were heard in the cities of Isfahan, Qom, Karaj, Kermanshah and Shiraz.\n\nVolleys of up to 20 cruise missiles were seen streaking across the sky above Iraq on the way to targets in western Iran.\n\n\n\nA squadron of 11 radar-dodging F-22 Raptors — America’s most advanced warplane — were believed to have led the onslaught.\n\nAircraft carriers USS Abraham Lincoln and the USS Gerald R Ford — the most powerful warship on Earth — were engaged with 150-plus planes in their strike group.\n\nThe US has around 500 fighter jets in the region in total.\n\nOfficials said it was the first time F-22s had been based on Israeli soil for a combat mission.\n\n\n\nEarlier this week they left RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk, supported by refuelling tankers.\n\nThree “eye-in-the-sky” Awacs planes were also in position while spyplanes watched over the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nKhamenei’s forces had prepared for the onslaught and hit back at US bases in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE.\n\nCitizens were seen running in panic in Dubai. One person was reported to have been killed in nearby Abu Dhabi.\n\nIt was the most serious strike against US assets ever launched.\n\n\n\nMissiles targeted the Fifth Fleet HQ in Bahrain, and the US Consulate in Erbil in Iraq.\n\nA tower block was also hit in Bahrain.\n\nAnother Iranian missile was intercepted over Qatar’s Al-Udeid airbase, which houses RAF and USAF forces.\n\nJordan confirmed it had shot down two Iranian ballistic missiles.\n\nAnd Saudi Arabia appeared to be ready to join forces with nations opposing Iran.\n\n\n\nLeader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called with leaders of the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Jordan declaring he was ready to offer “all its capabilities”.\n\nSirens wailed across Israel as missile and drone interceptions were reported in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.\n\nIsraeli ambulance officials reported no deaths and 89 people with minor injuries.\n\nThe UK’s Foreign Office advised citizens in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE to seek shelter.\n\nIsrael Defence Forces warned Iranians living near military and nuclear sites to run for their lives.\n\n\n\nTrump’s patience ran out after Iran’s fanatical regime continued to block his no-nuke demands.\n\nThe mullahs issued a pledge not to build a bomb but were still rejecting US demands to stop enriching uranium used in warheads.\n\nAnd they refused to make concessions on their ballistic missile arsenal, funding Middle East terror and launching bloody massacres of opposition protesters.\n\n\n\nIran’s chief negotiator Araghchi had refused to engage directly with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and the President’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nMeanwhile, PM Sir Keir stressed: “The United Kingdom played no role in these strikes, but we have long been clear — the regime in Iran is utterly abhorrent.”\n\nHe said “planes were in the sky” yesterday to protect British people and interests in the region.\n\nAnd he revealed Iran has backed 20 potentially-fatal attacks on UK soil in the past year.\n\nUrging peace he said: “It is vital that we prevent further escalation and return to a diplomatic process.\n\n\n\n“Iran can end this now. They should refrain from further strikes, give up their weapons programmes, and cease the appalling violence and depression against the Iranian people, who deserve the right to determine their own future.”\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nLabour MP Emily Thornberry said: “I’m pleased to see the UK is not involved in these strikes. They are ill-advised and illegal.”\n\nOther left-wing MPs accused Trump of ripping up international law. Greens leader Zack Polanski called for the UK to cut US ties."

            "content": "IT looks like the Assisted Dying Bill will not become law – this year, at least.\n\nThe proposed law would allow people with a terminal illness and fewer than six months to live to be euthanised by NHS doctors.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot has been written about the Bill, and whether it is right or wrong for a state to have the power to kill with consent.\n\nI have listened to both sides of the argument and find myself torn over what to think.\n\nThe Bill has eloquent backers, including Dame Esther Rantzen.\n\nAnd it is impossible not to be deeply moved by the stories of people suffering from painful illnesses who say they want dignity in death.\n\nWhy should their final months be spent in misery on a hospital ward somewhere if they can be helped to have a planned and humane death?\n\nOn the other hand, is assisted dying a slippery slope?\n\nWill old, disabled and sick people feel pressured to end their lives early — to “pull the plug”, so to speak?\n\nI don’t propose to tell you what to think about assisted dying. It is a matter of personal conscience.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of you will have watched a loved one die after a long illness and have strong feelings on both sides of the debate.\n\nBut I do think it is a good thing that this Assisted Dying Bill will not pass.\n\nIt was a bad Bill — rushed, and poorly thought through.\n\nSo why was this Bill such a bad Bill? First, it was a Private Members Bill put forward by a Labour backbench MP, Kim Leadbeater.\n\nThis means it did not have government backing or the time for parliamentary debate that comes with that.\n\nIt was only debated in the House of Commons for about 13 hours before MPs voted it through.\n\nThat is simply not enough. There has been far more debate in the House of Lords, and it is under this glare of scrutiny that it has hit the skids.\n\nPeers have tabled more than 1,000 amendments.\n\nThis is a staggeringly high number that shows just how widespread the concern is about the proposed law.\n\nSecond, where is the plan to transform the NHS to cope with the new responsibility — and burden — if and when the Bill does pass?\n\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, we do not have one. No plan for where the money will come from to set up new assisted dying clinics.\n\nI haven’t seen a single assessment of whether NHS doctors and nurses will actually be willing to take part in these consensual suicides.\n\nIndeed, the Labour government itself is deeply divided.\n\nAs it is a matter of conscience, MPs were allowed to vote however they liked on the Bill — there was no party whip.\n\nSir Keir Starmer has backed it but his own Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, voted against it.\n\nMr Streeting says end of life palliative care is not good enough — and so patients may feel pressured into choosing assisted dying without a decent alternative.\n\nWith the Cabinet itself so conflicted, how can we possibly go ahead with the half-baked plan?\n\nI also worry that the NHS is simply not in good enough nick to be able to cope with such a big change and heavy responsibility.\n\nOur health service is already struggling. Most of us will have seen this first hand.\n\nDoctors not passing on medical notes to specialists. Scans booked and cancelled without patients being told. Tests taken and the results duly lost.\n\n\n\nIs the NHS really in a fit enough state to cope with taking on the new role of assisted dying too?\n\nIf Number 10 want to bring in assisted dying they should make the case for it.\n\nThey should commission research to tell us how the “service” would physically operate, how much it would cost, and how it would be overseen.\n\nThey should give proper parliamentary time to the debate of the law.\n\nIt is too important for shotgun legislation.\n\nAnd they must make sure end-of-life palliative care is improved so people considering assisted dying have a proper humane alternative.\n\nOnly when this work is done — and these safeguards in place — will we be in position to decide if assisted dying is something the state should carry out.\n\nGorgeous Kate, my catwalk queen for ever\n\nIT is great to see Kate Moss back on the catwalk storming the runway for Gucci at Milan Fashion Week.\n\nNow in my book, Kate is everything a supermodel should be.\n\n\n\nShe is drop-dead gorgeous, a style icon, and a party animal.\n\nHer hell-raising antics and penchant for brooding rock stars defined the Noughties for girls like me.\n\nHow much more fun is she than the awful nepo baby gazillionaires who now dominate the catwalk?\n\nEvery pouting catwalk princess seems to be the sprog of some rich, Hollywood couple.\n\nHow many 14 year-olds from Croydon in South London are spotted simply for their looks now – like Kate was?\n\nThese young pretenders don’t walk the runway in Paris and then tear off to Glastonbury Festival to party until 6am like Kate did in her heyday.\n\nSo hooray for Kate, Queen of the catwalk. May she long reign over us.\n\nNEVER ACCEPT HATE\n\nWHAT is happening on Britain’s streets?\n\nSir Winston Churchill’s statue in Parliament Square has been vandalised with the words “Zionist war criminal” in orange paint.\n\n\n\nDays earlier, a newly opened Gail’s Bakery was smashed up by racist thugs.\n\nA friend of mine sent me a video from outside Gail’s.\n\nEvery single window has been smashed. It looks like someone has opened fire on it.\n\nThis is not mindless thuggery, but something far darker.\n\nLocals fear Gail’s was targeted because it is owned by a British Israeli woman.\n\nHardline protesters demanding a boycott have targeted the company for some time.\n\nSo don’t buy your sandwiches there if you don’t want to.\n\nBut what is happening on our streets is very worrying.\n\nShops targeted because of the heritage of their owner. Windows smashed up. Glass left on the floor.\n\nThis has happened before in 1930s Germany. It had a name – Kristallnacht.\n\n\n\nThis intimidation and violence is not acceptable.\n\nIt must not be tolerated or excused in the name of “political protest”.\n\nA FLY TRICK\n\nWE have all been stung by exorbitant charges just to check our baggage on to a flight.\n\nSo hats off to Laura Poole, a Cardiff businesswoman who saved cash by posting her clothes to Dundee instead.\n\nShe only had to fork out £2.29 for the postage fee with InPost – rather than the 30 quid Ryanair would have charged her.\n\nI’m off to Italy later this year. I wonder if InPost does deliveries there?\n\nPLEASE BUTTER ME UP\n\nA POSH new London private members’ club is looking for a “butter sommelier” to be in charge of, well, its butter.\n\nThe Pembroke in Belgravia is on the hunt for someone “with a deep love for, and understanding of” the yellow stuff.\n\n\n\nTheir tasks will include curating all the different types of butter and “training staff using the silver butter trolley”.\n\nWell look no further – sign me up!\n\nI love butter. My mum basically reared me on the stuff. I panic if I don’t have at least two blocks of Lurpak in the fridge at all times.\n\nI love butter on crumpets, hot cross buns and toast. My stomach turns if I see a tub of margarine. Yuck!\n\nIt is a pale imitation. A bright yellow artificial- tasting imposter.\n\nSo to the fine folk at The Pembroke – if it is a true butter connoisseur you are after, hit me up.\n\nIN THE FRAME\n\nA POLICE officer has been sacked after getting caught skiving while pretending to work from home.\n\nThe officer, who has only been named in reports as Sergeant X, was holding down keys on her laptop with a picture frame to make it look like she was busy beavering away.\n\nBut hang on – what was a police officer doing working from home anyway?\n\n\n\nShouldn’t they be out on the beat protecting our streets?\n\nOr down the nick quizzing ne’er-do-wells on their crimes?\n\nThe officer’s dodgy antics only date back to April and May last year – so Covid lockdowns can’t be to blame.\n\nHaving coppers working, or skiving, from home when they could be out making arrests is criminal."

I’m calling time on this and on 1 May the biggest upgrade in rights and protections in decades will be switched on.\n\n“Yet just this week, Reform said they would scrap them, leaving renters vulnerable to exploitation. The party that claims to be on the side of normal people showed their true colours. They’re really in the pockets of rogue landlords. This government is on the side of the millions of hardworking people and families that are renting and deserve the well overdue protections the Renters’ Rights Act will introduce.”\n\nThe groundbreaking Renters’ Rights Act will come into force in two months, changing the experience of renting for millions in England. It will abolish section 21 ‘no-fault’ eviction notices, end rent bidding wars and get rid of fixed contracts, giving renters the flexibility to leave with two months' notice.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nIt will shield them financially, stopping rents going up more than once a year and establishing new powers to challenge unfair rent increases.\n\nMr Reed continued: “These much called for measures will mean renters get the decent, safe and secure homes that they deserve, providing the foundations they need to work, raise a family and build a life. I know that a safe and secure home is more than just bricks and mortar – it is housing that can truly transform a person’s life. I’m determined to end the housing crisis we inherited, build the 1.5 million homes this country needs and give renters the stability and security they deserve.”\n\nResponding, a Reform UK spokesman said: “Labour’s Renters’ Rights Act has been a disaster for renters. It’s already driving landlords to sell up in droves, slashing rental supply and pushing up rental prices. All Steve Reed and his government has achieved is making renting more expensive and leaving ordinary people desperately hunting for homes that simply aren’t there.\""

Spanish health authorities have confirmed 82 cases of a particular strain of mpox.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTravel Health Pro stated: \"As of 17 February 2026, a total of 82 cases of mpox clade Ib have been reported in Spain. 62 of these cases have been reported in men who have sex with men (MSM).\" The organisation added: \"Take extra precautions.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Ib variant is believed to spread more easily than the clade II strain which sparked an outbreak across the UK in 2022. Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, can be transmitted between individuals through direct physical contact with mpox blisters or scabs.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAfter contracting mpox, symptoms typically emerge between five and 21 days following infection. Initial signs may include a high temperature, intense headaches, muscle pains and backache, along with swollen glands, chills, extreme fatigue and joint discomfort.\n\nView 3 Images As of February 17, 2026, a total of 82 cases of mpox clade Ib have been reported in Spain (Image: Getty)\n\nA rash may appear anywhere on the body between one and five days after symptom onset. The World Health Organisation (WHO) warns that very young children, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems, particularly those with uncontrolled HIV, are at heightened risk of severe complications from mpox, which can be life-threatening.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThroughout 2024, several African nations have been grappling with an outbreak of clade Ib mpox cases. Concurrently, imported instances have surfaced in a range of countries, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United States.\n\nThe NHS recommends contacting 111 if you exhibit any symptoms of mpox and have travelled to central or eastern Africa within the past three weeks, especially if you've had close contact with an individual showing signs of mpox.\n\nView 3 Images If you are eligible you can get vaccinated against mpox (Image: Getty)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe health organisation emphasised that whilst the condition is \"rare\", there are measures you can take to minimise your risk of contracting it and transmitting it to others. These include:\n\nGet vaccinated if you're offered the mpox vaccine\n\nWash your hands with soap and water regularly or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser\n\nLook out for any possible symptoms of mpox for three weeks after returning from central or east Africa\n\nTalk to sexual partners about their sexual health and any symptoms they may have\n\nBe aware of the symptoms of mpox if you're sexually active, especially if you have new sexual partners\n\nTake a break from sex and intimate contact if you have symptoms of mpox until you're seen by a doctor and are told you cannot pass it on\n\nDo not share bedding or towels with people who may have mpox\n\nDo not have close contact (within one metre) with people who may have mpox\n\nDo not go near wild or stray animals, including animals that appear unwell or are dead, while travelling in central or east Africa\n\nDo not eat or touch meat from wild animals while travelling in central or east Africa\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAccording to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), the first case of mpox clade Ib infection was confirmed in the UK on 30 October 2024.

This is not only Justice for the people of Iran, but for all Great Americans, and those people from many countries throughout the world, that have been killed or mutilated by Khamenei and his gang of bloodthirsty thugs.\"\n\nThe revelation comes as the POTUS appeared hesitant to confirm the rumours earlier this evening. When initially asked if Khamenei had been killed, he simply said: \"We feel that is a correct story.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to be the first to declare his death. He said there are \"growing signs\" that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is \"gone\" after US and Israeli strikes.\n\nTrump continued to celebrate the apparent death of the supreme leader while hinting others may possibly have been killed in the strikes.\n\nYet despite the triumph, the US president continues to send an ominous warning to Iran - that more \"death\", destruction and bombing is on the way for \"as long as necessary\" until peace is restored.\n\nTrump stated: \"He [Khamenei] was unable to avoid our intelligence and highly sophisticated tracking systems and, working closely with Israel, there was not a thing he, or the other leaders that have been killed along with him, could do.\n\n\"This is the single greatest chance for the Iranian people to take back their country.\n\n\"We are hearing that many of their IRGC, military, and other security and police forces, no longer want to fight, and are looking for immunity from us.\n\n\"As I said last night, 'Now they can have immunity, later they only get death!'\n\n\"Hopefully, the IRGC and police will peacefully merge with the Iranian patriots, and work together as a unit to bring back the country to the greatness it deserves. That process should soon be starting in that, not only the death of Khamenei but the country has been, in only one day, very much destroyed and, even, obliterated.\n\n\"The heavy and pinpoint bombing, however, will continue, uninterrupted throughout the week or, as long as necessary to achieve our objective of peace throughout the Middle East and, indeed, the world.\"\n\nThe statement comes as Downing Street confirmed the US leader spoke on the phone with Prime Minister Keir Starmer as well as other world leaders this evening, to discuss the developments in the Middle East.\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres said during the emergency Security Council meeting that he was \"not in a position to confirm\" Israel's reports about the death.\n\nThis is a Breaking News story.

            "content": "Former world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr has announced a surprise return to the ring, revealing plans for a fourth comeback that will begin with an exhibition against Mike Tyson before a blockbuster professional rematch with Manny Pacquiao later this year.\n\nThe rivals are set to meet again on September 19 at the Sphere - 11 years after their long-awaited 2015 showdown, when Mayweather claimed a unanimous-decision victory in the so-called 'Fight of the Century.'\n\nPacquiao, now 47, returned to action in July 2025 and fought Mario Barrios to a majority draw for the WBC welterweight title, insisting his comeback is driven by a desire to become world champion again. Mayweather, meanwhile, says he 'still has what it takes to set more records,' despite questions regarding his financial status.\n\nA recent report by Business Insider suggested Mayweather’s widely publicised fortune may be overstated, citing liens, outstanding debts, foreclosures and heavily leveraged assets including property holdings and his private jet.\n\nBack in 2024, I caught a glimpse of life inside Mayweather's orbit - a whirlwind casino evening filled with luxury excess, eye-watering tips and one surprising moment of frugality.\n\nFloyd Mayweather invited Daily Mail Sport for a night out in Las Vegas in an extraordinary offer\n\nCharlotte Daly hit the strip with Mayweather for a big night out in Las Vegas (pictured above)\n\nWhen Floyd Mayweather invites you for a night out in Las Vegas, you know it will be extraordinary. Picture this: the neon lights of the strip reflecting off luxury cars, the pulsating energy of the city that never sleeps, and 'Money Mayweather' at the centre of it all.\n\nFrom exclusive cigar lounges to high-roller tables, this was no ordinary night out. We sipped 'Good Money Whiskey' and indulged in caviar before discussing Mayweather's relationship with his father, the key moments in his career, the current crop of boxers, and his exhibition earnings.\n\nIn true Mayweather style, he arrived at Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot, in a blacked-out SUV, wearing a £2,000 Gucci jacket and a gleaming Rolex. Fans clamoured for photos as he was greeted by models holding sparklers and a glowing Mayweather sign.\n\n'I do like the finer things in life', Mayweather quipped when asked about his love for luxury. 'I enjoy my cars and my watches but money don't make me, I make money.\n\n'I don't just keep all the money either, I give back to the less fortunate. My mother don't want for nothing, my loved ones don't want for anything. My team live a pretty good life. They travel the world, stay at five star hotels. But, the most important thing is, we are happy. I was happy before I made money. With or without money I am a happy person.'\n\nA fixture on the Vegas Strip with his 7,000-square-foot gentleman's club and top-tier boxing gym, Mayweather took charge behind the bar, crafting an Old Fashioned cocktail with his Good Money Whiskey - a brand now available in 10 states including Nevada, California, and Florida.\n\nWhen handed the five-year-old whiskey, Mayweather joked, 'She's come all the way from the UK, and you're giving her the five-year-old whiskey? She deserves the 10-year!'\n\nThough not drinking himself, Mayweather passed the cocktail with a knowing smile. 'It's just like boxing,' he said confidently. 'I had the best team, so I got the best results. I've got the best team working on my brands, too. Just try it and you'll see.'\n\nIn true Mayweather style, he arrived at Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot, in a blacked-out SUV, wearing a £2,000 Gucci jacket and a gleaming Rolex\n\nWith a drink in hand, we moved to Mayweather's exclusive area, adorned with Le Bon Argent Champagne and attentive waitresses ensuring my glass was always full. Intrigued by highlight reels of his career playing on the screens overhead, I asked the boxing legend about his favorite memory.\n\n'I'm not sure which one was my favourite fight but the best fighter I ever fought probably was Manny Pacquiao. I can see why he won so many fights, it's all the moves he would make. But, I reckon the roughest fight I ever had was Emanuel Augustus, he was very tough competitor. When I faced him, I think he was 26 with 14 losses but extremely tough.\n\n'That being said, I think around half of my 50 fights were world title fights, so they were all good fights'.\n\nMayweather faced and defeated some of the biggest names in boxing, including Manny Pacquiao, Oscar De La Hoya, and Canelo Alvarez. He also claimed world titles in five different weight classes: Super Featherweight, Lightweight, Light Welterweight, Welterweight, and Light Middleweight.\n\nBut the true highlight of his career was walking away unharmed—a poignant topic given his father and uncle, Roger, both suffered neurological damage resulting in memory loss.\n\n'The real highlight of my career is that I am still able to communicate. That I am still able to speak well. I am still able to read and write. I am able to spend time with my children and I am able to travel. I still have all my faculties. That's the part about my career I am most pleased with. Not everyone gets that luxury and I've seen it first hand.'\n\nMayweather's relationship with his father has been complex but pivotal. Mayweather Sr. was instrumental in shaping his son's career, developing the defensive style that became his hallmark. Despite public disagreements and periods of estrangement, their bond remains strong.\n\n'My dad was my inspiration growing up. Without my dad I wouldn't have any of this. Without my dad I wouldn't have the crazy real estate portfolio I have. I wouldn't have met my two best friends, James McNair and Ricki Brazil. I wouldn't be here with you today. My dad is my driving force, my dad is everything to me.'\n\nFans clamoured for photos with him as he made his way to Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot\n\nA stark contrast to when Mayweather lashed out at his father in 2011, shouting: 'You couldn't fight for s***. You weren't nothing but a motherf***ing cab driver... bum a** trainer. You weren't s*** as a fighter, so how you gonna be something as a trainer. Get the f*** out my gym f*****t!'.\n\nWhile other kids played, Mayweather's childhood was a whirlwind of responsibilities, juggling time between caring for his drug-addict mother and training with his father.\n\n'My dad was about business, ever since I was a kid. From 1985, my dad had me running five miles a day. He wouldn't let me run in sneakers either. He made me run five miles every day in combat boots while I was a child.\n\n'He also brought me out into the garden and made me chop wood. He always told me, there is no room for excuses. He said no matter how many fights you win, it's never good enough, you can always get better. There is always room for growth.\n\n'But, my dad gave me structure. He helped mould me into the man I am today. A man of honour, a man of dignity. A stand-up guy. A person that believes he can get better. It's all because of my father.'\n\nAs we chatted, one of Floyd's friends casually offered spoonfuls of caviar around the room. This wasn't your average caviar; it was the kind that likely costs more than my entire monthly salary. The nonchalant manner in which it was served, however, made it seem like an everyday snack.\n\nMeanwhile, Eddie Griffin, a comedian from American sitcom Malcolm & Eddie, flitted around the room casually cracking jokes before diving into the high-stakes action at the casino tables.\n\nHaving accompanied him to the high-roller area, I watched in awe as players casually dropped $500k per round on craps. It was clear I'd be spectating rather than participating in this high-rolling spectacle.\n\nA fixture on the Vegas Strip with his 7,000-square-foot gentleman's club and top-tier boxing gym, Mayweather took charge behind the bar, crafting an Old Fashioned cocktail\n\nWhile Mayweather wasn't one to splurge at the tables, he was exceptionally generous with his tips. When $500 slipped from his pocket, he handed it to a waitress without hesitation and quickly pulled out another $500 for her colleague, making sure everyone felt appreciated.\n\nMayweather's wealth stems from his boxing prowess. Known for his defensive mastery and unmatched ring IQ, he earned the nickname 'Pretty Boy' for his flawless, unmarked face. He firmly believes no boxer will ever match his unique skills.\n\n'There will never be another boxer like me because my IQ was just on another level. You've got guys that have fast hands, you've got guys who have great punching power but they will never compete with my IQ.\n\n'My IQ was just on a whole different level. I could make adjustments that other people wouldn't be able to do. Go look at the Shane Mosley fight. Guy hit me with a couple of good shots, I came back the next round and put on a master class.\n\n'I was zoned in and knew exactly what he was going to do. I didn't hear the crowd, I didn't hear my trainer, I just listened to myself. I knew exactly what he was going to do. I had the ability to turn a fight on its head like that. Completely change the dynamic of a fight. That's what it takes, a sharp mind, a good chin and the heart of a lion.'\n\nYet, despite his undefeated boxing record (50-0) and iconic status, Mayweather acknowledged personal defeats beyond the ring.\n\n'Losing my uncle was a defeat. Losing my grandmother was a defeat. Losing my housekeeper of 20-something years was a defeat. Losing the mother of my children was a defeat. Losing my best friend was a defeat. I have been defeated in ways like that. Everything you go through in life is an experience you can grow from. I just try to use those experiences to become stronger every day.'\n\nMayweather's resilience in the face of such personal trials is mirrored in his approach to the racism he faced during his career.\n\nEddie Griffin, comedian from American sitcom Malcolm & Eddie, flitted around the room casually cracking jokes before diving into the high-stakes action at the casino tables\n\nGriffin joking told Mayweather he was going to steal a couple bottles of his whiskey\n\n'You're going to get racism and you're going to have to deal with it. I knew I was going to deal with it but that never stopped me from being who I wanted to be. It never stopped me from believing in myself.\n\n'It was never going to stop me from taking myself to the top. I knew I was the best and nothing was going to hold me back. There are many fighters that will come after me that will experience the same thing.\n\n'I want them to be great and I don't want them to be held back by it. I want them to surpass me if they can. Records are there to be broken but there will never be another Floyd Mayweather. I know that for a fact.'\n\nEven in retirement, Mayweather keeps his love for boxing alive through exhibition bouts, taking on the likes of Deji Olatunji, Tenshin Nasukawa, and Logan Paul.\n\nHowever, the pinnacle was his 2017 clash with MMA's Conor McGregor. While Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and LeBron James collectively earned $259 million that year, Mayweather surpassed that sum in a single night, shattering boxing's pay-per-view record with 6.5 million buys.\n\n'People have such a problem with my exhibitions. Jeff Bezos is well off but he's still working. Warren Buffett, he's probably in his 90's now and he's still working. The Walton's who own Walmart are still working. Elon Musk is still working. So, it's okay for me to work.\n\n'There is no risk with these exhibitions. I am taking on former MMA guys and YouTubers. They can't get near me. It's not a crime for me to have some fun with them and entertain the crowd.\n\n'I feel like I deserve it. I am still one of the most talked fighters in the sport of boxing and I'm not even boxing professionally anymore. So, it's only right I am getting the payday to match it. I have plenty of offers I could show you on my phone. $300million, $100million, $50million, $20million, $17million. They are all offers sat on my phone right now. It all depends but if you pay, we play. It's as simple as that.'\n\nMayweather popped into the local doughnut shop. After ordering two boxes of doughnuts, Mayweather was floored when he was told the total would be $90 (pictured above)\n\nPulling out a thick wad of cash, he went to pay before pausing dramatically, spreading the bills across his hands and playfully quipping 'I've got the money, I just don't want to spend it!'\n\nThe hilarious encounter ended with him handing over the money and taking the doughnuts\n\nDespite having the potential to rake in $300million from an exhibition bout and being nicknamed 'Money Mayweather,' the 47-year-old had a hilariously human moment at the end of our night out.\n\nJust as Brits might hit a kebab shop on their way home, Mayweather popped into the local doughnut shop. After ordering two boxes of doughnuts, Mayweather was floored when he was told the total would be $90.\n\nPulling out a thick wad of cash, he went to pay before pausing dramatically, spreading the bills across his hands and playfully quipping 'I've got the money, I just don't want to spend it!'.\n\nMayweather will return to the ring this summer for a rematch against John Gotti III - the grandson of the late mob boss - having first faced the 31-year-old back in June 2023, with the fight ending in chaos after a brawl broke out when people stormed the ring.\n\nThe Good Money is a global brand created in direct partnership with Floyd Mayweather. The brand produces high-quality Champagne and Whisky, with their bourbon available to purchase at large retailers such as Total Wine, Specs, Lee's Liquors and WalMart."

            "content": "Conor Benn to face former world champion on same card as Tyson Fury's return to boxing - as first bout since Eddie Hearn split is revealed\n\nConor Benn is set for a return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after agreeing to share top billing with Tyson Fury and Arslan Makhmudov and fight Regis Prograis in his first outing for new promotion Zuffa Boxing.\n\nThe British fighter announced his split with long-time promoter Eddie Hearn last week after 10 years of working together, with Benn instead joining Hearn's rival Dana White's fledgling company in an eight-figure deal.\n\nHearn revealed that he was 'devastated' by the defection, not least because he stood by the boxing dynasty scion throughout his ordeal over two failed drug tests in 2022.\n\nBenn previously fought in north London when he faced off with Chris Eubank Jr last year, with the fighter gaining his revenge after first being defeated by Eubank Jr in their initial meeting at the stadium.\n\nHis match-up with US light welterweight Prograis is set to take place on Saturday April 11, with their main event coming ahead of Fury's return to the ring after his retirement last year.\n\nThe evening is also set to be Netflix's first-ever live broadcast, following a number of events shown from the United States - including Anthony Joshua's meeting with Jake Paul last December - by the streaming giant.\n\nConor Benn will fight Regis Prograis on April 11 on the same card as the returning Tyson Fury\n\nFormer world champion Prograis last faced off with Jack Catterall on British soil at the Co-op Live in October 2024, with the Louisiana native losing to the Englishman by unanimous decision.\n\nBenn's decision to desert Hearn cast ripples through the boxing world, with Frank Warren sharing his comment in the form of a quote first made by former US President Harry S. Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one.

Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980. The bout was competitive, but Arguello scored the 11th-round knockout to retain his WBC super featherweight title.\n\nCastillo would lose his next bout, too, dropping a unanimous decision to Mexican legend Salvador Sanchez after leading the first six rounds.\n\nCastillo later lost to Julio Cesar Chavez in 1985 as the iconic boxer scored a sixth-round knockout at the Forum in Los Angeles.\n\nRuben Castillo (L) throws a punch against Julio Cesar Chavez during the fight at the LA Forum\n\nBoxer Ruben 'the Conquistador' Castillo has passed away at 68, according to the World Boxing Council.

'Definitely world championship material in a different era. R.I.P.'\n\nCastillo ultimately served as an announcer alongside legendary play-by-play man, Chick Hearn.\n\n'Ruben and Chick Hearn were gold on Fights From The Fabulous Forum broadcasts,' one fan wrote online. 'Great stuff.'\n\nHe also had a reputation as a positive influence on many young fighters and fans.\n\n'A great man,' his nephew wrote on Facebook. 'Both him and his family were a great part of my childhood. He always gave great advice, would be there when ya needed him. Going to parties at his place, doing golf charity events. He def was the neighborhood Uncle for alot of us.\n\nCastillo later served as an announcer on many WBC fights from the Forum in Los Angeles\n\n'A Family man, Boxer, Charity planner, we lost. Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God. May his wife Cindy, family and friends find comfort with the support of the so many who loved Ruben. Rest in eternal peace.'"

I don't think there's any problem in trying to get something but it wasn't really what we wanted at all and it was very difficult to get the message on.\n\n'But there's a bigger issue with it. It has been allowed to let go, whether it be blocking of goalkeepers or blocking of defenders, and you get the feeling now that referees really don't want to get involved in any of it.\n\n'It is nearly wrestling to an extent, which it shouldn't be. It should never have gone to this situation but I think it's been really poor that they've not tried to deal with it well enough and stop it.\n\n'You are now allowed lots of blocking, for example. In my day if you blocked someone it would have been a free-kick. But blocking has become a big part of it. Let's be fair, the best at it – but with style – would be Arsenal.\n\nEverton manager David Moyes has compared football's set piece obsession to 'wrestling'\n\nThe Toffees were criticised for their approach to corners against Manchester United this week\n\n'(They have a) good delivery, good style but ultimately there's a lot of dark arts in it such as blocking the goalkeeper from the back or the front, blocking defenders and making it difficult for them to be your key headers of the ball.\n\n\n\n'It is a big thing in football but I do think the level of refereeing has let that part of the game drop. And managers, if we see somebody else doing it and not getting punished for it, then we are all on it.'"

            "content": "Manchester City's dramatic triumph at Leeds United was marred by ugly scenes during and after the game as players clashed, Leeds boss Daniel Farke was shown a red card and Pep Guardiola called for 'respect' on a night home fans jeered as players observed Ramadan.\n\nAntoine Semenyo’s 45th-minute strike secured three points but only after City had to dig in to preserve a clean sheet amid a late Leeds onslaught.\n\nLeeds supporters booed en masse as three City players broke their fast for Ramadan, while Guardiola was involved in a stand-off with home fans in the Elland Road main stand during the second half.\n\nOne man in the home end appeared to head towards City’s dugout to confront Guardiola while the game was ongoing.\n\n‘They said something to me,’ Guardiola said. ‘W*****, w*****. But anyway, it is what it is.’\n\nGuardiola blew kisses and waved to that area of the stadium once the match finished, sarcastically claiming that his family were sat in that enclosure.\n\nDaniel Farke is shown red at the full-time whistle as Manchester City pick up a crucial three points at Elland Road! 🟥 pic.twitter.com/i3gziRPR1s — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) February 28, 2026\n\nTensions rose at full-time after Man City's 1-0 win over Leeds as both set of players clashed\n\nDaniel Farke was sent off seconds after full-time for confronting referee Peter Bankes\n\nDaniel Farke then saw red for confronting referee Peter Bankes after full time, while City skipper Bernardo Silva had to be led away after appearing to goad Leeds fans behind one goal.\n\nGuardiola called for ‘respect’ after the scenes in the 12th minute when Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Omar Marmoush were afforded time to take on vitamins and water after fasting.\n\nBoth teams headed over to their respective benches for around a minute. That was met by a chorus of persistent boos and offensive chanting from home fans until the match restarted.\n\nA message relaying that players were breaking fast was beamed onto Elland Road’s screens at the same time as the dissent.\n\n‘It is a modern world, right?’ Guardiola said. ‘[You see] what is happening in the world today. Respect religion, diversity, that is the point. The Premier League says you can have one or two minutes, you can have for the [fasting] players to do it [break their fast]. It is what it is, unfortunately.\n\n'Of course they [the players] know it. We took on a little bit of vitamins because they did not eat today. No more than that. The question is, can they do it or not? What is the problem?’\n\nCity requested the introduction of a break on Friday, which Leeds accommodated and confirmed 24 hours ahead of the meeting.\n\nFarke’s starting XI did not include any Muslim players. Ramadan will end next month, with a break in fasting expected during the FA Cup clash between Wrexham and Chelsea in next week’s 5:45pm kick off.\n\nFarke remonstrated with Bankes at full time for not elongating stoppage time and his sending off meant the German could not conduct post-match interviews.\n\nGuardiola blew kisses towards home fans who had been abusing him after they earlier booed when the game was paused for three City stars to break their Ramadan fast\n\nA message on the stadium's big screen had explained what was going on during the stoppage\n\nBernardo Silva also had to be led away after appearing to goad Leeds fans behind one goal at full-time\n\nLeeds assistant manager Edmund Riemer said: ‘We had six minutes added time. If you’re chasing the game and see the opposition doing what all teams do and waste time – they got booked for wasting time – then you can add a few seconds more.\n\n‘You’re emotional. The explanation is going to be that he is overly emotional. We’d wish for a more sensible reaction from the referee, to give a yellow card.’\n\nRiemer added that the backroom staff was ‘disappointed’ at the booing of the Ramadan break, while Guardiola praised his side’s fortitude in keeping Leeds out as they hunted a late equaliser.\n\n‘Leeds is so intense,’ the City boss added. ‘After that we did what we are good at, a thousand million passes, [making] the vibe of the crowd a little bit more calm.\n\n‘We missed a little bit of intention up front with the movements but when they got fatigued we had more intention. We normally drop in the second half but that didn’t happen today: we didn’t concede anything.\n\n‘It was long balls where we struggled. It was more uncomfortable but we defended really well. We played a complete game, in a tough, tough place and with 10 games left in the Premier League it is time to be decisive.’\n\nMeanwhile, a Kick It Out statement read: 'It’s massively disappointing that some Leeds United fans jeered when Manchester City’s players broke their fast during the first half of the match at Elland Road this evening. This was compounded by the fact that an explanation was displayed on a big screen inside the stadium.\n\n'Pausing the game to allow Muslim players to break their fast during Ramadan has been an agreed protocol for several years now. It’s an important and visible part of making the game welcoming for Muslim players and communities.\n\n'But as tonight’s reaction shows, football still has a long way to go in terms of education and acceptance.'"

            "content": "At full-time there was a short rebuke for the fourth official and then some sarcastic waves and blown kisses for the home fans with the colourful language behind the dugout. Suffice to say that in Pep Guardiola’s mind the Premier League title race has begun.\n\nThis is what a night at Elland Road can do to you. It can fray your nerves and scramble your mind. In a sporting sense, it can leave you gasping for air.\n\nThat Guardiola and his Manchester City teams managed to surface with three points at the end of this night of punch and counter punch says much about them. This may not be a City team of the classic Guardiola genre. It still feels like a work in progress and – if the great Catalan sticks around – we may not see the best of it for another year or so.\n\nBut the one thing this team shares with those that have passed before it is guts and they were there for all to see in west Yorkshire on Saturday night. A seam of courage and cussedness and experience runs through this City team. It’s carried in the blood of players like Gianluigi Donnarumma, Bernardo Silva, Ruben Dias and Rodri. Erling Haaland was not here for this one. He is injured. But a warrior spirit endures and it may yet be enough to give title favourites Arsenal a touch of the heebie-jeebies between now and the finishing line.\n\nDaniel Farke’s Leeds team don’t give anything away here in front of their own crowd. The minority of the home support that booed when play was stopped after 15 minutes so three City players could break their Ramadan fast may wish to do better next time but apart from that, the Leeds fans played a fundamental part in what was an incredibly tight game.\n\nLeeds were better for the first 25 minutes and the final fifteen. City rode their luck at both ends of the contest. In between, they managed to exert a modicum of control. Their centre half pairing of Dias and Marc Guehi was terrific for the most part while their new playmaker Rayan Cherki possesses the kind of vision and instinct that cannot be taught. How he doesn’t start every week is a mystery to which Guardiola doubtlessly has a smart answer.\n\nPep Guardiola will think that the Premier League title race is underway after closing the gap to Arsenal against Leeds\n\nNew signing Antoine Semenyo's first-half goal was the only difference-maker in the tie\n\nLeeds, for their part, play with a wonderful energy and vibrancy when their blood is up. They can be lovely to watch. Here, they sprang from the traps and should really have been ahead in the third minute.\n\nBrenden Aaronson got away down the right and it was not to be for the first time. His low cross found Dominic Calvert-Lewin arriving unmarked but the striker’s first time shot was stabbed the wrong side of the far post by about a foot. The ball did arrive at pace but even so Calvert-Lewin should have done better.\n\nHe was lively early on and City struggled to contain him. Calvert-Lewin is mobile and nimble when fully fit and here he worried City again as he ran on to a pass down the left in the 18th minute, turned Guehi surprisingly easily and pulled a low shot across goal and wide.\n\nThis pretty much summed up the flow of the game for half an hour. Leeds were on the front foot and dangerous while City were unable to slow the game down and impose their own rather more sedate rhythm. That period of the game was to arrive eventually but City had to survive some difficult moments first.\n\nCity goalkeeper Donnarumma dropped to his right to save a low 20-yard shot from James Justin while Jayden Bogle stole the ball from Rayan Ait-Nouri in the 22nd minute before crossing to the near post for Aaronson to poke it wide under pressure.\n\nCalvert-Lewin won a header from a corner soon after and Justin was close to nudging the ball in. On the touchline, with 25 minutes gone, Guardiola was looking agitated and it was with good reason.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin was a live wire in the thick of his good run of form but Man City were able to keep him under wraps\n\nOver time, the pattern of the game did change. Leeds couldn’t maintain the energy that fuelled their fast start and slowly dropped back in to a 5-4-1 shape. It doubtless wasn’t deliberate but it happened anyway.\n\nCity duly accepted the invitation to play a little higher up the field and it was from a spell of control if not incessant pressure that their goal eventually came. Before that there were some scares for Leeds. Omar Marmoush had a cross shot saved while Leeds goalkeeper Karl Darlow palmed away a Nico O’Reilly header when the young England star should have scored.\n\nLeeds still worried City when they broke but they no longer had a grip on the game. And when Cherki played Ait-Nouri clear with a lovely pass in the third minute of first half injury time, he crossed low for Semenyo to score from six yards.\n\nCity didn’t particularly deserve their lead but at half-time Leeds perhaps may have asked themselves how many saves Donnarumma had been asked to make. Not many. Four minutes in to the second half, the big Italian had cause to be concerned again as Calvert-Lewin took aim from an angle. This time, City full-back Matheus Nunes got across to make a fabulous block.\n\nThat proved to be a rather isolated second half threat as once again City largely controlled the game. Marmoush may have turned in Rodri’s cross shot at the far post in the 62nd minute but his legs couldn’t quite get him there. Then another Cherki pass released Nunes and his pull-back travelled all the way to the top of the penalty area on the other side where Ait-Nouri collected and drove a shot over.\n\nDarlow’s save from a Guehi header with just less than 20 minutes left was the best of the game and served to indicate that Leeds were now hanging on. Farke, to his credit, tried to alter the flow of the game with two attacking substitutions, Daniel James and Wilfried Gnonto coming on soon after.\n\nGnonto in particular had been influential as Leeds grabbed a late draw here against Liverpool before Christmas and he was soon troubling City with his darting runs and ability to spring off either foot. But it was another substitute who almost levelled the game with his first touch as Dutch forward met a corner from the right after being thrown on in the 86th minute only to head the ball down and wide when half of Elland Road thought it was in. Leeds were re-energised by their substitutes and came strong at the end. Liverpool buckled here back in early winter but City did not."

            "content": "Leeds fans BOO as Man City clash is briefly halted to allow Pep Guardiola's Muslim stars to break their Ramadan fast\n\nLeeds United supporters jeered en masse as three Manchester City players observed the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.\n\nReferee Peter Bankes called a stoppage in play in the 12th minute, allowing Rayan Ait-Nouri, Rayan Cherki and Omar Marmoush to break their fast at the time of sunset.\n\nThe trio could take on food and water on the touchline, with both teams heading over to their respective benches for around a minute.\n\nThat was met by a chorus of persistent boos and offensive chanting from home fans until the match restarted.\n\nA message relaying that players were breaking fast was beamed onto Elland Road's screens at the same time as the dissent.\n\nLeeds assistant manager Eddie Riemer, filling in for Daniel Farke on media duties, said he was 'disappointed if it happened' when questioned after the game on what had gone on.\n\nLeeds United supporters jeered en masse as three Manchester City players observed the Islamic holy month of Ramadan during their clash at Elland Road on Saturday\n\nAfter the game was paused in the 12th minute, City stars Omar Marmoush (pictured), Rayan Ait-Nouri and Ryan Cherki all took on food and water on the touchline\n\nCity requested the introduction of a break on Friday, which Leeds accommodated and confirmed 24 hours ahead of the meeting.\n\nDaniel Farke's starting XI did not include any Muslim players.\n\nRamadan will end next month, with a break in fasting expected during the FA Cup clash between Wrexham and Chelsea in next week's 5:45pm kick off.\n\nCity travel to Newcastle United in the 8pm slot that day and their Muslim stars, including Abdukodir Khusanov, will have been able to take on food and water beforehand.\n\n'They follow this religious tradition,' Guardiola said on the eve of the Leeds trip. 'We have good nutritionists and they adapt to what the team needs.\n\n'We cannot adapt the schedule for the Premier League [kick-off] times and I think they are used to it - they are not young and have been playing [for] many years during this period.\n\n'For the players I think it is not new. Both Rayans, Omar and Khusa, it is not the first time for [observing] Ramadan and they know perfectly how to handle it.'\n\nThe break in play lasted for around a minute as Pep Guardiola relayed instructions to his team\n\nSpeaking on BBC Five Live, former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson highlighted the importance of the breaks.\n\nHe said: 'I think it's very good for the players. We talk about the athletes and how fine-tuned they are at the moment.\n\n'To go that long without food and drink, it is vitally important that they have that break.'\n\nThe Premier League confirmed earlier this month that Ramadan breaks would be used in matches again this season to allow players to break their fast during the holy month, which runs from February 17 to March 19.\n\nGiven sunset in the UK ranges from around 5PM to 6.30PM during this period, the only games that are affected are 5:30PM kick-offs on a Saturday and the 4:30PM kick-off on a Sunday.\n\nThe protocol for these breaks sees teams and match officials discuss pre-match whether a pause is required, before they settle on an approximate time when the stoppage will take place.\n\nIt was in 2021 when Ramadan breaks were introduced, with Leicester City's clash against Crystal Palace in April of that year being the first occasion they were seen.\n\nDuring that match, play was paused at a goal-kick on around 30 minutes to allow Leicester's Wesley Fofana and Palace's Cheikhou Kouyate to take on board liquids and energy gels.\n\nIt has since become a regular occurrence to see games halted during Ramadan.\n\nMan United's FA Cup clash against Fulham last March was one example, with the match stopped to allow Noussair Mazraoui to break his fast.\n\nAlongside the City quartet, Muslim names in the Premier League include Mohamed Salah, William Saliba, Fofana and Amad Diallo, while City legends Ilkay Gundogan, Riyad Mahrez and Yaya Toure are also followers of Islam.\n\nSpeaking back in 2023, former Everton and Watford star Abdoulaye Doucoure hailed the top flight for its work in making Muslim players feel welcome.\n\n'In the Premier League you are free to do whatever suits you. They will never do anything against your faith and this is great,' he told BBC Sport.\n\n'I fast every day, I don't miss any day. It has become normal and very easy for me.\n\n'Training is still the same during Ramadan but when we go [for away matches], we might need to eat later than the others so the chef prepares food for us, making sure everything is in place as at home. We get halal food so there are no problems.'\n\n\n\nIn 2022, former Liverpool player Sadio Mane also revealed the club altered their training schedules to support their Muslim players during the month of Ramadan."

            "content": "Liverpool fly out of the blocks to pick up crucial victory against plucky West Ham on an afternoon that felt like spring 2025, writes LEWIS STEELE\n\nA first outing of the season for sunshine and bright blue skies made this Anfield afternoon feel rather like spring 2025 – but the weather was not the only reason.\n\nFor the first time since the famous day of April last when Liverpool won the Premier League title by thrashing Tottenham, the Reds scored three in a first half and put a game to bed.\n\nThe weather makes everything feel better and, like the lyrics to Here Comes The Sun by local band the Beatles, it has been a long, cold, lonely winter for Liverpool.\n\nBut the green shoots of spring are now showing after a taxing mid-season slump-cum-crisis for the champions, who have now won four games in a row.\n\nHugo Ekitike, Virgil van Dijk and Alexis Mac Allister were the first-half goal-scorers as the Reds broke with tradition to put their chances away, unlike far too often this season where poor finishing has bugged Arne Slot.\n\nIt highlighted the importance of starting games strongly as it gave Liverpool the safety cushion of a rather sloppy second half where West Ham came out fighting and pulled one back through Tomas Soucek just after the break.\n\nLiverpool beat West Ham 5-2 to boost their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League\n\nThe Reds burst out of the traps and were 3-0 up by half-time. Hugo Ekitike (right) and Virgil van Dijk (left) were among the scorers\n\nThe result was slightly harsh on Nuno Espirito Santo's side yet it was a huge blow in their battle to avoid relegation\n\nFirst halves have been a major problem for Slot this year. His team had scored just 13 goals in opening periods this season, compared to 29 after the interval.\n\nToo often they have left themselves with mountains to climb, too often they have allowed opposition teams to grow in confidence against them.\n\nDespite the fast start, the overall performance still left a bit to be desired. In terms of expected goals (xG), West Ham created more and maybe classed themselves as still in the contest until Cody Gakpo put it out of reach on 71 minutes with a much-needed goal.\n\nThat xG statistic counts for nothing, though, in either the relegation battle or the scrap for Champions League places. All history will remember is Liverpool giving the Hammers a shellacking and putting a huge dent in their hopes of safety.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo’s charges came here on a run of just one defeat in their last eight – a loss to Chelsea in a game they led 2-0 – but he would have travelled back to London knowing the Hammers’ top-flight future is dangling by a thread.\n\nSlot, meanwhile, will know this was another crucial victory on the way to achieving Champions League qualification again for next season, after last week’s last-second winner at Nottingham Forest.\n\nThe importance of staying in Europe’s premier competition was highlighted in financial accounts published this week: they made a profit and posted record revenues last year, compared to a significant loss the year before when they were only in the Europa League.\n\nVan Dijk's header from a corner highlighted Liverpool's improved strength at set-pieces\n\nAlexis Mac Allister scored for the second successive week to double his tally for the season\n\nTomas Soucek pulled one back at the start of the second half, but Liverpool held their nerve\n\nWith Aston Villa losing to Wolves on Friday night, Unai Emery’s men have been reeled from a title race to a battle for the top five – so this was points gained on them for Liverpool, with tricky games for Chelsea and Manchester United on Sunday.\n\nGiven a tricky run-in for the Reds that sees them play all three of those teams in their last four games, two away from home, getting points on the board now might be of the utmost importance come squeaky bum time in May.\n\nAnother problem area in Liverpool’s tricky season has been set-pieces but this game was another step in the right direction in that regard.\n\nThe ‘set-piece table’ is rather pretentious but it is worth referring to with this team. At the turn of the year, no team had scored fewer set-piece goals than Liverpool. In a mini-league since the start of 2026, no one has more than the Reds.\n\nIt is a remarkable turnaround for a team who looked so weak at the so-called small margin of the game that actually is having a rather decisive influence on this season, something that Slot – and other managers – discuss every day.\n\nThe first goal technically came from a set-piece as West Ham twice failed to defend a corner and Ekitike, on the half-volley, powered his 16th goal of the season past Hermansen, who was not helped by a minor deflection.\n\nIt was soon two thanks to the captain, Van Dijk, who headed home a Dominik Szoboszlai corner which took the Hungarian to eight goal involvements for the calendar year. Unlike Liverpool’s up and down form, Szoboszlai’s supremacy has been unwavering in a stellar campaign.\n\nMac Allister, who pulled off a great robbery in Robin Hood country last weekend with a last-gasp winner in Nottingham, doubled his league tally for the season with a nice volley which, again, came from a corner.\n\nCody Gakpo ended his goal drought and Jeremie Frimpong forced an own goal late on\n\nTaty Castellanos did pull the score back to 4-2 at one point, but the Hammers remain two points adrift of safety\n\nClearly, this was a day to right the wrongs of this season. From set-piece vulnerability to putting Mikel Arteta’s dead-ball kings to shame, from slow starts being an unwanted theme to flying out of the blocks and having the game won by half-time.\n\nSoucek pulled a goal back on 49 minutes to add a few nerves to Anfield, which were only furthered when Gakpo shanked one wide at point-blank range minutes later. The Dutchman soon atoned by cutting in to score his first goal in eight games.\n\nWest Ham’s January signing Taty Castellanos scored his third goal for the club on 75 minutes to prove Liverpool’s set-piece problems may still exist in a defensive sense, but substitute Jeremie Frimpong soon forced a Reds fifth, via a deflection off Axel Disasi, to put the gloss on the win.\n\n\n\nIt was the first time Slot’s men have scored five in the league since they confirmed their status as champions last April. We know they won’t be doing the same again this year but this was a significant victory on the way to achieving their new goal of Champions League qualification."

            "content": "When Jacob Ramsey was sick on the pitch before the start of the second half, it was grimly symbolic of what had gone before and what was to follow for Newcastle - a nauseating performance regurgitated, just when they thought a cure had been found.\n\nThis was a third straight defeat in the Premier League at St James’ Park. Last time, against Brentford three weeks ago, there were home boos and a dressing-room inquest. Eddie Howe and his team responded with three wins on the road, leading to talk of a corner turned. Here, they stumbled back down a dark alley.\n\nJust when it felt like a glimmer of light had appeared at the death, and with Sandro Tonali’s booming volley headed for the back of the Gallowgate End net in salvation of a point, Jordan Pickford somehow flicked the ball onto the crossbar.\n\nThe home fans applauded in recognition of Tonali’s 20-yard blast, but the appreciation could easily have been for the save, had it not been the former Sunderland goalkeeper, pantomime villain turned Everton’s hero.\n\nPickford’s intervention preserved what was a deserved win for David Moyes’ side, who led in the 20th minute when Jarrad Branthwaite headed in from a corner.\n\nHe was outstanding at the other end, too, making a strong case for starting at centre-back in front of Pickford at the World Cup this summer.\n\nJacob Ramsey was sick on the pitch and it was a nauseating Newcastle performance\n\nJordan Pickford made an extraordinary save late in the game to deny Sandro Tonali\n\nRamsey levelled on 33 minutes but, 105 seconds later, Beto punished a Nick Pope spill for 2-1. There was another equaliser in the 82nd minute, Jacob Murphy’s volley taking a nick beyond Pickford, but again Newcastle proved allergic to parity.\n\nAnthony Gordon surrendered the ball in midfield seconds after the restart and substitute Thierno Barry slid in at the far post to convert from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s low centre.\n\nThe substitute turned in with his buttock but it was Newcastle again making the proverbial backside of their defending. Leeds, Bournemouth, Brentford and now Everton have all scored three times on Tyneside in 2026.\n\n‘We dominated the second half, scored and then self-imploded,’ said Howe. ‘It is a strange situation. We started the season so strong defensively. That has flipped on its head and it’s been building.\n\n'Our resilience to keep the ball out of the net is not good enough. Too many individual errors are costing us goals. Our home form has tailed off and we need to grab that back as quickly as possible.’\n\nNewcastle will now have to win all 10 remaining matches to equal last season’s points tally of 66, when they finished fifth. If they are to qualify for next season’s Champions League, then, they’ll have to do it by beating Barcelona in the last 16 and going all the way to the final in Budapest, scene of their only European trophy in 1969.\n\nNot that they looked like continental champions here. Their league form, five defeats in six, means they are justifiably closer to the bottom three than the top five.\n\nThis was an afternoon of many shortcomings, but the Nick Woltemade midfield experiment is surely reaching expiry. He started as a No.8 for the fifth straight game but after half an hour was moved back to No.9, where he did not fare any better.\n\nLow on confidence and short of the physicality to compete in the Premier League, the German is a conundrum who needs time on the training ground. The football ground is proving an unforgiving environment of late.\n\nHe was substituted after 56 minutes and the numbers did not make for good reading. Of just 14 touches, none were in the penalty area. He also lost his three midfield duels, which prompted Howe’s first-half tactical change.\n\nIt was a deserved victory for Everton and the Magpies are now closer to the bottom three than the top five in the Premier League\n\nEddie Howe and Co look downcast after full time having lost another game at home\n\nJoelinton had started on the left wing to accommodate Woltemade in midfield and the Brazilian looked like a heavyweight in a ringside seat.\n\nHe wanted to be the other side of the ropes and, as Everton ran through Newcastle’s midfield at will, it was clear his team needed him there.\n\nWithin three minutes of the reshuffle that saw Gordon moved to left wing and Joelinton shifted to the canvas in the middle, Newcastle were level when Tonali fizzed into Ramsey and his shot deflected off Branthwaite and in.\n\nThe home celebrations had only just subsided when Dwight McNeil’s shot was fumbled by Pope and Beto pounced. Likewise, St James’ was still noisy in exultation of Murphy’s strike when Barry scored Everton’s winner.\n\nHowe looked sick on full-time. He’s been fighting the same symptoms for too long."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nAs a service to fans who have a general interest in WWE but might not have watched a match in months, we're happy to provide this FAQ as a guide to WWE Elimination Chamber from the United Center in Chicago on Saturday at 7 p.m. ET on ESPN Unlimited.\n\nHow do the Elimination Chamber matches work again?\n\nThe ring is surrounded by a giant steel structure, covering it from the floor up to a metal roof. One might call it a \"cell\" where \"hell\" might occur, but here's what separates Elimination Chamber from that other match: There is a glass booth stationed in each corner of the ring that will contain four eventual participants. Like on the Netflix dating show \"Love Is Blind,\" the glass containers are called \"pods.\" Unlike on \"Love Is Blind,\" no one is expecting to meet their soulmate outside of the pods -- only heartbreak.\n\nThere are six participants each in the men's and women's matches. Two wrestlers begin in the ring and four inside the pods. At intervals predetermined before the match, the pods open one at a time to introduce a new opponent into the fray. Combatants are eliminated through pinfall or submission. There are no disqualifications in the Elimination Chamber, as CM Punk learned when an \"eliminated\" Seth Rollins stomped his head to set up John Cena's win at last year's Chamber.\n\n(Yes, it's been a year since John Cena's shocking heel turn at Elimination Chamber. Where have you gone, Travis Scott?)\n\nThe winner of the Elimination Chamber gets a championship match at WrestleMania 42. After Roman Reigns won the Royal Rumble in January, he selected world heavyweight champion Punk as his Mania opponent. On Monday's episode of \"Raw,\" fellow Royal Rumble winner Liv Morgan selected WWE women's world champion Stephanie Vaquer. And by \"selected,\" we mean sucker-punched in the face with the mic in her hand. Which always sounds great, acoustically.\n\nThat means the winner of the men's Elimination Chamber match will wrestle for the Undisputed WWE Championship, currently held by Drew McIntyre, and the winner of the women's Elimination Chamber match will earn a shot at the WWE Women's Championship, currently held by Jade Cargill.\n\nWho's taking part in the women's Elimination Chamber match?\n\nTiffany Stratton beat Chelsea Green and Lash Legend to earn a spot in the women's Elimination Chamber. Photo by WWE\n\nFor both matches, WWE held triple-threat qualification matches on \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" to determine the participants in the Elimination Chamber. The six women vying for a title shot are:\n\n• Tiffany Stratton, who defeated Chelsea Green and Lash Legend on the Feb. 6 episode of \"SmackDown.\" Please recall that Cargill ended Stratton's title reign of over 300 days with a win on \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" in November 2025.\n\n• Rhea Ripley, who defeated Ivy Nile and Lyra Valkyria on \"Raw\" Feb. 9. Ripley hasn't held the WWE Women's Championship since 2021, though her one and only reign did last 379 days.\n\n• Alexa Bliss defeated women's United States Champion Giulia and Zelina on the Feb. 13 \"SmackDown\" to secure a spot in the match, pinning Zelina after a Sister Abigail in the middle of the ring. Bliss is a three-time Women's Championship holder.\n\n• Asuka defeated Bayley and Nattie on \"Raw\" three days later to earn her place in the Chamber. Did you know Asuka has never won a match at WrestleMania? Just throwing that out there.\n\n• Kiana James was a surprise entrant after pulling the upset on both Charlotte Flair and Nia Jax on the latest episode of \"SmackDown.\" James slid underneath while Flair was doing her bridge figure four thing and pinned Flair's shoulders for the win, which was pretty ingenious.\n\n• Raquel Rodriguez overcame Iyo Sky and Kairi Sane on Monday's \"Raw\" for the final spot. She's looking for her first WWE singles title. Rodriguez has been getting a push lately, and a power vs. power match against Cargill would be intriguing. But never underestimate when it could be \"Tiffy Time\" again.\n\nWho's taking part in the men's Elimination Chamber match?\n\nJe'Von Evans, left, was accompanied by rapper Offset during his men's Elimination Chamber qualifying match. Photo by WWE/WWE)\n\n• Originally, it was going to be Jey Uso, who defeated El Grande Americano -- the original version, not the new El Grande Americano (that's a different guy) - and Bronson Reed on Monday's \"Raw\", but Reed had to leave the match early after tearing his biceps. Would Reed have won this match and earned an Elimination Chamber spot? The fact they didn't have a graphic ready for Uso's victory might have been a tell. Also a tell: Uso was ruled out of the Elimination Chamber as quickly as he earned the spot, getting attacked backstage on \"SmackDown\" Friday night and ambulanced away.\n\nThat led to a match between Jacob Fatu and Logan Paul for the open pod that saw Paul enter the Elimination Chamber thanks to interference from McIntyre. The big news in the match, such as it was: a masked man attacked The Vision at ringside and was revealed to be ... some guy! He was later identified as Don Furio, a student at Seth Rollins's Black & Brave School. The same Seth Rollins who told ESPN's \"First Take\" this week that his injured shoulder means \"I will not be able to do anything this weekend\" at Elimination Chamber. Insert thinking emoji here ...\n\n• Randy Orton won a tough Feb. 6 \"SmackDown\" match against Aleister Black and Solo Sikoa with an RKO \"outta nowhere\" on Sikoa as he had the Samoan Spike loaded. Please note that Orton lost a match against Black on a later \"SmackDown\" after McIntyre hit him in the head with his belt. That brought out Cody Rhodes to chase away the champ. Speaking of which ...\n\n• Cody Rhodes defeated Jacob Fatu and Sami Zayn on the Feb. 13 \"SmackDown,\" in a match where McIntyre interfered and tried to keep Rhodes out of the Elimination Chamber match by handing Zayn the win. Alas, Rhodes recovered and pinned Sami instead.\n\n• Je'Von Evans defeated Gunther by pinning Intercontinental champ Dominik Mysterio on the Feb. 16 \"Raw,\" which is probably the least painful way to defeat Gunther. Expect many cage-related high spots from Evans on Saturday, one of the WWE's best aerial performers.\n\n• Trick Williams defeated Damian Priest and Carmelo Hayes last Friday on \"SmackDown,\" as he seeks his first WWE singles title after years of NXT dominance.\n\n• LA Knight won a match against Penta (scary guy in luchador mask) and Austin Theory (slightly less scary guy in black hoodie, now one of the only healthy members of The Vision) on \"Raw\" on Feb. 9.\n\nBeing that this match is for a WrestleMania main event and Rhodes is in the match, the expectation is that he'll earn the title shot. But don't underestimate Orton, who has beef with McIntyre. He's the nostalgia play -- Orton hasn't held a world singles championship since 2020.\n\nIf you think that drought is something, consider that Finn Bálor hasn't won a world title since the WWE Universal Championship in 2016. That could change at Elimination Chamber against CM Punk.\n\nWhy is Punk defending the world title against Bálor?\n\nplay 1:24 Previewing CM Punk vs. Finn Balor at Elimination Chamber Arda Ocal previews a huge match for the world heavyweight title between CM Punk and Finn Balor at Elimination Chamber in Chicago.\n\nIt's an Elimination Chamber in Chicago. It's illegal not to have \"Second City Saint\" CM Punk on the card.\n\nBut seriously, Bálor earned this rematch against Punk after nearly defeating \"the fighting champion\" at \"Raw\" in Belfast, Ireland, in January. Punk raised Bálor's hand after the match in acknowledgement of the effort.\n\nThings turned nasty after Bálor was \"snubbed\" from the 30-man Royal Rumble field, leading to him attacking Punk during a match with AJ Styles on \"Raw.\" Challenges were made. Bálor proclaimed that after Punk made him lose in his home country of Ireland, he would make Punk lose on his \"home turf.\" And a world championship match was made for Elimination Chamber.\n\nTwo things to keep in mind here. First, Punk has his WrestleMania match set against Roman Reigns. Second, one never knows when Bálor's highly combustible stable, The Judgment Day, could finally explode.\n\nPunk isn't the only one in his family with a championship match at Elimination Chamber. His wife, AJ Lee, is going for Intercontinental gold, too.\n\nThe long-awaited AJ Lee vs. Becky Lynch match has arrived\n\nplay 1:15 Arda Öcal previews WWE Women's IC title match Arda Öcal looks ahead to the WWE Women's Intercontinental championship match betweek Becky Lynch and AJ Lee at Elimination Chamber.\n\nThat it has. This feud began last September when Lee returned to the WWE for the first time in more than a decade to help her man in his battle against WWE power couple Seth Rollins and Lynch. In a mixed tag team match at WWE Wrestlepalooza last September, Lee forced Lynch to submit with the Black Widow.\n\nLater, Lee distracted Lynch in a title match against Maxxine Dupri on \"Raw\" at Madison Square Garden, costing Lynch the Intercontinental title and a record 163-day reign. Lynch fell into a full spiral that saw her, among other things, suggest the \"crooked\" WWE referees were out to get her. Lynch and Lee next met at Survivor Series: WarGames in late November, when Lee again made Becky tap with the Black Widow.\n\nAt this point, an exasperated Lynch was desperate for a way to finally be rid of Lee. Earlier this month, she challenged Lee to a match at Elimination Chamber. When Lee said she would only accept the match if Lynch put up the IC title, Lynch said \"No,\" which is a great way to get a WWE crowd to chant, \"Yes, yes, yes!\" Lynch finally relented and put the strap on the line to get her hands on her tormentor.\n\nOut of all the potential action on this card, the title match between an enraged Lynch and a trolling Lee could be the one with the most vitriolic satisfaction -- especially if Lee and Punk win title matches on the card.\n\nDid we mention this event is being held in Chicago? Just checking."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- In an NFL combine already filled with eye-catching speed and explosiveness in the drills, Arkansas quarterback Taylen Green had a record-setting day Saturday in Lucas Oil Stadium.\n\nGreen, who measured in at 6-foot-5⅞ inches tall and 227 pounds, ran a wide-receiver-worthy 40-yard dash in an official time of 4.36 seconds to go with a 43½-inch vertical jump and a broad jump of 11-2. All three are records for quarterbacks since at least 2003, according to ESPN Research.\n\nIndianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr., who was selected with the No. 4 pick in the 2023 draft, had the previous bests for a quarterback in the vertical and broad jumps in that span -- 40½ inches and 10-feet-9 inches respectively. Green's 40 time is now the first sub-4.4 clocking for quarterback since at least 2003.\n\nThe previous best 40 for a quarterback was a 4.41 by Robert Griffin III, coming off a Heisman Trophy season at Baylor, at the 2012 combine.\n\nGreen's performance comes in a year when the quarterback rankings, beyond the expected No. 1 pick of the draft in Indiana's Fernando Mendoza, are still in flux for many in the league. Green is the No. 8-rated quarterback in ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr.'s latest position rankings.\n\nGreen was a four-year starter in college -- two years at Boise State and two at Arkansas. This past season he threw for 2,714 yards with 19 touchdowns and 11 interceptions to go with 777 yards rushing as well as eight rushing touchdowns.\n\nHe had eight 300-yard passing games in his two seasons at Arkansas.\n\nSome scouts have said he will need to gain more consistently in his throwing motion, which is an extended delivery."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Now 30 years since the Dallas Cowboys' last Super Bowl appearance, owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he has let the fans down with his team's championship drought.\n\n\"I really can't accept just the thought of winning one Super Bowl and then what?\" Jones said Friday night from the NFL scouting combine. \"I've got more time on my clock than that in my mind. And so I don't see it that way. I see a chance to put a team together and basically be knocking at the edge and get another one or get a chance at a another one.\n\n\"It runs that way in my view. ... Make no mistake about it now, if you told me I could, because I've done a lot of hitchhiking in my life. ... I'd start here with you right now and hitchhike back to Dallas to win a Super Bowl.\"\n\nAfter a 7-9-1 finish in 2025, Jones promised change. One change will be the team's approach to free agency.\n\nThe Cowboys have not relied heavily on free agency in years, choosing to pick their spots to shore up holes on the roster with cost-effective players.\n\n\"I would bet that we will spend more money in free agency than we have,\" Jones said.\n\nTo do so, the Cowboys will first have to create salary cap room. Well over the $301.2 million cap that was set Friday, they will restructure the contracts of quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and left guard Tyler Smith, which will create $66 million of room.\n\nJones said the Cowboys will rework the contracts of defensive tackles Kenny Clark, Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa, who are scheduled to count around $63 million against the cap. With Clark and Williams, the Cowboys can look to add voidable years to their contracts then restructure that way.\n\n\"I want you to know that the only way to push more [out] is for me to go borrow some of my future, OK?\" Jones said. \"Expect me to go borrow some of my future.\"\n\nTo Jones, it goes beyond his personal Super Bowl wishes.\n\n\"I look at where we are with Dak and I look at where he is in his career. And I look at some of the pluses that we have on our front and what we think we can do there. And what we can do with [George] Pickens and Lamb and what we can do with our running back that we just signed [Javonte Williams],\" Jones said. \"And so all of those things I want to do everything we possibly can to stop somebody and to basically win some third downs more than we did last year. And so I think that would be the area that you would see me bust the budget. Where you would see me do that is what we're doing defensively.\n\n\"And I would expect anybody that's a Cowboy fan or a critic of the Cowboys to say, 'Duh, that's not hard to see, Jerry, to do.' But I guess what I'm doing is saying, yes, I intend to do that if given the opportunity.\"\n\nThe Cowboys defense finished at or near the bottom of the league in yards and points allowed in 2025. Christian Parker has been hired as the new defensive coordinator, and Jones acknowledged the need for more than just one or two new players, while also saying players that were on the defense in 2025 will be better in 2026 \"because the situation has changed.\"\n\nWith two first-round picks, the Cowboys have an opportunity to add more talent to their defense. Jones would not rule out the possibility of making trades, like the additions of Williams from the New York Jets and Clark from the Green Bay Packers for Micah Parsons.\n\n\"I don't know that I'd expect it but we have the ammunition to be good at it,\" Jones said. \"And I wouldn't hesitate to be good at it if it will help our team and help the timeline that we're talking about.\"\n\nNow 83, Jones was introspective at times during the hourlong meeting with reporters. His resolve to win a championship is strong.\n\n\"It's every bit the prize of anything I have, with the exception of family and your love for family,\" Jones said. \"I guess what I would say is make no mistake about it, I don't have a higher priority than to go and win a Super Bowl.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- After Denver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic tumbled to the Paycom Center court early in the fourth quarter Friday night, he determined that he needed to react to what he considered a dirty tactic by Oklahoma City Thunder guard Luguentz Dort.\n\nA chippy game between rivals who faced off in a seven-game series in last season's Western Conference semifinals escalated into a heated confrontation at that point, resulting in Dort's ejection and double technical fouls on Jokic and Oklahoma City center Jaylin Williams.\n\nThe fracas began when Dort appeared to trip Jokic as he ran up the court with 8:03 remaining in the fourth quarter. Dort backed into Jokic and stuck out his right foot, knocking down the big man, who quickly pounced to his feet to angrily confront Dort.\n\n\"It's an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction,\" Jokic said after the Nuggets' 127-121 overtime loss to the defending champions. \"There is no such thing -- I think there's not supposed to be those things on a basketball floor. So, it was just an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction by me.\"\n\nAfter Jokic chest-bumped Dort, Williams rushed over to intervene. Jokic and Williams exchanged shoves and grabbed each other's jerseys as a scrum of players, coaches, officials and staffers formed around them and eventually separated them.\n\n\"Just competing,\" Williams told ESPN. \"Two teams competing, that's it. That's all I got.\"\n\nAfter a review, the foul called against Dort was upgraded to a flagrant foul 2, resulting in an automatic ejection. Crew chief James Williams told a pool reporter that the officials \"deemed [Dort's] contact on Jokic to be unnecessary and excessive with a high potential for injury.\" Williams also cited the contact leading to an \"altercation that did not dissolve\" as a reason for upgrading it to a flagrant foul 2.\n\n\"I will say this: If [Williams] is running up the floor and gets tripped, we expect a flagrant 2 from this point forward,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \"That's all. If that's the precedent, if that becomes a malicious play and flagrant 2 is the line in the sand on that, we would expect that if it's [Williams]. We would expect that if it's anybody. And if that's the case, we're good.\"\n\nAsked if he believed the play was ruled a flagrant 2 because the foul was committed against a three-time MVP, Daigneault said: \"No, I'm not going to answer the question like that. I said what I needed to say about it.\"\n\nNuggets star Nikola Jokic confronts Thunder guard Luguentz Dort, who was called for a flagrant foul 2 after an apparent trip in the fourth quarter. Jokic and OKC's Jaylin Williams received technical fouls. Photo by Joshua Gateley/Getty Images\n\nThe referees determined that the actions of Jokic and Jaylin Williams during the altercation did not rise to the level of an ejection, James Williams said in the pool report.\n\nThe fracas overshadowed the return of reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had 36 points on 12-of-29 shooting and dished out nine assists in 34 minutes. Gilgeous-Alexander sat out the overtime period because he had reached his minutes limit after missing the previous nine games because of an abdominal strain suffered Feb. 3.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was called for a technical foul in the first quarter when he responded to Jokic's post-whistle contact by throwing the ball at him. James Williams told the pool reporter that Jokic was not called for a technical on that play because the officials determined that his contact with his left forearm did not rise to the level of an unsportsmanlike act.\n\n\"They're obviously a high-level team, we're a high-level team, and we've seen each other a lot in the past couple of years, so we might be a little bit more into the game just because we know the opponent,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"It was fun. It was good out there. End-of-season basketball is like that. It's that chippy, that physical, so it was good to get one of those in the regular season.\"\n\nThe Nuggets fell to 4-7 since Jokic returned from a monthlong absence, including 1-6 in clutch games (within five points in the final five minutes) during that span. Jokic recorded his league-leading 22nd triple-double with 23 points, 17 rebounds and 14 assists against the Thunder, but his uncharacteristic recent shooting struggles continued, as he went 9-of-25 from the floor and 2-of-10 from 3-point range.\n\nJokic, who was 3-of-5 from the free throw line, animatedly protested no-calls after several of his shots. There were also multiple instances of Jokic bumping and shoving with Thunder players during the game.\n\n\"I think his frustration is sometimes because the game's officiated differently out on the floor than it is near the basket, and I think he was reacting to what was being done to him,\" Nuggets coach David Adelman said. \"And his reaction's not going to be to cower away. He's competitive. ... I know why he's frustrated. I can feel his frustration with all the contact out there. He shot five free throws.\n\n\"It's just part of the game. The closer you get to the basket, it seems like for a bigger guy, it seems like it's called a little bit different, but he has to react to that the right way. Concentrate and finish through contact. And obviously with Dort's play, I think that took it to a different level for him. He felt like it was malicious, also.\"\n\nThe Nuggets and Thunder meet again March 9 in Oklahoma City."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nBOSTON -- The Celtics have been one of the NBA's hottest teams since returning from the All-Star break.\n\nThey can add one of the best offensive performances in league history to their list of accomplishments as they await a possible return of star Jayson Tatum to action.\n\nBoston shot a season-high 66.7% (52-of-78) from the field in their 148-111 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Friday. Including the playoffs, it was the club's third-highest percentage in a game in the shot clock era (since 1954-55), behind 67.9% in 1984 and 67.0% in 1990, according to ESPN Research.\n\nThe Celtics also shot 64.7% from the 3-point line Friday, which equated to an 80.8% effective field goal percentage -- the highest in the shot clock era. Effective field goal percentage measures shooting efficiency by adjusting for the fact that 3-pointers are worth more than two-point shots\n\nAll-Star Jaylen Brown led the way, finishing with 28 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. But he got plenty of support from his teammates, with trade deadline acquisition Nikola Vucevic adding 28 points and 11 rebounds for his third double-double as a member of the Celtics.\n\n\"I thought we just did a good job reading the game,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"I thought we made the right reads throughout most of the entire game. I thought tonight Vooch really looked comfortable in his offensive reads and his offensive screening. He unlocked a lot of stuff for us.\"\n\nAll 13 Celtics players scored, with Boston committing only three turnovers after halftime.\n\n\"We just try to read the game and take what's there,\" Brown said.\n\nBoston, winners of five of its six games since the All-Star break, will wait to see if Sunday night's home matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers will mark the return of Tatum.\n\nThe game, originally scheduled to be played earlier in the day, was moved by NBC into an 8 p.m. ET prime-time slot, creating speculation it could signal Tatum's plan to return.\n\nIt's been 41 weeks since Tatum ruptured his right Achilles tendon in May in the waning minutes of the Celtics' loss to the New York Knicks in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe Celtics are required by the NBA to release an initial injury report by 5 p.m. ET on Saturday ahead of Sunday's home game against the 76ers.\n\nAfter practicing with the Celtics' G League team two weeks ago, Tatum said he hadn't decided whether he would return.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that I'm coming back or I'm not, it's just following the plan. So it's just another step,\" Tatum said. \"I don't know percentage. I just know I feel a little bit better every day. I just try to focus on that.\"\n\nTatum said in the same interview that he is also mindful of not wanting to disrupt the progress of a Celtics team that at 39-20 sits in second place in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\n\"I'm just hyper aware of what's going on. I think it would just stem from that. Obviously, I know what I bring to the table and bring to the team. But I'm also aware that these guys have been playing extremely well,\" Tatum said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Former Miami offensive lineman Francis Mauigoa has heard the buzz about teammate Rueben Bain Jr.'s supposed short arm length here at the NFL combine.\n\nAnd as far as Mauigoa is concerned, he doesn't want to hear it. In fact, it is Miami's pair of defensive ends, Bain and Akheem Mesidor, who have helped Mauigoa develop into the force he's become, he said.\n\n\"Nobody comes close to what we got,\" Mauigoa said when asked about his toughest matchups last season. \"I mean, Rueben Bain and Akheem Mesidor, they gave me all the work. They built who I am right now.\"\n\nMauigoa, the projected first offensive lineman to be selected in the April draft, helped anchor a dominant Miami offensive line. But their unit was rivaled by their own team's defensive line, headlined by Bain and Mesidor.\n\nBain has been the subject of some debate at the combine because of his arm length, measured at 30⅞ inches. That's much shorter than teams prefer for the position, but it shouldn't be a factor in evaluating one of the most dominant players in the country in 2025, Mauigoa said.\n\n\"That don't matter,\" he said. \"I mean, if you look at the tape, it doesn't matter... Rueben Bain, he's got that mentality. He's got that heart to do whatever it takes.\"\n\nAs for the practice matchups between the Miami lines, Mauigoa borrowed an analogy from his head coach.\n\n\"Every day, we're going head-to-head,\" he said. \"Like coach [Mario] Cristobal said in one of his interviews, it's like Jurassic Park.\"\n\nAs for his own prospects, Mauigoa said he'd like to be the first lineman selected and believes his willingness to play any position will help in that endeavor.\n\nMauigoa is a candidate to play tackle or guard in the NFL, something he said teams have discussed with him during his combine interviews. He responded by explaining that he would embrace the idea and had requested his college offensive line coach give him practice reps at guard in preparation for the possibility.\n\n\"They all talked to me about how do I feel if I move to guard,\" he said. \"And it's the same thing. I mean, Coach [Alex] Mirabel can attest. I asked Coach Mirabal if I can get some reps at guard. I already know I'm going to play right tackle [at Miami], but for the next level, I mean, I'm not sure. If they want me at whatever position, I'm going to do it. And like I said, it's five positions. I'll make sure I take one of them.\""

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Convenor of DYMOG, Edward Seyram Tuttor.\n\nA coalition of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) has called on President John Mahama to declare a state of emergency over the escalating illegal mining crisis, insisting that the government’s anti-galamsey taskforce has failed to deliver results.\n\nThe protest, led by the FixTheCountry Movement and supported by groups such as the Dynamic Youth Movement of Ghana (DYMOG), took place on Friday, February 27, 2026, and coincided with the President’s State of the Nation Address to Parliament. The demonstrators, who later presented a petition at the Ministry of Interior in Accra, say the fight against galamsey has stalled despite earlier assurances.\n\nIn an interview with JoyNews, DYMOG convenor Edward Seyram Tuttor did not mince words. “Our demand is just one, that galamsey must stop now,” he said. “As we speak, NAIMOS has failed.”\n\nHe was referring to the National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS), the government’s anti-galamsey taskforce. According to him, when the President previously met with CSOs, NAIMOS had promised decisive action.\n\n“When the president met with CSOs, NAIMOS was clear that we’re going to smoke out galamsey’s campaign financiers and labourers,” he recalled. “But as we speak, looking at what happened at Hwediem in the Asutifi constituency alone, it tells us that whatever is in the bush, the military cannot handle it.”\n\nFor DYMOG, the situation has moved beyond routine enforcement.\n\n“So we need the President to trigger his emergency powers under Article 31,” Tuttor stressed. “Article 31 says that whenever anything that sustains life comes under threat and is harmful to life, the president must invoke the emergency powers.”\n\nHe argued that illegal mining poses a direct threat to water, food security and public health.\n\n“If galamsey fails, potable water is affected. If galamsey fails, the food that we eat, our staples, are under attack. If galamsey fails, the health implications are with the citizens,” he said.\n\nListing the potential consequences, he warned of “kidney failure, acute liver issues, brain damage, and even the attack on fetuses during pregnancy.”\n\n“All of that is an attack on the citizens,” he added. “So, for the welfare of the citizens, we are calling on the president to declare a state of emergency. Only he can declare, and he must do what the president of Ghana must do.”\n\nDYMOG also questioned the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) claims that it has deployed nano-ionic copper technology to cleanse polluted rivers.\n\n“The EPA is saying that they have a nano-ionic copper technology that can cleanse rivers,” Tuttor said. “From what we saw, it was not a river that they were actually piloting to cleanse. It was stagnant water.”\n\nHe dismissed the efficacy of the method against heavy metal contamination.\n\n“We all know from bioengineering that heavy metals like mercury, cyanide, arsenic and lead cannot be removed,” he argued. “The only thing it does is that it can help floating substances to subside, to make the water look clean, but it cannot.”\n\nIn a pointed remark directed at the EPA leadership, he added, “After that water has settled, she cannot drink it. And no medical practitioner will advise anybody to drink water that has been filtered through ionic aggregation.”\n\nThe DYMOG convenor further cited continued illegal mining activity across major water bodies as evidence that enforcement efforts have not succeeded.\n\n“Just yesterday, River Ankobra, we saw changfans over there. The Black Volta, changfans are on there. When you go to the River Bia, changfans are on there. Galamsey is still going on,” he said.\n\n“So the question is, where is NAIMOS? Where is that energy? Where is the reset?” he asked, referencing the government’s broader economic reform agenda.\n\n“If there’s a reset happening in the economy, but the reset is not affecting the fight against galamsey, then it means that the reset is not happening,” he argued.\n\nDYMOG also raised concerns about alleged complicity at the local government level.\n\n“It is a surprise that as we speak, the DCE for Amansie Central, who has been captured, that under his watch, money is being taken from galamseyers — 6,000 Ghana Cedis is being charged for changfan — that DCE is still at post,” Tuttor alleged.\n\n“Are we really serious about the fight against galamsey?” he asked. “Look, we are making a mockery of the fight against galamsey.”\n\nDYMOG has warned that if the President does not act decisively, the pressure will intensify.\n\n“If that is not done, we will keep protesting, and we will keep demanding that the right thing be done,” Tuttor declared.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Ghana's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has activated an emergency preparedness plan and begun a partial evacuation of its embassy in Tehran, as a joint US-Israeli military strike on Iran on Saturday triggered retaliatory missile attacks across the Gulf — putting Ghanaian nationals in Bahrain, Israel, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates directly in harm's way.\n\nIn an official press release issued on February 28, 2026, the Ministry said it was \"closely monitoring with serious concern the escalating hostilities in the Middle East\" and was already assessing whether full evacuations of Ghanaian nationals would be necessary.\n\n\"An emergency preparedness plan has been activated, and assessments are ongoing regarding the evacuation of Ghanaian nationals where necessary,\" the Ministry stated, adding that the Government had \"at this time initiated the evacuation of several staff of the Embassy of Ghana in Tehran, retaining essential personnel to coordinate assistance to Ghanaians in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\"\n\nThe Ministry urged all Ghanaian nationals across the affected countries to remain indoors, avoid large gatherings and sensitive locations, comply with directives from local authorities, keep travel documents accessible, and maintain contact with the nearest Ghanaian diplomatic mission.\n\nAll Ghanaians were also advised to avoid non-essential travel to and from the Middle East until further notice.\n\nOn February 28, the United States and Israel carried out a series of joint military strikes on Iran, with explosions reported in central Tehran.\n\nThe attacks followed the largest US military buildup in the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with two aircraft carriers — including the USS Gerald R. Ford — deployed to the region.\n\nIran's retaliation was swift and wide-ranging, targeting US military assets across the Gulf. The US Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the US Consulate in Dubai both issued shelter-in-place alerts for all staff, urging Americans in the UAE to take cover until further notice. Qatar, home to the US Central Command's regional headquarters at Al-Udeid Air Base, was among the hardest hit — and had already prompted Ghana's Doha Embassy to issue its own shelter-in-place advisory to Ghanaians earlier in the day.\n\nThis is not the first time Ghana has had to move fast to protect its citizens caught in the Iran-Israel conflict.\n\nWhen an earlier wave of hostilities escalated in June 2025, Ghana closed its Tehran embassy and successfully evacuated the first group of Ghanaian nationals to Turkey by June 20, 2025, following intense diplomatic engagements with both Iranian and Israeli ambassadors.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa personally coordinated that effort, covering Ghanaian diplomats, students, professionals, and other compatriots evacuated via land borders.\n\nGhanaians requiring emergency consular support may contact the Ministry on +233 240 913 284 or +233 240 793 072, or reach the Ghana Embassy in Israel on +972 54 931 6007.

            "content": "Ghana’s Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has intensified surveillance of industrial facilities across the country, introducing a real-time monitoring system aimed at cutting emissions and improving compliance with environmental standards.\n\nThe following mounting evidence suggests that air pollution remains one of Ghana’s most pressing public health threats. In 2019, the country’s annual average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 11 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s 2021 recommended guideline. Air pollution is now ranked as the second-highest health risk factor for death and disability in Ghana.\n\nAccording to Selina Amoah, Director of Air Quality at the EPA, industrial activities remain a major contributor to pollution levels.\n\n“Yes, the sources of air pollution in the country have been identified first from industrial activities,” she said in an interview. “Industrial activities making reference to both the formal and the informal industrial activities.”\n\nShe explained that emissions come from a wide range of operations: “If you take the cement industry, for instance, because it is gravel that they are grinding, the grinding of the gravel itself generates emissions.” She added that wood processing industries, boiler operations, generator sets, forklifts, spraying in metal fabrication and carpentry shops, and even small-scale food processors using firewood all release pollutants into the air.\n\nUnder Ghana’s updated Environmental Assessment Regulations, LI-2504, industries are required to obtain environmental permits and comply with strict conditions, including emissions monitoring.\n\n“As part of the permit conditions, they are required to conduct monitoring,” Amoah noted. “You may have the system in place. How do you know whether the system is working or is not working? It is only the data that can tell.”\n\nHowever, she acknowledged that previous monitoring systems had limitations. “The results that we get from industry is mostly passive,” she said. “Passive, I mean that by the time they bring the results to us, the pollution episode would have passed.”\n\nTo address this gap, the EPA has introduced the Ghana Online Continuous Emission Monitoring System (GOCEMS), which enables real-time tracking of emissions from industrial stacks.\n\n“This is a real-time monitoring from industrial operations,” Amoah explained. “And that gives the pollution levels as and when the activity is going on.”\n\nThe system allows regulators to detect spikes instantly and intervene quickly. “When you look at the results, and then you see the spikes, you can quickly check what is causing the pollution level,” she said, adding that timely mitigation measures can then be enforced.\n\nIndustry accounts for an estimated 11 per cent of air pollution in Accra, alongside emissions from road transport, open waste burning, biomass cooking, and energy generation. A World Bank report estimated that environmental degradation cost Ghana US$6.3 billion in 2017, about 11 per cent of GDP, with air pollution alone accounting for over US$2.4 billion.\n\nAlthough Ghana is one of only seven African countries with real-time air quality monitors, access to comprehensive data has remained limited. EPA officials believe GOCEMS marks a significant shift toward transparency, accountability, and proactive enforcement — a critical step in reducing industrial emissions and protecting public health.\n\nThis story was a collaboration with New Narratives.

            "content": "Findings from the PwC Africa Workforce Hopes and Fears Survey indicate that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will transform 49 per cent of jobs in Africa within three years.\n\nThe survey also reveals that whilst AI introduces uncertainty, 64% of African workers feel confident in their job security. 49,843 workers were surveyed in 48 countries across 28 sectors.\n\nIn the presentation of the key findings at the Mövenpick Hotel in Accra by Associate Director, Workforce Transformation, PwC Ghana, David Tsey, it was revealed that overall, AI use is strong. 64 % of African workers used AI at work in the past year, above the 54% global average. It also indicated that only 17% used AI daily.\n\nMr Tsey indicated that there is significant excitement and curiosity across Africa regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to him, many employees are optimistic about how AI will transform the workplace. He explained that there is “a lot of excitement, a lot of curiosity, and a lot of positive feeling” about the impact AI will have on work.\n\nMeanwhile, the CEO of the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission, George Smith-Graham, emphasised that Ghana has reached a stage where AI is being adopted to enhance productivity within the public service.\n\nHe noted that if productivity improvements are not achieved through AI, the country risks paying employees who are not working as effectively as expected.\n\nDr. Smith-Graham further stressed that salary increases should no longer be automatic but must be directly linked to measurable productivity.\n\nAccording to him, Ghana has moved beyond the point where employees can simply demand salary increments without demonstrating improved performance. Instead, compensation growth must now be tied to increased efficiency and output, supported by AI adoption.\n\nHe said, “But what I take for me is that we've gotten to a stage where we are not going to just allow employees coming and just asking for salary increases. But we need to make sure that the increases are linked to productivity”\n\nThe survey also reveals that whilst AI introduces uncertainty, 64% of African workers feel confident in their job security.\n\nThe Forum debated how employers can proactively manage employee fears by investing in reskilling and upskilling programmes that enable workforce transformation without denting trust.\n\nWorkforce Transformation Africa Leader at PwC South Africa, Dr Dayalan Govender, advised leaders to understand their organisation.\n\nHe said, “What makes your employees tick? Next thing is, you get those millennials, or you get this Gen Z coming to your business. You know what they like? They like flexibility in terms of how they work. It's more output-driven. But we want to see your output.\"\n\nA Partner, Consulting and Risk Services at PwC Ghana, Winfred King, said leaders must be prepared to lead the change.\n\nHe outlined how leaders can effectively integrate upskilling, technology-driven transformation and human-centred approaches to build sustainable performance and ensure well-being across Africa’s diverse workforce.\n\nThe PwC Africa Workforce Hopes and Fears Survey Forum brought together leading voices from industry, academia, government and policy to explore how Africa can rewire the future of work in ways that deliver sustainable performance and build lasting trust at a time when Artificial intelligence and rapid technological acceleration are rewiring workplaces across Africa.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "An associate professor at the Department of Physics of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Professor Bright Kwakye-Awuah is raising scientific and cost concerns over the Environmental Protection Authority’s (EPA) technology to clean water bodies polluted by illegal mining activities.\n\nThe EPA on February 24, 2026, commenced a pilot application of the Copper-based nano liquid technology on the Birim River in the Eastern region.\n\nAfter days of the clean-up trial, the EPA released images of what appears to be a visibly clear state of the diverted and stagnant pool of the Birim River.\n\nBut a section of the public and local scientists critiqued the technology, with some doubting the feasibility of the trial in fighting the illegal mining menace.\n\nProfessor Bright Kwakye-Awuah, in the underlisted concerns, analyses the scientific and economic underpinnings of the technology while proffering viable solutions to restoring the polluted water bodies.\n\nIn his submission, Prof. Kwakye-Awuah explained that the scientific validity of the technology for polluted rivers, highlighting that the technology exhibits established antimicrobial and catalytic characteristics when applied under controlled parameters to facilitate flocculation – aggregation of dispersed particles to form larger clusters - or induce oxidative destabilisation of suspended particles.\n\nHowever, he believes rivers polluted by galamsey are multifaceted, involving extreme turbidity from clay and silt, a spectrum of dissolved and particulate heavy metals (including mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, and manganese), potential cyanide residues, high suspended solids, and disrupted hydrodynamics.\n\nWith copper itself being a heavy metal, and introducing copper nanoparticles into an open river system, he says, raises significant concerns regarding secondary contamination, bioaccumulation in aquatic life, sediment enrichment with copper, and long-term ecological risks.\n\n“While rapid water clarification may be observed, visual improvements do not equate to compliance with regulatory standards for dissolved heavy metals. The dynamic nature of river systems means nanoparticles may disperse downstream, accumulate in sediments, or become resuspended during flooding events,” he added.\n\nPro. Kwakye-Awuah elaborated that any of such intervention would require robust validation, including ICP-MS analysis of residual metals, total copper quantification, sediment and ecotoxicity studies, before they can be deemed scientifically sound.\n\n“Without comprehensive chemical and ecological assessments, the approach may yield superficial results rather than true environmental remediation,” he noted.\n\nWith the EPA estimating that $200,000 is needed per kilometre of the river for cleaning, Prof. Kwakye-Awuah suggests the real means to stop the pollution is to fight off the illegal miners.\n\n“This assumes homogenous contamination, uniform effectiveness, and a one-off treatment capable of resolving pollution permanently. However, if illegal mining persists upstream, continuous or repeated applications would be necessary, causing total costs to escalate well beyond initial projections.\n\nHe continued that: “A thorough economic evaluation should consider treatment durability, reapplication frequency, long-term environmental liabilities, ongoing monitoring, and sediment management. Addressing symptoms in the river, rather than eliminating pollution at its source, risks creating a cycle of recurring public expenditure without sustainable outcomes. Cost justification must therefore be grounded in long-term effectiveness and risk of recurrence, not solely on immediate visual results”.\n\nHe recommended some possible technology-based solutions to clean the river, other than the experimental copper-based nano liquid technology.\n\n“Treating river segments with chemical nano-dosing primarily addresses downstream symptoms, whereas source-based interventions target pollution at entry points prior to dispersion,” he noted.\n\nProf Kwakye-Awuah asserts that treatment technologies must aim at physically removing suspended solids and adsorption of dissolved heavy metals without introducing additional toxicants.\n\n“Modular deployment at pollution nodes, coupled with water recycling for operational reuse, creates a closed-loop system that minimises river discharge,” he added.\n\nHe continued that: “When enforced alongside the cessation of in-stream mining and a polluter-pays model (requiring miners to fund water treatment) the economic burden shifts from the public to those responsible for contamination”.\n\nBy focusing on discharge points rather than the entire river, he says, the treated volumes decrease, capital and operational costs are more manageable, and long-term sustainability is enhanced.\n\n“Over time, source containment with engineered adsorption and flotation proves more structurally and economically viable than ongoing, river-wide chemical dosing, particularly when ongoing contamination is anticipated,” he noted.\n\nIn conclusion, Prof Kwakye-Awuah believes restoring the degraded water bodies or any other natural resource must not introduce harmful measures.\n\n“Environmental restoration must not introduce new environmental hazards. Rivers are dynamic, living ecosystems whose water chemistry and/or biochemistry are different from non-laboratory systems. The deployment of copper nanoparticles in natural water bodies, absent comprehensive ecotoxicological validation, poses potential long-term risks,” he noted.\n\nHe continued that: “Effective remediation begins at the source of contamination. By intercepting pollution from illegal mining, treating it with advanced adsorption and flotation systems, and responsibly reusing treated water, we can safeguard our rivers without imposing further chemical burdens. Ghana must prioritise science-based, economically sound, and ecologically responsible solutions to ensure the preservation of our rivers for future generations.”.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Their leader, Sergeant Adjetey, explained their mission, but the British officer insisted they leave the petition with him—an offer they rejected, insisting on seeing the governor in person.\n\n\n\nTensions escalated when the officer ordered one of his men to open fire. When the subordinate refused, the officer seized the rifle and shot into the unarmed crowd, killing Private Odartey Lamptey, Corporal Attipoe, and Sergeant Adjetey.\n\n\n\n“I narrowly escaped death. If the bullet had missed Sergeant Adjetey, I would have been the next victim,” he recalled.\n\nHe also shared the broader trauma endured by Ghanaian veterans men who fought for the British Empire abroad, only to return home to hardship, neglect, and broken promises.\n\n\n\nThe February 28 Shooting became a catalyst for widespread riots and political agitation, accelerating the push toward Ghana’s independence and cementing the ex-servicemen’s legacy in the nation’s history.\n\n\n\nWatch the video below\n\n\n\nDetails of February 28 shooting – WWII tells it all\n\n\n\n\n\nMRA/EB\n\n\n\nWatch NPP MPs in all-black as President Mahama delivers 2026 SONA"

            "content": "Bags of cement\n\nCement manufacturers in Ghana have hinted at potential price increases as congestion at the country’s ports continues to delay the unloading of clinker, a critical raw material for cement production.\n\nIndustry players say escalating demurrage costs, with vessels waiting up to 20 days to berth, may eventually be passed on to consumers if urgent action is not taken.\n\n\n\nBishop Dr George Dawson-Ahmoah, CEO of the Chamber of Cement Manufacturers Ghana, described the situation as “dire,” noting that the industry is financially “leaking” due to mounting demurrage charges.\n\n\n\nHe warned that prolonged vessel delays will drive up costs, with the likelihood of higher cement prices on the domestic market if the congestion continues.\n\n\n\nRepresentatives from cement companies and key industry stakeholders gathered to address operational bottlenecks that have left clinker shipments stranded at the ports for two to three weeks, creating significant financial strain.\n\n\n\nThe issue was discussed at an emergency meeting on Monday, February 23, 2026, convened by the Minister for Trade, Agribusiness and Industry, Elizabeth Ofosu-Adjare, in collaboration with the Minister for Transport, Joseph Bukari Nikpe.\n\nThe Transport Minister, in his address, assured stakeholders that the government is expediting dredging works to expand berth capacity and accommodate larger vessels.\n\n\n\n“Once the dredging is completed by the end of June, the port will handle vessels over 20,000 tonnes, compared to the current 8,000-tonne capacity, which will significantly reduce traffic and waiting times,” he said. Partial relief is expected within one to two weeks as works around Berth 14 are finalised.\n\n\n\nOfosu-Adjare, addressing the gathering, emphasised that port inefficiencies directly increase production costs, which can translate into higher cement prices.\n\n\n\n“If we want good prices, we must also perform our part of the bargain to ensure that production costs remain efficient,” she said.\n\n\n\nKofi Nsiah-Poku, President of the Association of Ghana Industries, praised the Ministers’ proactive approach but cautioned that until dredging and interim measures fully take effect, continued congestion could place pressure on cement costs for consumers."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "Spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei says Iran’s attacks on US targets across the region are legitimate defensive actions.\n\nIran is entitled to defend itself from Israeli and US attacks, the spokesman for Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stressed.\n\n“We have every right in accordance with international law, with the UN Charter, to defend ourselves with all might”, Esmaeil Baghaei said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Saturday.\n\nThe US and Israel launched a wave of attacks across multiple Iranian cities, including Tehran, on Saturday, in what US President Donald Trump described as “major combat operations”.\n\nAt least 201 people have been killed, according to Iranian media, citing the Red Crescent.\n\nIran responded by firing missiles towards Israel and US military targets in multiple countries, including Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBaghaei said the country’s armed forces “are defending national sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Iran against these barbaric acts of aggression”.\n\nThe US-Israeli attacks came after a third round of indirect negotiations on Iran’s nuclear programme between the US and Iran ended on Friday.\n\n“We were supposed to meet on Monday to talk about technical aspects of any possible deal on [the] nuclear issue,” Baghaei said. “And the Americans themselves acknowledged that these negotiations went quite well. The mediator, [the] foreign minister of Oman, qualified this round of negotiations as being of significant progress.”\n\nIt was the second time in less than a year that diplomacy had been scuttled by an attack on Iran, Baghaei noted. Iran and the US had engaged in several rounds of negotiations last year, when Israel launched a 12-day war on Iran in June, which the US briefly joined, despite Trump saying he was committed to a diplomatic resolution.\n\n\n\nBaghaei said the US “launching an act of aggression against another member of the United Nations” also threatened the international body, as its main pillar, “the UN Charter, is the provision of the use of force.”\n\n“So, I think what is at stake is not only the security and peace of the region and that of Iran, but also the whole fabric of international law. And the normative system that has been created by the United Nations Charter,” he added.\n\nFriends in the region\n\nBaghaei defended Iran’s retaliatory attacks in several countries across the region.\n\n“Under international law, any place, any location, any logistical support that are given to the aggressor [is a] legitimate target for the victim state,” he said. “So, we are not attacking any country in the region. We are friendly with all countries of the region. What we are doing is just taking defensive actions.”\n\n“We have proven that we trust our friends in the region,” Baghaei said. “That’s why we try to get together with the countries of the region in furtherance of this diplomatic process. The problem is that the United States is conducting this war of aggression at the cost of everyone, including the countries of the region.”"

And we will continue.”"

            "content": "Tehran, Iran – Iranians are being directly addressed by leaders inside and outside the country after the United States and Israel launched attacks across Iran, prompting Tehran to respond with a wave of ongoing missile and drone attacks across the region.\n\n“In light of the continued joint operations by the US and the Zionist regime against Tehran and several other major cities, if possible while remaining calm, please travel to other centres and cities where it is feasible for you to do so,” read a text message sent to the 10 million residents of Tehran by the government on Saturday afternoon.\n\nAll outbound roads from the capital were heavily congested with traffic from the morning, shortly after the US and Israel began joint strikes that targeting more than 20 of Iran’s 32 provinces.\n\nInside Tehran, people also formed long queues in front of petrol stations, even as government authorities emphasised that they remain in control, saying that food and fuel supplies would not be a problem and that contingency plans were in motion.\n\nAuthorities also accommodated civilians trying to exit the city, including by setting up roadside refuelling stations. Many families were headed to three provinces to the north near the Caspian Sea, as they did during the 12-day war with Israel.\n\nLast June, during the war, US President Donald Trump issued a direct warning telling all Tehran citizens to immediately evacuate.\n\nBut in a video message released shortly after the strikes began on Saturday, he urged the Iranian people to stay in their homes and wait for a suitable time to rise up and overthrow the theocratic establishment governing Iran since a 1979 Islamic revolution. He framed it as “probably your only chance for generations”.\n\n\n\nSimilar sentiments were echoed in separate video messages released by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the US-backed shah who was overthrown by clerics led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini during the revolution.\n\n“Be vigilant and prepared so that at an appropriate time, which I will inform you precisely, you return to the streets for the final effort,” Pahlavi said.\n\nThis was in reference to nationwide protests that gripped Iran in January, during which thousands of civilians were killed, many on the nights of January 8 and 9.\n\nIranian authorities claim that civilians were killed by “terrorists” and “rioters” armed, funded and trained by the US and Israel. But the United Nations and international human rights organisations have blamed state forces for an unprecedented crackdown against peaceful protesters, and say tens of thousands have been incarcerated and some face execution.\n\nStudent protests also took place last week in Tehran and major cities, including the holy Shia city of Mashhad to the northeast and Shiraz to the south of Iran. A number of students were suspended, while others were arrested or summoned by intelligence authorities.\n\nUniversities and schools were declared closed after the strikes on Saturday until further notice, according to a directive by the Supreme National Security Council. Most had already been moved online until the end of the Iranian calendar year on March 20 in response to the unrest at other universities.\n\nBut dozens of people, many of them children, were killed after two schools were hit in southern Iran’s Minab and in Tehran.\n\nState media showed paramilitary Basij members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) patrolling the streets of downtown Tehran on Saturday afternoon on motorcycles and vehicles and waving flags.\n\nA similar gathering was recorded in Palestine Square, where pro-state groups shouted “Death to America” and “Death to Israel”.\n\nIranians forced into another internet blackout\n\nThe opening salvo in Tehran targeted the Pasteur neighbourhood in the downtown area, where government offices are located.\n\nA satellite image and videos of the area showed that the compound housing the offices of the supreme leader was largely destroyed in the strikes. It was not immediately clear if Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was present at the time of the attack, but the foreign minister later told NBC News that Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian were alive “as far as I know”.\n\n\n\nMinutes after the start of the war, Iranian authorities began shutting down internet connections and mobile phone connections across multiple areas of Tehran. Some mobile connectivity was restored, but the internet shutdown was expanded across the country, with almost all traffic blocked and leaving only few proxy connections working to access the global internet.\n\nThe Islamic Republic had imposed an unprecedented 20-day total internet shutdown in January, and heavy state filtering was in place prior to the shutdown on Saturday.\n\nIranian authorities urged citizens on Saturday to only follow official state media, to report any suspicious activity, and to refrain from collaborating with “enemies” on pain of heavy punishment.\n\nAs daylight waned, Tehran’s streets emptied, but the sounds of explosions continued to ring loud."

The system went live publicly on Tuesday, February 24th, and on the first night dropped some 800,000 alerts about asteroids, supernovas, and feasting black holes. And that number is only expected to climb to the multiple millions per night.\n\nThe observatory released the first images taken with its car-sized Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) camera in June of last year. But researchers and stargazers have been eagerly anticipating the launch of this system. Every night, the camera captures about 1,000 images and then compares those against a reference image taken when the telescope first went online. Differences are automatically flagged, and an algorithm can distinguish between potential supernovas and approaching asteroids to send alerts to interested parties, all in just a matter of minutes. This means scientists can quickly turn their attention to fleeting celestial events.\n\nThankfully, the alerts aren’t all-or-nothing. They can be filtered by event type, brightness, or even the number of events within a given time period. That should help keep researchers from becoming overwhelmed by alerts as the Rubin Observatory ramps up the rate of discoveries."

            "content": "Here’s what we can tell you. If you’re thinking of picking up the Galaxy S26 Ultra at launch, putting in your preorder now isn’t a bad idea. It’s also a great time to pick up the midrange QuietComfort Headphones and what many of us at The Verge consider to be the game of 2024: Astro Bot. And who doesn’t want to save on a slick handheld vac?\n\nNow let’s get to it.\n\nIf you’re craving a little peace and quiet, Bose’s QuietComfort Headphones are currently on sale at Amazon in multiple colors for $199 ($150 off), which is the best price we’ve seen this year.\n\nThe standard QC Headphones are essentially a refresh of the last-gen QC45s with some new software tricks, including the ability to adjust noise cancellation levels and set custom listening modes. That being the case, you still get up to 24 hours of battery life, excellent comfort, and multipoint support, making it easy to switch between Bluetooth devices on the fly. They lack Bose’s immersive audio mode and the higher-quality Bluetooth found in the newer QC Ultras, though, as well as support for lossless audio over USB-C. Then again, that probably shouldn’t come as a surprise given they’re retailing for $250 less.\n\nAs we alluded to earlier, Samsung announced its Galaxy S26 lineup this week. There are already plenty of preorder deals to consider, but one of the best comes courtesy of Amazon, which is throwing in a $200 gift card alongside a free storage upgrade when you preorder the 512GB Galaxy S26 Ultra starting at $1,299.99. Other retailers are also running promos ahead of the phone’s March 11th release date, mind you, though they’re not as impressive; Best Buy is only providing a free storage upgrade, while Samsung is offering a mere $150 in credit.\n\nWhile the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus both feel like underwhelming, iterative updates, the 6.9-inch Galaxy S26 Ultra actually impressed our resident phone reviewer, Allison Johnson. That’s largely because of the new Privacy Display, which can help shield your screen from people sitting near you (if desired), and a more powerful camera array that should improve low-light performance. Plus, like the rest of the S26 lineup, the Ultra is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, which supports more advanced generative AI tools and a souped-up version of Gemini that can carry out certain tasks in third-party apps on your behalf. No one likes calling an Uber themselves, anyway.\n\nYou can still grab a physical copy of Astro Bot at Walmart for $32.99 ($27 off), an all-time low. The fantastic PlayStation 5 exclusive — which won Game of the Year at the 2024 Game Awards — has players take on the role of Astro, a lovable robot who sets off on a space adventure after his crew is lost in a sudden attack. Despite the prior game being a pack-in title for the PS5, Team Asobi’s full-sized sequel brims with inventive platforming, whimsical power-ups, and a kind of lighthearted fun that recalls the best of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon. Thankfully, it never feels outdated, even if ‘90s vibes are totally there.\n\nIf you’re looking for a relatively compact handheld vacuum that can reach into car crevices and suck up crumbs on your desk, Fanttik’s foldable Fold V10 Apex is still on sale at Amazon for $85.49 (about $65 off), matching its best price to date.\n\nFanttik’s 17,000Pa vac features an extendable nozzle that pivots up to 210 degrees, along with a built-in LED light to help illuminate the dark corners of your vehicle. An onboard display, meanwhile, indicates the remaining battery life and suction mode, as well as the status of the washable filter. It also comes with a range of useful add-ons, including an upholstery tool, two brush heads, and an extendable hose with a crevice tool for hard-to-reach areas. It even charges via USB-C, making it easy to juice after the battery runs out in about 30 minutes or so.\n\nMore ways to save this weekend\n\nsecond-gen AirTags for $99.99 ($24 off) at You can pick up fivefor $99.99 ($24 off) at Costco , though non-members will have to pay a $5 surcharge. That’s the first discount we’ve seen on Apple’s latest location tracker, which builds upon its predecessor with an upgraded ultra-wideband chip and extended range, allowing for more precise tracking from up to 50 percent farther away. It’s also better at locating items in multi-story homes, and the built-in speaker is up to 50 percent louder, making it easier to hear.

The 1440p display is a great entry-level OLED, with a sharp 16:9 panel and a speedy 240Hz refresh rate. As a QD-OLED monitor, it delivers the deep blacks and vibrant colors the technology is known for, along with G-Sync compatibility to help reduce screen tearing. It also includes a three-year warranty for added peace of mind.\n\nSharge Pixel 100 from You can snag thefrom Amazon (with Prime) and Sharge for $69.90 ($30 off) right now, which is its lowest price to date. The small, retro-inspired GaN charger delivers up to 140W of power, which is enough to charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50 percent in about 25 minutes. It also features three USB-C ports for powering multiple devices, along with a customizable dot-matrix display that shows the real-time wattage for each port."

On one end of the tracker you’ll find an integrated metal loop that can be attached to a keyring or clipped to a carabiner without the need for an extra case.\n\nThe Xiaomi Tag is compatible with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub tracking networks and mobile apps, but not at the same time. You’ll need to choose one or the other during setup. Like Apple’s AirTag, the Xiaomi Tag is powered by a replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery good for up to a year of use, and boasts an IP67 dust and water resistance rating, so it can survive a short dunking. There are also NFC capabilities that others can use to load your contact details should they find a lost device with the tag attached.\n\nAlthough it doesn’t have a clip, the Xiaomi Tag has a metal loop on one end so you can attach it to other things without needing a case.

You’ll instead have to rely on audible alerts to locate it once you’re nearby. If that’s not a deal-breaker, the Xiaomi Tag will be a cheaper alternative to Apple’s AirTags, selling for £12.99 (around $18) each, or £44.99 (around $61) for a four-pack.

            "content": "is a news editor with over a decade’s experience in journalism. He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nXiaomi and Leica’s long-running phone partnership just got a little closer. Alongside the new international release of its 17 Ultra flagship, Xiaomi has been entrusted with manufacturing a separate version that is the first Leica Leitzphone to release outside of Japan, following three Sharp-made models exclusive to the country.\n\nIn truth, the Leitzphone is a 17 Ultra with Leica branding and a rotatable camera ring, and apart from a few design tweaks, it’s mostly the same as the Leica Edition of that phone already available in China. But the branding is a big deal: Leica hasn’t let Xiaomi use its red dot logo on hardware until now, even though the companies have partnered on Xiaomi’s flagship cameras since 2022. The jump to a fully Leica-branded phone is a vote of confidence from the camera company.\n\nAfter two weeks using the Leitzphone version of the 17 Ultra, it’s clear that confidence was well placed. This is my favorite phone of 2026 so far, Leica logo or not, though most buyers would be better off saving money with the standard 17 Ultra.\n\nThe 17 Ultra and its original Leica Edition launched in China on December 25th, 2025. The international version and the Leitzphone were launched at Xiaomi’s pre-MWC press conference in Barcelona on February 28th, alongside the regular Xiaomi 17. The 17 Ultra starts from £1,299 / €1,499 (about $1,750) with 512GB storage, rising by £400 / €700 for the Leica version. That’s a hefty premium, but there are a few differences from the regular 17 Ultra.\n\nLet’s start with the Leica of it all. It’s obvious first and foremost in the design: an ever-so-slightly glossy black finish on the back, an industrial touch in the knurled aluminum-alloy edges, and Leica’s red dot logo in one corner. It’s a slightly different design to the 17 Ultra Leica Edition that released in China at the end of December, which has a two-tone finish and orients the Leica logo the other way. It also ships with branded accessories, including a faux leather case with a Leica lens cap, a microfiber cleaning cloth, and a bright red wrist strap.\n\nThe Leica logo isn’t just printed on; that lettering is raised metal. The textured edges make the phone more grippy, even without a case. My favorite accessory by far is this case, which preserves the red dot logo and adds a lens cap.\n\nOther changes run through the software. While both versions of the 17 Ultra run Xiaomi’s HyperOS 3, based on Android 16, the Leitzphone’s interface has been customized. There are dedicated Leica widgets, including photo galleries and a golden-hour timer, and custom monochrome app icons for the most popular apps from Xiaomi and third parties — which look great when you first turn the phone on, but less so once they’re mixed in with all the non-monochromatic apps you’ll inevitably download from elsewhere.\n\nLeica and Xiaomi’s design languages coexist in the camera app.\n\nMost of the customization is in the camera. There’s an expanded array of Leica filters, and the interface uses Leica fonts and red as its accent color, instead of Xiaomi’s usual yellow. A new Leica Essential shooting mode lets you pick between two camera simulations: a color re-creation of the M9 and a monochromatic take on the M3. The Leitzphone also adds the option to enable C2PA content credentials on every shot you take.\n\nNone of this is as novel as the Leitzphone’s unique hardware feature: a rotatable camera ring. The edge of the camera island can be twisted round, with a satisfying haptic buzz to emulate the feel of gears clicking. It makes for an excellent fidget spinner, though its real purpose is to control zoom in the camera app, or cycle through exposure settings or filters if you prefer.\n\nThe metal rim of the camera island is the part that twists round.\n\nThis sounds like a great idea, and it’s something I’ve wanted to see on more phones since spotting it on Nubia’s Focus 2 Ultra. In practice, it’s not that useful. The camera island may be enormous by phone standards, but it would be small on a real camera, and it’s too flush against the body to hold comfortably. I’ve had to force myself to use the camera ring to zoom, finding the onscreen controls quicker and more natural every time. Perhaps with persistence I could drill it in my muscle memory; for now, I mostly rotate it by accident and get annoyed when I do.\n\nThe addition of the zoom ring makes sense given the 17 Ultra’s headline photography feature: a telephoto with continuous optical zoom. While Xiaomi’s 15 Ultra featured two telephoto cameras, the 17 Ultra combines them into one. (The company skipped 16 to catch up with Apple.) A single 1/1.4-inch type 200-megapixel sensor is paired with a Leica APO zoom lens that covers 3.2-4.3x magnification — the equivalent of 75-100mm — adjusting the aperture from f/2.39-2.96 as it goes.\n\nThe obvious criticism is the same we levied at Sony’s Xperia 1 IV, which boasted continuous 3.5-5.2x zoom: This is too short a spread to make much difference. It’s rare that the framing of a photo changes drastically as you move through the range, and outside those limits you’re back to the same digital zoom and sensor cropping that every other phone offers.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 20 I took all of these photos using the 17 Ultra’s telephoto camera.\n\nPhotos are excellent. The large sensor delivers natural bokeh, along with macro support at a minimum distance of 30cm. It can handle challenging lighting conditions, with good results in dim light — though it did once struggle with the inverse, blowing out highlights on an especially bright day. Mostly I’ve shot exclusively on the Leica Authentic mode — the other option being Leica Vibrant — which I like for its filmic qualities, preserving more of the highlights and shadows than most phones and avoiding the flattened sheen of excessive HDR.\n\nThe other lenses are just as impressive, though I do find myself defaulting to the telephoto. The main camera has a large 1-inch-type sensor, and the same 50-megapixel resolution as the ultrawide and selfie camera. It’s one of the first phones to include a LOFIC (lateral overflow integration capacitor) sensor, which expands the dynamic range for highlights, helping me take some of the most dramatic skyline shots I’ve managed on a phone, and contributing to excellent performance in nighttime shots with bright lights.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14 These are a mix of photos from the other lenses.\n\nDespite the Leica logo, this isn’t just a camera. The Leitzphone has all of the flagship specs you’d expect: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, 16GB of RAM (in this economy?!) and 1TB of storage (with an option for 512GB on the regular 17 Ultra), a 6.9-inch 1-120Hz LTPO OLED display, and IP68 protection.\n\nThe battery is another standout feature. The 6,000mAh silicon-carbon cell isn’t the biggest around, and is smaller than the phone’s Chinese edition, but it’s still impressive. Even powering a demanding phone with a big display, I’ve usually been able to just about get two days of use from it between charges, though with very little left in the tank afterwards. 90W PPS wired charging and 50W wireless top it back up fast, though you’ll be limited to slow Qi speeds over third-party wireless chargers, and there’s no support for the magnetic Qi2 standard.\n\nThis is my favorite phone of the year so far.\n\nThe biggest problem the Leitzphone has is that it’s mostly a more expensive version of the 17 Ultra, which shares most of its best features. I prefer the look of the Leitzphone, and like a few of the Leica-specific shooting styles and the included case. But those aren’t worth £200, and the rotatable camera ring isn’t either. Unless that little red dot is very dear to your heart, there’s not quite enough reason to shell out extra for it — but mostly because the 17 Ultra is such a good phone in its own right.\n\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nAgree to Continue: Xiaomi 17 Ultra Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.

            "content": "is a news editor with over a decade’s experience in journalism. He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nXiaomi has just given a global launch to two of its latest flagship phones, the Xiaomi 17 and 17 Ultra, along with a Leica-branded Leitzphone edition of the Ultra. There’s no sign, however, of the 17 Pro, which launched in China with an additional display mounted next to the rear cameras.\n\nThe 17 and 17 Ultra will apparently be available soon in the UK, Europe, and select other markets. The 17 — pitched as a rival to the likes of the iPhone 17 and Samsung Galaxy S26 — will cost £899 / €999 (about $1,200), while the larger and more capable Ultra starts from £1,299 / €1,499 ($1,750). The limited-edition Leitzphone will be substantially more expensive at £1,699 / €1,999 ($2,300), though it includes 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, along with a few extra accessories.\n\nI like the simple, sleek aesthetic of the phone. The 6.3-inch display isn’t tiny, but it does make the phone small by modern standards. All three of the phone’s rear cameras are 50-megapixel.\n\nThe 17 is an extremely capable small-ish flagship, with a 6.3-inch OLED display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and large 6,330mAh silicon-carbon battery (though sadly smaller than the 7,000mAh version launched in China). I won’t be writing a full review of the 17, but did spend a week using it as my main phone, and found that the battery cruised past the full-day mark, though wasn’t quite enough for two full days of my typical usage. That’s far better battery life than you’d find in similarly sized phones from Apple, Samsung, or Google.\n\nThe cameras impress too, with 50-megapixel sensors behind each of the four lenses, selfie included. Pound for pound, you won’t find many better camera systems in any phone this size.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 10 I’ve been largely impressed by the Xiaomi 17’s cameras.\n\nThe Ultra, unsurprisingly, takes things to another level. It’s much larger, with a 6.9-inch display, and weighs a hefty 218g. Despite that, the 6,000mAh is actually smaller, though I found it delivered pretty similar longevity.\n\nThe 17 Ultra is larger in just about every respect, but strangely has a smaller battery.\n\nThe enormous camera is, as ever for Xiaomi’s Ultra phones, the highlight. There are 50-megapixel sensors for each of the main, ultrawide, and selfie cameras, with a large 1-inch-type sensor behind the primary lens. The periscope telephoto is even more impressive: 200-megapixel resolution, a large 1/1.4-inch sensor, and continuous optical zoom from 3.2x to 4.3x, the equivalent of 75-100mm. Xiaomi isn’t the first to pull off a true zoom phone — Sony’s Xperia 1 IV got there first in 2022 — but the telephoto camera here is far more capable than that phone’s, with natural bokeh and impressive performance even in low light.\n\nThis is the Leica-branded Leitzphone version of the 17 Ultra.\n\nThe camera capabilities are supported by Xiaomi’s ongoing photography partner Leica, but it’s the pair’s Leitzphone that really emphasizes that. Slightly redesigned from the 17 Ultra Leica Edition that was released in China last December, this includes Leica branding across the hardware and software, a range of Leica filters and shooting styles, and a rotatable rear camera ring that can be used to control the zoom. It’s the first Leica Leitzphone produced by Xiaomi — after a trio of Japan-only Sharp models — and comes with additional branded accessories, including a case with a lens cap and a microfiber cleaning cloth.\n\nXiaomi has plenty of other announcements alongside the 17 series phones at MWC this year, including a super-slim magnetic power bank, the Pad 8 and Pad 8 Pro tablets, and a smart tag that supports both Google and Apple’s tech-tracking networks.\n\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge"

            "content": "I never knew how easy it was to die in an orgy. But that’s just one of the many threats facing Geralt of Rivia in his latest adventure. The studio behind the Reigns series of Tinder-like choose-your-own-adventure games has now adapted The Witcher, following a handful of original titles and a take on Game of Thrones. And for Francois Alliot, creative director at Reigns studio Nerial, the series’ structure actually makes it an ideal way to ease players into sprawling fantasies like this. “There’s something about the way you can bring really complex universes, lore, and storylines to simple actions,” he says. “It can work in a lot of contexts.”\n\nWhat makes Reigns so approachable is the way it distills every action into a binary choice. As you play, you’re presented with cards, and you progress by either swiping right or left. In the case of The Witcher, for instance, an elf might ask Geralt for protection, and your options are simply to say either yes or no and then deal with the consequences. Each run through the game involves making a number of these decisions to progress a storyline until, well, you die.\n\nThe idea was for Reigns: The Witcher to work on two levels. For existing fans, it’s a fun way to play around and experiment in the world. “It’s not a new Witcher,” Alliot notes. “It’s a meta game around this universe, a bit like a fanfiction simulator.” But for those who might be intimidated by the franchise, which spans multiple books, games, and TV shows, it’s also a good place to start. “It works nicely as an entry point because you can really get a feel for the tone and rules, or lack of rules, of the world,” says narrative designer Oscar Harrington-Shaw. “But you’re not having to commit to a complex RPG.”\n\nThere are several aspects of the Reigns formula that had to be tweaked to work with The Witcher. One of the key conceits in the games is that you can die; in the original Reigns you played as a king, and when that was over you picked up as their successor. But that doesn’t really work when you’re playing a character like Geralt who can’t die. So you aren’t actually playing as Geralt; instead, you’re his bard pal Dandelion, singing tales of Geralt’s exploits that may or may not be true. This allowed the team at Nerial to “free ourselves from the lore,” as Alliot describes it, and have fun with things. This is especially apparent in the deaths, which come in the form of the aforementioned orgies or even from Geralt drinking himself to an early grave.\n\n“It really helped in two ways,” Harrington-Shaw says of coming up with the Dandelion idea, which came about from discussions with Witcher studio CD Projekt Red. “One is that it helps explain the loop; it gives a really neat end point. And we can have loads of fun deaths because it’s just a satisfying ending to a song. But we think it adds a really fun tension because you are playing as Geralt and you’re trying to survive, but you’re also trying to write good content.”\n\nImage: Devolver Digital\n\nAs I played, this setup made me much more open to experimenting. Instead of trying to roleplay as Geralt, I would often make odd choices just to see what happened. This, in turn, helps open up new storylines, giving some payoff for making the seemingly wrong decision. Even an early death can lead somewhere interesting in future runs.\n\nThe other notable addition in Reigns: The Witcher is a combat system. It wouldn’t be The Witcher if Geralt wasn’t slaying some monsters, but the idea of battles also had the potential to complicate the streamlined Reigns structure. The team settled on a sort of rhythm game, where you’re moving Geralt side to side on a board to attack or avoid monsters. What makes this system work within the confines of Reigns is that you’re still using the same commands; whether you’re making a pivotal decision or staring down a striga, everything comes down to swiping either right or left.\n\nDespite those changes, Harrington-Shaw says that The Witcher universe is an almost ideal fit for Reigns thanks to its dark sense of humor and frequently bleak world full of opposing factions. More important, though, is the main witcher himself. “Geralt is always facing these tricky binary choices,” he says. “The world of The Witcher is full of murky, gray morality, and that seemed perfect to translate.”\n\nReigns: The Witcher is out now on PC and mobile."

Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nHi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 117, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, please send Android tips, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)\n\nI also have for you the first big phone launch of the year, a new-old weather app, a way to maybe make your YouTube a little cheaper, a bunch of stuff to watch this weekend, and much more.

And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, forward it to them and tell them to subscribe here.)\n\nThe Drop\n\nScreen share\n\nMeredith Haggerty is one of those people you meet and you’re immediately like, Oh, you’re much cooler than I am. The more I get to know Meredith, a new(ish) editor here at The Verge, the more I realize how correct my first assumption was. Meredith has written about fashion and culture and brands and TV shows and also recently made a Pride and Prejudice joke that made me laugh so hard I spilled coffee all over my keyboard. Technically, Meredith owes me a keyboard.\n\nI asked Meredith to share her homescreen with us, both because I think it’s a fun way to get to know new people here and because I want her to tell me about cool things but I don’t want to just constantly badger her for TV recs. Here’s her homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why:\n\nThe phone: An iPhone 17. Until very recently, I was clinging to an iPhone 12 mini that I’d gotten as a hand-me-down corporate gift from a friend; it was so tiny and good and I had the perfect phone case. (Ben Affleck smoking a cigarette in a mask. A conversation starter!) But the battery became glacial, even after a couple of trips to the Genius Bar, and I had to give it up.\n\nThe wallpaper: A screenshot of Roku City, fall edition. I find Roku City very calming, so I decided to keep it with me.\n\nThe apps: Spotify, Messages, Mail, Chrome.\n\nI’m especially dependent on Notes, and here you can see my three main categories of Note: things I need to do, things I need to buy, thoughts I probably would have tweeted a few years ago. I love that the MTA app will tell me when I should leave for the train, but I almost never check it before I leave my house. For the weather, I actually rely on the New York Metro Weather Instagram account; my boyfriend hates it when I tell him what number the vibes are.\n\nTo be clear, this attempt to simplify my homescreen hasn’t alleviated my time-wasting at all. Beyond this page, I have a loopy number of apps, mostly put into folders to keep me away from them, which doesn’t work. I’m still always scrolling to the last page, to the last folder, to the last page of that last folder, so I can play a mobile game I don’t enjoy called Drop the Cat. There’s maybe nothing worse in my life than the hold that mobile games I don’t enjoy have on me. I’m not even a cat person.\n\nI also asked Meredith to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she sent back:\n\nLove Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette . I’m appropriately ashamed of watching this show (I’m sorry, Schlossberg family!), but it’s a fantastic combination of cool and dumb. One second it makes smoking a cigarette in 1994 while wearing Calvin Klein look like the apex of human existence; the next, Fake JFK Jr. is pointing to an actor in a thick white wig, saying, “Have you met my uncle Teddy?” We shouldn’t even talk about the scene where Jackie O dances to Camelot.

It parses the deluge of recommendations from TikTok or Instagram, if you happen to be on the “wealthy children pose with food” side of those apps. You screenshot the clip, send it to Rodeo, and it grabs the relevant information and can save it in fairly handy lists.\n\nThe library. This might be stolen valor from the Meredith who had not yet downloaded Drop the Cat, but a little over a year ago I moved closer to the library and have really been cashing in on how free those books are. Plus, the Brooklyn Public Library app is so good, letting me put things on hold whenever I happen to think of them. I’m currently reading Louise Erdrich’s The Sentence , which I am probably incorrectly not as into as her The Mighty Red , and we don’t have to talk about how many times I’ve renewed it because I’ve been playing phone games instead.\n\nNirvanna the Band the Show the Movie . I’d never watched Viceland’s Nirvanna the Band the Show before I went to see the movie, and you currently cannot do so legally, so probably I still haven’t. I didn’t need it to enjoy the movie, though, which is hilarious and sweet and made me go “How did they do that???” so many times.\n\nCrowdsourced\n\nHere’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads and this post on Bluesky.\n\n“Marathon (a new extraction shooter game by Bungie) is having an open play-test / demo this weekend so that’s what I’ll be into for the next few days.” – Janego\n\n“Really enjoying Agnes Aubert’s Mystical Cat Shelter by Heather Fawcett (author of the delightful Emily Wilde series). Feels like a cross between Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell and Howl’s Moving Castle.” — Spencer\n\n“Since 1Password have upped their price I’ve spent a few hours moving over to Apple Passwords and Uplock. Was mostly okay, but it’s a shame you can’t transfer over all your passkeys to Apple Passwords. Uplock having a lifetime purchase is a big plus.” — Matthew\n\n“Been watching Demon Slayer this past month, and FINALLY watched the Infinity Castle movie in a theater, and, it’s so clear how these anime movies are wildly different (and spectacular!) in tone, direction and characterization from our current crop of Hollywood blockbusters.” — Anshuman\n\n“I just yesterday switched my family from my grandfathered free Google Apps plan for our custom domain email to Fastmail. Fastmail is private but supports industry standard IMAP and CalDAV protocols, so we can use the built-in mail apps on our phones and computers.” — Mike\n\n“I’ve been listening to Comedy Bang Bang! Still super funny. Big Paul F. Tompkins fan.” — Mo\n\n“Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown. Despite the occasionally brutal RNG, it’s so fun to be able to dive into my favourite Trek stories and tweak the outcomes.” — Jono\n\n“Reading the first book in the On the Calculation of Volume series. It’s a time loop story, like Groundhog Day but way more realistic and sorta sad but it’s great so far!” — Colin\n\n“The news of the YouTube app coming to the Apple Vision Pro made me re-watch the only good use of 360 video I’ve seen: ‘How TV screens made watching movies worse,’ a fully 3D-animated, 20-minute video essay about how the home releases of movies differ from their theatrical cuts and why that matters, and how the physical size of TV screens makes an impact on content. If you have a Vision Pro it’s worth pulling out just for this video. After that, watch everything else that YouTuber (Noodle) has made.” — Nathan\n\nSigning off\n\nThis winter has been a disaster, where I live and many other places. So much snow, so many snow days, so much chaos. First of all, I hope you’ve all stayed safe and warm and well! Second of all, there is one bit of good news in all this: Casey Neistat is out in New York City vlogging again. All these years later, nobody YouTubes quite like Casey YouTubes. Between this and the return of Paul Ford’s blog, it almost feels like the good internet is coming back. Here’s hoping.\n\nSee you next week!"

Now reporting in Bloomberg offers more details about why Netflix executives backed down from a bidding war that it seemed to win back in December.\n\nFor one thing, the streaming giant’s shareholders appeared deeply skeptical that the acquisition was a good deal — Netflix’s share price declined 30% since announcing the deal, while the subsequent news that it was backing down sent Netflix stock up nearly 14%.\n\nFor another, Netflix’s commitment to the deal reportedly wavered after Paramount came in with an increased offer and seemed willing to go several more rounds in a bidding war.\n\nBy the time Sarandos met with Trump administration officials on Thursday, he may already have decided to concede. In fact, since President Donald Trump had previously warned him not to overpay, Sarandos reportedly told him, “I took your advice.”\n\nMeanwhile, employees at Warner Bros. now worry about major studio layoffs and conservative political pressure on CNN."

            "content": "The streaming and entertainment industry just witnessed one of its most high-stakes megadeals ever, stunning industry observers. Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to disrupt Hollywood and the media business as we know it.\n\nAfter years of Warner Bros. Discovery struggling under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by declining cable viewership and fierce competition from streaming platforms, the company has been considering major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.\n\nSeveral major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant and in December, Netflix announced it would acquire WBD’s studios and streaming for $82.7 billion.\n\nBut in a surprise eleventh-hour move this month, it now looks like the David Ellison-run Paramount will actually be the winner of this bidding war, offering $111 billion to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery’s assets, including its studios, HBO, streaming platforms, games, and TV networks such as CNN and HGTV. Paramount was itself recently acquired by Ellison with significant support from his father, the Oracle chairman, world’s sixth-richest person, and major Trump donor Larry Ellison.\n\nParamount’s offer still awaits formal approval from WBD’s board of directors, and any potential agreement may also face pressure from regulators.\n\nLet’s break down exactly what is happening, what’s at stake, and what could come next.\n\nWhat has happened so far?\n\n​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) revealed it was exploring a potential sale after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.\n\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026: The tech ecosystem, all in one room Your next round.

San Francisco, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\n​The bidding process quickly became competitive, and Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with Paramount initially viewed as the frontrunner.\n\nHowever, WBD’s board eventually determined that an offer from the streaming giant Netflix was the most attractive. Netflix offered $82.7 billion for just Warner’s film, television, and streaming assets.\n\nThus began the bidding war. Paramount believed its bid, of approximately $108 billion for all of Warner’s assets, was superior to Netflix’s offer that focused on just the studios and streaming. To sweeten its deal, Netflix amended its agreement in January to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per share of Warner Bros. Discovery, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed.\n\n​Paramount persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD. Still, the Warner board repeatedly rejected its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal, including concern over the suite of investors bankrolling Paramount’s bid, which includes Saudi, Qatari, and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take at the time.\n\nIn January, Paramount filed a lawsuit seeking more information about the Netflix deal. A month later, the company sought to sweeten its deal by announcing it would offer a $0.25 per share “ticking fee” to WBD shareholders for each quarter the deal fails to close by December 31, 2026. It also said it would pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee if Warner backs out of its deal with Netflix.\n\nThen, in a final attempt to secure a deal, Paramount increased its offer to $31 per share in February. This prompted the WBD board to prolong discussions with Paramount regarding a potential agreement, considering it as a superior offer. Netflix declined to increase its bid and withdrew from the negotiations.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement on Feb. 26. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nIn addition to the billions Paramount already holds in debt, the company is also set to assume the approximately $33 billion in debt Warner Bros. Discovery holds under the agreement. The deal will be backed by a $54 billion debt commitment from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, and Apollo Global Management, as well as $45.7 billion in equity from Larry Ellison.\n\nRegulatory hurdles and other concerns\n\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch\n\nIn addition to the assumption of substantial debt posing a significant financial burden, Paramount faces several other hurdles in its deal with WBD that could impact the success of the transaction.\n\nFor one, Ellison has warned about significant job reductions that are expected in the near future. There have already been widespread concerns among critics about potential job losses and lower wages.\n\nEllison is also a controversial figure in the industry, and his ownership of CBS News has been seen as sympathetic and supportive of the administration of Donald Trump, of whom his father, Larry Ellison, is a major donor. Under Ellison’s ownership of Paramount, reporting critical of the administration has been shelved or received increased scrutiny from Ellison or his appointed head of CBS News, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss.\n\nThis has led to some concern among employees at Warner-owned CNN. Trump has personally sought concessions from news divisions critical of him, including a $16 million settlement from CBS, before his FCC would approve the Ellison takeover of Paramount. Before Netflix bowed out of the deal, Trump pressured the company to fire the former Biden White House official Susan Rice from its board. He has publicly stated his intentions to bring CNN to heel under new owners.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny is another hurdle. Such a large-scale merger has attracted attention from lawmakers.\n\nFor instance, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement on February 26 that “these two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny — the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review.”\n\nA day before Netflix backed out, it was revealed that a coalition of 11 state attorneys general urged the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to review the merger under concerns it will stifle competition and increase subscription prices. This comes months after U.S. senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal voiced their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large.

            "content": "It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.\n\nBelow, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.\n\nMicrosoft’s 2019 investment in OpenAI\n\nThis is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash.\n\nIt was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.\n\nThe partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. Last year, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. Microsoft has also begun exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.\n\nOpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs.\n\nThe rise of Oracle\n\nOn June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company’s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle a spot alongside Google as one of OpenAI’s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company’s stock went shooting up.\n\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026: The tech ecosystem, all in one room Your next round. Your next hire. Your next breakout opportunity.

San Francisco, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nA few months later, it happened again. On September 10, Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle’s stock climbed even higher, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith.\n\nBut before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with.\n\nNvidia’s investment spree\n\nAs AI labs scramble to build infrastructure, they’re mostly buying GPUs from one company: Nvidia. That trade has made Nvidia flush with cash — and it’s been investing that cash back into the industry in increasingly unconventional ways. In September 2025, Nvidia bought a 4% stake in rival Intel for $5 billion — but even more surprising has been the deals with its own customers. One week after the Intel deal was revealed, the company announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, paid for with GPUs that would be used in OpenAI’s ongoing data center projects. Nvidia has since announced a similar deal with Elon Musk’s xAI, and OpenAI launched a separate GPU-for-stock arrangement with AMD.\n\nIf that seems circular, it’s because it is. Nvidia’s GPUs are valuable because they’re so scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way. You could say the same thing about OpenAI’s privately held stock, which is all the more valuable because it can’t be obtained through public markets. For now, OpenAI and Nvidia are riding high and nobody seems too worried — but if the momentum starts to flag, this sort of arrangement will get a lot more scrutiny.\n\nBuilding tomorrow’s hyperscale data centers\n\nFor companies like Meta that already have significant legacy infrastructure, the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that the company plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028.\n\nIn the first half of 2025, the company spent $30 billion more than the previous year, driven largely by the company’s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent $10 billion deal with Google Cloud, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers.\n\nA new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, dubbed Hyperion, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas.\n\nThat kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk’s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that experts say violate the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe Stargate moonshot\n\nJust two days after his second inauguration last January, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history.” OpenAI’s Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.”\n\nIn broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman’s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.\n\nAs the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. In August, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of eight data centers in Abilene, Texas, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.\n\nThe capex crunch\n\n“Capital expenditures” are usually a pretty dry metric, referring to a company’s spending on physical assets. But as tech companies lined up to report their capex plans for 2026, the rush of data center spending made the figures a lot more interesting — and a lot bigger.\n\nAmazon was the capex leader, projecting $200 billion in 2026 spending (up from $131 billion in 2025), while Google was a close second with an estimate between $175 billion and $185 billion (up from $91 billion in 2025). Meta estimated $115 billion to $135 billion (up from $71 billion the previous year), although that figure is a little deceptive because a lot of the data center projects have been kept off their books entirely. All told, hyperscalers are planning to spend nearly $700 billion on data center projects in 2026 alone.\n\nIt was enough money to spook some investors. The companies were mostly undeterred, however, explaining that AI infrastructure was vital to their companies’ future. It’s set up a strange dynamic. As you might expect, tech executives are more bullish on AI than their Wall Street counterparts — and the more tech companies spend, the more nervous their bankers get. Add in the huge amounts of debt many companies are taking on to fund those buildouts, and you start to hear CFOs across the valley grinding their teeth.\n\nThat hasn’t put a damper on AI spending yet, but it will soon — unless of course, hyperscalers show they can make those investments pay off.\n\nThis article was first published on September 22."

            "content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced late on Friday that his company has reached an agreement allowing the Department of Defense to use its AI models in the department’s classified network.\n\nThis follows a high-profile standoff between the DoD — also known under the Trump administration as the Department of War — and OpenAI’s rival Anthropic. The Pentagon pushed AI companies, including Anthropic, to allow their models to be used for “all lawful purposes,” while Anthropic sought to draw a red line around mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons.\n\nIn a lengthy statement released Thursday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said the company “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner,” but he argued that “in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.”\n\nMore than 60 OpenAI employees and 300 Google employees signed an open letter this week asking their employers to support Anthropic’s position.\n\nAfter Anthropic and the Pentagon failed to reach an agreement, President Donald Trump criticized the “Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic” in a social media post that also directed federal agencies to stop using the company’s products after a six-month phase-out period.\n\nIn a separate post, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth claimed Anthropic was trying to “seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military.” Hegseth also said he is designating Anthropic as a supply-chain risk: “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\n\nOn Friday, Anthropic said it had “not yet received direct communication from the Department of War or the White House on the status of our negotiations,” but insisted it would “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.”\n\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026: The tech ecosystem, all in one room Your next round.

            "content": "China’s humanoid robots grabbed global attention with kung fu flips at the nation’s televised Spring Festival Gala, while Chinese phone maker Honor is set to unveil its first humanoid robot at MWC in Spain.\n\nRobotics was flagged as a priority under the country’s “Made in China 2025” plan, albeit originally focused on factory automation, rather than humanoids. Now, rapid advances in multimodal AI are accelerating so-called embodied AI — autonomous machines operating in the real world — a push officials say could help offset labor shortages and drive productivity gains.\n\nAt this early stage of humanoid robot development, Chinese companies are outpacing their U.S. rivals in both speed and volume, Selina Xu, a China and AI policy lead at the office of Eric Schmidt said.\n\n“China has a more robust hardware supply chain — much of it built up through the EV sector, from sensors to batteries — and the world’s strongest manufacturing base, allowing companies to iterate far faster than Western competitors,” Xu told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result, not only are Chinese robots cheaper but companies can also release new models more quickly, Xu noted, adding that leading Chinese player Unitree shipped roughly 36 times more units last year than U.S. rivals Figure and Tesla.\n\nGlobal humanoid robot shipments totaled just 13,317 units last year, according to a Forbes report released last month. That is a tiny base for an industry expected to nearly double annually and reach 2.6 million units by 2035. (Still, the figures should be viewed with caution. The report notes it remains unclear how many units represent commercial sales versus demo models or pilot deployments, underscoring the early-stage nature of the industry.)\n\nThe top humanoid robot makers by 2025 shipments were led by China’s Agibot and Unitree, followed by UBTech, Leju Robotics, Engine AI, and Fourier Intelligence, underscoring Beijing’s early dominance in the sector.\n\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026: The tech ecosystem, all in one room Your next round.

San Francisco, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe biggest shift recently has been from “demo-driven excitement” to “operations-driven adoption,” Yuli Zhao, chief strategy officer at Galbot, told TechCrunch. Galbot’s humanoid robot, the G1, appeared at this year’s Spring Festival Gala, China’s annual, state-run lunar New Year’s Eve television show, alongside robots from Unitree Robotics, Noetix, and MagicLab.\n\n“More customers are asking: Can the robot run stably in real environments and actually take work off people’s plates? That practical pull is strengthened in China because policy and industrial strategy encourage automation upgrades, and the manufacturing ecosystem makes iteration extremely fast,” Zhao said.\n\nWhile increased funding toward humanoid startups “has definitely accelerated” the pace of progress, “the most durable adoption comes when you can show reliable and repeatable value in production or service operations, not just a one-off showcase,” Zhao added.\n\nStill, investing helps and Chinese robotics makers are securing it. Last year Unitree was valued at around $3 billion after closing its Series C, with ambitions to reach as much as $7 billion in a future IPO. Meanwhile, Galbot has raised more than $300 million in fresh funding, reportedly pushing its valuation to $3 billion, one of the largest financings in China’s humanoid robotics sector to date.\n\nU.S. companies are moving beyond flashy demos as well to focus on real-world deployments. Plus, they are pursuing their own aggressive goals. U.S. startup Foundation, for instance, plans to build 50,000 humanoid robots by the end of 2027.\n\nBut China is already targeting a mix of affordable mass-market models and high-end applications, rapidly expanding humanoids across industrial, consumer, and rehabilitation sectors, according to a December TrendForce report.\n\nBottlenecks to China’s dominance\n\nWhen it comes to AI systems and integrated software, it’s still unclear where Chinese humanoid firms truly stand. The industry is largely betting on vision-language-action models and “world models,” but both technologies remain in early stages. Nvidia currently leads the space with its end-to-end humanoid software stack, according to Xu, so naturally most humanoid startups in China are powered by Nvidia’s Orin chips. However, domestic chipmakers are developing homegrown alternatives, she said.\n\nYet humanoid robotics makers are still working on fundamental problems. The challenge is enabling robot foundation models to predict the “next physical state” the robot will face in unpredictable environments, like how large language models predict the next word. But unlike LLMs, humanoid robotics companies can’t simply scrape the internet for training data, Xu said. So most are relying on simulation environments, which generates synthetic data, though real-world data collection remains essential.\n\n“Because of the data scarcity problem, humanoids are still far away from autonomy. The hardware is currently ahead of the software — the robot body can handle a lot more dexterity today than years ago (though it has reliability issues, as we saw with the robots that broke down at humanoid marathons), but the brain is still nascent,” the analyst said.\n\nSafety is a major hurdle for humanoid robots, too. One high-profile accident could trigger public backlash, and China is likely weighing how to roll out the technology quickly without moving too fast. As the industry matures, more regulations are expected.\n\nGiven the lack of data, Zhao believes that demand for humanoids will grow first in fairly contained workplaces.\n\n“Early momentum is likely to be in industrial manufacturing, warehouse logistics, and retail, where tasks are repetitive, hours are long, and processes are clear — creating real demand and ideal conditions for humanoid robots to deliver value at scale,” he said.\n\nOther APAC players\n\nHumanoid robot development is not a two-country race. Japan’s robotics ecosystem — from startups to semiconductor heavyweights — is targeting humanoid mass production by 2027. Long a pioneer through projects like Honda’s Asimo, Murata Manufacturing’s Murata Boy, and SoftBank Robotics’ Pepper, Japan leans on precision and advanced control. One area unique to this nation: Humanoid robots are increasingly used in eldercare.\n\nCoral Capital CEO James Riney, who invests in tech companies in Japan, believes Tokyo will continue to thrive in the humanoid robotics industry. “There are three factors likely to drive the adoption of robotics in Japan. One is the labor shortage and the desire to depend less on mass immigration. The second is the widespread cultural view of robots as our friends — more Doraemon vs. Terminator. The third is that Japan is already dominant in many parts of the robotics supply chain.”\n\nHyundai Motor’s Boston Dynamics unit introduced a new Atlas humanoid for factory use by 2028, with plans to produce up to 30,000 units annually in the U.S. as part of its AI-driven robotics push.\n\nStill, for China, government policy, industrial strategy, labor shortages, and private capital are all converging to turbocharge the country’s humanoid robotics push.\n\n“China’s leadership is best understood as a speed-to-scale advantage,” Zhao said. “The ecosystem here compresses the entire cycle — R&D, supply chain, manufacturing, integration, and customer deployment — into a very tight loop. That means humanoid companies can move from prototype to real-world deployment faster, learn from real operations, and iterate at a pace that’s difficult to match elsewhere.”"

            "content": "Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.\n\nThe blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.\n\nThe Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.\n\nAccess to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.\n\nWe understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase. We acknowledge the difficulties this is causing for our users there. Supabase continues to follow up through all available channels to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nWe continue to advise affected customers… — Supabase (@supabase) February 27, 2026\n\nAn Indian founder, who asked not to be named to avoid potential repercussions, told TechCrunch they had stopped seeing new user sign-ups from India over the past two to three days. A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.\n\nWhile Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.\n\nAt the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nA screenshot showing Supabase’s access blocked on ACT Fibernet Image Credits:Screenshot / Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\n\nNotably, Supabase’s main website remained accessible in India — but its underlying developer infrastructure did not.\n\nIndia is Supabase’s fourth-largest source of traffic, accounting for about 9% of global visits, according to data from Similarweb, highlighting the potential fallout for the country’s developer ecosystem. The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.\n\nThe incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.\n\n“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.”\n\nIndia has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted access to developer platform GitHub, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also reported that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.\n\nFounded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has gained traction amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its valuation to $5 billion.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond."

            "content": "“This is just not the right pathway forward,” Isaacman said.\n\nA senior NASA official, speaking on background to Ars, noted that the space agency has experienced hydrogen and helium leaks during both the Artemis I and Artemis II prelaunch preparations, and these problems have led to monthslong delays in launch.\n\n“If I recall, the timing between Apollo 7 and 8 was nine weeks,” the official said. “Launching SLS every three and a half years or so is not a recipe for success. Certainly, making each one of them a work of art with some major configuration change is also not helpful in the process, and we’re clearly seeing the results of it, right?”\n\nThe goal therefore is to standardize the SLS rocket into a single configuration in order to make the rocket as reliable as possible, and launching as frequently as every 10 months. NASA will fly the SLS vehicle until there are commercial alternatives to launch crews to the moon, perhaps through Artemis V as Congress has mandated, or perhaps even a little longer.\n\nIs Everyone on Board?\n\nThe NASA official said all of the agency’s key contractors are on board with the change, and senior leaders in Congress have been briefed on the proposed changes.\n\nThe biggest opposition to these proposals would seemingly come from Boeing, which is the prime contractor for the Exploration Upper Stage, a contract worth billions of dollars to develop a more powerful rocket that was due to launch for the first time later this decade. However, in a NASA news release, Boeing appeared to offer at least some support for the revised plans.\n\n“Boeing is a proud partner to the Artemis mission and our team is honored to contribute to NASA’s vision for American space leadership,” said Steve Parker, Boeing Defense, Space & Security president and CEO, in the news release. “The SLS core stage remains the world’s most powerful rocket stage, and the only one that can carry American astronauts directly to the moon and beyond in a single launch. As NASA lays out an accelerated launch schedule, our workforce and supply chain are prepared to meet the increased production needs.”\n\nSolid Reasons for Changing Artemis III\n\nNASA’s new approach to Artemis reflects a return to the philosophy of the Apollo program. During the late 1960s, the space agency flew a series of preparatory crewed missions before the Apollo 11 lunar landing. These included Apollo 7 (a low-Earth-orbit test of the Apollo spacecraft), Apollo 8 (a lunar orbiting mission), Apollo 9 (a low-Earth-orbit rendezvous with the lunar lander), and Apollo 10 (a test of the lunar lander descending to the moon, without touching down).\n\nWith its previous Artemis template, NASA skipped the steps taken by Apollo 7, 9, and 10. In the view of many industry officials, this leap from Artemis II—a crewed lunar flyby of the moon testing only the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft—to Artemis III and a full-on lunar landing was enormous and risky."

            "content": "Residents across Tehran and other Iranian cities were jolted awake by sounds of loud explosions in the early hours of Saturday morning, as Israel and the US launched joint attacks on Iran.\n\nThe attacks, which the US and Israel are calling “preemptive strikes,” come after a period of failed negotiations between the countries, and on the heels of mass protests in Iran earlier this year that saw the death of at least 3,117 civilians, according to government statistics.\n\nShortly after the first set of explosions, Iranians received bursts of notifications on their phones. They came not from the government advising caution, but from an apparently hacked prayer-timing app called BadeSaba Calendar that has been downloaded more than 5 million times from the Google Play Store.\n\nThe messages arrived in quick succession over a period of 30 minutes, starting with the phrase ‘Help has arrived’ at 9:52 am Tehran time, shortly after the first set of explosions. No party has claimed responsibility for the hacks.\n\nScreenshots shared with WIRED Middle East show messages urging Iranian military personnel to surrender their weapons with the promise of amnesty. They also urged army personnel to join “the forces of liberation” and to “defend your brothers.”\n\nThe push notifications are all titled “Help is on the way” and call on Iranian military members to surrender. Screenshot: WIRED Middle East\n\n“The time for revenge has come,” one notification received at 10:02 am read (translated from Farsi). “The regime's repressive forces will pay for their cruel and merciless actions against the innocent people of Iran. Anyone who joins in defending and protecting the Iranian nation will be granted amnesty and forgiveness.”\n\n“For the freedom of our Iranian brothers and sisters, this is a call to all oppressive forces—lay down your weapons or join the forces of liberation. Only in this way can you save your lives. For a free Iran,” another message sent at 10:14 am read.\n\nCybersecurity analysts confirmed that BadeSabah users had received notifications around the time of the strikes, but have not been able to identify the source of the hack. “At this point, we genuinely do not know who is behind them, whether it was Israel or other anti-government Iranian groups,” says Narges Keshavarznia, digital rights researcher at the Miaan Group, adding that no hacker group has claimed credit."

However, debris from one interception fell in Abu Dhabi, killing one civilian. Abu Dhabi sits near several strategic military installations, including Al Dhafra Air Base, which hosts Emirati and US forces.\n\nFor many residents, the event unfolded as a series of distant flashes and muffled explosions in the sky. Behind those brief moments, however, is a complex network of radars, interceptors and command systems designed to detect, track, and destroy ballistic missiles traveling at hypersonic speeds.\n\nUnderstanding what happened in those seconds means understanding how the UAE’s layered missile defense network works.\n\nThe System Designed to Stop Ballistic Missiles\n\nThe UAE’s missile shield includes multiple layers of defense, such as the high-altitude Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and the lower-altitude MIM-104 Patriot."

If you’ve never sampled its wares, preferring the latest Apple or Samsung iteration, you might be surprised at just how good these devices are. The Chinese company is the third-largest phone maker in the world behind Apple and Samsung, and it packs all the latest cutting-edge hardware into its annual flagship release. Xiaomi’s Ultra line has long battled for the camera king title.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nAmusingly, Xiaomi skipped the 16 series to compete directly with Apple’s latest iPhone generation. There’s no radical redesign for the 17 Ultra over last year’s Xiaomi 15 Ultra, but there is refinement and a special version called the Leitzphone, designed with Leica, that may prove irresistible to fans of the German camera brand. The Xiaomi 17 Ultra is easily one of the best phones you can’t officially buy in the United States. While importing a Chinese smartphone is not without potential pitfalls, this one will tempt keen American photographers.\n\nLeica a Lot\n\nI’ve always appreciated Leica’s minimalist industrial design. Textured black and silver materials with a splash of red add some identity. It strikes me as a careful balance between form and function, and it comes through very strongly in Xiaomi’s Leitzphone. The aluminum alloy frame is ribbed for enhanced grip, you can rotate the ring around the camera for fine zoom control, and the user interface has an elegant Leica-themed makeover. I’m surprised there’s no dedicated shutter button, though you can add one with the optional photography kit (more on that later)."

            "content": "Others We Tested\n\nThere were multiple great bags we tried whose features or designs just didn't add up to a place in the top spots above. However, everyone has something different they're looking for in a toiletry bag, so while not perfect for us, some of these options may still be perfect for you.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nPatricks BB1 Bathroom Bag for $189: This crush-resistant, shock-absorbing rectangular bag is basically a heavier-duty, unisex version of the Flat Lay, below, except it costs four times as much. I tested it in the Triple Black colorway, which is “strictly limited to 1,000 pieces globally.” This one’s got two interior flaps with a slim, shallow zippered pouch on either side, but otherwise is just one big compartment that led to too much clinking and clanking of contents during my test. It’s great for full-sized products, but my testers and I all preferred bags that hold the products securely upright, as in the less expensive Parallelle Kit, above.\n\nFlat Lay Makeup Box Bag for $37: Available in opaque-fabric and clear (\"jelly\") styles, this unassuming pouch looks like a chubby rectangle with a handle on the end but actually unzips into a flat tray for easy access. There's only one compartment, so I didn't love it as a toiletry bag, but I did love it as a pool and beach accessory bag for sunscreen and makeup.\n\nMonos Metro Toiletry Case for $95: This durable, structured case, available in either nylon or vegan leather, exhibits the class and quality construction Monos is known for. It has one main roomy compartment with three small pockets inside; one zippered. It did a great job of protecting its contents while still being squishable enough to fit in a tightly packed carry-on, though I did find myself wishing it had a handle for carrying.\n\nCalpak Clear Cosmetics Case for $85: Constructed largely of water-resistant, wipe-clean PVC, this clear cosmetic case (I tested the Medium size) zips all the way around and folds flat to reveal two zippered compartments and one smaller zippered mesh bag. It also looks like a cute little purse with its 16 trendy color options, dual handles, and metal bottom studs. However, contents aren't as easy to access as other cosmetic bags that just open from the top—you have to lay the Calpak flat to open both sides, which requires a 16-by-10-inch footprint.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nVera Bradley Toiletry Bags for $30: The erstwhile must-have accessory of both early-aughts Southern sorority girls and their grandmothers, Vera Bradley bags are back with a new spokesperson (Zooey Deschanel), new designs, and updated fabrics like smooth twill and cotton gabardine. (Die-hard fans can rest assured that the staple quilted paisley options are still available.) The new line includes multiple styles of toiletry bags and makeup bags that are lightweight, giftable, and can add a pop of color and personality to your travel setup. I tested several, and my favorite was the Lay-Flat Travel Organizer—its two interior clear zippered compartments and three mesh slip pockets were roomy yet snug enough to keep all contents of my morning routine secure, and a rather large spill of soap in the large pocket cleaned up quickly. However, even though the fabric is padded, which provides some protection for the interior contents, the exterior is somewhat absorbent and not machine washable (though other designs are), so be forewarned that light-colored options could attract stains.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBagsmart Blast 4.5L Toiletry Bag for $30: This rectangular toiletry bag can sit on a counter (with about a 10 x 5-inch footprint) or hang with a 360-degree rotating hook. It's machine washable and has a bright orange interior for visibility, sporting five mesh pockets. Both my testers and I liked it a lot. The only thing that kept it from nabbing a top spot is how much space it took up when not hanging, and when it did hang, it stuck out more than the traditional flat hanging styles.\n\nBeis the Dopp Kit for $68: I’ve had Beis' Dopp Kit for four years now, and it’s still my go-to for any trip. The poly canvas material is durable and easy to spot-clean. Plus, I opted for the black version to mask the inevitable scuffs and smaller stains. What I love the most, though, are the compartments. The water-resistant section is a total game-changer when packing liquids or fragrances. If something leaks, a quick wipe gets the job done. The waterproof bottom is also a huge bonus when I’m getting ready at a bathroom sink. —Boutayna Chokrane\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nThule Aion Toiletry Bag for $65: This spacious, 5-liter bag with an 11 x 5-inch footprint features many thoughtful touches, including a wipe-clean interior with a rubbery, water-resistant bottom to protect it from wet countertops. (Though there's also a handy strap that snaps to hang on any-diameter hook or rack.) The sides snap down to compress, almost like a packing cube, and I like that it's squishable to fit into a smaller suitcase. It also comes with a removable translucent bag for taking liquids through the airport security line. However, it does take up a lot of space when not snapped down, and the waxed canvas does attract a lot of lines and marks, which may not be to everyone's aesthetic taste.\n\nNex Dopp for $73: The small and large Dopp kits I tested, part of Nex’s 2024 Hawaii collection, consisted of a roomy, single compartment with a dual zippered strip. They’re made of microfiber leather, which is a higher-quality synthetic leather, said to be softer and more durable. The bags were stiff and well-structured, which felt protective of my cosmetics when jammed into my carry-on. There is a slight synthetic smell from the microfiber leather, which is hard to miss, since you must lean your face quite close to the bag to see the contents in the cavernous single compartment. I also felt that when the bag was unzipped, the zippered strip was either in the way or had to be splayed out, which took up too much space on my tiny hotel-bathroom shelf. Otherwise, this is a fine option that offers both a lifetime warranty and an unlimited trade-in program.\n\nCotopaxi Nido Accessory Bag Cada Día for $50: Cotopaxi’s trim little bag is meant not just for hygiene items, but any collection of odds and ends. It’s made from light recycled deadstock nylon (so, probably not for you if you are carrying glass bottles or anything that needs padding) and weighs in at a modest 6.5 ounces. Your colorway will be unique! I like the surprisingly capacious 4-liter capacity spread over three different compartments, with a big middle compartment for your quart-size, TSA-approved bag of liquids and two other compartments with separate, smaller pockets. I do have to admit, though, that I like hooks better than loops, and hanging is more convenient with a clamshell toiletry bag design than with this one, which can't be hung while open. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nKusshi Hair Tools Bag for $89: Unlike similar bags that just bunch up your hair tools into a roll, this hair tool carrier has two organized pocket sections; a zippered pouch in the middle for hair products or, in my case while I was testing, attachments for my Shark FlexFusion; and a pocket on the outside for rubber bands or small accessories like lip balm. It's also made of neoprene that's heat-resistant up to 380 degrees Fahrenheit, so you don't have to worry about waiting for your tools to cool down before packing them away. Keep in mind, though, that the initial off-gassing is strong with this one—you may want to let it sit in a well-ventilated area for several days before packing it in your suitcase, lest it make everything else smell plasticky. This included the air from my hair dryer when I used it. There are also reports online of it not accommodating some Dyson tools, though it did fit an Airstrait and Corrale.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nAer Travel Kit 2 Ultra for $79: Does the average traveler need a toiletry bag made partially of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which is 15 times stronger than steel by weight? Perhaps not, but it definitely makes for an interesting bag. Part of Aer’s 10th Anniversary Ultra Collection, this hardy, chunky little Dopp kit incorporates the collection's Ultra400X fabric (in black only) by Challenge Sailcloth, known for its high-performance sails for yacht racers and kite surfers. Despite its strength, the Travel Kit is still pretty lightweight at 8 ounces. However, the hook is thick plastic and too small for a towel rack, and the rubbery “Aer” brand tags on the outside and inside seem to accumulate toothbrush and soap residue, as does the mesh zippered pouch in the top compartment. Both proved somewhat difficult to clean.\n\nEagle Creek Pack-It Trifold Toiletry Kit for $50: Eagle Creek's travel accessory game is extremely strong. Its toiletry bags, packing cubes, and various organizers are affordable, sturdy, and exceedingly well designed, and this toiletry bag is no exception. At first glance, it looks like two toiletry bags snapped together, but each side unzips to make a hanging organizer with six compartments. The only problem is that one side of the bag holds products upside down until it's unfurled, which led to items falling out in my tests.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nState Bags Benson Toiletry Kit for $65: This is a solid, simple bag with three mesh pouches and a snap-in/snap-out plastic envelope that can hold a toothbrush and toothpaste or shower items like soap. The navy version I tested had a coated polyester wipe-clean exterior and interior made from recycled bottles, and I liked that it had the option to hang. However, the organization was more rudimentary than similar-category bags we tested, and it was missing some of the thoughtful details featured on other bags in the same price range, like a quick-access pouch on the back and a larger hook with a rubber tip to prevent slipping. (This bag's thick, small plastic hook wasn't even wide enough to hang on a towel rack.)\n\nCuyana Travel Beauty Case for $298: Those still chasing the quiet luxury aesthetic will love this elegant zippered cosmetic case, available in black or pale pink. It’s made of high-end-feeling Italian pebbled leather both inside and out, with gold hardware and “Cuyana” discreetly printed on the bottom. It opens clamshell-style, and the lid contains a snap-close cover concealing a brush holder with elastic loops. A removable pouch snaps onto that lid cover, and the main compartment has a pocket for securing tubes, bottles, and small tools. Contents aren’t as immediately accessible as they are in other cosmetic cases I tested, but they are more secure. This bag is also on the heavy side, even for a cosmetics case, weighing in at 1.6 pounds, but if you can swing the price, this is a well-made, timeless investment for your travel arsenal.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nCincha the Toiletry Bag for $55: After testing nearly every style of toiletry bag in existence, I thought I had seen it all, but this thoughtfully designed bag from Cincha surprised me. The large size is essentially the tackle box of toiletry bags. It zips open in the middle to reveal four roomy compartments—two on each side, each topped with a small, translucent vinyl zippered pouch. I could not believe the amount of stuff I was able to fit into this thing, and yet I never had trouble closing it, despite packing it to the absolute max. I ended up taking it on a five-day getaway where I had to share a bathroom with two other people, and I found that I loved being able to flip it over and lift the “lid” of whatever side I needed, in order to keep the counter footprint small.\n\nJuly Hanging Toiletry Bag for $85: I own and love July's carry-on suitcase, so I was excited to try the brand's popular hanging toiletry bag. It's a great design with a zippered pouch on the back, plus a body that zips flat to reveal PVC and pouch zip compartments and a large, rubber-tipped metal hook that tucks away. It looks well-made and stylish with leather trim and gunmetal hardware, but my husband took it on a business trip and found that its pockets are actually quite small, confirming a worry I had when I tested it in my bathroom at home. It wouldn't be an issue if the bag itself were small, but it took up a full quarter of the carry-on.\n\nTumi Alpha Bravo Response Kit for $225: This rugged-looking, ballistic nylon bag has the classic Tumi Tracer inside to help facilitate its return to you if it gets lost, as well as an antimicrobial lining. It can hang, stand up, or lie flat and has several convenient internal pockets and an external zipped pouch. It's a lot of money for a toiletry bag with many of the same features as ones half the price, but if you're a Tumi fan and need a toiletry bag to match your luggage, you could do worse than this model.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBeautifect Go Mini for $177: WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe loved the larger Beautifect Box, and I tested the Mini to see if it would work for travel. While the smaller size does make it more portable (along with a purse-like carry strap), the multifunction lighted mirror and its battery made the lid top-heavy, so it kept flopping forward when I tried to use it on a soft, uneven surface like my lap or a bed. It's also got a very hard case and is a bit heavy at almost 2.5 pounds, so as much as I wanted to take it with me on a plane, I ended up bringing a smaller bag instead. Worth a buy if you want a makeup case with a lighted mirror, but it's definitely best for day trips.\n\nFjallraven Kanken Toiletry Bag for $60: I love this thing, which makes me feel like a Red Cross nurse on the battlefields of World War II. It’s made from a proprietary Fjallraven fabric blend that combines organic cotton with recycled polyester, so it feels like fabric but is more waterproof and durable. It has a clamshell design with a sturdy interior plastic hook. My quart bag of bottles goes into the enormous lower zip compartment, my toothbrush and deodorant in the top compartment, and there are mesh pockets and MOLLE webbing so that your tiny things are easily visible. However, its dimensions are very large, so this might not be for you if you’re a minimalist with just a toothbrush and a comb. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nTom Beckbe Canvas Dopp Kit for $195: Known for its high-end jackets, field hats, and vests for fishing and waterfowl hunting, Birmingham, Alabama-based sports outfitter Tom Beckbe also makes a Dopp kit made of full-grain distressed leather and the brand’s proprietary Field Canvas. It matches the genteel Southern vibe of Tom Beckbe’s collection of other travel bags and related accessories like camo whiskey totes and insulated shooting gloves. If the Marlboro Man ever left the ranch, this is definitely the Dopp kit he would have used. The only downside is that the bag is relatively large—and dark inside—for what’s essentially one compartment.\n\nEagle Creek Pack-It Isolate Quick Trip for $25: This little bag is a simple design, made from recycled bottles, with a zipper on the top and on the side. However, its light weight and semi-structured shape make it perfect for holding a wallet and keys at the gym, or even as a tech pouch for work purposes.\n\nKusshi Neoprene Wristlet Clutch for $39: It's a purse! It's a toiletry bag! It's a purse that doubles as a toiletry bag! This clutch is the perfect size for a larger phone, e-reader, or small tablet, with a couple of mesh pockets for makeup. I used it to tote a day's worth of makeup and skincare around town and found it was just heavy enough to be burdensome, but if you like the neoprene look and your essentials are lightweight, this clutch, like most Kusshi products, is sturdy and well-made.\n\nSympl Dopp Kit for $75: I liked this bag’s durable Cordura exterior and stow-away clip for hanging, as well as the fact it has a lifetime warranty. The bag opens clamshell-style to reveal four simple waterproof zip pockets—two thin and horizontal, one small rectangle, and one larger rectangle. It's an interesting idea, but in practice, this severely limits utility since a user is restricted to specific toiletry-sized products that fit the shape of each of the pockets. (My deodorant did not fit, nor did a toothbrush in a case.)\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBagsmart Paz Hanging Toiletry Bag for $35: With its stylish, padded exterior; generously sized carry handle; and ability to transport up to eight full-sized products, this one had me reaching for it long after the testing period was over. The thin, tipped metal hanger makes it easy to hang anywhere, and there's an easy-access compartment on the front with loops for makeup brushes or other long, thin items. In fact, this is almost a small toiletry briefcase rather than a bag—the whole thing unfurls into a 33-inch-long organizer with four separate compartments (two with sections to hold full-sized products). It will almost certainly be too much for anyone who likes to travel light, but if you check your luggage, will be on the road for a long time, or just don't want to deal with decanting your personal care products, this is a well-designed and easy-to-use solution.\n\nSaltyface Everywhere Bag for $36: Technically designed to store Saltyface self-tanners and bronzers, this puffy black fabric bag spent an indordinate amount of time on my counter, simply because I liked how it looked. Practically speaking, though, the handle was too small for an adult-sized hand, and I found myself becoming irritated with the single zipper pull, so it's not ideal as a general-purpose travel toiletry bag.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow I Test Toiletry Bags AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron For bags our team hasn’t already been using for years, I spend a four-week period rotating new toiletry bags during my morning routine. I note any annoyances or unique details, volume, how easy it is to store and retrieve items, how much space each one takes up on the vanity, how they survive being splashed with water and soap, and, if the bag can hang, how easy it is to retrieve items once hanging. About every three months, my family goes on trips that require stays in hotels. I always take different groups of bags and determine how easy it is to use multiple bags at once in a small space, if hook designs allowed for multiple places to hang, and whether the contents spilled in or otherwise dirtied the bags, and if so, how easy they are to clean. For bags I am not able to take on trips, I lend them to friends and family members who are traveling and take down their notes to consider alongside my own home testing. How Does WIRED Obtain Toiletry Bags for Testing? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Some toiletry bags are review samples requested from the manufacturer, while others are purchased and expensed. Review samples are only accepted without promise of editorial coverage. Toiletry bags chosen as picks are reused for durability testing purposes, while all other bags are donated upon completion of testing. What Kind of Toiletry Bag Do You Need? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Dopp kits, cosmetics cases, hanging bags … the differences between categories aren’t always clear. Here are some of the more common types of toiletry bags you'll come across, and what to consider with each. Dopp kit: Named for leather craftsman Charles Doppelt, who provided “Dopps,” or toiletry kits, for WWII soldiers. “Dopp kit” has evolved over time to indicate any kind of portable toiletry organizer, but commercially, toiletry bags labeled “Dopp kits” tend to be smaller and hold just a handful of necessities for short trips as opposed to larger fold-up hanging bags and cosmetics cases. Cosmetics case: Designed for those who need more than just the necessities, a cosmetics case is usually a much larger boxlike container with specialized compartments for makeup, skin care, hair care, and other necessities. They often come with extras like brush holders and mirrors. Hanging toiletry bag: A bag that, as the name indicates, comes with a hook so that it can be hung on a hook, towel rack, tree, or someplace it won’t take up space on the counter. Often, the user needs to hang them to be able to access all the storage compartments. Something to consider is that hooks can be used up quite quickly if everyone in your hotel room has a hanging bag. All the hooks in our bathroom were taken almost immediately, so my husband ended up having to hang his bag over the toilet, which he wasn’t thrilled about. A good hanging toiletry bag will also have a hook that's thin enough to slip over just about any hook, and be rubber-tipped so it won't slide off.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "Shopping for a MicroSD card can be a little daunting. There are a ton of numbers to consider, a huge number of brands producing cards with similar-sounding features and names, and words like Pro, Extreme, and Express getting thrown around everywhere.\n\nTo make a long story short, unless you're shooting a ton of photos and videos, and doing so even semiprofessionally where losing those shots might be detrimental to your professional reputation, you're fine to buy a MicroSD card from any company whose name you've heard before. I prefer cards from PNY, SanDisk, and Lexar. Keep an eye out for the “U” symbol with a 3 inside, or a “V30” on the card for the best balance of speed and price. There are two exceptions to that suggestion:\n\nIf you're shooting on a high-end camera, you should consider a V60 MicroSD card, if you can find one for a reasonable price. Some cameras have extra video features you can enable with a faster MicroSD card, so check your manual for more info on whether you need to upgrade.\n\nIf you're buying for a Nintendo Switch 2, you'll need an unfortunately more expensive MicroSD Express card. While you can transfer images and videos from your Switch 2 with most regular MicroSD cards, you'll need an Express version to use it for actually running games.\n\nCapacity\n\nHow much storage you need will largely depend on your needs, but there are a few things to consider when debating between 128 GB and 1 TB. The first is that MicroSD cards are tiny, and having to swap them out on the road can be a risky proposition. Costs tend to go up exponentially for 1 TB and 2 TB cards, but the gap between 256 GB and 512 GB isn't that large, so I recommend sizing up a bit.\n\nThe other factor is that storage sizes are also separated into different standards, so you'll want to make sure your device actually supports that larger card. Cards that are 64 GB are higher are technically “SDXC” for Extended Capacity, and are currently the most common type, and you should be able to use them in most modern situations.\n\nSpeed\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about MicroSD speeds, we have a write-up with a full explanation of the different speeds and how they interact, but I'll give you the quick rundown here too.\n\nEach MicroSD card will have its actual minimum sequential write speed indicated by a letter and number on the card. The number indicates the speed in MB/s, with the letter representing the generation. A C10, U1, and V10 are all essentially the same speed, just written differently, so you're likely to see multiple symbols printed on each card. I'd recommend checking out the SD Association's page on speeds with a handy chart showing the full comparison.\n\nIn practice, you have to go out of your way to find a MicroSD card that's slower than V30/U3 at most retailers, though you may find them included with some electronics that don't require anything more substantial."

            "content": "The idea of using a laptop cooling pad feels antiquated. These days, laptop chips have become extremely efficient. The fans on MacBooks (if they even have them) are barely used, and both Intel and Qualcomm are pushing efficiency on the Windows front.\n\nBut people keep buying laptop cooling pads, so surely there is a use case in 2026 that actually makes sense, right? I tried out a couple cooling pads paired with a couple of different gaming laptops, and walked away surprised at how effective they could be.\n\nDo Cooling Pads Actually Work?\n\nPhotograph: Luke Larsen\n\nLaptop cooling pads have been around for decades, and the idea has always been simple: provide extra air to blow through a laptop that’s otherwise restricted by its own cooling system. In theory, more air means lower temperatures—and, ultimately, better performance. This is the whole idea of the power modes that exist in Windows, which ramp up the RPMs (rotations per minute) of the fans to add more air to both improve performance. More than that, less heat also means a longer-lasting laptop that doesn't degrade as quickly over time. It’s by that same logic that laptop cooling pads offer help.\n\nThe problem, however, is that a cooling pad is a rather inefficient way of transferring air into your device. Most laptop cooling pads, including the two that I tested, use one large fan or two smaller fans to blast cold air across the bottom of the laptop. This is the first reason why the vast majority of modern laptops won’t benefit much from a cooling pad, as these laptops tend to only have vents along the hinge. Without vents or open holes, blowing air across a sheet of metal or plastic isn't going to do anything to cool the components on the other side. It'll only generate a bunch of fan noise.\n\nGaming laptops are the main exception, though, which is why they are the primary use case for such an accessory. Most gaming laptops have a few open vents, usually above the fans, like the Razer Blade 16, which is one of the laptops I used to test these cooling pads. Laptops like the Blade 16 are designed for intensive tasks like gaming, video editing, or local AI processing—and use a high-wattage GPU and CPU to get the kind of performance you need. My model has two of the most powerful laptop components on the market: the RTX 5090 and Ryzen 9 HX 370. As you might guess, they generate a lot of heat when cranked up. Modern chips tend to max out at 100 degrees Celsius, before throttling back performance to bring down temperatures.\n\nMost laptops use fans to cool these components, but the thickness of the laptop chassis is also a determining factor in how much the system will need to throttle back performance to keep temperatures down. In the end, it's geometry and physics, and every millimeter of space in the laptop chassis has an effect on how cool it can keep its internal components. And unlike in a large desktop PC, you have very restricted space. That's especially true in the modern era, where even gaming laptops have become increasingly thin."

            "content": "Congressional Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee released a report this week pinpointing more than $20.9 billion in consumer losses stemming from identity theft that came out of four major breaches of data broker firms. US senator Maggie Hassan launched the investigation in August after an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, copublished by WIRED, found that some data brokers were hiding opt-out tools from Google and other search engines.\n\nThe US Department of Justice’s recent release of 3 million documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein included grand jury subpoenas to Google that shed light on how federal investigators interact with tech companies and how they respond to government requests for information.\n\nThe Mexican drug cartel CJNG may survive the killing of its longtime leader Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes in part thanks to its prolific use of technologies like drones, social media, and AI. Meanwhile, the Mexican Navy announced on Thursday that it had seized a semi-submersible vessel carrying nearly 4 tons of cocaine as part of a recent initiative to deter drug trafficking in the Pacific Ocean. The effort comes as the US has launched its own purported campaign against maritime trafficking via a series of deadly attacks on boats in the Caribbean.\n\nMeanwhile, as AI assistant agents like OpenClaw explode in popularity—and sow chaos around the web—a new open source project called IronCurtain is using a unique design to secure and constrain agentic AI before it can go rogue.\n\nAnd there’s more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nSetting an autonomous internet-enabled robot loose in your house should give anyone a moment’s pause. When that robot is a roving vacuum cleaner equipped with a camera and microphone that could be hijacked from anywhere in the world with nothing more than its serial number, it becomes an actual privacy horror story.\n\nOne such robovac owner, Sammy Azdoufal, discovered that absurd security vulnerability while attempting an experiment in piloting his DJI Romo robot vacuum cleaner with a PS5 controller. He found that he could instead control 6,700 of the robots in 24 countries around the world, with full access to the floor plans they generated of their owners’ homes and their video and audio feeds. When The Verge contacted Azdoufal, he was able to instantly access a Romo owned by a staffer at the tech news outlet just by knowing its 14-digit serial number. DJI has now fixed the vulnerability in response to Azdoufal essentially live-tweeting his findings. But the story nonetheless raises serious questions about the security of other audio- or video-enabled internet-of-things gadgets—not to mention ones capable of freely roaming your home.\n\nWhile the Department of Homeland has been hugely empowered under the Trump administration in its mission to deport millions of immigrants, the organization within DHS that serves as the United States’ primary cyber defender, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, has been neglected. Now its acting director, Madhu Gottumukkala, has been replaced as CISA seeks to find new footing.\n\nEven before that news, CyberScoop this week reported on the crises that have plagued the agency for the entire first year since Trump’s inauguration: A third of the staff has been laid off and entire divisions of the agency have been closed. Nominations for a permanent director have been blocked in Congress. Its capabilities have withered, and organizations that had sought out CISA for assistance and partnerships have looked elsewhere. Gottumukkala has suffered his own more personal scandals such as ousting security personnel after he failed a polygraph test and sharing sensitive contracts on ChatGPT. Now Nick Andersen, who has served as CISA’s executive director for cybersecurity, will replace Gottumukkala at the beleaguered agency.\n\nA researcher at King’s College London pitted three popular large language models against each other in simulated war game scenarios and found that, 95 percent of the time, at least one of the models opted to deploy tactical nuclear weapons. The researcher also found, when an AI model deployed a tactical nuclear weapon, its AI opponent only deescalated a fourth of the time. None of the companies behind the three models—OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic—responded to New Scientist’s request for comment.\n\nAI’s role in war-fighting has lurched into the spotlight this week. Anthropic and the Department of War are embroiled in a contract dispute over whether Anthropic’s AI models can be used to power fully autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance. Dario Amodei, Anthropic’s CEO, wrote in a statement that these types of use cases “can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.” In turn, President Donald Trump has threatened to ban the use of Anthropic products, including its Claude chatbot, within the US government. Meanwhile, hundreds of Google and OpenAI employees have signed an open letter asking for their bosses to “put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War's current demands for permission to use our models for domestic mass surveillance and autonomously killing people without human oversight.”\n\nA new app for Android phones called Nearby Glasses lets users scan for smart glasses in your vicinity, revealing the presence of the wearable gadgets, which are sometimes indistinguishable from normal glasses and let wearers record people without their knowledge. The app scans for the unique Bluetooth signatures that the glasses emit, and sends users a notification if it detects a nearby source.\n\nThe developer told 404 Media that he was inspired to build the app after reading about several incidents involving smart glasses. Over the summer, 404 Media reported that a Customs and Border Protection agent had donned a pair during an immigration raid, and this fall the outlet also reported that men were using smart glasses to film massage parlor workers, seemingly without their knowledge or consent. In February, The New York Times reported that one smart-glasses developer, Meta, had plans to integrate face recognition into its glasses, spurring fresh concerns among privacy experts."

            "content": "While my esteemed CNET colleagues were in San Francisco for the release of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series, I was in Barcelona ahead of MWC 2026, seeing the sights and eying the fancy cars that ply the Spanish city's streets.\n\nOnce my colleagues arrived with the Galaxy S26 in tow, I found a novel use for one of its coolest features: shooting videos of Europe's expensive automobiles.\n\nIt's not uncommon for a Porsche or Maserati to zoom down the streets of the upscale neighborhoods in Barcelona. To capture them on video, I tried out the Galaxy S26's new Horizontal Lock, an extremely forgiving image stabilization mode. As my colleague Abrar Al-Heeti noted in her first take, with the camera feature turned on, you can tilt the phone as much as you want while the horizon remains steady.\n\nHorizontal lock keeps your image's horizon level even when the phone isn't during video recording. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nFirst, I reviewed CNET's hands-on sessions with the new mode. I overrotated the phone 90 degrees in one direction and flipped it 180 degrees in the other. Horizontal Lock worked exactly as advertised, showing smooth footage you'd believe was shot with a phone held very still.\n\nThis was a great feature to try out on Barcelona's streets, turning my wiggling arm into a steady hand behind the camera as I tracked flashy autos speeding down Passeig de Gracia and Carrer d'Arago in the Quadrat d'Or.\n\nWith Horizontal Lock straightening my footage, I could send videos back to my friends at home with undeniable proof that I'd seen some beautiful cars -- like the Porsche Carrera GTS in the image above (a 904 from around 1964, if my Googling skills are to be believed).\n\nThe Galaxy S26's Horizontal Lock is a perfect assistant if you're shooting fast, agile subjects darting around unpredictably. The feature could also salvage videos from unusably shaky footage, a clear advantage when recording during emergencies, disasters or in war zones.\n\nAnd for everyday Galaxy S26 owners, Horizontal Lock makes casual videos easier to watch, ensuring they end up on the good photography subreddits rather than the bad ones."

Tara Brown/CNET\n\nMobile World Congress 2026 is kicking off on Monday, teeing up a week that's likely to be filled with product announcements and futuristic phone concepts.\n\nOur expectations for this year's MWC 2026 include upcoming phones that we already know about -- including the Nothing Phone 4A that's set to launch March 5 -- along with launch events from companies like Xiaomi and Honor. Motorola's also attending, and considering the company revealed its upcoming Razr Fold at CES 2026, we'd expect the company to provide more details about the book-style folding phone.\n\nWe've also historically seen concepts at MWC that have never made it beyond the development stage but are still so cool to see. That's included Motorola debuting a flexible phone concept that you can wear on your wrist and Lenovo showing a solar-charging laptop.\n\nAnd even though Apple isn't expected to attend MWC, it's quite possible that the company might be debuting the rumored iPhone 17E over the course of the week. Apple has announced that it's going to be making new product announcements starting Monday in the lead-up to a March 4 event in New York, London and Shanghai. We'll certainly be keeping an eye out in case a new iPhone is one of them.\n\nWe'll be covering all the reveals, concepts and fun highlights we find in Barcelona in this live blog.

            "content": "When you go to perform the dreaded chore that is cleaning your toilet bowl, you likely notice that simply flushing your toilet isn't enough to get the rim clean. However, this may soon be a problem of the past.\n\nAt KBIS 2026, the CNET team saw a new toilet from Japanese toilet manufacturer Toto, the Aurora Washlet Plus S7A, designed to increase toilet bowl cleaning coverage by up to five times compared to standard gravity-flush toilets.\n\nThe Aurora Washlet Plus bidet toilet uses a new flushing technology that cleans the entire bowl and rim in a single flush. Toto\n\nHow the Aurora Washlet Plus cleans itself\n\nAt KBIS, Toto unveiled its new Integravity System within the Aurora Washlet Plus. It's a dual-valve, gravity-driven flush engine that uses rim wash and siphon-jet action in sequence to keep your toilet bowl cleaner for longer. It also works in concert with Toto's Tornado-style flushing (which the company calls \"the best flush in the industry\") and the Cefiontect ceramic bowl glaze, which prevents mold and grime from sticking, to clean all 360 degrees of your toilet bowl in one flush.\n\nA diagram showing how the Toto Integravity System works inside the Aurora Washlet Plus toilet. Toto\n\nExtra fancy features on this porcelain throne\n\nIn addition to its cleaning capabilities, Toto designed the Aurora Washlet Plus to quietly flush with water efficiency. Per flush, it uses 1 or 1.28 gallons of water. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, the current federal standard is 1.6 gallons per flush, meaning this toilet uses at least 0.32 gallons less per flush.\n\nThe Aurora Washlet Plus also has an integrated bidet. If you're a bidet user, then you know how challenging it can be to keep the bidet wand clean, as well as the toilet bowl. To help with this, the Aurora Washlet Plus uses an electrolyzed water cleaning agent called Ewater Plus to auto-clean the wand before and after every use, and Premist to mist the bowl before every use to prevent debris from clinging. The stain-resistant Clean Resin material makes it easier for both the wand and toilet seat to stay pristine.\n\nThe Aurora Washlet Plus was named after the aurora borealis and inspired by its quiet power. Toto\n\nThe only setback\n\nThe toilet is impressive but you'll have to dump a lot of cash to get it. David Watsky/CNET\n\nWhile there's a lot to love about this toilet, there's one hitch: It costs $3,648 at full price. You can bring that price down to $2,418 if you go with the Washlet S2 bidet model instead of the Washlet S7A, but you'll lose some features. Certain retailers offer discounts, depending on your location, but paying thousands of dollars for a toilet is still a pretty penny. However, as humans, we do tend to spend quite a bit of time in our bathrooms, so if a futuristic toilet can make our time in there more efficient, it could be worth it.\n\nThe future of the toilet\n\nToilet designs like this one make us think there will one day be a future in which we no longer have to clean our own toilet, and that it will do all the dirty work (literally) for us. This type of feature, especially at a more accessible price, could transform the bathroom into a space for solely self-care rather than another item to check off our cleaning to-do lists. That's a future we can get behind."
