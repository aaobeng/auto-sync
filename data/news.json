Arsenal are believed to be optimistic about signing him for as low as £75m.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAccording to The Sun, Arsenal will pursue a deal for the 25-year-old this summer, despite attention from Liverpool and United.\n\nMikel Arteta is reported to be a long-standing admirer of the winger, with speculation surrounding the Gunners first surfacing earlier this year.\n\nNow, Arsenal are said to be leading the chase ahead of Liverpool and United, and there is confidence within the club that ex-Everton ace Gordon would be receptive to a transfer to north London.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJesse Lingard in line for shock Man Utd reunion after latest transfer twist READ MORE :\n\nCristiano Ronaldo sent transfer request after buying 25 per cent stake in club READ MORE :\n\nHe has two years left on his contract, and whilst Newcastle are reluctant to part with him, there is a sense that a deal could be possible if the right fee was offered.\n\nDespite Gordon's Premier League and international credentials, the same report suggests Arsenal are targeting to secure him for a fee in the region of £75-£80m.\n\nGordon, however, rejected speculation of a transfer last week and maintains he is content at Newcastle.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR ARSENAL FB PAGE! Latest Gunners news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nWhen quizzed about the rumours of him being the next major talent to leave Tyneside, he told Chronicle Live: \"About me? I haven't seen them. What are they saying?\"\n\nUpon learning he's been linked with Arsenal and Liverpool recently, Gordon responded: \"It's the same old, same old. I think they just pick names out of a hat. They do (names out of the hat). I haven't heard anything; they might want to tell me before they tell you (the media).\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe added: \"I am focused on me and focused on the team, I am focused on right now.\n\n\"You look too far in the future and you start to underperform.

The Brazilian has been in and out of the team throughout the campaign and has only registered three Premier League goal contributions so far.\n\nBeyond Gordon's evident attributes, his blistering speed and goalscoring threat, Arteta is said to appreciate his adaptability, with Eddie Howe deploying him as a No.9 on multiple occasions this season.\n\nArsenal invested over £250million on eight first-team players last summer, but they are in a position to spend again following extended campaigns in the Champions League and domestic cups.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe Gunners presently occupy top spot in the Premier League and are aiming to bring the title to north London for the first time since 2004. Five points divide them and second-placed Manchester City, though Pep Guardiola's side have a match in hand, with the title battle poised to go down to the wire.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Diego Simeone's side booked their spot in the last-16 following a 7-4 aggregate triumph over Club Brugge.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe first leg had been a thrilling 3-3 draw but Atletico demolished the Belgians 4-1 in the second leg. Turkish giants Galatasaray nearly saw their Champions League ambitions extinguished as they were forced to net twice in extra time to overcome Juventus 7-5 on aggregate, despite going into the second leg with a 5-2 advantage.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

However, neither offers a straightforward route to the Champions League quarter-final. Here, Mirror Football examines the six-time European Champions' potential nightmare scenario.\n\nAtletico Madrid\n\nShould Liverpool meet Atletico it will mark the second occasion the sides have clashed this season. Goals from Mohamed Salah, Andy Robertson and a late winner from Virgil van Dijk secured the Reds' 3-2 victory over Atletico in a tense encounter at Anfield in September.\n\nHowever, it was a tie notable for a breakdown from Atletico boss Simeone that resulted in him being dismissed by the referee. After defeating Brugge, Simeone even insisted he is \"not thinking about Liverpool\" with a potentially uncomfortable reunion now on the horizon as the notoriously combative Argentinian seeks revenge against the Reds.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMan Utd and Liverpool avoid breaches as PSR status of every Premier League club emerges READ MORE :\n\nChampions League last-16 draw was declared void after huge error occurred READ MORE :\n\nOverall, Liverpool have faced Atletico nine times since 2008. The Reds have triumphed in four of those encounters, drawn two and been defeated three times.\n\nThe positive news for Liverpool is that Atletico are struggling in La Liga this season, having suffered five defeats and drawn six in 25 matches. Simeone's team finished 14th in the Champions League league-phase, losing three, drawing once and winning four.\n\nView 4 Images Diego Simeone was sent off against Liverpool earlier this season (Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhilst Liverpool might not be confronting a classic Atletico outfit, it remains a side driven by unpredictable forwards in the form of Alexander Sorloth, who netted a hat-trick against Brugge, the highly-sought-after Julian Alvarez and veteran Frenchman Antoine Griezmann.\n\nNot forgetting midfielder Marcos Llorente, who has remarkably found the net four times against Liverpool in as many fixtures. Most significantly, and somewhat forebodingly for Slot, Simeone's side have knocked out Liverpool on the two occasions the clubs have clashed in European knockout competition.\n\nIn 2020 with Liverpool then under Jurgen Klopp, Atletico saw off the Reds 4-2 on aggregate, despite Liverpool dominating their opponents at Anfield.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn April 2010, the Spanish titans broke red hearts once more. Atletico netted a late away goal at Anfield in the Europa League semi-finals, causing Liverpool, then under Rafael Benitez, to crash out of the tournament.\n\nGalatasaray\n\nLiverpool have faced the Turkish powerhouse five times in European competition. The Reds have only triumphed in one of those matches, losing two and drawing two.\n\nJust like with Atletico, the Reds have already faced Galatasaray this season, suffering a frustrating defeat at the Ali Sami Yen in September by a single goal - a penalty slotted home by Victor Osimhen.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Victor Osimhen celebrates after Galatasaray's victory over Liverpool (Image: Getty Images)\n\nYou would need to rewind to 2006 to find Liverpool's last victory over the Turkish team. That was a 3-2 win at the Ataturk Stadium with Liverpool then reigning as European Champions under Benitez. Much like the Spanish giants, Okan Buruk's squad boasts an array of striking options that will intimidate any defence.\n\nThis season, Mauro Icardi, Osimhen, Burak Yilmaz and Leroy Sane have amassed 34 goals between them, demonstrating that whatever forward line Buruk selects, the threat is present.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Turkish side also top the Super Lig standings by two points but concluded the Champions League league phase in a disappointing 20th place.\n\nWho would Liverpool rather avoid?\n\nIt's a tough call, quite simply. Atletico likely represent the more challenging tie, due to their fiery temperament, range of attacking talent, and not to mention, typically solid defence.\n\nView 4 Images Julian Alvarez is a threat for Atletico Madrid (Image: Europa Press via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe history between the two clubs, now enhanced by Simeone's red card last September, will also add spice to any potential tie. The fact Atletico have triumphed over Liverpool on every occasion the two have met in a European knockout encounter suggests the odds are in their favour too.\n\nIf this is combined with Liverpool's patchy form this season then it's probable the Reds would prefer to face Galatasaray when the draw is made come Friday.\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE!

Liverpool saw off an AC Milan side filled with superstars as they came from 3-0 down to win the tie on penalties.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThen managed by Rafael Benitez, the Anfield outfit clinched their fifth European Cup against Carlo Ancelotti's side. Carragher's wife, Nicola, told The Telegraph how her husband's new-found level of fame after the victory meant all eyes were on them, and their children, James and Mia, wherever they went.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"When the kids were little, Liverpool won the Champions League and James was made player of the year. He was a very recognisable face and that did affect me a bit,\" she admitted.\n\n\"If we were out in public I was always worried that people were looking at us. I felt shy, embarrassed. I remember being in a restaurant and he was messing about with the kids, pulling faces, hiding under the table, making a right fool of himself.\"\n\nHowever, regardless of any media intrusion, Nicola claimed the Sky Sports pundit's primary concern is his family. She said: \"As long as the kids were happy, he didn’t care what anybody thought.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"What I can tell you is he is without doubt the best dad in the world,\" she added. \"Yes, there have been times when he has done things he regrets, but so have I. If the world focused on every stupid thing that you did or I did, we’d be in trouble.\"\n\nThe game dubbed as 'the miracle of Istanbul' was the major turning point for several Liverpool players at the time. While many had basked in the glory of the treble-winning season of 2001, where the Reds picked up the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup, winning the Champions League in such dramatic fashion thrust the likes of Carragher into the limelight like never before.\n\n4 View 4 Images Jamie and Nicola have been together for almost 30 years (Image: Instagram/23_carra) 4 View 4 Images Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard kissing the European Cup in 2005 (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror in 2020 Carragher opened up on how Liverpool's fifth European Cup triumph changed his life. \"It’s funny how those great European triumphs are known by the city where they took place. As a kid, for me it was Rotterdam, with Everton. Rome ’77. [Manchester] United have Barcelona... Not ‘the Bayern game,’ but ­Barcelona,\" he said.\n\n\"Istanbul, though. It’s somehow even more powerful. It’s our city and our club. Just the word makes you feel lucky to have been part of it. An honour and a ­privilege.\n\n\"It’s the one moment in my career I’d love to go back to. That moment of realisation, and then release. I ran towards Jerzy [Ex-Liverpool goalkeeper, Dudek] and was the first one there. But there was no way I could stop and hug someone. I needed to keep running, jumping, ­shouting, screaming.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I couldn’t have bottled that up. It was just an energy rush that had to come out. I carried on around the track, couldn’t have stood still with the players, had to get involved in the crowd. It’s just a pity I didn’t get that energy in the first half.\"\n\nView 4 Images Jamie Carragher has raised two children with wife Nicola. (Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA, Getty Images)\n\nElaborating on how the game brought the club closer to the fans, he said: \"We had a great night in the hotel after the game, with the lads, the chairman and the manager giving speeches. But when we got back to Liverpool for the homecoming was the real celebration.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE! Latest Reds news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n\"The final was on a Wednesday and I kept drinking until the Sunday night! I was with people back home who couldn’t make it to the game but still had so many stories, and I’m probably more interested in how they felt.\n\n\"I think it’s one of those games – it’s for the people of the city, not the players. The whole city had a glow to it, a bounce in the step for six months.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our LFC WhatsApp community and get all the latest LFC news, views, transfer gossip and more, as it happens We also treat our community members to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

The Gunners delivered the perfect response to their recent wobble by thrashing Tottenham last weekend.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nViktor Gyokeres and Eberechi Eze both scored twice to secure a 4-1 triumph just four days after Arsenal were rocked by a 2-2 draw at Wolves. The dropped points at Molineux led to questions about their title mentality. However, their performance against Spurs - which took them five points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League - went some way to silencing the doubters.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNext up is a Chelsea side battling to secure Champions League football in another season of upheaval at Stamford Bridge, with Liam Rosenior replacing the sacked Enzo Maresca. Mirror Football brings you a round-up of the latest Arsenal news…\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGyokeres demand\n\nGyokeres has been told he needs to do more against Arsenal's main rivals. The Swede's rollercoaster debut season with the Gunners took a turn in the right direction with his brace in the north London derby.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

Gyokeres hasn't found the net against the Manchester clubs or Liverpool this season, although Limpar accepts his team-mates have a role to play in that too.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nArsenal told team that can stop them winning the Champions League ahead of last 16 draw READ MORE :\n\nThe former winger told Bettingsidor.se : \"He's struggling in some games because players like Saka, Trossard and Odegaard don't look to find Viktor. They haven't quite worked each other out yet, so he's struggled.\n\n\"When he gets more of the ball, his touch is good and he wants to receive it, so I think Arsenal have to find Viktor more, even when playing Liverpool or Manchester City, who are the top teams.\n\nFOLLOW OUR ARSENAL FB PAGE! Latest Gunners news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"When playing an awful defensive team like Tottenham, he looked really, really good. So they have to be patient and see what he can do against Chelsea and build on that.\n\n\"It’s not heaven or hell here. We have to be patient and let him grow into the team. For some players, it takes a little longer, but he was unbelievable against Spurs.\"\n\nView 2 Images Ben White could be on his way out of Arsenal in the summer (Image: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhite replacement option\n\nArsenal are reportedly among a clutch of clubs interested in Eintracht Frankfurt right-back Nnamdi Collins. With Ben White playing second fiddle to Jurrien Timber and potentially on his way out of the club this summer, the Gunners are on the lookout for a potential long-term replacement.\n\nCollins has been catching the eye with his performances, establishing himself as one of the Bundesliga's most promising defenders. Arsenal are not the only club interested in the 22-year-old, who, like White, can also operate in the heart of defence.\n\nManchester City, Newcastle, Brentford and Brighton are also watching Collins, reports TEAMtalk. Meanwhile, White, 28, who cost the Gunners £50million when he arrived from Brighton in 2021, has been linked with a move to Barcelona, per reports in Spanish media.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

George has got the team around him. Kimi [Antonelli] will be stronger this year in the other car, but George is completely out of Lewis [Hamilton]'s shadow there, he's the king of the castle at Mercedes-Benz.\n\n\"He did all those years at Williams and then he went to Mercedes when they just stopped dominating, so he's done the hard yards.\n\n\"I think he's got the experience, he's got the car control, and I think he will command the respect in the team to help drive what's going to be an incredibly changeable year.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Craig Slater and Martin Brundle review and rank all the F1 teams after pre-season testing\n\nSpeaking during an appearance on Sky Sports News, Brundle added: \"I think his team-mate Kimi Antonelli will have a great season as well, but George has got all the confidence he needs to win races and to go and win a championship, if it's available to him.\n\n\"We questioned that with Lando [Norris] last year, and Oscar [Piastri] too, whether they would wilt under pressure from Max [Verstappen], and they didn't.\n\n\"I think George is in a very good place.\"\n\nAsked how Russell would handle any increased intra-Mercedes challenge from team-mate Kimi Antonelli, the 19-year-old Italian entering his second year of F1, Brundle added: \"Remember, [Russell] grew up in Lewis Hamilton's shadow at Mercedes, and he handled that, and eventually in the final year they were team-mates, he beat Lewis clearly.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Russell admits his two starts in Bahrain have been 'worse' than his worst-ever start in Formula 1\n\n\"So, I have no doubts about him whatsoever. They're all world-class drivers in F1, you've got to beat them somehow.\n\n\"I think George has got so much experience now despite not being 30 yet, that I don't think anything will distract him if he's got a championship-winning car.\"\n\n'No clear favourite' - Brundle expects open 'big-four' battle\n\nWhile Mercedes may be favourites for both titles heading into the 24-race campaign, Brundle believes they will face a challenge from all three of their established rivals on the evidence of the three winter tests.\n\n\"I see Ferrari being strong, I see both Ferrari drivers being strong,\" said Brundle.\n\n\"I think both McLaren drivers will be strong as well. Oscar will come back on a mission after what he learned last year; Lando, I don't think I've ever seen him yet not with that big grin on his face so far this year, he's just got that comfort now.\n\n\"The Red Bull looks really strong, and we know how Max's car control, which you'll need with these cars, will be incredible.\n\n\"So, for me, there's not a clear favourite.\"\n\nWatch every race of the 2026 Formula 1 season live on Sky Sports, starting with the Australian Grand Prix from March 6-8.

            "content": "Football's lawmakers are expected to discuss the idea of a new five-second time limit for goal-kicks and throw-ins, which could put an end to the current long-throw trend in the Premier League.\n\nThey are also expected to increase the scope of VAR to include decisions on second yellow cards, when they meet in Wales on Saturday - with further proposals to crack down on time-wasting also on the agenda.\n\nIf a new five-second time limit is introduced for goal-kicks and throw-ins, it is thought that would effectively mean an end to the increasing trend in the Premier League and EFL for teams to use long-throws as an attacking tactic.\n\nThe International Football Association Board (IFAB) which is made up of the English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish FAs together with FIFA, holds its AGM each spring. Only at this meeting can the laws of the game be amended, and they then have to be applied worldwide.\n\nHowever, the IFAB board may decide to trial some law changes rather than introduce them permanently, with those laws made optional for individual competitions to consider implementing. While any law changes will not come into effect until July 1 (so, effectively for the start of the next domestic football season) it is likely that FIFA will choose to introduce some of them, as a trial, during this summer's World Cup in North America.\n\nMonterosa Monterosa , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Enable Cookies Allow Cookies Once\n\nInsiders think the VAR change to include second yellow cards will be passed without much opposition, meaning incorrect decisions like the one which saw Wily Boly sent off for Nottingham Forest last season against Bournemouth could be overturned by the officials in Stockley Park.\n\nCurrently, the VAR is not allowed to look at whether a second yellow card is valid or not.\n\nMore controversially, IFAB will also discuss whether the VAR can adjudicate over whether a corner should be awarded or not.\n\nIt is thought FIFA is in favour of this move, and may look to introduce it for the World Cup, although the home nations are generally more opposed to the idea, Sky Sports News has been told, for fear it will lead to more unpopular match interruptions for fans. Currently, the Premier League has the lowest intervention rates for VAR of any of the 'big five' European leagues.\n\nFA chief executive Mark Bullingham has spoken publicly about his dislike for the idea, but Pierluigi Collina, FIFA's head of referees, is a strong advocate, arguing that VAR would only get involved in corners where there has been a clear and obvious error.\n\nThere is widespread belief in the game that the introduction of the 'eight-second rule' for goalkeepers has been a success in cracking down on time-wasting - largely because there have been very few incidents this season where a 'keeper has held the ball for more than eight seconds, and a corner has been awarded to the opponent as a result.\n\nBecause of that success, IFAB will discuss further measures to speed up stoppages in play.\n\nHow would the 'five-second' rule work?\n\nProposals include introducing a new 'five-second rule' for goal-kicks and throw-ins, whereby a player will have only a very short time to get the game back under way again, or face a penalty. If they go beyond the five seconds, the throw-in would be reversed and awarded to the opponent, and a goal-kick would become a corner for the attacking side.\n\nSome insiders have suggested that five seconds is too short a time for players to adhere to, and others fear long throws would be impossible to organise in that time-frame.\n\nSome referees are also likely to be concerned that, if they have to do visual countdowns for goalkeepers with the ball in-hand, and also for throw-ins and goal-kicks, that could cause too much distraction from their other match-ruling functions.\n\nOther laws on the IFAB agenda include the mandatory 30 seconds that a player must remain off the pitch once they have received treatment for an injury on it.\n\nThere is a proposal that this time should be doubled to one minute, to help player welfare, but also to act as a further deterrent to would-be time-wasters. Similarly, a time limit for substitutions could be introduced to try to help further speed up the game.\n\nAgain, the feeling among the home nations FAs seems to be that the 30-second rule for players receiving treatment is working effectively at present, and so there may be some resistance to this law being introduced, we are told.\n\nEach law change, after discussion, will be put to the vote on Saturday. There needs to be a 75 per cent majority for any proposal to be passed. Each of the home nation FAs has one vote each, with FIFA having four votes, meaning six of the eight votes has to be in favour, for a law to be amended."

            "content": "Nottingham Forest survived a scare from Fenerbahce to book their Europa League last-16 place, winning 4-2 on aggregate despite a 2-1 defeat at the City ground in Thursday's second leg.\n\nVitor Pereira had the luxury of rotation for the knockout play-off tie, having already won 3-0 in Istanbul last week, but the difference in performances could not have been more vast.\n\nForest were the architects of their own difficulties too, and made a seemingly simple task monumentally harder.\n\nThey were first punished in the 22nd minute when Fenerbahce's ruthless break saw Kerem Akturkoglu sweep home to hand the visitors a lifeline.\n\nIt gave Fenerbahce real confidence, with Akturkoglu and Sidiki Cherif squandering glorious chances to level up the tie in the first half.\n\nImage: The game was stopped mere seconds after kick-off after Fenerbahce fans threw flares onto the pitch\n\nForest players forced to dodge Fenerbahce fireworks Forest players were forced to dodge fireworks thrown on to the pitch by Fenerbahce fans.\n\n\n\nMoments after the match kicked off, there was a three-minute delay as sections of a 1,500-strong away end launched several fireworks on to the pitch into the Forest penalty area.\n\n\n\nJair Cunha had to take evasive action as he had his back to them and Neco Williams also had to duck as he tried to carry one away.\n\n\n\nFenerbahce's Archie Brown also had to intervene and carry some of the pyrotechnics off the pitch while urging calm from his side’s fans.\n\nAfter 45 minutes with no shots on target, high turnovers and losing duels, Pereira made four half-time changes - something he called \"difficult\" after the game - bringing on Callum Hudson-Odoi, Igor Jesus, Ola Aina and Ibrahim Sangare.\n\nBut seconds into the second half, another clumsy moment handed Fenerbahce a penalty. Jair Cunha stuck a foot out to catch Akturkoglu and, after a VAR check, the on-field decision stood.\n\nImage: Fenerbahce's Kerem Akturkoglu scores his opener against Nottingham Forest\n\nIt was the forward who stepped up and easily slotted home his second of the evening to give the Turkish side real hope of levelling up on aggregate.\n\nBut Forest soon settled into their rhythm as the substitutes worked their magic, even if the approach of careful possession - as they have done so well in their two games under Pereira so far - did little to calm the nerves of the home fans.\n\nImage: Nottingham Forest's Callum Hudson-Odoi scored at the City Ground on Thursday\n\nAnd as the unhappy whistles began, Forest answered. It was two substitutes who combined as Aina's swinging cross found Hudson-Odoi over on the left of the area. He then sped past his defender before hammering home his first European goal of the season into the far corner.\n\nThe relief was palpable around the City Ground, and it took the remaining puff out of injury-hit Fenerbahce. Forest are now in the draw for Friday's last-16 draw, and will face either Real Betis or FC Midtjylland.\n\nTeam news headlines Only five Nottingham Forest players survived from the weekend's 1-0 defeat to Liverpool - those were Stefan Ortega, Murillo, Neco Williams, Elliot Anderson and Omari Hutchinson.\n\nFenerbache have an injury-hit squad, and only named five outfield players on their bench. The likes of Ederson and Milan Skriniar were among the absentees.\n\nPereira: Changing six players was a risk\n\nNottingham Forest head coach Vitor Pereira: \"When you change half of a team, it's not easy to keep the level, that's my responsibility because we have an important game in three days. By my decision, I try to manage the next game and recover some players. It's not easy. It will change a lot.\n\n\"We are in the moment of the season that we need to think not about one game, but about two games, about the next game. It was a risk because I decided to make six changes in the team. If you have one or two changes the players can be in the middle of the others, and you don't miss the quality.\n\n\"But when you change six players they aren't used to playing 90 minutes. This is the risk and I decide to take this risk. I decide because I need to think about the Brighton game, because it's very important for us. We need to go there with fuel and energy.\n\n\"We conceded a goal and lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at half-time, but I said to the players it's my decision. The game was a dangerous situation for us. They start the second half by scoring the second goal and after we start to play and create.\n\n\"We have a big chance to score the second goal. Ok, this is important to keep in our mind. I know they came here to fight for the result.\"\n\nOn learnings: \"Even for me. If you change five players you don't know what will happen. When the pressure starts to come, under stress it's difficult to be themselves when you don't play every match. In the end, we are in the competition so let's move forward and think about Brighton.\"\n\nVitor Pereira has become the second Nottingham Forest manager this season to lose his first two home games in charge, along with Ange Postecoglou. He's now lost four in a row at home in all competitions (also his last two at Wolves), his worst-ever run as a manager.\n\nHudson-Odoi: We made it difficult for ourselves\n\nImage: Hudson-Odoi scored his first European goal of the season against Fenerbahce\n\nNottingham Forest goalscorer Callum Hudson-Odoi to TNT Sports: \"We made it difficult for ourselves. When you're in the lead and sometimes you can feel a bit comfortable, but we showed a great reaction after they scored the second goal.\n\n\"We wanted to score, which we did. It's important that we're through even if we didn't get the result on the night.\"\n\nOn what Forest needed to do in the second half: \"We needed to up the levels a bit more and focus on what we know is best - that's us on the ball, playing a high press and going to win the ball up high.\n\n\"It was unfortunate to score a second goal straight away in the second half but we reacted very well.\n\n\"In situations like that where they're getting a couple of goals, you've got to calm the game down. They're trying to chase the game, but we had to do what we know best - keep the ball, create more chances and hope to get a goal.\n\n\"When we got the goal, it gave us more breathing space to attack more. We've just got to keep working hard and push ourselves to get results.\"\n\nOn facing either Real Betis or Midtjylland in the last 16: \"No matter who comes, we're going to be prepared and ready for the game.\"\n\nAlthough they have now reached the Europa League last 16 stage, Nottingham Forest have suffered two home defeats in a single major European season for the first time (also lost 2-3 to FC Midtjylland in October).\n\n\n\nFenerbahce registered just their second European away win in England in all competitions (D2 L7), with this their first since beating Man Utd 1-0 in the UEFA Champions League in October 1996.\n\nWhat is the Europa League schedule?\n\nRound of 16 draw: 27 February, 12pm\n\nRound of 16: 12 & 19 March 2026\n\nQuarter-finals: 9 & 16 April 2026\n\nSemi-finals: 30 April & 7 May 2026\n\nFinal: 20 May 2026 (Istanbul)"

            "content": "Evann Guessand scored again late on as under-pressure Oliver Glasner watched his Crystal Palace side beat Zrinjski Mostar 2-0 at Selhurst Park to secure a 3-1 aggregate win in the UEFA Conference League and secure passage into the last 16.\n\nAlong with the help of a Maxence Lacroix header Palace now look forward to Friday's draw, where they will find out whether they take on Mainz or AEK Larnaca in the next round.\n\nBack-to-back wins for Palace for the first time since December should guarantee that Glasner remains in position for Palace's trip to Manchester United this weekend after he fanned the flames of speculation around a premature exit this week.\n\nPalace laboured in the early exchanges as they looked to open the scoring and Lacroix's 36th-minute header, teed up by a superb Adam Wharton ball from a set-piece, was their only effort on target in the first period. The goal, though, lifted an otherwise lacklustre Selhurst atmosphere with spots of empty seats reflective of a collective apathy in south London.\n\nPlayer ratings: Crystal Palace: Henderson (6), Munoz (6), Lacroix (7), Richards (6), Canvot (6), Mitchell (6), Wharton (8), Kamada (7), Sarr (6), Guessand (8), Strand Larsen (6)\n\n\n\nSubs: Hughes (6), Johnson (6)\n\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Wharton\n\nWhile quality was lacking, Palace continued to push a Zrinjski side who had failed to score and therefore win in any of their Conference League games away from home this season.\n\nIsmaila Sarr was denied by opposition goalkeeper Goran Karacic in a one on one as he spurned one of his several chances, as Palace's endeavour proved more than their quality as the game wore on.\n\nHowever, after Tomi Juric had Palace hearts in their mouths late on as he sent a header wide, Guessand ran through and wrapped up the victory in injury time.\n\nWhat's happening in Friday's draw?\n\nThe Conference League last-16 draw will take place on Friday at 1pm UK time in Nyon, Switzerland.\n\nThe draw will confirm the last-16 ties and also allocate a side of the bracket for every team so they know who they could potentially meet in the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final.\n\nEach of the play-off winners face the sides that finished in the top eight (seeded teams) in the league phase.\n\nPalace will play the second leg of the tie against either Larnaca or Mainz away from home.\n\nGlasner: I've been given assurance of staying but sometimes we don't enjoy the noise\n\nCrystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner played down suggestions of a premature Selhurst Park exit but says he has not enjoyed the backlash during his side's difficult spell.\n\nSpeaking to TNT Sports, he said: \"I've had 100-per-cent assurance [of staying on]. For me, the number one is the players, the players believing in the staff and I - and that's the most important thing, otherwise you can pack your suitcase and go home.\n\n\"They have a great togetherness in the group, the staff and it's the same with the chairman and sporting director.\n\n\"They are sometimes wondering - it's the second-best Premier League season ever.\n\n\"The best was last year, so maybe the best two in Palace's history, playing European football for the first time, and there is so much noise so sometimes we really don't understand it.\n\n\"Maybe I gave some interviews which were not really helpful, I have to admit, but I always say what I am feeling and sometimes it's positive, sometimes it's not so positive.\n\n\"That's Oliver Glasner, and in the end, we are in a very good position in the league and now it's up to us with our fans to make a really good season of it.\"\n\nStimac: Palace are my favourites to win the Conference League!\n\nZrinjski Mostar boss Igor Stimac says Crystal Palace are his pick to go on and win the Conference League.\n\n\"Congratulations to Crystal Palace,\" he said.\n\n\"Looking at the teams which are left there. As far as I'm concerned, they are one of the top three favourites in this competition. I wish them the best of luck to win the competition and to go all the way through.\"\n\nQuizzed further on who his top three are, Simac added: \"Crystal Palace is my favourite. Mainz is the second one. I would say we played against them already. And they have an enormous quality in their team also. They have wonderful support and a really, really well-balanced team. Dangerous from each part, each position.\""

            "content": "1 Emery seeks to end Wolves duck\n\nUnai Emery has seen most things in this game but he has never won at Wolves. In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three away games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on a direct rival. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season. Will Unwin\n\nBournemouth v Sunderland, Saturday 12.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Back in business: Granit Xhaka looks set to give Sunderland a timely boost. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in match-day chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) and sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL translators will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here. Andy Hunter\n\nLiverpool v West Ham, Saturday 3pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Liverpool fans sing You’ll Never Walk Alone before kick-off at Anfield. Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images\n\n5 Centre stage for Gordon against old club\n\nNewcastle may be in the last 16 of the Champions League but they are also 11th in the Premier League, two places and one point behind Saturday’s visitors to St James’ Park, Everton. “We’ve raised our game at times in the Champions League, there’s no denying that,” says Eddie Howe. “But we want to get into Europe every season and we’re desperate to get our Premier League form back on track. We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track following a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croatian’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to firstly avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance. WU\n\nFulham v Tottenham, Sunday 2pm\n\nView image in fullscreen João Palhinha (left) battles with Leandro Trossard during an uncomfortable afternoon in the north London derby. Photograph: Ian Walton/AP\n\n9 Amad to make way for Sesko?\n\nFor Michael Carrick to find a fall guy for Benjamin Sesko, who is seeking a first start under him, the interim manager need look no further than Amad Diallo. The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge for the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes following the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "For 67 minutes, Nottingham Forest were at risk of matching an unwanted record. At that point Fenerbahce were 2-0 up and full of belief that they could achieve the miracle their head coach, Domenico Tedesco, had been manifesting since their 3-0 first-leg defeat in Istanbul.\n\nOnly one team in the history of European club competitions have lost the first leg of a tie by a three-goal margin at home and advanced in the second. Up in the directors’ box, Evangelos Marinakis, more than an interested party on that occasion, presumably had flashbacks of Olympiakos suffering a 4-1 home defeat by Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Conference League two years ago, only to triumph 6-1 in Serbia in the second leg.\n\nKerem Akturkoglu scored twice to fuel Fenerbahce’s hopes, his second from the penalty spot almost immediately after the half-time restart, but the Forest substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi struck midway through the second half to extinguish the visitors’ dreams. Forest will learn on Friday whether they will face Midtjylland or Real Betis, both of whom they played in the league phase and could not beat, in the last 16. Fenerbahce’s hopes of reaching the Europa League showpiece in May, across town in Besiktas Stadium, are over.\n\nThe way this game was set up, an early Fenerbahce goal was always going to shift the dynamic of the tie and the Turkish side got one when Akturkoglu applied the finishing touch to a counterattack. Vítor Pereira acknowledged the worst mistake Forest could make was to assume their place in the last 16 was secure and his much-changed side were disjointed and sloppy. “It was a thriller – with suspense,” Pereira said. “We had to suffer.”\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate. Agencies Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nIt was a long first half from a Forest perspective. The flares thrown on to the pitch by the Fenerbahce supporters within 30 seconds of kick-off paused the game for a couple of minutes. Murillo, who opened the scoring in style in Turkey, was uncomfortable and erratic after being shunted across to left-back, with fellow Brazilians Morato and Jair Cunha doing little to inspire confidence at centre-back. Luckily, Stefan Ortega, one of five Forest players to keep their spots, was alert in goal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elliot Anderson shoots narrowly wide against Fenerbahce in the first half. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nForest were in an awkward spot from the moment Dorgeles Nene released Sidiki Cherif down the right channel in the 22nd minute and suddenly it was two v two. Cherif squared the ball for Akturkoglu and, while Neco Williams got a touch after sliding in desperation, the Forest full-back then lost his footing and now the Fenerbahce forward just had Ortega to beat. Pereira scratched his head as the away end went ballistic.\n\nPereira attempted to stem the bleeding with a quadruple half-time substitution, introducing Hudson-Odoi, Ola Aina, Igor Jesus and Ibrahim Sangaré. Yet just 25 seconds after the restart, the Italian referee, Maurizio Mariani, pointed to the penalty spot after Akturkoglu collapsed in the box. Jair Cunha appeared to make little contact with the Fenerbahce striker but was deemed to have tripped Akturkoglu, who made the most of a clumsy challenge and stepped up from 12 yards to beat Ortega.\n\nThe changes lifted Forest but Pereira was always going to rest players with Sunday’s trip to Brighton their fourth game in 11 days. “We need to go there with fuel,” said the Forest head coach. “When you change half of the team it is not easy to keep the level. I didn’t expect a fantastic game after changing so many players. After we conceded the first goal, we lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at the same time but we needed to do it because the game came into a dangerous situation for us.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Fenerbahce fans threw flares on to the pitch and delayed the first half. Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPA\n\nAfter the penalty, Fenerbahce raced the ball back to the centre circle. Game on? Forest were faced with exactly the kind of scenario they must have dreaded, though the fear seemed to galvanise them. Jair Cunha and Nicolás Domínguez both fired shots at goal and Williams sent a swerving effort wide.\n\nForest commanded greater control and Pereira cut a relieved figure as his side re-established a two-goal aggregate buffer, a pair of substitutes combining to devastating effect. Aina chipped the ball towards the back post where Hudson-Odoi controlled brilliantly, twisted past Nelson Semedo, a half-time arrival himself, and prodded his shot into the far corner.\n\nPereira punched the air with both fists and the underlying tensions evaporated. Forest, for so long fraught with nerves, could finally rejoice. “We lost the chance to qualify at home in Kadikoy,” Tedesco said. “They most probably over-performed in our stadium and we underperformed. We leave the competition with our heads held high.”"

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final European fixture as a manager. He created such wonderful memories for Celtic’s support in this domain during his first tenure that departing with a smile felt appropriate. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts. “The evening is nothing to do with me,” said O’Neill with needless self-deprecation.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal inside 30 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered unexpected cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half – the hosts had 24 attempts at goal – but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that is worthy of huge credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have delivered a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite either set of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday at the start of a spell that will define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart had managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ragged and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe only goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. “I got carried away with myself,” O’Neill said later. “I thought ‘we are going to do this here’.”\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate.

The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm clash. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident been as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were only 25 minutes from that maiden win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly cancelled for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious as Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement albeit the officials had ushered him back on to the pitch. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "It is a peculiarity particular to Crystal Palace that a season of such upheaval and unrest could still end up with Oliver Glasner’s side winning another trophy. Having left the pitch after last week’s first leg with supporters calling for the Austrian manager to be sacked in the morning, Maxence Lacroix and Evann Guessand made it a much more harmonious evening for Glasner and his side.\n\nAfter being fortunate to escape from last week’s trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina with a 1-1 draw, it could have been very different if Zrinjski Mostar had equalised just before Guessand settled the tie late on. But having been demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League after winning the FA Cup last season, Palace’s first European campaign will continue against either the Cypriot side Larnaca – who they lost to during the group stages – or Mainz from Germany in the last 16.\n\n“There is so much noise, so sometimes we really don’t understand it, but maybe I gave some interviews that were not really helpful, I have to admit,” said Glasner in reference to his comments after the first leg when he told fans to “stay humble”.\n\n“I just had to express it otherwise I would have exploded. I can’t do it differently. If I feel something, I have to say it. Then I have to face the shitstorm. Everyone hopefully knows everything I say and do is for the best of Crystal Palace.”\n\nPalace rejected a request from the supporters’ group responsible for the banner directed against Glasner and the club’s board in their last match against Wolves to turn off the music so they could “back the team during the pre-match warm-up” on the grounds that Uefa’s regulations wouldn’t allow it.\n\nBut the presence of a large group of travelling supporters who took up position two hours before kick-off helped to create a decent atmosphere despite a large number of empty seats in the home sections. “40 quid? Palace fans fleeced = empty seats,” read the latest message that was displayed by the Holmesdale Fanatics during the first half.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16.

Guessand, who was starting for only the second time since his loan move from Aston Villa after scoring the decisive goal against Wolves, could not take advantage of a mix-up between the goalkeeper Goran Karacic and Igor Savic before the latter blocked Daichi Kamada’s goalbound shot.\n\nView image in fullscreen Crystal Palace fans display a banner protesting against ticket prices. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nThe Palace fans were starting to get on the Portuguese referee’s back after a series of decisions went against their side, with Jaydee Canvot and Strand Larsen both cautioned.\n\nBut in a season where defending set pieces has proved to be a major weakness, Glasner punched the air in delight when Adam Wharton’s pinpoint free-kick was headed in by Lacroix.\n\nThe England midfielder has been showing signs of fatigue in recent weeks but is still capable of providing real quality, as well as the occasional mistake. It was Wharton’s slip that allowed Leo Mikic a first sight of goal for Zrinjski just before half-time but his shot was jeered as it sailed wide.\n\nWharton was withdrawn not long after he had been shown a yellow card for a high boot, with Glasner revealing afterwards that the fourth official had warned he was close to a second booking. “Him and Will Hughes are rotating themselves by fouling too much,” he said.\n\nIsmaïla Sarr headed well over from Tyrick Mitchell’s cross in a rare sight of goal as another of Palace’s issues this season – struggling to break down teams employing a low block – returned. Their best chance of extending the lead was from another set piece and Chris Richards should have done better from close range on two occasions from a couple of Kamada free-kicks.\n\nView image in fullscreen Evann Guessand doubles Crystal Palace’s lead in stoppage time. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThere was a warning for Palace that the tie wasn’t over when Zrinjski had a goal correctly ruled out for offside with 25 minutes still to play. Yet it was the hosts who should have wrapped up the victory as the chances came thick and fast. Guessand had a golden opportunity to settle it but saw his shot saved by Karacic and Sarr was also guilty of missing two chances that looked easier to score.\n\nZrinjski’s big moment came in the second minute of injury time but the substitute Tomi Juric could only head over before Guessand finally made sure to send Palace into the next round."

            "content": "Chelsea made a financial loss of £355m in the 2024-25 season, according to new data released by Uefa, the biggest deficit ever recorded by an English football club.\n\nAccording to Uefa, Chelsea’s losses were more than double the ­second-worst in Europe, the £171m posted by Lyon. The figures are also about £260m worse than those posted by the Blues in 2023-24.\n\nWhile Uefa’s report does not fully break down Chelsea’s figures, it does show that while they have spent money on a level with the top clubs in Europe, costs have not been matched by revenues. Chelsea’s wage bill is estimated to be the sixth highest in Europe, at £390m a season. Chelsea’s operational expenditure, or day-to-day costs, were the fifth highest in Europe, meanwhile, at £241m. Uefa also calculates that the Blues have the most expensive squad in history, assembled at a combined cost of over £1.5bn.\n\nIn terms of matchday revenue, however, Chelsea made a reported £1.2m less per game than Liverpool, with Stamford Bridge only the 10th biggest ground in last season’s ­Premier League. Commercial revenue fell year-on-year to £207m, about £165m less than the figure reported by Manchester City and at odds with an overall trend for growth in this area. Chelsea did, though, increase their broadcast revenues, from £167m to £193m thanks in large part to their success at the Club World Cup.\n\nChelsea’s finances have been the subject of debate since the club was taken over by the investment vehicle BlueCo in 2021. The men’s team has largely gone without a front-of-shirt sponsor in the intervening years, while the club have also become known for tying their players to long-term contracts, such as the eight-year deal given to the winger Mykhailo Mudryk, reported to be worth £100,000-a-week. The Ukrainian is serving a provisional ­suspension for doping.\n\nThe ownership have also sold hotels on the club’s grounds to related businesses in order to meet the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules.\n\nAlso on the list of Europe’s ­biggest financial losers are Strasbourg. Ranking at No 8 in Uefa’s list, with reported losses of £69m, the Ligue 1 side are also owned by BlueCo and have spent increasingly substantial figures on transfer fees in the past three seasons. Many of those deals have been struck with Chelsea, including nine transfers from London in this season alone."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says the salvage operation he has taken on at Tottenham is tougher than he envisaged and most likely his hardest job in management.\n\nThe interim coach, who is preparing for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Fulham, has worked with his new squad since the beginning of last week, having replaced the sacked Thomas Frank. Tudor lost his first game 4-1 at home to Arsenal on Sunday, which left Spurs four points above the relegation zone.\n\nAn alarming fitness situation has improved slightly with the return to training of Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso, meaning Tudor will be without eight injured players at Fulham, plus the suspended Cristian Romero, though Micky van de Ven is expected to be fit.\n\nSpurs are without a win in nine league matches and Tudor’s eyes are wide open about the scale of the task. “Probably, yes … I agree with you,” Tudor said when asked whether the role was more difficult than expected.\n\n“It’s very tough … but it is how it is. So daily work, focus, raising in all things we need to do – physical condition, mental confidence, performance – and waiting for the [injured] players to come back.”\n\nTudor started work as a manager in 2013 and is now in his 12th job. Is Spurs the biggest challenge? “Probably,” he said. “If I recognise the difficulties there are, probably, yes. It’s an even bigger challenge, an even bigger motivation to do this and we do it.”\n\nTudor described Spurs’ plight before the Arsenal game as an “emergency situation” and he warmed to the theme before another derby. “It’s not looking to the style at this moment,” he said. “Because now it’s a question of life and death.\n\n“There is not too much time to think about performance or style. Every game needs to be prepared in that way. How we can take these points, one way or the other?\n\n“In Italy, they use the term ‘have the mentality of a small team’. That is the key, to always have motivation when you play big teams. So that’s the start, of course, and we work a lot on that. The players are aware of the situation.”\n\nLike Frank before him, Tudor refused to use the R word – relegation. “I never used it but not because it’s something too scary or it’s a danger word or we won’t sleep,” he said. “It’s about that we need to refocus on ourselves.”"

We’re looking to build a business, but we’re also looking to learn to see how that might be replicable around the world.”\n\nMasters told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London that Premier League Plus would be offered in partnership with the existing rights holder, Starhub, and would be a “24-seven” service.\n\n“It’s going to be a really exciting product, and the big change is I think that the Premier League will have its own customers and means us delving into things like promotion and pricing,” said Masters. “That’s why it’s an important step for us.”\n\nThe idea of a “Premflix” offering has been speculated on for a number of years. Premier League club owners have backed the idea, with Chelsea’s Todd Boehly telling the FT conference last year that the league should sell its global rights direct to the streaming service Netflix. Instead, the Premier League has gone for a trial approach, with Masters telling an audience of industry insiders that international broadcast revenues had grown by 27% through the latest three-year rights cycle.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Premier League’s Richard Masters says its new app is ‘an important step for us’. Photograph: Jon Super/AP\n\nAlso appearing at the conference was the chair of the Independent Football Regulator, David Kogan. He called on the Premier League and EFL to come to a new “long-term sustainable agreement” over financial redistribution, arguing that it would lead to “less regulation” in the future.\n\nKogan also reaffirmed that parachute payments, which have been a barrier to any resolution between the Premier League and EFL, would come under scrutiny as part of the forthcoming State of the Game review. “Parachute payments are not going to vanish overnight,” Kogan said, “[but] the discussion about parachute payments is a fundamental part of the discussion about distribution.”\n\nThe chair of the EFL, Rick Parry, also speaking at the summit, said that parachute payments had represented 6% of EFL turnover when introduced in 1992, but by the 2018-19 season had reached 173% of turnover. The wage bill of clubs in receipt of the payments was more than double that of the rest of the Championship. “The Premier League chase is the most expensive lottery ticket on the planet,” he said.\n\nKogan said he believed the “backstop” option which would allow the regulator to impose a distribution deal would not need to be activated and that the leagues would come to a deal independently. Masters said that while “we’re all agreed we want a strong pyramid”, he thought “it should be left to the organisations to come up with these agreements”."

            "content": "A number of European football federations fear they will lose money sending their national teams to the World Cup this summer, with an unusual hike in costs and inconsistencies around tax exemptions among the problems Fifa is being urged to rectify.\n\nAlthough Fifa approved record prize money of £539m for the tournament last December it may not be enough to prevent losses, or reduced profits, for competitors who would usually expect a World Cup to generate vital funds. An investigation by the Guardian and PA Media found particular concerns among football associations about the consequences of missing out on money that would largely be reinvested in local initiatives.\n\nAbout 10 FAs are understood to have shared misgivings between themselves, most recently at Uefa’s annual congress in Brussels a fortnight ago. It has also been informally raised with senior Fifa officials, some of whom appear “embarrassed” about the situation according to an executive from one FA.\n\nTeams that qualify receive $9m (£6.7m) each from Fifa and are handed $1.5m in preparation costs. Those numbers are believed to have been the same for Qatar 2022, but the previous daily allowance of $850 per delegation member has been reduced to $600. One FA estimated that this would mean receiving about $500,000 less if its team remained at the World Cup, which has been expanded in length and number, for a month.\n\nSome FAs have calculated that they will make considerably less money in the US, Canada and Mexico than they did in Qatar; one, a fixture at international tournaments, told the Guardian it will in fact lose a sizeable sum in the event of elimination in the group stage or early in the knockout rounds.\n\nOne particularly aggravating element is a perceived unfairness around tax arrangements. Countries bidding for a World Cup are obliged to provide tax exemptions for FAs that qualify; those have been agreed with Canada and Mexico but no such arrangement has been reached with the US, meaning that nations potentially face vastly differing financial outlooks depending on where they were drawn to play.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Qatar World Cup cost less and was more lucrative for teams, with clear tax arrangements. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nState taxes within the US vary wildly. In California, where Los Angeles and San Francisco will host games, the top rate is 13.3%. In New Jersey, whose MetLife Stadium will stage the final, it stands at 10.75%. Teams largely based in states with lower rates, or outside the US, will find themselves at an advantage financially unless an agreement is reached in the next three and a half months. Given that context, there is also frustration that FAs have been left to seek their own tax advice rather than being given specific assistance by Fifa.\n\nOther factors hiking costs include the tournament’s considerable travel demands, unfavourable exchange rates against the dollar, the well-publicised increase in ticket prices and the event’s duration. In Qatar there were four weeks between the opening game and final; this time around the 28-day mark will arrive as the quarter-finals commence.\n\nWhile some figures acknowledge that FAs are responsible for their own bonus structures, which inevitably make for a notable outlay, they point out it would be unworkable to offer a reduced package to that which was promised to their squads in Qatar. Another mitigation offered for this summer’s problems is the potential longer-term benefit of lengthy exposure to the vast North American market. Fifa was contacted for comment."

Of course I would.”\n\n4 Neville has had a number of iconic moments on the mic during his 15-year punditry and commentary career Credit: Getty\n\nGoing to the wire\n\nFor the majority of the season, it had looked as if Arsenal were going to run away with the title.\n\nBut they've slipped up at the start of 2026, and Man City are back in the race.\n\nThe Citizens splashed the cash in January on Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo.\n\n\n\nThey have made a tangible difference, with City looking like an aggressive and more physical version of older Guardiola sides.\n\nAnd if they pip Arsenal, Alex Crook believes Arteta should leave the Emirates Stadium.\n\nSpeaking on the talkSPORT Daily Podcast, he said: \"If Arsenal don't win the league, I think it will be an incredible failure and I think it'll be on Mikel Arteta. I would go as far as to say he should offer to quit.\n\n\"If they blow the title again... I was watching the Wolves game and they weren't even in the game, Arsenal were strolling around and keeping possession; it was a training match.\n\n\"But there lies the problem - if you're champions elect and 1-0 up after four minutes against probably the worst team the Premier League has ever seen...you go for the jugular.\n\n\n\n\"You get the second goal and get the third goal, get the fourth goal. Goal difference could be vital in the title race.\n\n\"So, to not do that and go back to this safety-first football and put the handbrake on, alright, you do get the second goal, but you invite Wolves back into the game.\n\n\"He's got players there who are more than capable of putting Wolves to the sword, but they're not doing it.\n\n\"They're trying to plod their way to the Championship...if they don't win it... I think Arteta has got to walk away.\""

It was very normal that you have a difficult period and it fell for us at Christmas.\n\n3 Coventry are on course to return to the Premier League for the first time since 2001 Credit: Getty\n\n3 Next season would be the first time the CBS Arena, opened in 2005, would see Premier League football\n\n“You’ve got to show a bit of character to get through it. The boys have really switched on and have deserved to turn this little corner.\n\n“It’s so important we keep our feet on the ground. Everybody don’t get excited again because there’s so many points to play for.”\n\nThe Sky Blues’ quest to secure Premier League football for the first time since 2001, sees them face Stoke City next at the Coventry Building Society Arena on Saturday."

            "content": "AN AMERICAN man gunned down in the Cuban speedboat shootout was “obsessed” with the country’s freedom, according to his brother.\n\nMichel Ortega Casanova has now been pictured as one of four who were killed by coastguards as they stormed towards the island nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe would-be revolutionaries were allegedly armed with assault rifles and Molotov cocktails.\n\nHavana claimed that the 10 passengers aboard the Florida-registered boat fired shots first, injuring a commander as they were encountered just one nautical mile off the northern coast.\n\nMichel’s brother, Misael, has now shared that his late loved one had lived in the United States for over 20 years, but would still agonise over Cubans’ suffering.\n\n\n\nHe added that his brother was on an obsessive and diabolical quest to secure the country’s freedom.\n\n“They became so obsessed that they didn’t think about the consequences nor their own lives,” Misael said from Miami.\n\nAdding to the heartbreak, the news had caught Michel’s family completely by surprise.\n\nMisael said that he did not recognise a single name on the list of the boat’s occupants released by the Cuban government.\n\n\n\n“No one knew,” Misael said of his brother’s plans. “My mother is devastated.”\n\nHe added that he hopes his brother’s death will be for a worthwhile cause.\n\n“Maybe it will justify that some day Cuba will be free.”\n\nCuban authorities, meanwhile, say Michel was accompanied on the boat by two wanted terrorists, speaking of Amijail Sanchez Gonzalez and Leordan Enrique Cruz Gomez.\n\nOfficials who searched the vessel found assault rifles, handguns, homemade explosives, bulletproof vests, telescopic sights and camouflage uniforms.\n\n\n\nAdding to intrigue, the boat was reported stolen from an island in the Florida Keys archipelago 140 miles (225 kilometres) southwest of Miami, according to a report from the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nThe ten occupants were all Cubans who live in the US, according to state media.\n\nCuba’s government said the majority of the boats passengers “have a known history of criminal and violent activity.”\n\n\n\nBut Secretary of State Marco Rubio has vowed the US will “find out exactly what happened” and “respond accordingly.”\n\n“We’re not gonna base our conclusions on what they told us,” he said.\n\nThe passengers were part of a flotilla to get relatives out of Cuba, the New York Times reported.\n\nAn official told the paper it was not a US Navy or Coast Guard vessel.\n\nFlorida’s Attorney General has ordered an investigation into the shooting.\n\n\n\nRepresentative Carlos A. Gimenez – a Republican from Florida – said the shooting raised concerns on the use of lethal force against US registered vessels.\n\nIn a public statement, he called for “an immediate investigation into this massacre”.\n\n“United States authorities must determine whether any of the victims were US citizens or legal residents and establish exactly what occurred.”\n\nThe firefight comes at a perilous moment for Cuba.\n\n\n\nTop officials believe the island’s iron-fisted communist rulers are more exposed than ever, with the economy at its weakest point in decades.\n\nCuba has been hit by skyrocketing prices and oil shortages as a US blockade has taken hold.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nPresident Donald Trump has plotted to entirely blockade the island and eventually topple the communist regime.\n\nLike Venezuela and Iran, he has pushed the regime to cut a deal."

No such issues have been reported today.\n\n“If Democracy Volunteers were so concerned about alleged issues they could and should have raised them with us during polling hours so that immediate action could be taken.\n\n“We have operated a central by-election hub which has been rapidly responding to reported issues during the day, in liaison with the police – who had a presence at every polling station – where necessary.\n\n\n\n“It is extremely disappointing that Democracy Volunteers have waited until after polls have closed to make such claims.”\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe Prime Minister’s chances of staying in Downing Street rest on the crucial vote with the seat seen as a three-way tie between Labour, Reform and the Greens.\n\nPolling stations opened at 7am on Thursday and closed at 10pm."

Never Again Fascism.”\n\nAfter the dictator’s 1945 suicide, the Pommer family took over the deed.\n\nSince 1972, the Austrian Ministry of the Interior began leasing the house to protect it from misuse by Neo-Nazis.\n\n\n\nIt has taken on different lives as a city library, a school, and later a disability workshop centre.\n\nThe house stood derelict from 2011 to 2016, but became state property a year later, with the owner reportedly receiving a handsome £700,000 sum.\n\nAuthor Ludwig Laher, a member of the Mauthausen Committee Austria that represents Holocaust victims, blasted the costly conversion.\n\n\n\n“A police station is problematic, as the police… are obliged, in every political system, to protect what the state wants,” he said.\n\nAccording to Laher, a previous idea to turn it into a place where people could discuss peace had received a lot of support.\n\nJasmin Stadler, a 34-year-old shop owner and Braunau native, also slammed the eye-watering money paid.\n\nShe added it would have been interesting to put Hitler’s birth in the house in a “historic context”.\n\nBut others showed support for the redesign.\n\n\n\nWolfgang Leitner, a 57-year-old electrical engineer, said turning it into a police station could help “bring, hopefully, a bit of calm”\n\n“It makes sense to use the building and give it to the police, to the public authorities,” he said.\n\nIt comes as a bonkers 41-year-old neo-Nazi got nicked for hoarding drugs, weapons and Hitler-themed wine in Pinsdorf, an hour south of the Hitler home.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThroughout Austria, debate on how to address the country’s Holocaust history has repeatedly flared.\n\nSome 65,000 Austrian Jews were killed and 130,000 forced into exile during Nazi rule."

It must have been doing faster than 40mph.”\n\nMoments later, the same witness came across the aftermath.\n\nThey added: “As I drove on I saw smoke and mist in the road and then saw bits of car and realised something had happened.”\n\n\n\nMedical tests later found no evidence of drugs or alcohol in Louie’s system.\n\nThe court heard he had left a “note of intention”, with the coroner recording a conclusion of suicide.\n\nMs Brown concluded: “Louie Day from Brentwood died on September 5, 2025, on the A414 near King Street due to multiple injuries (head, chest and abdomen) sustained as a result of a road traffic collision as the driver and only occupant, leaving a note of intent.\n\n“The conclusion is one of suicide.”\n\nLouie had been training with the Metropolitan Police at the time and was working as a response officer on the East Area Command, based in Barking and Dagenham. He had previously served for two years as a PCSO.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIn a heartbreaking statement, Louie’s family said: “It is with the greatest sadness that we announce the passing of our son, Louie Day, a beautiful soul who has left this world and will be greatly missed by all who loved him.\n\n“We would now like some privacy to grieve in peace.”"

            "content": "Cutting one food slashes risk of five cancers up to 30 per cent\n\nBut there is a warning for vegans and vegetarians\n\nView 4 Images You need to get more fruit and vegetables\n\nA vegetarian diet can slash the risk of five cancers by as much as 30%, research suggests. The largest ever study of its kind found vegetarians have a 21% lower risk of pancreatic cancer and a 9% lower risk of breast cancer compared with meat eaters. They also have a 12% reduced risk of prostate cancer, 28% lower risk of kidney cancer and 31% lower risk of multiple myeloma.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, researchers at the University of Oxford found vegetarians have nearly double the risk of the most common type of cancer of the oesophagus compared with meat eaters. This might be due to vegetarians missing out on some key nutrients, the team suggested.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt is already known that eating processed meat such as ham, bacon and salami is linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer, and possibly stomach cancer. Red meat such as beef, pork and lamb also increases the risk, while white meat, such as chicken and turkey, has not shown a link.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Meat has been linked to a higher cancer risk\n\nExperts behind the new study, published in the British Journal of Cancer, said more work was needed on whether it is overall meat consumption that is problematic when it comes to cancer, or whether something specific in vegetarian diets lowers cancer risk. The new research included data from various studies across the world, with most people coming from the UK and US.\n\nSome 1.64 million meat eaters were included, alongside 57,016 poultry eaters (no red meat), 42,910 people who ate fish and no meat (pescatarians), 63,147 vegetarians and 8,849 vegans. Led by researchers at Oxford Population Health, which is part of Oxford University, and funded by the World Cancer Research Fund, the study investigated 17 different cancers, including those of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, reproductive system, urinary tract, and blood cancer.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFood intake, generally over the previous 12 months or a “typical diet”, was assessed using food questionnaires. Factors that may influence the results, such as body mass index, were taken into account. When looking at vegans, researchers found they had a significantly higher risk of bowel cancer when compared with meat eaters.\n\nView 4 Images A meal high in grains and fruit\n\nThey said this may be due to a low average intake of calcium compared with other people (590 milligrams per day compared to a recommendation of 700 milligrams per day), and low intakes of other nutrients. Cancer Research UK has already found that calcium lowers bowel cancer risk, with a large glass of milk a day linked to a 17% reduction.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, the Oxford team said more research was needed in this area owing to the fact only 93 bowel cancers were found in the vegan group. For the other cancers studied, there was no evidence that risk in vegans differed from meat eaters, and for some less common cancers there were too few vegan cases to analyse.\n\nVegetarians also did not have a lower risk of bowel cancer, compared with meat eaters, which the researchers said was “inconsistent” with the knowledge that processed and red meat increases the risk. They said this was likely because processed meat intake in the meat eating group was moderately low.\n\nAurora Perez Cornago, principal investigator of the study, said: “Vegetarians typically consume more fruit, vegetables and fibre than meat eaters and no processed meat, which may contribute to lower risks of some cancers.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Cutting oiut meat seems to be good for your health\n\nShe added: “The higher risk of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in vegetarians and bowel cancer in vegans may relate to lower intakes of certain nutrients more abundant in animal foods. Additional research is needed to understand what is driving the differences in cancer risk found in our study.”\n\nTim Key, emeritus professor of epidemiology at Oxford Population Health and co-investigator of the study, said there are around three million vegetarians in the UK and interest “in vegetarianism growing in many parts of the world”.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe said that, although it is true that vegetarians do eat more fibre and more fruit and vegetables, the differences in the study between the two groups were “not very big” and may not explain the findings. He said “my feeling is the differences are more likely to be related to meat itself than to simply vegetarians eating more healthy foods”.\n\n“But that’s sort of an opinion which we haven’t looked at directly,” he added. Dr Helen Croker, assistant director of research and policy at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: “To increase your overall protection from cancer, our advice is to build meals around wholegrains, pulses, fruit and vegetables, and avoid processed meat and limit red meat.”\n\nAmy Hirst, health information manager at Cancer Research UK, said the “high-quality study” offers some interesting insights, but the findings were not strong enough to draw definitive conclusions. More research in larger, more diverse populations is needed to better understand these patterns and what’s causing them.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n“When it comes to reducing cancer risk, keeping a healthy, balanced diet overall matters more than individual foods. Aim for plenty of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains and sources of protein – as well as cutting down on processed and red meat, alcohol, and foods high in fat, salt and sugar.”"

Green candidate Hannah Spencer stormed to victory with 14,980 votes - a majority of 4,402 - triumphing over hard-right Reform candidate Matt Goodwin on 10,578 and Labour's Angeliki Stogia on 9,364.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe victory - the Greens' first ever in a parliamentary by-election - spells trouble for Mr Starmer, as Labour failed to defend a seat it won with more than 13,000 votes at the 2024 election. Recriminations are already beginning over the party's performance - and the decision by Labour chiefs to block Andy Burnham from standing in the race.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGorton and Denton by-election: Live result as Greens SHOCK Labour and Reform with victory READ MORE :\n\nView 2 Images Newly elected Green MP Hannah Spencer takes a selfie with Party Leader Zack Polanski (Image: Getty Images)\n\nIn the run up the vote, Labour insiders indicated they thought the contest was winnable as the party threw everything at trying to hold the seat. But by around 1am, the mood started to shift and Labour sources began to say that the Greens had turned out a higher than anticipated number of supporters.\n\nThe result risks undermining Labour's argument that it is the only party to take on Reform, and paves the way for trouble in a pivotal set of local elections in May. It also marks a seismic blow to Keir Starmer's authority only weeks after he survived a brush with political death when Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for him to quit.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Labour's Angeliki Stogia arrives at the count flanked by Deputy Labour leader Lucy Powell, right, and MP Andrew Western, left (Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe PM is likely to face a backlash from his own party over the decision by Labour chiefs to block Mr Burnham from standing.\n\nLabour chairwoman Anna Turley MP said: “This result is clearly disappointing. By-elections are normally difficult for the party of government, and this election was no different. We have had thousands of conversations over the last few weeks and we know the majority of voters here did not want the poisonous politics of Nigel Farage and Reform.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe added: \"The politics of anger and easy answers offered by the Greens and Reform won’t deliver this.\"\n\nMs Spencer, a 34-year-old plumber, jokingly apologised to her customers as she delivered an emotional victory speech. She said: \"I think I might have to cancel the work that you haven't booked in, because I'm heading to Parliament. And when I get there, I will make space for everyone doing jobs like mine,\n\n\"We will finally get a seat at the table. We can demand better without hating each other. We ran a hopeful campaign backed by thousands of volunteers and activists.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nA row erupted during the count over claims of family voting - an illegal practice where two people confer, collude or direct each other on how to cast their ballot. It can involve husbands telling their wives how to vote.\n\nDemocracy Volunteers - an election observer group - said they had seen \"concerningly high levels of family voting\" in the battle. Officials said no such issues had been reported throughout the day and questioned why the group had not raised the serious allegations.\n\nSore loser Nigel Farage ranted about \"sectarian cheating\" as his divisive candidate failed to triumph."

He recalled: “Watching that massive mouth lined with sharp teeth charge straight toward me is a thrill I’ll never forget.”\n\n“Probably the best leopard seal shots I’ve seen,” commented contest judge Tobias Friedrich. “To capture such a perfect composition with delicate lighting, in such an intense moment, is so impressive.”\n\nWe’ve documented all the category winners in the gallery below — let us know your favourite image in the comments section."

She shares how a terrifying diagnosis stripped her of her social life\n\nView 6 Images Darcie Warner\n\nClutching her chest, Darcie Warner was panic stricken. Her heart rate had skyrocketed and she was in extreme pain. At just 16 years old, she thought she was having a heart attack. “I couldn’t move or do anything,” says Darcie, now 20, who lives in Cardiff. “The pain was the scariest part, not knowing when it was going to stop. It was sudden and I was by myself. I honestly had no idea what was happening, I was in shock.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDarcie is one of just 0.2% of the population who suffer from Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), a chronic nervous system disorder that affects blood flow and heart rate, causing the heart to beat abnormally fast, with symptoms often occurring when someone moves from lying down to standing up leaving them dizzy, lightheaded and unsteady. The condition affects roughly 135,000 people and is most commonly diagnosed in women aged 15 to 50, though it can occur in men.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFebruary is National Heart Month in the UK, a campaign led by the British Heart Foundation, that raises awareness of a variety of health conditions directly related to cardiovascular disease, and promotes healthy living measures such as diet and exercise that can lower risks. Darcie hopes that sharing her experience with Mirror readers will help others going through similar experiences, and challenge the assumption that heart-related conditions are only a concern later in life.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n6 View 6 Images Darcie experienced her first symptoms in the gym 6 View 6 Images Darcie is one of just 0.2% of the population who suffer from Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)\n\nIndeed, Darcie’s symptoms began at just 16. Before that, she “lived a life similar to every teenager”, enjoying an active lifestyle, regularly attending the gym and spending time with friends. It was during one particular workout that Darcie’s heart rate sped up to an alarming pace for the first time, frightening her. She was hit with intense palpitations, dizziness and breathlessness.\n\nAt first, she tried to ignore it, putting it down to exercise. But as time went on, the same thing happened again and again. Her symptoms quickly heightened, and alongside the palpitations came dizziness, crippling chest pain and feeling faint. “I’d be sitting on the sofa or even asleep, and my heart rate would suddenly shoot up,” Darcie says. “Sometimes it was nearly 200 beats per minute, and I wasn’t doing anything.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDoctors initially diagnosed anxiety, as both symptoms mirrored each other, and suggested she was prescribed medication. Darcie’s mum Rebekah, 49, says: “I thought it was anxiety, if I'm honest. All the symptoms that she was telling me were very anxiety-based.” But Darcie couldn’t shake the feeling that something else was to blame. “You’re young, so people tell you it’s stress or hormones. You start to feel like you’re being dramatic. I thought I was making the whole thing up. I was just like, is this even real? I started to not believe myself at all.”\n\nView 6 Images Darcie Warner\n\nEventually, Darcie began avoiding exercise altogether. She struggled with her sleep and her mental health suffered. Slowly, her social life started to shrink too. “I didn’t feel confident having a normal social life,” she says, “I was always worried something would happen when I wasn’t at home. As a teenager you want independence. Instead, I just felt safer at home.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe explains how she had to watch on as her friends lived their lives to the fullest, planning adventures and girl holidays. “I was too scared to do any of that because I was like what if something happens and no one knows what to do,” she says. After two years of aggressive heart palpitations, Darcie’s Apple Watch began flagging dangerously heart rates at rest. It was a turning point.\n\nWorried, the family sought private treatment and Darcie was eventually diagnosed with POTS. \"It was great when I got diagnosed, I honestly felt validated,” she says, “I stopped feeling I was making it all up, but it’s sad because I’ve missed all that time, time I should have had.”\n\nWhile there is currently no cure for POTS, symptoms can often be managed. Mr Kalyana Javangula, consultant Cardiac Surgeon at Nuffield Health Leeds Hospital says: “Although people with POTS have a normal life expectancy, unfortunately, there is no cure. However, physical activity, diet and nutrition can help to alleviate symptoms. Studies have shown that reclined aerobic exercises like swimming, rowing, and recumbent cycling have the best results. In 80% of cases, the condition improves, but some may have residual symptoms. You can also get medical compression stockings to help push blood from the legs to reduce symptoms.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\n6 View 6 Images Now 20, Darcie is rebuilding her life 6 View 6 Images Darcie has a bright future ahead of her\n\nSince her diagnosis, Darcie has tried lifestyle changes, introducing electrolyte drinks, adjusting her routine and slowly reintroducing activity. They have helped slightly, but haven’t been enough and she is preparing to start medication to better control her symptoms too. But, she says, she’s excited about her future for the first time in a long time, and is studying radiography at Cardiff University.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe’s also beginning to push herself socially again, rebuilding the confidence she lost as a teenager. “I can start doing more things than I used to be able to, I just want to go back to the gym without stopping after 30 seconds,” she says. “I want to feel confident in my body again and to go out with friends without worrying.”\n\nShe continues: “You realise how much you’ve had to make yourself small. I can’t wait to feel normal again. “There’s a lot more to POTS than people realise. If this helps even one teenager feel listened to sooner, it’s worth it.”\n\nPostural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)\n\nSymptoms can include palpitations, chest pain, fainting, extreme fatigue and what many describe as brain fog. For some, it can also trigger nausea, headaches and breathlessness, with heat, dehydration or standing for long periods making symptoms worse.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n*For more information about Nuffield Health, see nuffieldhealth.com"

Green-fingered enthusiasts have their work cut out at this time of year as gardens spring back into action.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIndeed, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) advises pruning roses, planting onion sets and shallots, and, if required, mowing the lawn when it’s dry.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBBC Gardeners' World legend Monty Don agrees that this is the month to do so, though he offers a word of caution. He says the lawn will \"need mowing in March,\" but you shouldn’t \"cut it too short.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn his blog, Monty urged gardeners to \"give it a light trim\" throughout the remainder of the month. Additional advice surfaced on TikTok from Michael Griffiths, who recommended feeding roses to achieve \"better blooms.\"\n\nView 4 Images Gardeners have no shortage of jobs to get stuck into (stock) (Image: Getty Images)\n\nMeanwhile, Rob Brett previously emphasised there is \"so much to do\" during the spring months, describing it as a \"great\" opportunity to get planting underway.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRob explained: \"Choosing one thing to plant is a challenge as there is so much to do in a garden in spring. Spring is a great time to plant, so perhaps use early spring to plan your planting sequence. Depending on weather conditions, early March is the last time to plant bare-root trees and shrubs.\n\n\"March is also a great time to split and divide clumps of herbaceous plants and relocate them to areas around the garden (or, if not needed, give them to friends and neighbours).\n\nView 4 Images Rob said summer is a \"great time\" for \"wonderful\" plants like Gladiolus (Image: RHS )\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"March and April are also the time to plant many of our traditional vegetables – early potatoes, onion sets and shallots, for example. If I had to choose one thing to plant in spring it would be summer flowering bulbs. We often neglect to think about this, as we concentrate on planting spring flowering bulbs in autumn.\"\n\nLooking ahead, he observed that summer presents a \"great time\" for \"wonderful\" plants such as Gladiolus, with particular favourites including Nerine and Eucomis, renowned for their \"pineapple flowering heads.\"\n\nBeyond planting, the RHS has outlined a host of additional tasks for gardeners to tackle this March, ranging from planting potatoes to managing overgrown perennials.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nView 4 Images March signals the arrival of spring and offers a welcome reprieve (stock) (Image: Getty Images)\n\nRob wrapped up: \"I would hope that people have been enjoying their gardens throughout the winter – they can become a beautiful visual statement and food for wildlife – but, if you are venturing out for the first time, take stock and see what's looking good, what's flowering and what needs cutting back.\n\n\"March signals a time for cutting back herbaceous plants that have been left over winter, but March is also the time for pruning shrubs and climbing roses.\""

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980. The bout was competitive, but Arguello scored the 11th-round knockout to retain his WBC super featherweight title.\n\nCastillo would lose his next bout, too, dropping a unanimous decision to Mexican legend Salvador Sanchez after leading the first six rounds.\n\nCastillo later lost to Julio Cesar Chavez in 1985 as the iconic boxer scored a sixth-round knockout at the Forum in Los Angeles.\n\nRuben Castillo (L) throws a punch against Julio Cesar Chavez during the fight at the LA Forum\n\nBoxer Ruben 'the Conquistador' Castillo has passed away at 68, according to the World Boxing Council.

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

Emile Heskey wore it so well, that strange cocktail of exasperated indignation. You’re asking me about Erling Haaland? Ah, come on.\n\nHeskey, sat on upholstered leather to bring an air of authority to proceedings – those proceedings being to goad an ex-professional into saying something inflammatory on video for social media, all in the name of betting advertising – briefly weighed up the question of whether Haaland is 'world class'.\n\nHe answered 'no' and then the edited footage cuts to the former Liverpool striker explaining why, presumably to somebody who raised surprise in an action that now had him all of a fluster. ‘World class? Tell me what he does apart from scoring goals. Tell me what he does apart from scoring goals.’\n\nHeskey knows a thing or two about goals of course, having registered one in five games at club level and one in nine for England during a career that saw him clean up at Birmingham City’s Player of the Year Awards in 2005.\n\nThese days he spends a bit of his time flogging CBD online but here we are instead focusing on his suggestion that Haaland is selling snake oil to anybody who thinks he’s an elite striker.\n\nHeskey’s sons, Jaden and Reigan, are both products of Manchester City’s academy and have regularly trained alongside Haaland, so are perhaps in a better position to determine the 25-year-old record-breaker’s skillset from the perspective of somebody who has seen him close up.\n\nErling Haaland chases down the ball against Newcastle last Saturday during a dynamic display in which he had his most touches yet in a Premier League match, at 43\n\nHaaland set up Nico O'Reilly for City's second goal. The Norwegian has three assists since City's formation switch\n\nTheir old man’s game was predicated on doing the donkey work, allowing others to grab headlines. He did this expertly by bringing midfielders into play, occupying defenders, creating channels for others, generally enjoying the physicality of the Premier League.\n\nThat description does bring a man to mind, actually. Long hair, Scandinavian. Fastest ever to 100 Premier League goals. Second in this year’s assist charts with seven, behind only Bruno Fernandes. Part of a leadership team handpicked by the great Pep Guardiola. Seems like a full package. World class, you might say.\n\nDiscussion around what Haaland does or does not do came back round last weekend, when City squeezed past Newcastle United. The best all-round performance of his career has been the shout from a section of observers and Wayne Rooney gushed over the nature of it. ‘It’s a performance I will never forget,’ Guardiola said, having already held Haaland up as an example to his team-mates in the dressing room after the 2-1 victory.\n\nBasically the message was to remember what he put in for the cause, the commitment and desire, the sort of which is non-negotiable if City are to beat Arsenal to this title.\n\nHaaland ran, defended, hustled like a man possessed. He bundled Dan Burn about as if the giant defender was a rookie on the slight side. There he was, heading away a dangerous corner in the dying seconds. He didn’t score but assisted beautifully for Nico O’Reilly’s second, standing up a right-foot cross to the back post. Haaland admired it as O’Reilly headed in before darting off to celebrate with the scorer.\n\n‘You can see his joy when other people succeed,’ Norway head coach Stale Solbakken has told Daily Mail Sport. ‘That is big proof of what a team player he is.’ Some City players have been somewhat surprised by his collegiate attitude over the years; that attribute is partly why Guardiola handed him more responsibility last summer.\n\nHis numbers against Newcastle paint a picture. A career-high 12 duels. His most touches in a Premier League match, at 43. No City player completed more clearances, albeit that is dependent on which source and what they determine a clearance to be.\n\nHis average position by the centre circle was about 20 yards deeper than fellow forward Omar Marmoush, which is a product of Guardiola going with two up front and a box midfield in recent weeks. ‘We’ll see what we do when the wingers (Jeremy Doku and Savinho) are back,’ the City manager said. ‘I think he adapted perfectly. I’m not telling Erling to play left back.’\n\nIt’s no coincidence that Haaland has three assists since the formation switch and is now only one from his league-best tally.\n\n‘It’s a performance I will never forget,’ City manager Pep Guardiola said of Haaland's efforts against Newcastle\n\nHaaland's average position by the centre circle was about 20 yards deeper than fellow forward Omar Marmoush (Phil Foden, Rayan Cherki and Abdukodir Khusanov were all substitutes)\n\nThese bits are significant indicators of a complete centre forward, more Harry Kane than Cristiano Ronaldo. And it is a trend. The conversations around how Haaland’s game has been transformed, doing more for the team and not ‘just’ scoring an inordinate number of goals, have now surfaced at least four times this season.\n\nThe draw at Arsenal. Beating United in September’s derby – before which Haaland was a central figure in a team meeting about raising standards and when he completed more defensive actions than that Newcastle match. And after a home win against Bournemouth. Each display prompted discourse about his style, the sort of which that has that guy at the end of the bar earnestly offering that Haaland’s not just about goals anymore, you know.\n\nThat this talk about an improvement outside of his recognised zone, between the posts, happens periodically and presented as new begs the question: has he actually always been like this?\n\nThe answer is yes and no, although it certainly looks to the naked eye that he has grown into a main character of City’s build-up play. And often that is more instructive than the raw stats. Heading and City relying upon his size is the main upturn – and a drastic one. This has been an area that Haaland’s worked on for a long while, particularly with Marco Rose at Borussia Dortmund, and one he knew needed elevating.\n\nWhile the number of aerial duels he battles in is only up marginally per 90 minutes, 3.9 now compared to 3.55 last year and 3.2 during his first season, City are seeing far better results. Haaland now wins 64 per cent of those, up from an average of around 50.\n\nHis dribbling statistics are on an upward curve, one deft slalom against Newcastle given the slow-motion treatment by City’s video team this week. He takes on more of those per game and completes 40 per cent.\n\nBut then there are the others. Winning back possession in the final third is better than last year but not as prevalent as in 2023-24. Passes played into the box is half of the Treble year. Expected assists are broadly the same as his other three campaigns, chances created from open play are actually lower than ever - even if through-balls are now far higher than his normal average.\n\nAverage number of touches – the metric that detractors became obsessed by – are lower than his first two seasons, 24 now and 27 in that blistering first term when plenty mocked his lack of general involvement. But this takes into account the whole season, not just the period that City have been wingerless. Anyway, it's a funny old game. He’d not felt the ball once before a 15th-minute opener in Monaco and nobody mentioned it.\n\nHaaland is now winning far more of his aerial duels: 64 per cent up from an average of around 50\n\nHaaland's stats for winning back possession in the final third are better than last year\n\nOften the sheer weight of goals distract from everything else and perhaps the amazement of those feats wearing off has seen pundits look for other things in his game to highlight.\n\nCertainly working for the team is nothing new, Haaland particularly pleased with a decoy run to distract Juan Foyth, allowing Bernardo Silva to score, away at Villarreal in October as a recent example, even if dropping deep is.\n\nRoughing up William Saliba and Gabriel in the 2023 title showdown with Arsenal is a memorable display of force and doing the dirty stuff, while Norway marvelled at the way he pressed, ran channels and held up possession as they secured a vital World Cup qualification win over Italy in June.\n\nTactically, they are seeing him have a greater awareness of what is required, especially against supposedly superior opposition. And that is maybe where this year’s difference comes: the statistics are similar but it’s learning how best to utilise those opportunities to the betterment of players around him.\n\nEven as the league’s top scorer on 22, there have been struggles. A barren spell in front of goal either side of new year is being worked through and he is still not entirely out of that yet. Coming out of the dressing room at Anfield in his sliders, Haaland insisted there was ‘no excuse’ for his form and he has still only scored one from open play in his last 10 league games.\n\nHe has refused to put this down to fatigue, even if Guardiola has labelled him ‘exhausted’ and attempted to give rest where possible, Haaland benched for victory over Wolves last month. Haaland is between houses at the moment, the family temporarily moving down near Crewe, and spent some of his three days off after Newcastle in Paris.\n\nLeeds United next, the city of his birth, as the first half of the run-in starts motoring. City undoubtedly need him to start scoring regularly now and Guardiola has spoken candidly about the pressures the club’s No 9 places upon himself.\n\nHaaland celebrates scoring against Fulham with Phil Foden but he only has one goal from open play in his last 10 league games\n\n'The problem with Erling is that he has to deal with his own numbers and expectations,’ Guardiola says. ‘We won the Treble because he scored I don’t know how many goals'\n\n‘The problem with Erling is that he has to deal with his own numbers and expectations,’ Guardiola said. ‘That is the challenge for him. When your expectation is five goals a season, you can improve. We won the Treble because he arrived, he scored I don’t know how many goals (52), and the expectations are there.\n\n‘When you go four or five games without scoring, it is like “Oh what happened, what happened?” He puts a lot of responsibility on himself. He is a guy who desperately wants to help the team and the club. I always say to him not to put too much pressure (on himself).\n\n‘He knows how much we need him, he doesn’t want to leave the team disappointed. That is a big attribute. I would prefer that to somebody who doesn’t care. He’s completely the opposite, he suffers when he doesn’t score a goal. Don’t suffer, you do your best.’\n\n\n\nThe best will never be enough for some."

            "content": "It was an outcome which would never have been foretold among those whose mission is now persuading a digital generation to click on BBC Sport’s output rather than someone else’s TikTok or YouTube content.\n\nA peak audience of 5.5million people in the UK were glued to that old-fashioned concept called BBC1 last week, as they watched the Team GB men’s curling final.\n\nIt’s demode to say it, but many will have done so while communing around a TV. Countless had become armchair curling experts amid two beautiful weeks of Winter Olympics. The BBC broadcasts of the Games had 26.3million viewers in all.\n\nIt’s not the only time lately when that experience of tuning in to something transcending clicks and instant gratification was to be found on the BBC. Against a beautiful Peak District backdrop, Macclesfield’s defeat of Crystal Palace unfolded before our eyes on a sunny Saturday lunchtime in early January.\n\nThe ensuing digital clips were fine – bandaged captain Paul Dawson leaping to score and sending the roof off that modest stadium – but it was the unfolding match, the national suspense, the collective willing-on of the underdogs, the excellent Mark Chapman’s half-time talk with the Macclesfield manager’s brother, Wayne Rooney – which made it so fine and compelling.\n\nSport as it actually unfolds. Sport with its myriad dramas and unpredictabilities. Sport as we had once come to expect it from the broadcaster which takes our licence fee.\n\nThe BBC's Winter Olympics coverage showed sport as it actually unfolds. Sport with its myriad dramas and unpredictabilities... not merely social media clips\n\nAgainst a beautiful Peak District backdrop, Macclesfield’s defeat of Crystal Palace unfolded before our eyes on a sunny Saturday lunchtime in early January\n\nThe media landscape is changing at a mesmerising pace. The BBC, in the throes of existential crisis, are facing the financial challenge of streaming platforms which are making the commercial battle for live sport extremely competitive.\n\nBut it was not just those of us brought up on the live football commentary of John Motson, Barry Davies and the great Hugh Johns whose hearts were heavy when hearing the BBC’s director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski tell the Financial Times Business of Football summit that you don’t need to show live sport to stay relevant.\n\n‘We’re not competing against who we were competing with before,’ he said. ‘The BBC might have thought, traditionally, it was up against ITV, or Sky, or other broadcasters. Well, guess what? We’re not. We’re in a race to not be swiped. Up against people selling you holidays, or clothes companies, or two-for-one chicken breasts on sale from the supermarket, or football teams, or athletes.\n\n‘We still have reporting and live pages and digital video that draw in millions and millions and millions of people. You can still be relevant - you can still matter - if you don’t show the sport.’\n\nBBC Sport’s need for intellectual curiosity and imagination in a complicated media landscape extending far beyond outside broadcasts is undeniable. All in the industry are facing the same challenge. Clips are certainly working for them in terms of Premier League, Champions League and cricket coverage.\n\nBut it was what Kay-Jelski didn’t say, as well as his bleak and provocative suggestion that the BBC’s sports output is competing with poultry purveyors, which reinforced the sense that the national broadcaster have given up on live sport, in their pursuit of digital clicks.\n\nWhat you really wanted to hear was that BBC Sport are fighting for their lives to hold on to the rights of sports held dearest by the British public, in the face of aggressive streamers who want to monetise them. That the list of televised sport's free-to-air ‘crown jewels’ must, as a matter of national significance, be extended to preserve them for those who cannot or will not pay for an ever-growing number of commercial bolt-ons.\n\nA group of MPs have let it be known that they are supportive of such an extension. Here was some momentum to seize on. On all of the above, we heard nothing.\n\nThe BBC’s director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski told the Financial Times Business of Football summit that you don’t need to show live sport to stay relevant\n\nSome broadcast staff in the BBC’s Six Nations coverage, already split with ITV, are thought to be wondering how secure the future looks. Wimbledon five years from now? Who knows?\n\nThe Boat Race is the most recent live sport event lost from the BBC, with word coming down last autumn that the corporation had ‘fallen out of love’ with it. Granted, not an event guaranteed to feed the clips or ‘second screen’ culture. But one which is still held in huge national affection, with a 2.6million viewership.\n\nThe event, enthusiastically picked up by Channel 4, has now gone the same way as the Grand National, The Open, Test cricket, the Paralympics and Royal Ascot. Each of those pillars of British sport came with the licence fee in the early 1990s. No more.\n\nThis summer will see the Commonwealth Games not staged on the BBC for the first time – a disaster for organisers involved in their own fight for relevance. The Games have been picked up by TNT Sports.\n\nThat’s the same broadcaster whose low-rent coverage of the Ashes this winter was encapsulated by commentator Rob Hatch mistaking a replay of Jamie Smith's run-out as a live wicket and excitedly announcing that Ben Stokes had been dismissed.\n\nIn December, my colleague Mike Keegan’s reporting provided a graphic sense of how the BBC’s pivot to digital content, and the 16-24-year-old demographic it craves, is being viewed by staffers who believe in the concept of covering sports news on TV. His report related how a Q&A session with senior management, called a ‘culture cafe’ became a ‘slanging match’ at times.\n\nIt also highlighted how, in the same pursuit of the digital traffic, BBC Sport have recruited dedicated correspondents for Liverpool, Newcastle United, Chelsea and the Manchester clubs, as well as a ‘football tactics correspondent’ and a ‘football issues correspondent'. Chasing online audiences which the nation’s big clubs bring does not cohere with a Royal Charter which that states the BBC should be for everyone.\n\nKay-Jelski’s words this week suggested that he is fine with facing down the criticism. ‘It’s OK if a lot of these innovations don’t make everybody happy,’ he said. ‘It’s also OK if some of the traditional forms of its media content or sporting content don’t make people happy.’\n\nHow long before Wimbledon joins Sue Barker in departing our free-to-air screens?\n\nBut for two weeks this month, we were reminded that linear TV is not dead, as we sat together in front of the box in the corner of the room and watched skiers and snowboarders and skaters fly in northern Italy.\n\nWe witnessed the extraordinary outcome when BBC Sport commentators, editors, engineers and studio staff cohere. We were reminded of the understated brilliance of Hazel Irvine, one of the nation’s very best sports presenters.\n\nAnd it was all ours to view, for free. The very best of our licence fee.\n\nMy friend bought his young kids a carpet curling kit and says they were so besotted that they practised every day of the Games. Such is the wonder and absorption that live sport brings. You don’t fall in love with clips."

            "content": "Earlier this week, before his devastating hundred hurtled England into the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup, Harry Brook sauntered into a press conference, clocked the facial expressions of those present and suggested a smile or two wouldn’t go amiss.\n\nNaturally, there have been times during what has been the most harrowing of winters for Brook that facing questions from the media was the last thing he wanted to do. But the jovial nature of that entrance in Pallekele here in Sri Lanka told of his desire to move on and embrace the next chapter of his England captaincy.\n\nThere is no doubt that he is in a much happier place since this World Cup began, despite the revelations on its eve that he lied about being alone on the Halloween night out that ended with him being struck by a Wellington bouncer.\n\nThere is an irony here, because without the Yorkshireman’s honest testimony - coming clean to England coach Brendon McCullum during the final one-day international at Wellington's Sky Stadium on November 1 - there is a chance the episode might never have come out.\n\nFor the original story entered the public domain during England’s Ashes tour not because of the incident itself, but the fact he’d been reprimanded and fined £30,000 by his ECB bosses as a result. Equally, it was loyalty to team-mates Jacob Bethell and Josh Tongue that led Brook, in taking responsibility and apologising for his own actions, to say that he had been on his own.\n\nNot great optics, some will argue, and it led to further scrutiny from the outside world in the form of an ongoing investigation by the Cricket Regulator. But it has arguably strengthened Brook’s standing within the England dressing room - other players respect him. And they are increasingly his players.\n\nHarry Brook's attempts to protect his team-mates have strengthened his standing within the England dressing room\n\nBrook points to the heavens in memory of his grandmother Pauline after reaching his 50-ball hundred in Pallekele on Tuesday\n\nOver the course of his 10-month tenure, Brook’s influence on selection has shown itself with the recalls of Will Jacks and Tom Banton, two of his former England Under 19s team-mates, even if another close friend in Brydon Carse has fallen by the wayside.\n\nJacks has found himself in a new role at No 7, while Brook confessed at the start of this tournament that he did not necessarily have a specific position for Banton, just that he knew he wanted him in his first-choice XI. Liam Dawson was recalled from the international wilderness at the start of last summer. Surrounding himself with old friends, people with whom he shares mutual trust, has had the desired effect on and off the field.\n\nA strong bond has developed with Bethell, the team’s unofficial vice-captain and whose adventurous nature led to walks together through leafy Kandy, seeking out the best coffee shops.\n\nAway from the game, Brook lost his grandmother Pauline - whom he called his ‘rock’ - two years ago this month. She was someone who in typical Yorkshire style told him how things were. Berated him for bad shots. Or poor choices. Loved him unconditionally. Poignantly, he looked to the heavens in her memory when he reached three figures in Pallekele.\n\nGuidance more recently has come from his manager Phil Weston, the former Worcestershire and Gloucestershire player, whom he acknowledged has been an ‘amazing’ support as trouble shadowed him these past few months.\n\nBrook’s mum, Lucy, has been around too and was present for his 27th birthday last Sunday, including a 'cake smash' after victory over the tournament co-hosts Sri Lanka, in which Bethell appeared to take great delight in the smearing of sponge and cream into the England captain’s face.\n\nThat took place at the team hotel in Kandy where two nights later in the bar, a posse of England players, mingling happily with fans, raised glasses to the 100 that had downed Pakistan by two wickets - booking the first ticket to the final four in the process.\n\nThere is a time and a place for such things, of course, and no one would be so prudish as to deny them a chance to celebrate success three nights before what is for England a dead-rubber against New Zealand on Friday.\n\nEngland are operating to a self-imposed curfew of midnight on non-matchdays during this tournament, but there has been no need for an alcohol ban, just a much more mature approach to its consumption in the light of an Ashes dogged by forensic examination of boozy incidents.\n\nBrook smashes a straight six on the way to his 50-ball century against Pakistan\n\nWill Jacks congratulates Brook on his ton. Brook wanted Jacks in the team and the all-rounder's presence is a sign of the captain's growing influence on selection\n\nFor one, there is not much opportunity for nights out in a World Cup schedule that has generally been travel, practice, play, repeat. Although they did stop off in Colombo in transit from Kolkata to Kandy last week, allowing a group of 20 and 30-somethings to act like 20s and 30-something men and enjoy some downtime.\n\nGolf and padel have been on the agenda, but watching Brook’s mastery of the Pakistan bowling attack on Tuesday was a reminder that to him cricket always comes first.\n\nMultiple publishers were interested in Brook writing a book this winter, charting a rise from West Yorkshire village club Burley-in-Wharfedale to a Test batsman averaging mid-50s, but he postponed it, citing a desire to retain full focus on England’s tour Down Under.\n\nSince resuming his limited-overs captaincy, he has orchestrated five wins out of six in bilateral matches here in Sri Lanka - using the defence of just 128 in the final T20 as a reference point during team meetings for maintaining a never-say-die-attitude at this tournament.\n\nImprovements have been noticeable both in terms of tactics and temperament: an instinct call to open the bowling with Jacks despite a competition economy rate touching 14 rushed the Sri Lankans to Super Eight defeat last weekend, while slowing his bowlers down between deliveries to regain composure proved a crucial factor in the last-ball thriller versus Nepal. Pre-match chats have not altered, with input from Brook and Brendon McCullum bookending thoughts from the floor.\n\nBut several members of the squad have reflected on the increasingly symbiotic relationship of Brook and McCullum, which would bode well for the future if the New Zealander were secure in his position.\n\nHowever, the threat of post-Ashes change coincides with Ben Stokes being assigned a ‘coaching’ role with England Lions in the UAE, effectively increasing contact time with Andrew Flintoff following their partnership at Northern Superchargers last August. Such arrangements might just be coincidence, of course.\n\nBrook calls McCullum the best coach he’s known, and immediately credited him as the mastermind behind the move to No 3 that saw him destroy the Pakistan attack.\n\nBrook calls England coach Brendon McCullum the best he’s known and credited him as the mastermind behind the move to No 3 that saw him destroy Pakistan\n\nLike Ben Stokes before him, the responsibility of captaincy appears to be having a maturing effect on Brook\n\nThose close to him joke that Brook wears his intelligence lightly - Joe Root playfully dubbed him an 'idiot' last year. Yet his cricketing smarts are there for all to see.\n\nTake that 50-ball hundred when in conjunction with Sam Curran and Jacks - fellow gym bunnies - the Pakistanis were run ragged on Pallekele’s huge expanses, conceding nine twos in addition to Brook’s 14 boundaries. He later joked that his 2023 self would have carried too much timber to have seen through the plan.\n\nLike Stokes before him, the responsibility of captaincy appears to be having a maturing effect, even if there are blips - like the too-close-to-the-bone Stone Cold Steve Austin beer slam celebration marking his one-day hundred here in Colombo last month.\n\nThe thousands of supporters that flocked to Australia did so in the hope of witnessing such hundreds there, not brain fades that gifted his wicket away.\n\nBut hope remains that his first truly match-defining international innings can raise smiles until what is the very latest point on England’s winter schedule - the final in Ahmedabad a week on Saturday - seeing him emulate Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler as World Cup-winning captains."

Self-destruction.\n\nIf that seems a little harsh on a team currently five points clear at the top of the Premier League, consider that they are second in another table.\n\nOnly rivals Tottenham have conceded more goals from errors this calendar year (five to Arsenal's four), with a streak of costly lapses threatening to undermine the Gunners' momentum.\n\nHad it not been for the emphatic 4–1 scoreline against Spurs last weekend, this dangerous pattern might already have been laid bare. Instead, the winning margin that day masked an issue which has been lingering in the background.\n\nOn Sunday, Declan Rice was the culprit, uncharacteristically giving the ball away to Randal Kolo Muani outside of the area, ahead of the Frenchman's equaliser.\n\nComing from a man who has been so dependable for Arsenal all season long, the error felt significant.\n\nArsenal players have made four errors leading to goals in 2026, with Declan Rice (left) at fault for Tottenham's equaliser on Sunday\n\nIt's a problem Mikel Arteta needs to solve soon, with the title race decided by such fine margins\n\nPlayers are human, of course. Mistakes can happen. But when it becomes concerning is when a trend emerges.\n\nBetween their opening match of the season against Manchester United on August 17 and December 31, the Gunners made just one mistake that directly led to a goal — the fewest across the league, and a testament to their brilliant defensive record.\n\nThat error came when Martin Zubimendi was tackled in the build-up to Richarlison’s consolation goal against Spurs in November.\n\nIt was an isolated lapse, and the big question at the time was whether Arsenal could break Chelsea’s 2004-05 record of conceding just 15 goals in a single campaign. But since the turn of the year, cracks have begun to show.\n\nRice’s misstep was merely the latest in a sequence of self-inflicted wounds: against Bournemouth, Gabriel’s defensive lapse was ruthlessly punished by Evanilson; versus Manchester United, Zubimendi was caught out and Bryan Mbeumo capitalised.\n\nAnd in the meeting with Wolves, confusion between Gabriel and David Raya in the area allowed Tom Edozie to convert a stoppage-time equaliser, with his strike rebounding off Riccardo Calafiori and into the net.\n\nTo make matters worse, title rivals Manchester City are yet to concede a single goal due to an individual error in 2026. The contrast couldn't be starker.\n\nThe margins are razor-thin at the top, yet the Gunners are being hurt by their own avoidable mistakes.\n\nThese are not systemic defensive collapses, nor tactical breakdowns. They are concentration lapses, moments that elite sides simply cannot afford, and point towards a psychological battle amid the rising pressure of trying to win the club's first Premier League title in over 20 years.\n\nMartin Zubimendi feels the heat after gifting Manchester United a goal at the Emirates last month. Arsenal went on to lose the game 3-2\n\nSports psychologist Paul McVeigh earned 20 caps for Northern Ireland and played for Tottenham and Norwich.\n\nHaving seen both sides of the equation, he is clear on how pressure will be affecting the Arsenal players’ mental psyche.\n\nMcVeigh told Daily Mail Sport: ‘When players are in the zone, they call it being in a flow state. This is when players perform at their best because they're not thinking about it. It allows the muscles in their frame for years and years to be able to perform and not even think about it.\n\n‘But once players are aware (of the pressure), it becomes more and more important. And of course, it's very difficult to stop thinking about it now that you're in the zone.\n\n‘This group of players (at Arsenal) have come close and fallen away quite a lot of times over the last few years, so it is very difficult to stay in the subconscious.\n\n‘The players who have won league titles, like the Manchester City players, who have done it a number of times over the last five years, they have the experience of getting over the line.\n\n‘So they might have different strategies they can use. The majority of the Arsenal team, however, don’t know how to navigate the situation of being in a title race, and the Arsenal fans are expecting them to throw it away.’\n\nThe culprits of these errors are seasoned players at the top of their games, the mistakes coinciding with a tide of expectation which has continued to build from the outside.\n\nThat his given opposition teams, even as lowly as Wolves, a glimmer of hope in matches which Arsenal fail to kill off.\n\nMikel Arteta’s men are no longer suffocating games once they gain control. Instead, they are offering opponents moments, small windows that top-flight forwards can exploit.\n\nSports psychologist Paul McVeigh played over 200 games for Norwich. He insists Arsenal's near-misses in previous Premier League seasons will have taken a toll\n\nA loose pass in midfield or a split-second of indecision at the back each carries amplified consequence in a title race defined by the smallest of details.\n\nIt is this slight vulnerability which has prevented the north London club being at least eight points clear at the top — had they beaten Wolves and drawn with Manchester United — instead of just five. In that scenario, the title race would have felt an awful lot more settled than it does now.\n\nMcVeigh, who wrote a book titled It’s Not About You: The Psychology of Leadership featuring an interview with Robert Pires, played against the 2004 Invincibles side when he was at Norwich. That team is incomparable to the current Arsenal side in his eyes.\n\n‘I don't think there's any comparison at all,’ he explained. ‘The team I played against were almost superhuman.\n\n‘When I was playing (against them), not only did Thierry Henry not have to run with the ball at his feet, he was walking with it, as if to say, “Don't come near me because if you do, I'm going to embarrass you”.\n\n‘And so I took him at his word and I didn't go near him, I kept backing off. The difference is, there was a supreme confidence and inner belief that team, especially personified by Thierry Henry, were going to win.\n\n‘By that stage, Henry, Patrick Vieira, Pires, all these guys were World Cup winners, absolute serial winners, and they were all coming together with another group of players in that team who had all won significant prizes. That is the massive difference.’\n\nA stoppage-time mix-up between Gabriel and David Raya at Wolves last week saw the Gunners drop two points to the league's bottom side\n\nThe good news for Arteta is that the issue can be fixed. In terms of what Arsenal can do to cope with pressure and iron out mistakes, McVeigh added: ‘They could be doing things like visualisation, affirmations, setting goals, psycholinguistics, working as a group and having discussions on all of this. There's so many different things.\n\n‘Whether players are actually good at this, working on their psychology, I would highly doubt. In my 30 years in professional football, I would say less than one per cent of people in professional football utilised sports psychology, which for me is just an absolute crutch.\n\n‘They (Arsenal) have sports psychologists. The difference is, does anyone actually use them? That's always the question: how much trust does a player have in a psychologist that the club provides? Potentially, the player might doubt that there's going to be complete trust between them and the psychologist.\n\n‘The psychologist could be having conversations with the manager, which is always the difference. It is why, even as a player, you might struggle a little bit (to trust them).’\n\nDespite some of the recent errors, it is not as though Arsenal’s defence is meek or weak. From August through December, their remarkable solidity was the backbone of their good form, with their backline the envy of Europe.\n\nA fearsome centre-back partnership of Gabriel and William Saliba, aided by defensively sound full backs in the shape of Jurrien Timber and either Calafiori or Piero Hincapie, is a mean defence on paper.\n\nWhen asked about why his team were conceding such few goals earlier in the season, Arteta replied: ‘The right level of organisation, but especially with the desire to play, shown every day, and the commitment that they show to do all the duties necessary for us to be a team that is very difficult to play against and to score against.’\n\nHe views defending as an element the whole team has to buy into, a non-negotiable even.\n\nDefending is something Arteta wants his whole team to buy into. Will his side be able to restore their superb record before the season is out?\n\nSince January, that sharpness has dulled just enough to tilt tight contests in the wrong direction. Arsenal have conceded eight goals across nine league games in 2026. Before the turn of the year, it was 13 conceded across 19 games.\n\nThe nine-match sample so far this year includes conceding two goals each against bottom-placed Wolves and mid-table Bournemouth, as well as shipping three at home to United. Clean sheets have given way to recovery jobs, and authority has been replaced by anxiety.\n\nThe data shows a rise in goals conceded, but the eye test reveals hesitation where there was once conviction. And at this level, hesitation is costly.\n\n\n\nIf Arsenal are to go the distance, the mistakes must stop — and immediately."

            "content": "Mike Ashley is not the worst owner. Now there is a statement that would have once raised eyebrows, if not fists, on Tyneside.\n\nA black and white might have left you black and blue for daring to be so antagonistic. Yet, for Sheffield Wednesday, there is a grain of hope in that thought.\n\nFor Ashley to make a success of any investment — you can measure that in pounds and pence — his football club needs to function, albeit dysfunctionally. It is not in the interest of him nor the brands whose colours will soil the club for it to drop down the pyramid and be run into the ground.\n\nThink of the two seasons when he showed most interest and ambition at Newcastle — they were both in the Championship. The first time, in 2009/10, he funded the pay packets of Nicky Butt, Alan Smith, Kevin Nolan, Joey Barton and Andy Carroll and his team amassed 102 points as champions. Seven years later and the stardust was in the dugout in the form of Rafa Benitez. Again, they won the league. Not every club relegated from the Premier League has an owner so desperate to take them back to the top flight, even if the motivation was self-interest. Once back in the top flight, however, the aspiration did not extend far beyond keeping the billboard prominent.\n\nIf Ashley is to get involved with Wednesday, it will be business, not pleasure. That, for them, is no bad thing given their current plight. Supporters might have to hold their nose — and close their eyes to avoid the red and blue — but Ashley’s scent for a quick profit would make a speedy return to the Championship his primary goal.\n\nHis attitude to football changed the day his family were verbally abused when Newcastle were relegated at Villa Park in 2009, two years after he had bought the club. As one source told us when Ashley finally sold Newcastle to a Saudi-backed consortium in 2021: ‘The club became about maximising brand exposure for Sports Direct at the expense of on-field ambition. He had an attitude of, “All noise is good noise”.\n\nIf Mike Ashley (left) is to get involved with Sheffield Wednesday, it will be business, not pleasure\n\nAshley scent for a quick profit would make a speedy return to the Championship his main goal\n\n‘A lot of the stunts he pulled were exactly that — renaming the stadium, branding all over the ground, he knew the publicity it would generate.\n\n‘If the team did well at the same time then great, but he wasn’t going to invest his own money chasing the top four, the margins didn’t add up. Instead, it was about making the club self-sufficient, making a profit on player sales and staying in the Premier League to keep Sports Direct prominent.’\n\nAshley likes distressed assets and will sense an opportunity at Hillsborough. Not to be the altruistic white knight, more so the dark horse with cold-eyed intent. But when the starting line is League One and the threat of extinction, the 61-year-old is not necessarily a bad bet. He has ridden a similar track before, given the big-club heritage of Newcastle, iconic home and invested fanbase. He will know some of the shortcuts to accelerate the journey.\n\nAs for the destination, the comfort for supporters is that it should be a better place than where they find themselves.\n\nAshley does not want to see a team bounce around League One. The detail might well be in the retail, but that is the price on the ticket if he is to swoop in and rescue the club. He would certainly generate interest.\n\nHere is one story that captures the maverick of the man. During a meeting with Sports Direct senior managers, he gave them all a playing card. Ashley had a deck and started turning over cards from the top. The first to match was a store boss from Teesside, and Ashley gave him the keys to a new Ferrari Spider. It is rarely dull around Ashley. Buckle up, Sheffield Wednesday."

He signed a £6.5m-a-year deal until June 2027, meaning his pay-off for the remainder of his contract is around £10.05m.\n\nThe club had already splashed out £14.5m following the sacking of Erik ten Hag and departure of sporting director Dan Ashworth.\n\nShould they be forced to compensate Amorim and his staff in full, it will take the total United have spent on sacking managers and executives to nearly £30m in just 15 months.\n\nAmorim left United the day after an explosive press conference following the 1-1 draw with Leeds, where he openly criticised club bosses. He clashed with Wilcox in a meeting three days before the trip to Elland Road.\n\nUnited took the decision amid concerns the team could fail to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nAmorim was replaced on an interim basis by Darren Fletcher before the club appointed Michael Carrick, who has won five and drawn one of his six games in charge to boost United's chances of returning to European football's top table.\n\nThe Red Devils are fourth having won the most points - 18 - of any Premier League team this calendar year.\n\nThe top five in the Premier League will secure a Champions League place next season and United are three points clear of Liverpool in sixth.\n\n\n\nAmorim won only 25 of his 63 games in charge and finished 15th in the Premier League before losing the Europa League final to Tottenham in May."

            "content": "Crystal Palace 2-0 Zrinjski Mostar: Oliver Glasner finally finds the formula in Europe with key tactical change - as Eagles unite Selhurst Park despite chaos engulfing the club\n\nRight when they needed them, Crystal Palace's players stepped up as Oliver Glasner's side kept their European dream alive on a huge night at Selhurst Park.\n\nMaxence Lacroix’s first-half header looked to have been decisive for Palace, but after some nervy moments, Evann Guessand confirmed the victory in injury-time to knock out their plucky Bosnian opponents Zrinjski Mostar.\n\n'It was a good and important win,' Glasner said post-match. 'We learned the lessons from the away leg, controlled the game and waited for the moments.\n\n'Not everything is perfect, but we can see the players are feeling better in the way we are playing.'\n\nThere was no doubt this was the biggest night of the Eagles' season given the way their campaign has started to unravel since Glasner announced in January that he would be leaving this summer.\n\n2025-26 had promised so much, but an end to the European journey in February, regardless of the acrimony that has followed the Austrian in recent weeks, would’ve been a disaster.\n\nCrystal Palace dispatched Zrinjski Mostar 2-0 at Selhurst Park to reach the UEFA Conference League last 16\n\nEvann Guessand's 93rd-minute strike followed Maxence Lacroix's first-half header\n\nIt is easy to forget that it is just over two months since Palace, not long off a club record unbeaten run, were in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals and about to enter the FA Cup as holders, but such has been the collapse in their form that this felt enormous.\n\nThat jeopardy was added to by Zrinjski manager Igor Stimac, once of West Ham and Derby.\n\nAt his pre-match press conference, he called out Palace's board for a 'lack of ambition', spoke about their weaknesses, and expressed a desire to add to his own history against the club. Stimac was at Derby when they beat the Eagles to gain promotion to the Premier League in 1996.\n\nYet despite the recent chaos that has engulfed Palace and the breakdown in relationship between the fans and Glasner as a result of his repeated public outbursts, the home supporters roared their side on from before kick-off and this was a night where harmony returned to Selhurst Park.\n\n'I'm always honest,' the Austrian added when pressed on his recent words. 'I can’t do it differently.\n\n'If I feel something I say it and then I have to take the s***storm that follows. Hopefully everybody knows what I'm saying is for the success of Crystal Palace. Tonight the support was great.'\n\nPalace had won just two of their last 16 matches in all competitions heading into this clash - including a dire performance in last week's 1-1 draw in Bosnia - yet the energy and intensity that had been lacking during that run was back in the first half.\n\nMuch of their European campaign has been hampered by a failure to break down low blocks, but here they zipped the ball around and pressed with intent.\n\nIt was also notable how much more direct they were in their play and Jorgen Strand Larsen, Daichi Kamada and Guessand all went close early on.\n\nZrinjski were dogged, and Stimac’s side used all the tricks they could to slow Palace down and frustrate them.\n\nCrystal Palace 2-0 Zrinjski Mostar (3-1 aggregate) Crystal Palace (3-4-2-1): Henderson (C) 7; Richards 7.5, Lacroix 8, Canvot 7.5; Munoz 7, Wharton 7.5 (Hughes 56 7), Kamada 7.5, Mitchell 7; Sarr 7, Guessand 8; Strand Larsen 7 (Johnson 73 6) Subs not used: Benitez (GK), Matthews (GK), Clyne, Sosa, Devenny, Rodney, Riad, Pino, Cardines Manager: Oliver Glasner 7 Yellow cards: Canvot, Strand Larsen, Wharton Goals: Lacroix 36, Guessand 90+3 Referee: Luis Godinho 5\n\nYet it was Adam Wharton, one of many players to have struggled during the recent run, who whipped in a delightful free kick for Lacroix, the unsung hero of this side, to head home powerfully.\n\nThe atmosphere ramped up a notch and the question was whether the Eagles could capitalise, but Glasner’s side squandered a host of opportunities and the tension ramped up.\n\nIt almost cost them when Tomi Juric agonisingly headed wide for Zrinjski in injury time, although that left the stage for Guessand to settle things after good link-up play with Brennan Johnson as Palace secured their passage to the last-16.\n\n\n\n'Crystal Palace deserved to go through,' Stimac said. 'They played better football in both games.'"

            "content": "Callum Hudson-Odoi helps send jittery Nottingham Forest through as the boos begin for Vitor Pereira - and the three squad players who did him no favours on an unconvincing night against Fenerbahce: TOM COLLOMOSSE\n\nVitor Pereira's honeymoon period as Nottingham Forest head coach has lasted precisely 225 minutes. That was all it took for the home fans to show their disgust with their team.\n\nThey may have squeezed through to the Europa League last 16 but in Pereira's third game at the helm, Forest were far from convincing and were booed off at half-time, trailing to Kerem Akturkoglu's strike.\n\n'I took a risk,' admitted Pereira. 'I had to pick this game with one eye on our game at Brighton on Sunday. It's not easy to make six changes but I could not think only about this game. We are not comfortable in the Premier League and it's very important to get points so we can avoid a difficult situation.'\n\nIt threatened to become worse when Akturkoglu converted a penalty early in the second half but by then Pereira had sent on his main men and one of them, Callum Hudson-Odoi, scored in the 68th minute to seal a 4-2 aggregate victory. Forest will face either Real Betis or FC Midtjylland in the next round – even though they took on both clubs in the league phase.\n\nThanks to their 3-0 first-leg win in Istanbul last week, this should have been a comfortable evening for Forest. But like Nuno Espirito Santo, Ange Postecoglou and Sean Dyche before him, Pereira is learning there is a huge gap in quality between Forest's best 13 or 14 players, and the rest of the squad.\n\nPereira made six changes to his starting XI and none of those players are likely to be included for Sunday's crucial Premier League clash on the south coast.\n\nNottingham Forest survived a second leg scare in the Europa League, before Callum Hudson-Odoi's goal gave the Premier League side a 4-2 win on aggregate against Fenerbahce\n\nVitor Pereira's side had earned a 3-0 win in the first leg away from home, all but sealing the tie\n\nBut Kerem Akturkoglu struck in the 22nd minute of the game to make it 3-1 on aggregate\n\nThe Fenerbahce star then netted from the penalty spot after the break to set up a nervy finish\n\nThe travelling Fener fans hurled multiple flares on to the pitch in the first minute, causing a brief stoppage in play. Captain Ismail Yuksek pleaded for calm yet it was Forest who looked jittery.\n\nNerves are one thing, competence is another. When he arrived, Pereira talked about using his whole squad. How does he stick to those words after this? Morato, James McAtee and Lorenzo Lucca looked way out of their depth and Forest were lucky to be only 1-0 down at the interval.\n\nWhen Morato slipped on the halfway line in the 22nd minute, Forest were left two-on-two at the back. Neco Williams failed to cut out Sidiki Cherif's cross, allowing Akturkoglu to steady himself and finish from close range. Trying to respond immediately, Elliot Anderson collected a pass from Omari Hutchinson and fired a fraction wide from a narrow angle.\n\nCherif – twice – and Akturkoglu failed to profit from Forest mistakes and when the whistle went for half-time, the home fans made their feelings known.\n\nForest made four changes at half-time only for Fener to win a penalty within 25 seconds of the restart when Jair Cunha tripped Akturkoglu and the Turkey international converted confidently from the spot. And when Cunha had the chance to make amends soon afterwards, Tarik Cetin saved his effort.\n\n\n\nDespite the second goal, the arrival of first-team regulars Ola Aina, Ibrahim Sangare, Igor Jesus and Callum Hudson-Odoi revived Forest a little, and it was Hudson-Odoi who lowered the collective heart rate inside the City Ground when his angled shot from 10 yards crept into the corner midway through the second half. Igor Jesus and Hutchinson then wasted chances to level it on the night as Forest edged through."

Following an eventful week of knockout play-off drama, the final 16 clubs have now been confirmed.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe seeded Blues were able to sit this stage out - having finished sixth during the league phase - but the draw has left them with two possible matchups, neither of which are particularly inviting. Chelsea will face either a fiery all-English showdown with Newcastle or a headline-grabbing encounter against reigning champions PSG.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNewcastle booked their place in the last 16 with a dominant 9-3 aggregate win over Qarabag, while PSG squeezed past Monaco 5-4 over two legs in a thrilling all-French battle.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nChelsea will be paired with one of those sides, while the other will meet Barcelona.

After a chaotic opening leg, Luis Enrique's men were pushed to the limit by Monaco, even though they spent significant periods of both matches playing against 10 men.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThey sit two points ahead of Lens at the Ligue 1 summit and are widely expected to secure a fifth consecutive domestic crown. However, their recent performances have been somewhat inconsistent. PSG closed out the Champions League group phase with two losses and two draws from five matches and they have also suffered domestic defeats to Rennes and local rivals Paris FC in recent weeks.\n\nEven so, the squad is packed with elite-level quality. Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Desire Doue - who scored twice in the first leg against Monaco - and Bradley Barcola make up one of the most dangerous forward lines in the game. With Vitinha, Joao Neves and Nuno Mendes orchestrating play behind them, PSG possess the quality and firepower to punish any opponent.\n\nView 4 Images Chelsea beat PSG in the final of the Club World Cup last year (Image: getty)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThere are, however, weaknesses at the back. They have shipped eight goals in their last four matches in all competitions and have managed just two clean sheets in Europe this term.\n\nChelsea will also draw confidence from their emphatic victory over PSG in the Club World Cup final last year. Few expected the Blues to prevail, yet they produced a superb display to claim a convincing 3-0 win and lift the trophy in style.\n\nOption 2: Newcastle\n\nAlthough Newcastle currently sit 11th in the Premier League table, they have looked transformed on the continental stage this season. They tore Qarabag apart in the play-offs, virtually settling the tie with a 6-1 first-leg rout before completing the job with a 3-2 success in the return fixture.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDuring the group phase, they registered victories over Benfica, PSV and Athletic Bilbao, and earned away draws against PSG and Bayer Leverkusen. That said, their domestic results have been disappointing recently. Eddie Howe's side have been beaten in four of their last five league outings - and six of their last nine matches in all competitions.\n\nView 4 Images Chelsea haven't the strongest of record against Newcastle recently (Image: getty)\n\nStill, Newcastle won't be pushovers. Chelsea are well aware of the intensity, physical battles and the electric environment at St James' Park that will come with drawing the Magpies. While league consistency has deserted them, European nights appear to inspire them - particularly the likes of Anthony Gordon and Bruno Guimaraes.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nChelsea's recent record against Newcastle since the PIF takeover is also concerning. The Blues have failed to win any of their last three meetings with the Toon and have claimed only three victories from their past nine encounters overall - with one of those successes requiring extra time.\n\nOn the other hand, Chelsea will believe they can find the net against Newcastle, who have conceded 17 goals in their last eight matches in all competitions. Notably, if the draw pairs the two sides together, they would meet three times within a week, as their upcoming Premier League fixture at Stamford Bridge would fall between the two European legs.\n\nView 4 Images Chelsea will face either PSG or Newcastle (Image: Dave Winter/Shutterstock)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR CHELSEA FB PAGE! Latest Blues news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nVerdict\n\nUltimately, PSG would represent the more daunting prospect for Chelsea. Newcastle pose a threat, but Chelsea would likely enter that tie as favourites given their stronger league form and greater squad depth. It would also mark the Blues' first European meeting with Premier League opposition since their victory over Manchester City in the 2021 Champions League final.\n\nPSG, by contrast, offer a different level of challenge. They are the defending champions, boast recent experience of lifting the trophy and have match-winners across the pitch capable of changing a contest instantly.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAn away night at St James' Park is never easy, but travelling to Paris to take on the holders is the scenario Chelsea will hope to avoid when the draw is made tomorrow."

            "content": "Kon Knueppel drops in a 3-pointer in the third quarter, setting the record for most 3-pointers made in a season for an NBA rookie. (0:18)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Charlotte's Kon Knueppel reached yet another milestone in a remarkable rookie season for the No. 4 pick out of Duke.\n\nThe Hornets swingman broke Keegan Murray's NBA rookie record for 3-pointers, making his 207th on Thursday night against the Indiana Pacers. Knueppel connected on five 3s in the first half and then broke the record in the third quarter off an assist from Sion James, his former college teammate with the Blue Devils.\n\nHe finished with 28 points in the 133-109 win, with his 8 3s (on 12 attempts) tying his career high and landing just one shy of tying the NBA rookie record. He leads the NBA with 209 3s.\n\n\"It's really just about making the right basketball play,\" Knueppel said after the win. \"My teammates are setting good screens and setting me up in good spots. The coaches as well. I'm just out there looking to make the right play for my team.\"\n\nIt took Murray 80 games in 2022-23 to establish the record -- and Knueppel just 59 to surpass it. He said he did not realize the magnitude of the shot that set the mark.\n\n\"Honestly, I thought I needed seven,\" Knueppel said.\n\nGolden State's Stephen Curry holds the single-season NBA record with 402 3s.\n\nKnueppel is shooting 44.2% from beyond the arc, making him a contender for NBA Rookie of the Year along with his former college teammate and roommate Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 pick of the Dallas Mavericks. He has also helped propel the long-suffering Hornets into playoff contention; Charlotte has not made the playoffs since the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"It's what elevates our whole culture when you have a guy that's that good, but that humble, no ego -- it becomes contagious throughout your whole organization,\" Hornets coach Charles Lee told CGTN Sports Scene after Knueppel eclipsed 200 3s on Tuesday night.\n\nKnueppel has been a perfect fit in second-year coach Lee's offense alongside playmaker LaMelo Ball by finding open spots on the court -- a skill he attributes to playing in his father's men's league against taller competition beginning as an eighth grader growing up in Milwaukee.\n\nKnueppel has thrived as a catch-and-shoot player with 93% of his 3s this season coming off assists entering Thursday night, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nHe has turned heads across the league with his high shooting percentage.\n\nCurry, the NBA's career leader in 3s, made 166 on 380 attempts as a rookie with the Warriors in 80 games in 2009-10. Knueppel has now attempted 473 3s.\n\n\"He can obviously shoot the ball at a high level,\" Curry said after a recent game against the Hornets. \"You can't really leave him open at all as he has such a quick release and shoots with confidence. And his playmaking is very underrated. His game just suits the NBA style, whether it's fast-paced or a slowed-down possession game.\"\n\nKnueppel surpassed Donovan Mitchell, who is third on the list of 3s made by a rookie, in a loss to the Cavaliers on Feb. 20.\n\nMitchell joked that he heard about it after the game from Cavs teammate Tyrese Proctor, who played with Knueppel at Duke.\n\n\"He's talented,\" Mitchell said of Knueppel. \"For him to be a rookie and be able to go out there and make it look effortless. ... We know he can shoot the ball, right? But I think him getting to the midrange and play-develop in the small pick-and-roll that is something I think is really unique about his game is being able to do that and create advantages for himself.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting with him and Coop for rookie of the year.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

His Buckeyes teammate Arvell Reese, the No. 3 player on Kiper's big board, also ran a 4.46 in the 40, tying them for the best times among all players who ran Thursday night.\n\nTo put Styles' vertical jump into context, it was better than Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who at 6-5, 239 pounds, had a 42½-inch vertical jump at the 2007 combine. Styles' jump was also better than current Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori, whose 43-inch jump was the best at the 2025 combine.\n\nStyles' broad jump was also best among all players who took part Thursday, and he was the only player among the defensive linemen and linebackers to top 11 feet.\n\nReese did not do any of the jumps in the workout, but did do position drills.\n\nStyles, who played almost exclusively at middle linebacker for the Buckeyes this past season, said earlier this week that he felt ready to show the league's personnel evaluators what he could do on the field.\n\n\"I think I would say that -- the great defenses you look at, there's at least two or three guys who can play a multitude of roles,'' Styles said. \"Like for example, this year for the Seahawks, Nick Emmanwori was a versatile player, and when you have guys like that on your defense, you're able to do a lot of different things as a coordinator.''"

Today I scored two goals, and that's what matters,\" Neymar told SporTV. \"That's football. One day you're no good or you're 'retired'; the next, people say you have to go to the World Cup.\n\n\"I'm dedicating myself and working to get in the best possible shape.

Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti has said repeatedly that Neymar would be considered for selection for the World Cup if he was fit.\n\nAfter scoring the opening goal in the 25th minute, the Santos No. 10 celebrated by heading to the corner flag to perform the same dance Vinícius Júnior did after scoring in both legs of the Real Madrid's Champions League playoff matchup against Benfica.\n\nVasco drew level before halftime, but Neymar scored again in the second half to put the game away for Santos.\n\nThe festive atmosphere for Neymar and Santos fans was briefly interrupted following a heated altercation with Vasco midfielder Thiago Mendes.

He already broke me once at PSG, and he threatened me again today. It's always the same with him,\" Neymar said.\n\nThis brace marks Neymar's first goals since December 2025, when he closed out the previous year with a two-goal performance against Juventude."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Division I football rules makers have proposed a one-year trial rule allowing a player disqualified for targeting for the first time to play in his team's next game regardless of which half the penalty was assessed, the NCAA announced Thursday.\n\nCurrently, players disqualified for targeting must sit out the rest of the game and, if the penalty occurs in the second half, sit out the first half of the next game.\n\nUnder the Division I Football Rules Subcommittee's proposal, a player disqualified for targeting a second time during the season would sit out the first half of the next game. A third targeting ejection in the same season would cause the offending player to sit out the entire next game.\n\nTargeting is forcible contact with an opponent's head or neck area in which the offending player often uses the crown of his helmet to make contact or launches his body into the opposing player above the shoulders.\n\nOversight committees for the Bowl Subdivision and Championship Subdivision must approve proposals before they become official. Those committees meet next month.\n\n\"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said A.J. Edds, rules subcommittee chair and vice president of football administration for the Big Ten. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n\nDress code:\n\nThe rules subcommittee proposed that players wear leg coverings from the top of their shoes to the bottom of their pants. Players would have to wear the same covering style and colors for that particular game.\n\nPlayers out of compliance with the rule would have to leave the game for at least one down and correct the issue. A team would receive a warning for the first offense.\n\nIf a team has a second offense under this proposal, the offending team would be given a 5-yard penalty. Any subsequent violations of the rule would result in a 15-yard penalty.\n\n\"The current look of the uniform is clearly not meeting the expectations of the college football community,\" Edds said. \"This will take a collective effort by administrators, coaches and officials to communicate expectations to players and equipment managers. This proposal, we believe, is definitive and gives us a chance for consistent enforcement across Division I football.\"\n\nTexas head coach Steve Sarkisian was amused by the proposal, saying, \"I'm just trying to figure out how we're going to police socks to pants.\"\n\n\"The NFL has that rule and they fine the players when they don't meet their uniform requirements,\" he said. \"Are we hiring uniform police that the NFL does, and they come and they assess every player and they dock them pay and they fine them for when they're suited properly? I would assume instead of worrying about socks to pants, are we going to tuck in our shirts? We've got T-shirts hanging out down to our knees now. There's a lot of things, but for that to come up as being an issue seems kind of odd.\"\n\nFair catch kicks:\n\nUnder a proposal, a team could choose to attempt a fair catch kick after a completed or awarded fair catch. The kick would be a field goal place kick with a holder or a drop kick from the spot where the returner caught the ball. The defense would be at least 10 yards from the spot of the kick.\n\nIf the ensuing kick goes through the uprights, it would be worth three points.\n\nSubcommittee members believe adding the rule would align Division I rules with those in the NFL and high school football. The rarely used play came up in 2024 in the NFL when the Los Angeles Chargers' Cameron Dicker converted from 57 yards against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

(2:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Miami Dolphins ranked first in the NFL Players Association annual report cards, according to survey results obtained by ESPN. The Minnesota Vikings finished second, followed by the Washington Commanders in third.\n\n\"Players consistently describe the organization as 'the best in the NFL,'\" the NFLPA survey wrote about the Dolphins.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished last for the first time in the four-year history of the union's survey. Last year, the Steelers ranked 28th. The Arizona Cardinals finished 31st in the 2026 survey, after a last-place finish in 2025, and the Cleveland Browns finished in 30th, the same as in 2025.\n\nThe NFLPA is not making the report cards public this year after a grievance filed by the NFL, which said the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. Earlier this month, an arbitrator agreed with the league, saying the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses for report cards even if it can't publish them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment.\n\nAn NFL spokesperson also declined to comment, saying that, as in previous years, the league had no knowledge of the survey. The league sent a memo to all teams later Thursday, saying that, as the arbitration hearing showed, the survey results are \"neither reliable nor scientifically valid.\"\n\n\"... We continue to recommend that clubs prioritize feedback and information provided directly by their own players rather than relying on the NFLPA's agenda-driven exercise,\" the league said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by ESPN. \"We further recommend that Clubs refrain from commenting or engaging publicly on the alleged survey and Report Card results.\"\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A-plus to F-minus on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and it was conducted from Nov. 2 to Dec. 11.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" according to the survey.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest-rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" according to the survey. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers' locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers' training room lacks updated recovery technology and \"modalities.\" Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, though the training staff ranked first.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium, \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A-plus to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the survey. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be, according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives, and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Parliament’s approval of the Ghana Accelerated National Reserve Accumulation Policy (GANRAP 2026–2028) has sparked renewed debate over transparency and policy continuity.\n\nKojo Oppong Nkrumah, Minority Spokesperson on the Economy and Development Committee, took centre stage to urge the government to be more candid.\n\nSpeaking on the floor of the House, he framed the discussion around the long-standing Domestic Gold Purchase Program, first introduced under former Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia.\n\n“The program was designed to boost the foreign reserves by buying local gold and either adding it to bullion or converting it into forex,” he said, noting that GANRAP essentially continues the same framework under a new name.\n\n“Ghanaians deserve honesty,” he stressed. “If this government finds the program useful, there is no need to rebrand it as something new. Admit that you inherited a working policy and build on it. Candour is central to credible economic management.”\n\nGANRAP's key feature is its ambitious goal of adding US$9.5 billion annually to Ghana’s reserves through weekly purchases of approximately 3.02 tonnes of gold.\n\nUnder the policy, the Ghana Gold Board (GOLDBOD) will procure gold from small-scale miners, while a pre-emptive right will allow the state to acquire 20% of output from large-scale mining companies.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance says the policy is expected to strengthen Ghana’s foreign reserves and provide 15 months of import cover by the end of 2028.\n\nWhile acknowledging the potential benefits, Mr Oppong Nkrumah raised concerns about recent inconsistencies in the government’s handling of gold reserves.\n\n“A few weeks ago, they sold 50% of our gold reserves and converted them into U.S. dollar-based assets. Now they are asking Parliament to approve the purchase of more gold to replenish reserves. Why sell at $4,000 per ounce, only to consider repurchasing weeks later at over $5,200?” he questioned.\n\nThe MP argued that the current government should embrace continuity rather than reinvention.\n\n“The Ghanaian voter is informed and understands economic policies. You don’t need to rebrand, rename, or polish inherited programs. What matters is building on them responsibly.”\n\nMr Oppong Nkrumah also commended the aspects of GANRAP that align with Dr Bawumia’s earlier G-4-R principles, which emphasised domestic resource mobilisation, results-based management, and the use of gold as a stabilising anchor for the Ghanaian currency.\n\nHowever, he warned that without transparency, the program risks public scepticism and could undermine confidence in national reserve management.\n\nParliamentarians largely supported the policy’s operationalisation, highlighting its potential to strengthen gross international reserves without further borrowing.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Minister for Lands and Natural Resources, Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah, has rejected assertions that excavators confiscated from illegal mining sites have gone missing.\n\nResponding to questions from Members of Parliament on Thursday, February 26, the Minister addressed concerns over how equipment seized during anti-galamsey operations is managed and monitored.\n\nIllegal small-scale mining, commonly referred to as galamsey, continues to pose significant environmental threats in Ghana, with excavators frequently cited as the primary tools driving the destruction of rivers, forest reserves and farmlands.\n\nOver time, critics have raised suspicions about the whereabouts of some machines impounded during enforcement exercises.\n\nHowever, Mr Armah-Kofi Buah dismissed suggestions of mismanagement, maintaining that detailed records exist for every excavator seized.\n\n“I wish to state categorically that no excavator seized is missing or unaccounted for. The military and the Ministry of Lands have data on all the seized excavators and their locations.”\n\nBeyond addressing the allegations, the Minister announced strengthened regulatory measures to curb the unchecked importation and movement of excavators — a factor widely blamed for fuelling illegal mining activities.\n\nHe revealed that government has introduced a nationwide digital tracking system designed to monitor earthmoving equipment across the country.\n\nThe initiative is being implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA), and the Minerals Commission.\n\n“In furtherance to our efforts to regulate the importation of excavators, the Ministry of Lands, in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, DVLA, and Minerals Commission, has rolled out a national excavator tracking system which provides a centralised national dashboard to monitor the movement and importation of earthmoving machines into the country.”\n\nThe Minister said the new platform will enhance transparency, strengthen oversight and support ongoing efforts to tackle illegal mining nationwide.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

The regulator has also signalled its readiness to enforce further action if the situation is not promptly resolved.\n\nSpeaking on Channel One TV on Thursday, February 26, Acting Executive Secretary of the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission, Dr Shafic Suleman, said consumer protection remains the Commission’s top priority.\n\n“The consumer must be protected, safeguarded and be able to have equal access to ECG and that is the focus. ECG is supposed to work timeously to solve the problem,” he said.\n\nDr Suleman expressed optimism that ECG would respond swiftly but cautioned that the Commission would not hesitate to invoke the appropriate legal measures should the company fail to comply with the directive.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Refuse, for instance, is a major headache for the organisation.\n\n\"The organisation pays so much. So much refuse is generated in the area, and we spend so much, and it is all coming from the revenue that we mobilise from the centre to be able to do that,” he added.\n\nManagement maintains that the rent adjustment is necessary to ensure proper maintenance and sustained operations at the market.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

She emphasised that she would always voice out her concerns.\n\n\n\nHer comments follow her controversial picketing against the government in 2023, under the leadership of former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, over the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP).\n\n\n\nSpeaking in an interview on Joy News on February 26, 2026, Akuffo said she would gladly participate in any form of protest if it was against unlawful actions that affected citizens.\n\n\n\n“You don’t sit there and just let unlawful things be done and if you feel strongly about it and there’s no one to listen to you, you shout it out,” she said.\n\n\n\nThe former head of the judiciary was seen holding a placard in 2023 that read, “We use our bond yields to pay our rent, medical bills, electricity bills and water bills.”\n\n\n\nShe had joined retirees demanding a total exemption from the controversial DDEP for their investments.\n\n\n\nFormer Chief Justice details how she joined protest against Akufo-Addo’s govt\n\n\n\nAkuffo explained that she was not part of the decision-making process that imposed “haircuts” on bondholders.\n\n\n\n“First and foremost, I wasn’t there in that boardroom when that decision was made to give people haircuts, whether they liked it or not. But even if I had been and I had disagreed and despite my strenuous position, it went ahead to the extent that I think it’s wrong and that it’s in the interest of the public to know that it’s wrong yes, I would have come out and done it.”\n\n\n\nShe insisted that her actions were a matter of principle.\n\n\n\n“So, it’s something which I always say, if I had to do it again, I would do it. Maybe it’s my home upbringing or how I understood my legal education. You don’t sit there and just let unlawful things be done and if you feel strongly about it and there’s no one to listen to you, you shout it out.”\n\n\n\nAkuffo further revealed how she joined the protest, “Fortunately, I saw that there were some people picketing and I saw somebody I knew on that picket line. I phoned her and said, was it you I saw? She said, yes. And I said, okay, are you going again? She said, yes.’ I said, Can I join?

Dankwa’s wife was a close associate of Nkrumah,” Kwesi Pratt said.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, Nkrumah’s popularity was also reflected at the polls, where JB Danquah is said to have lost elections in areas believed to be his political strongholds.\n\n\n\nHe further noted that some members of Nkrumah’s administration were drawn from Danquah’s extended family, demonstrating how far the CPP’s influence reached across political divides.\n\n\n\nKwesi Pratt also rejected suggestions that Nkrumah declared himself president for life. He argued that the 1960 Constitution clearly set a fixed term for the office.\n\n\n\n“Look, there’s nothing in the 1960 constitution which actually makes Nkrumah life president. In fact, the 1960 constitution imposed a five-year term on the presidency. They should stop.They should go read the Constitution again. Get their facts right,” he added.\n\n\n\nWatch the video below:\n\n\n\n\n\nEven J.B Danquah's wife abandoned him to join Kwame Nkrumah - Kwesi Pratt on the 'Nkrumah v Danquah' debate#GoodMorningGhana #MetroTV pic.twitter.com/5DcJvTy78e — Metro TV Ghana (@metrotvgh) February 25, 2026\n\nAK/AM"

I phoned her and said, was it you I saw? She said, yes. And I said, okay, are you going again? She said, yes. I said, Can I join? And so, I went.”\n\n\n\nEconomic dissonance threatens peace, security - Sophia Akufo\n\n\n\nDuring the 2023 protest, the former head of the judiciary was seen holding a placard that read, “We use our bond yields to pay our rent, medical bills, electricity bills and water bills.”\n\n\n\nAkuffo has maintained that she does not regret joining the demonstration and would gladly do it again if the need arises.\n\n\n\n“So, it’s something which I always say if I had to do it again, I would do it. Maybe it’s my home upbringing or how I understood my legal education. You don’t sit there and just let unlawful things be done, and if you feel strongly about it and there’s no one to listen to you, you shout it out.”\n\n\n\nAM\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, watch GhanaWeb’s exposé on the 'dark side of Kayamata' and its devastating impact"

Their swift action brought relief and hope to families who feared the worst,” he said in his message.\n\n\n\nHe concluded by urging continued support for the security agencies, stressing that the safety of Ghanaians on land and at sea remains a top priority for Parliament and the nation.\n\nThe Member of Parliament further called on the President, as a matter of urgency, to immediately nominate a substantive Minister for Defence.\n\n\n\nHe argued that the absence of a substantive minister exposes the country to security vulnerabilities, particularly at a time when threats in the sub-region are evolving.\n\n\n\nHe warned that terrorist and jihadist groups could exploit perceived weaknesses in the country’s security leadership structure if urgent steps are not taken to strengthen institutional oversight and coordination.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, watch GhanaWeb’s exposé on the 'dark side of Kayamata' and its devastating impact"

            "content": "Business News of Friday, 27 February 2026\n\nSource: classfmonline.com\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer of the Tree Crops Development Authority (TCDA), Andy Osei Okrah, says the $500 million commitment by President John Dramani Mahama to expand oil palm cultivation marks a decisive step toward transforming Ghana’s tree crops sector into a key driver of economic growth.\n\n\n\nThe funding will support the development of 100,000 hectares of new oil palm plantations, a programme projected to create around 250,000 jobs while helping the country diversify its agricultural base and reduce long-standing dependence on cocoa exports.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the Asaase Breakfast Show on Thursday, Okrah described the investment as evidence of government’s seriousness about the sector, noting that discussions are already ongoing with development partners and international financiers to mobilise the required funds.\n\n\n\n“That alone tells you the money is there,” he said.\n\n\n\n“Oil palm will lead, but all the crops have strong commercial potential.”\n\n\n\nBeyond oil palm, the broader strategy targets five additional crops — cashew, coconut, rubber, mango and shea — which the Authority believes can collectively reposition Ghana within the global agricultural value chain.\n\n\n\nTCDA projections suggest that each of the six crops could generate about $2 billion annually, lifting potential export earnings to as much as $12 billion per year through expanded production and value addition.\n\n\n\nCurrently, the entire tree crops segment brings in roughly $750 million, a small fraction of the $230 billion global market, underscoring significant growth opportunities.\n\n\n\nOkrah said investor appetite is already strengthening, with recent engagements drawing private sector commitments involving land acquisition and capital running into hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\n\nHe added that accountability will be central to implementation, with government-backed initiatives such as seedling distribution, grants and farmer support programmes subject to public tracking.\n\n\n\n“This is not a talk show. This is an impact investment drive,” he stated."

She described the reduction as unprecedented, noting that previous governments had prioritised farmers’ welfare.\n\n\n\nThe MP also highlighted the burden of high electricity tariffs on Ghanaians and called on the President to address the issue by outlining plans to make electricity more affordable.\n\n\n\n“If the President fails to address these two critical issues tomorrow, it will be surprising and would suggest that the government does not care about its people,” she emphasised.\n\n\n\nShe further stated that the government and Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) should absorb the cocoa sector’s debt rather than passing the burden on to farmers.\n\n\n\n“Farming is not easy, and the government should not make farmers suffer,” she added."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

Pakistan says it has also attacked Kandahar and Paktika inside Afghanistan.\n\nThe declaration on Friday comes hours after after Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah ⁠Mujahid said Afghanistan was carrying out “large-scale offensive operations” against the Pakistani military “along the Durand Line” that separates the two countries.\n\nThe Taliban said their attack was in response to a separate round of Pakistani air strikes earlier this week.\n\nHere is how world countries and institutions are reacting:\n\nUnited Nations\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is closely monitoring the situation, expressing deep concern over the surge in violence.\n\nIn a statement delivered by his spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, Guterres urged both nations to adhere strictly to their obligations under international law, with a specific emphasis on international humanitarian law.\n\nGuterres underscored the urgent need for both parties to prioritise the protection of civilians as confrontations continue.\n\nIran\n\nIran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who has been involved in intensive talks with the United States to avert conflict engulfing his own nation, has urged the two countries to resolve their differences through dialogue and good neighbourly principles, as he highlighted the significance of the holy month of Ramadan as a time for self-restraint and Islamic solidarity.\n\n\n\nIn a post on X early Friday, Araghchi reaffirmed Iran’s readiness to support the process, stating that his country is prepared to provide any necessary assistance to facilitate constructive dialogue, deepen mutual understanding, and promote cooperation between Kabul and Islamabad.\n\nRussia\n\nRussia has urged warring parties to ⁠halt cross-border attacks ‌immediately and resolve their differences through diplomatic ⁠means, the ⁠RIA news ⁠agency reported on ⁠Friday, ⁠citing foreign ministry. It has also offered to mediate if both sides agree.\n\nPakistan\n\nIn addition to blaming the Taliban for “terrorism” and instability within the country, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif says Islamabad “made every effort, both directly and through friendly countries, to keep the situation stable”.\n\n“It carried out extensive diplomacy. Today, when attempts are being made to target Pakistan with aggression, by the grace of God our armed forces are giving a decisive response,” he said on X.\n\n“Our patience has reached its limit.

The sources said that the strike occurred in an area outside the Israeli military’s control, and described the condition of some of the wounded as critical.\n\nIn the central Gaza Strip, two Palestinians were killed and others were injured in a similar Israeli drone strike that targeted a police post at the entrance to the Bureij refugee camp.\n\nHamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said that the rising number of deaths as a result of the ongoing Israeli bombardment across the Gaza Strip reflects “the Zionist occupation’s blatant disregard for the efforts of mediators, and its complete disregard for the Peace Council and its role”.\n\nQassem added, in a statement, that Israel is continuing its war of extermination against the Palestinian people, despite some changes to form and method, indicating that “the talk of the guarantor states about stopping the war lacks any real substance on the ground”."

            "content": "President Prabowo Subianto is trying to expand Indonesia’s global standing, but questions raised about role of military in Gaza peace plan.\n\nIndonesia is preparing to send 1,000 soldiers to Gaza within weeks, the first contingent of some 8,000 personnel that Jakarta has pledged to deploy to the Palestinian territory as part of an International Stabilization Force (ISF) under United States President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace.\n\nIndonesian army spokesperson Brigadier General Donny Pramono told news media the first troops are preparing to reach the enclave by April, and the majority will be on the ground in Gaza by June.\n\nBut as the hasty deployment approaches, some Indonesians are questioning what role their armed forces will play in the mission amid Israel’s genocidal war on the Palestinian territory.\n\nIndonesia is a seasoned participant in United Nations-led peacekeeping missions, but critics fear that without oversight by the UN, Indonesian forces could be used as “pawns” by the US – Israel’s foremost ally – to control Palestinians in Gaza and formalise the occupation of the enclave.\n\n“We are afraid that Indonesia will be used as the buffer to control the Palestinians,” Shofwan Al Banna Choiruzzad, an associate professor at the University of Indonesia, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Indonesia has built a reputation in Palestine as one of the most active partners on the ground. It would be very painful for both Palestinians and Indonesians if they see the Indonesian army becoming an instrument of the occupation,” Shofwan said.\n\n“The worry is that Indonesia will only be a shock absorber,” he said.\n\n“Indonesia will only be an actor which is used to establish legitimacy [for Israel’s occupation], and worse.”\n\n\n\nComplicating matters further is the fact that Indonesia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel owing to its long support for the Palestinian cause.\n\n“Indonesia needs to make clear that it will not be in the sectors which risk confrontation with Palestinian factions, [and] it will also not be in the Israeli-controlled areas – because that will require operational coordination with the Israeli army, which means practical recognition of Israel,” Shofwan said.\n\n‘Palestinians are seen as objects’\n\nIndonesia – with the world’s largest Muslim population – was the first among members of the Board of Peace to commit a specific number of soldiers to the ISF.\n\nJakarta’s pledge of peacekeepers was then followed by Kosovo, Morocco, Albania, and Kazakhstan, although they have not said their troops’ strength in the enclave.\n\nOfficials in Jakarta have stressed the country will play a “balancing” role on the Board of Peace alongside other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan.\n\nBut, as a longstanding supporter of a two-state solution and an independent Palestine, observers worry that Indonesia’s stance will be compromised by its involvement in the Gaza operation.\n\nIndonesian President Prabowo Subianto could also soon face difficult questions about the work of the Board of Peace and its plans for the reconstruction of Gaza and the future of the territory’s Palestinian population, analysts say.\n\nUniversity of Indonesia’s Shofwan said the Board of Peace and its approach to Gaza is fundamentally “colonial”.\n\n“It is designed to achieve negative peace without putting the rights and voices of Palestinians at the centre, and Palestinians are seen as objects,” he said.\n\n“They are seen to be something that needs to be controlled. There are no restraints towards Israel at all, so the design is very colonial,” Shofwan added.\n\nThe board’s executive committee comprises Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner; US Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East; Marc Rowen, CEO of Apollo Global Management; World Bank President Ajay Banga; former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair; and Robert Gabriel Jr, US deputy national security adviser.\n\nPalestinian participation in the board has been siloed into a “transitional committee” of apolitical technocrats led by Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority (PA) deputy minister.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, shortly after Prabowo signed on to the Board of Peace, representatives from some 40 civil society and religious groups in Indonesia met the president to discuss the Gaza mission, Indonesia’s state news agency Antara reported at the time.\n\nPrabowo told the groups he was prepared to withdraw from the Board of Peace if it “fails to advance the goal of an independent Palestine”, Antara reported, citing Muhammad Cholil Nafis, vice chairman of Indonesia’s top Islamic advisory body.\n\nIndonesia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also emphasised that the country’s troops will be in Gaza “solely to support Palestine’s recovery and its fight for independence and sovereignty”.\n\nIn addition to deploying troops to Gaza, Indonesia will also focus on humanitarian assistance and send several hospital ships.\n\nBut observers told Al Jazeera that Prabowo’s decision to join the Board of Peace reflected more his “personalised” style of leadership and his desire to be seen as a global player than a direct concern with the question of Palestine.\n\n“We participated with peacekeepers in Lebanon and [the Democratic Republic of the] Congo, but now the new president wants to make Indonesia diplomatically stronger on the global level,” said Yon Machmudi, an expert in Indonesian politics and international relations, also at the University of Indonesia.\n\n“This is also part of the motivation of the president to be involved in any kind of negotiations with the peace process,” he said.\n\n“I think Prabowo truly wants to leave a significant legacy, remembered as a president active in global peace, not only in the Middle East but also in other regions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war,” Machmudi said.\n\n‘It’s about maintaining optics’\n\nPrabowo, a former military general once banned from entering the US, has found himself in the global spotlight since being elected president in 2024, starting with his decision to visit China on his first international trip.\n\nHe has since visited Russia twice, skipping a Group of Seven meeting in June to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nMuhammad Zulfikar Rakhmat, director of the Indonesia-MENA desk at the Centre for Economic and Law Studies in Jakarta, told Al Jazeera that he believes Prabowo has been trying to get Trump’s attention.\n\nThe US president has a track record of responding to assertive and transactional leadership, and once said he gets along better with world leaders “the tougher and meaner they are”.\n\nCourting China and Russia was one step towards Prabowo getting US attention, while signing on to the Board of Peace and deploying Indonesian troops to Gaza was another, Rakhmat said.\n\nIn the mix of motivations for joining the board, Prabowo may also have been hoping for a better trade deal with the US after Trump unleashed trade tariffs last year. The White House initially planned to levy a “reciprocal” tariff of 32 percent on Indonesian exports, which was later cut down to 19 percent.\n\n\n\nThe Indonesian president late last week signed a formal trade deal with Trump on the sidelines of the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington, DC. The deal kept tariff rates at 19 percent, while Indonesia agreed to cut tariffs on 99 percent of its US imports. It is still unclear how the deal will be impacted by a landmark ruling on Friday from the US Supreme Court striking down the legal basis for many of Trump’s tariffs.\n\nRakhmat fears Prabowo’s ambition makes it less likely that he will push back if something goes wrong in the Gaza operation and Palestinians are negatively impacted.\n\nHe told Al Jazeera that Prabowo will likely “condemn” any operational drift in the Gaza plan, rather than withdraw completely from the Board of Peace.\n\n“People will expect more, but looking at his past behaviours, it is unlikely he will do something extraordinary,” Rakhmat said.\n\nThe Indonesian president “wants to have a good image among major powers. It’s about maintaining optics”, he said."

            "content": "Carney’s trip comes at a time when he’s looking for new markets for Canadian exports to diversify from the US.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is heading to India for what experts say is a “very significant trip” as he tries to reset relations between the two countries and find new markets for Canadian exports.\n\nWhile the trip, which starts Friday, is expected to be heavy on diplomacy, experts question whether it will result in major economic deals to shore up Canada’s economy.\n\nCarney has pledged to broaden the country’s trading partners as relations with its neighbour, the United States, fray. And India, with its 1.4 billion people, is a potentially large market for Canada’s vast petroleum and natural gas reserves, among other products.\n\nBut to build those economic bonds will require Carney to overcome diplomatic tensions and hesitancy about the costs of its exports, according to analysts.\n\n“Canada domestically needs to figure out to what extent it wants to grow its oil and gas industry,” said Tarun Khanna, professor at the University of British Columbia who focuses on energy policy.\n\n“Improvement in the overall relationship can provide incentives to both nations.”\n\nRepairing a diplomatic rupture\n\nPart of the hurdle for Carney is repairing recent diplomatic strains between his country and India.\n\nThe two countries engaged in a prolonged diplomatic freeze in September 2023, after Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau alleged that India was involved in the killing of a Sikh separatist activist on Canadian soil.\n\nIndia rejected the allegations as false, and both countries expelled each other’s diplomats.\n\n\n\nA breakthrough came last year when Carney invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Kananaskis, Alberta, to attend the Group of Seven (G7) leaders’ summit in June.\n\nSince then, relations have thawed. In September, both sides named new diplomats to serve as high commissioners to each other’s countries.\n\nIn the lead-up to this week’s meeting, more bilateral collaboration has unfolded. Officials from India and Canada have engaged in senior ministerial and working-level engagements in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), liquefied natural gas (LNG), critical minerals and supply chain resilience.\n\n“This is a very significant visit and allows Prime Minister Carney to consolidate a reset that began in the relationship last year,” said Vina Nadjibulla, vice president at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, a research institute.\n\nFinding alternative trading partners\n\nBut the rapprochement with India also comes in a transition period for Canada.\n\nThe US has long been its primary trading partner: It is the only country it shares a border with. But since the return of President Donald Trump to the White House, the US has taken an aggressive stance towards trade with Canada.\n\nTrump has stacked steep tariffs on key Canadian exports like steel, aluminium and automobile parts. He also suggested he would like Canada to cede its sovereignty and become a state within the US.\n\nCarney has resisted such efforts, including by imposing counter-tariffs on US goods.\n\nBut in January, he gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he outlined his vision for “middle-power” states to break from the superpowers that seek their “subordination”.\n\n“From the fracture, we can build something bigger, better, stronger, more just,” Carney said.\n\n“This is the task of the middle powers: the countries that have the most to lose from a world of fortresses and the most to gain from genuine cooperation.”\n\nCarney’s trip to India, followed by Australia and Japan, is his first major trip to Asia following his Davos speech. Experts say the outing will give him a stage on which to spread his appeal for “genuine cooperation” among smaller economies.\n\n“It allows him to take that message of middle-power diplomacy to India, Australia and Japan, the three most significant for Canada in the Indo-Pacific region,” said Nadjibulla.\n\nThe trip also comes at a time when, on the domestic front, Carney’s top priority is to strengthen economic resilience, make sure investments keep flowing into Canada, and protect industries that have been hit by Trump’s tariffs.\n\n\n\nAs part of that push, Carney visited China last month, becoming the first Canadian prime minister to do so in almost a decade.\n\nA market for Canadian energy\n\nCarney’s latest trip is expected to yield announcements on Canadian exports of oil, natural gas, uranium and critical minerals, as well as cooperation with India on developing nuclear power as a clean energy source.\n\nThe outreach effort is “part of Carney’s strategy” to diversify its economic trading partners and find new markets for its products, according to MV Ramana, an expert in energy and security at the University of British Columbia.\n\nCanada is the fourth-largest exporter of crude oil in the world, and the fifth-largest oil producer overall. Its crude exports were valued at more than $100.7bn in 2024 alone.\n\nBut Ramana believes that negotiations will also centre on Canada’s uranium. The North American country is the world’s second-largest producer of the metal, which is key to nuclear power production.\n\n“Canada is trying to position itself as an exporter, a petro-state of sorts — not just for oil and gas, but also critical minerals and uranium,” Ramana said.\n\nIndia has a long history of nuclear cooperation with Canada, which provided it with a research reactor in the 1950s for its nascent nuclear programme.\n\nIt has continued to import uranium from Canada, and the two countries are in the midst of finalising a 10-year, $2.8bn deal that would ensure a supply of the metal to India.\n\nGiven that backdrop, Ramana said he expects to see announcements on small modular reactors for nuclear energy, even though there are currently only a few operating in Russia and China.\n\nThe first in North America — the Darlington New Nuclear Project — is in the works in Ontario, and Carney appears to be angling for Canada to become a leader in such small-scale reactors. But it won’t be easy, warned Ramana.\n\n“These are supposed to be cheaper, but they also produce far less power. As a result, the cost per unit of power generation will be much higher,” he said.\n\nAnother complication is the fact that the licence for the modular reactor design is owned by a US company.\n\nThat means the US will need to be involved, said Ramana, a tricky balance as Carney continues to be in the crosshairs of Trump.\n\n‘Combination of price and strategic decision’\n\nWith the largest population in the world, India’s already-huge energy demands are expected to keep increasing.\n\nKhanna, the energy policy expert, said that means there is likely to be negotiation about fossil fuels as well during Carney’s trip.\n\n“We don’t know what will materialise, but given the Indian energy situation, oil and gas is one thing that will be on the table,” said Khanna.\n\nBut India has also faced backlash under Trump about where it sources its energy supply from.\n\nIn August, the US president slapped an additional 25 percent tariff on India, doubling his tariffs on the South Asian nation to 50 percent, as a penalty for its import of Russian oil.\n\nThat was finally rolled back this month, and US tariffs on India were brought down to 18 percent, though that rate, among others, was overturned by a decision from the US Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nNow, the current US tariffs on Indian imports sit at 10 percent. But experts have warned that Trump’s tariff policies have sown uncertainty among the US’s trading partners, including India.\n\nSo New Delhi is looking to secure its oil supplies, and Canada is looking for new buyers, Khanna said. But price will ultimately be the key.\n\n“India is a price-sensitive market, so the Indian side will be looking for deals that secure supplies but at a reasonable price,” he pointed out.\n\nIf Ottawa seeks to increase its market, “then it’s up to them to see what kind of incentives they can hand out”, Khanna added.\n\nFor India to sign a deal, “it will have to be a combination of price and strategic decision”."

            "content": "Palestinians in the devastated enclave struggle to manage their daily lives amid shortage of cash caused by war.\n\nGaza City – Amid the buzz of customers in the Remal neighbourhood in Gaza City, Samar Abu Harbied stops at a small, makeshift roadside stall to buy groceries to prepare an Iftar meal for her family, to break their fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nWith no cash in her purse, the 45-year-old housewife asks the grocer if she could put the bill on credit, until her husband or son could wire the money to him.\n\n“I have not touched a paper note for months. I don’t even have money to pay for a taxi. Now we walk a lot, for long distances,” Abu Harbied said.\n\nNajlaa Sukkar, 48, was trying to catch her breath at the same stall, which is run by her son Abdallah, after a failed journey on foot to see a doctor for a post-surgery check-up and to buy medication.\n\nNajlaa said she did not have enough money to pay the 30 shekel (US$9.5) check-up fees, and the only banknote she had, a 20-shekel bill, was so worn out that the pharmacist turned it down.\n\n“I returned without receiving medical care,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\n“At the pharmacy, they didn’t accept the banknotes as they were frayed. The taxi driver didn’t accept a banknote, only small change, which I don’t have. It is very difficult to get by. What a mess, we don’t know what to do!”\n\nPalestinians in the Gaza Strip are struggling to conduct their daily lives amid a severe cash flow problem imposed by Israel immediately after it embarked on its genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023.\n\nA US-brokered ceasefire that went into effect in October has brought little reprieve to Palestinians, who are still using worn-out currency they had from before the war, or must rely on a new system of electronic payments conducted through smart telephones amid limited internet coverage.\n\n\n\nPalestinians in Gaza use the Israeli currency, the shekel, in their daily transactions, and depend on Israel to supply banks with new banknotes and coins.\n\nElectronic payments\n\nPalestinians were forced to turn to a digital payment system as a way to get around a severe shortage of Israeli shekel banknotes, a problem that has been exacerbated by the destruction of an estimated 90 percent of bank branches and cash machines.\n\nThe Palestinian Monetary Authority, working with internet service providers, has pushed for mobile-based electronic payments, including PalPay and Jawwal Pay, to help Palestinians overcome the liquidity problem.\n\nAbu Harbeid said her son switched to electronic payments after he faced many problems using the 50 shekels per shift he was receiving while working as a night guard.\n\n“My son, Shady, was receiving his daily wage in cash, which was worn and torn. We could hardly break it into smaller change or buy anything, as sellers don’t accept overused paper bills,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Moreover, the seller doesn’t accept it unless I spend it all, as they don’t have change. Now, as he is paid into his bank account, we buy everything through bank apps,” she added.\n\nBut digital payments have added another layer of hardship to a large segment of the population.\n\nMost Palestinians still do not receive bank-transferred salaries, many lack access to smartphones, and those who have phones struggle to keep them charged in an area where electricity services are in severe crisis.\n\nTo add to that, there is still the problem of finding a good internet connection for the transfer process.\n\nAbu Harbeid said a proper trip to the market requires her to have her husband or son with her to pay for goods. But neither can leave work to join her.\n\n“I prefer cash in my hand; I could buy anything on the go,” Abu Harbied said.\n\nNot only a liquidity shortage issue\n\nAnalysts say Gaza’s current economic reality started as a liquidity crisis, but has become an issue of transition from a regulated financial system to a fragmented survival economy shaped by scarcity, informality, and political constraints.\n\n“However, as the months passed, the crisis evolved into something far more structural,” Ahmed Abu Qamar, member of the board of directors of the Palestinian Economists Association, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\n\n“The black market now plays a dominant role in determining liquidity conditions. A small group of traders effectively manages cash circulation through high-commission cashing operations.”\n\nHe said that when money itself becomes a traded commodity, it signals severe distortion in the monetary system. “Cash, like any commodity, becomes subject to supply and demand dynamics. When it becomes scarce, its value increases beyond its nominal worth. From an economic perspective, this represents a structural disruption of the monetary system.\n\n“The formal banking sector and the Palestinian Monetary Authority were sidelined. What we are seeing is the neutralisation of the formal monetary system,” he said.\n\nAbu Qamar said the deeper issue was confidence – not just in cash, but in the financial system as a whole. “Cash is inherently difficult to track, whereas electronic payments are traceable and can be frozen or restricted. Implementing such a transition abruptly produces severe economic and social distortions,” he warned.\n\n“Widespread selling on credit is not a sign of market stability – it is an indicator of declining incomes and weakened purchasing power. When debt expands rapidly without a parallel increase in income, the result is social fragmentation. Approximately 95 percent of households in Gaza depend on aid,” he added.\n\nProfiteering from Gaza’s woes\n\nThe war has paved the way for middlemen to cash in illegally on the financial woes of Gaza, residents said.\n\nSukkar said that when her husband or sons needed cash, they were often forced to deal with brokers who charge a hefty commission that could reach 50 percent.\n\n“We lose our money to them for nothing; they steal from us under our full consent,” she said.\n\nMany residents, like Abu Harbeid, also do not trust bank transfers, saying they prefer physical cash in hand.\n\n“I ask my sons, where does that money in the account appear?” said Sukkar.\n\n“Who holds our money in their hands? I used to see money and count it, the banknotes and the change. On some days, when there are technical problems with the bank applications, we get nervous about the possibility of losing the money in their accounts,” she added.\n\nAbdallah Sukkar, whose family ran a well-known family store in the Shujayea area in eastern Gaza before the war, said families who receive direct deposit salaries often buy with bank transfers.\n\n“But I don’t like this method; I prefer cash,” he said.\n\nHe said he accepts all banknotes, whether new or worn-out ones, and allows people to buy on credit, but admitted that all of that affects his ability to make improvements to the roadside stall he now runs in place of his family’s old business.\n\nHe also complained of unpaid debts, adding that debts had soared by more than 500 percent during the war, while his profits barely reach 2 percent. He said he had given out 20,000 shekels’ worth of goods to new customers, “all of [whom] have become customers during the war”.\n\n\n\n“People don’t have money; I can’t turn them away when they come to buy food on credit. It’s already catastrophic in Gaza,” he said.\n\n“From the beginning of Ramadan till now, I haven’t had banknotes and change, which affects the sales. I don’t have small change to give to people who have cash, so they turn to other stalls or shops.\n\n“Yesterday, when the bank application stopped, we were terrified that we might lose our money in the bank,” he said."

            "content": "Both sides say Pakistan has bombed targets in Kabul, Kandahar and Paktia in an escalation of recent tit-for-tat attacks.\n\nPakistan has bombed Afghanistan’s capital Kabul and other cities, claiming to have killed scores of Afghan Taliban fighters, as Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said Islamabad would now be waging “open war”.\n\nIn a major escalation of the simmering tensions into all-out conflict between the neighbours, Asif said on Friday that his country’s “patience has run out” with the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan, following attacks by Afghan forces against Pakistani military positions along their shared border earlier.\n\nAsif framed the attack as one that his country had been forced to make, and followed “aggression” from Afghanistan.\n\nAfghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said that Pakistani military had struck targets in Kabul, Kandahar, and in Paktia province, but claimed there were no casualties.\n\nAl Jazeera’s correspondent in Kabul, Nasser Shadid, reported early on Friday that a bombing raid targeted the Afghan capital at 1:50am local time (21:20 GMT, Thursday), followed by a second air raid.\n\nAfghan anti-aircraft guns opened fire after the first raid and continued firing after the second, according to Shadid.\n\nAn Afghan government source confirmed to Al Jazeera that an air strike had hit Kabul, and Pakistani warplanes also hit a military base in Kandahar province in southern Afghanistan.\n\nMosharraf Zaidi, the spokesperson for Pakistan’s prime minister, claimed that 133 Afghan Taliban fighters had been killed in Pakistan’s attacks on Friday, and more more than 200 wounded, and that Taliban positions had been targeted in Kabul, Kandahar and Paktia.\n\n\n\nZaidi said that nine Taliban positions had been captured and 27 destroyed, while adding that Pakistani attacks were continuing.\n\nAl Jazeera has not been able to independently verify the various claims of casualties inflicted by either side.\n\nEarlier attacks\n\nThe strikes followed attacks by Afghan forces late on Thursday on Pakistani positions on the border shared by the two countries.\n\nAn Afghan military source told Al Jazeera that 10 Pakistani soldiers were killed in the attacks, and 13 outposts were captured.\n\nThe source added that the attacks were a response to Pakistani attacks on Afghan positions in the border region on Sunday.\n\nPakistan claimed that its attacks on Sunday had killed at least 70 fighters, but Afghanistan rejected the claim, saying that civilians had been killed.\n\nPoor relations\n\nA statement from the office of Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the whole country was united behind Pakistan’s armed forces.\n\n“The people of Pakistan and its Armed Forces are fully prepared to safeguard the nation’s security, sovereignty, and territorial integrity,” the statement said. “There will be no leniency in defending our beloved homeland, and any aggression will be met with a fitting response.”\n\nRelations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which share a 2,611-kilometre-long (1,622-mile) border, have nose-dived since fighting in October killed more than 70 people on both sides of the border.\n\nThe tension stems from Pakistani accusations that Kabul has allowed armed groups such as the Pakistan Taliban to use Afghanistan as a base and launch attacks on Pakistan.\n\nThe Pakistan Taliban shares deep ideological ties with the Taliban in Afghanistan, but is a distinct movement.\n\n“Pakistan made every effort to keep the situation normal through direct means and through friendly countries,” said Asif. “It engaged in full-fledged diplomacy. But the Taliban became a proxy for India.”\n\n“In the past, Pakistan’s role has been positive. It has hosted five million Afghans for 50 years. Even today, millions of Afghans are earning their livelihood on our soil. Our cup of patience has overflowed. Now it is open war between us and you,” Asif said.\n\nFormer Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai said on X that Afghans would “defend their beloved homeland with complete unity in all circumstances and will respond to aggression with courage” amid the attacks.\n\n“Pakistan cannot free itself from the violence and bombings – those problems it has created itself – but must change its own policy and choose the path of good neighbourliness, respect, and civilised relations with Afghanistan,” he said.\n\n\n\n‘Grave escalation’\n\nReporting from Islamabad, Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder said that “from what we have seen so far, heavy casualties have been inflicted”.\n\n“This is a grave escalation, probably the worst since the Taliban took over.”\n\nElizabeth Threlkeld, director of the South Asia Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, DC, said the latest clashes came as no surprise following months of “frayed” tensions between the neighbours.\n\n“It is significant to the extent that it represents perhaps a shift in strategy,” Threlkeld said, noting the “more aggressive, kinetic attacks” from Pakistan.\n\n“We’ve seen a couple of terrorist attacks within Pakistan that were quite significant,” she said. “I’m not surprised that after those cumulative attacks, that tensions have frayed and things have again gone in this direction, unfortunately.”\n\nCalls for restraint\n\nThe United Nations has called for urgent de-escalation. “[UN Secretary-General] Antonio Guterres urges the parties to uphold their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, and to ensure the protection of civilians,” Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General, said.\n\n“The Secretary-General urges the parties to continue seeking to resolve any differences through diplomatic channels and commends the mediation efforts undertaken by several Member States in recent months,” he added.\n\nIran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi urged Afghanistan and Pakistan to resolve their differences through dialogue and good neighbourly principles, saying in a post on X his country was ready to support the process.\n\nMeanwhile, Zalmay Khalilzad, a former United States ambassador to Afghanistan, said earlier on Thursday that the tit-for-tat attacks over recent days were a “terrible dynamic that must stop”.\n\n“A better option is a diplomatic agreement between the [two] countries that neither would allow its territory to be used by individuals and groups to threaten the security of the other,” Khalilzad said.\n\n“The implementation of the agreement should be monitored by a trusted [third] party, for example, Turkiye. This approach is a much wiser course than continuing with attacks and counterattacks.”"

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nLess than 24 hours before the deadline in an ultimatum issued by the Pentagon, Anthropic has refused the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted access to its AI.\n\nIt’s the culmination of a dramatic exchange of public statements, social media posts, and behind-the-scenes negotiations, coming down to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s desire to renegotiate all AI labs’ current contracts with the military. But Anthropic, so far, has refused to back down from its two current red lines: no mass surveillance of Americans, and no lethal autonomous weapons (or weapons with license to kill targets with no human oversight whatsoever). OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to the new terms, while Anthropic’s refusal had led to CEO Dario Amodei being summoned to the White House this week for a meeting with Hegseth himself, in which the Secretary reportedly issued an ultimatum to the CEO to back down by the end of business day on Friday or else.\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, Amodei wrote, “I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community.”\n\nHe added that the company has “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner” but that in a “narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values” — going on to specifically mention mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons. (Amodei mentioned that “partial autonomous weapons … are vital to the defense of democracy” and that fully autonomous weapons may eventually “prove critical for our national defense,” but that “today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons.” He did not rule out Anthropic acquiescing to the military’s use of fully autonomous weapons in the future but mentioned that they were not ready now.)\n\nThe Pentagon had already reportedly asked major defense contractors to assess their dependence on Anthropic’s Claude, which could be seen as the first step to designating the company a “supply chain risk” – a public threat that the Pentagon had made recently (and a classification usually reserved for threats to national security). The Pentagon was also reportedly considering invoking the Defense Production Act to make Anthropic comply.\n\nAmodei wrote in his statement that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” He also wrote that “should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.”"

The company will shrink from more than 10,000 people to less than 6,000, Dorsey says in a post on X. And the reason why? AI.\n\n“We’re not making this decision because we’re in trouble,” Dorsey says. “Our business is strong. Gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving. But something has changed. We’re already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. And that’s accelerating rapidly.”\n\nDorsey opted to do a big layoff instead of gradual cuts because “I’d rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome.”\n\nThe layoffs were announced on Thursday as part of the company’s Q4 2025 earnings. In a shareholder letter, Dorsey says that “We believe Block will be significantly more valuable as a smaller, faster, intelligence-native company. Everything we do from here is in service of that.”"

Even the controllers are convertible: the right side controller can be used as a vertical mouse in “FPS Mode,” similar to the mouse mode on the Legion Go 2 or the Nintendo Switch 2. The right-side controller also has a built-in display that shows performance metrics and settings and doubles as a touchpad.\n\nThe Legion Go Fold is rumored to include an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V CPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 48 Whr battery. According to WindowsLatest, Lenovo plans to announce it as a concept device at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona next week, although it likely wouldn’t be commercially available right away, if ever."

I asked Samsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the executive in charge of both R&D and operations for Samsung’s mobile business. He says the added thickness of magnets is a bad tradeoff to make, because you’re just going to buy a case anyhow.\n\n“About 80 or 90 percent of people are using a case, and cases with magnets are very popular these days,” he tells me.\n\nSamsung would rather use that extra height to give the phone a larger battery or make it thinner, he says.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Samsung isn’t looking into magnets. “We’re still doing a lot of research to make sure we don’t have any sacrifice inside the phone; when we actually achieve that, we’ll integrate,” he says.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with Choi’s premise. I want extra battery and magnets, and I’m willing to sacrifice thinness to get it. Phones are thin enough already, except for the ones that fold.\n\nAnd if Samsung took charge of the magnets like Apple, and replicated Apple’s standard pattern and strength, maybe the magnet case I use with my Galaxy S25 would properly and firmly hold onto magnetic battery packs without them rotating in place. Since there’s no magnets inside my phone, I’m at the mercy of casemakers.\n\nBut I get it. Why make the tradeoff if someone will pay for a case anyhow? Seems like we need to ask Apple and Google why they chose differently."

That’s according to the latest report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), which forecasts smartphone shipments to plummet 12.9 percent this year, marking its “lowest annual shipment volume in more than a decade.”\n\nAt the same time, the average selling price for smartphones is set to hit new highs, with IDC predicting a 14 percent increase to a record $523. “While memory prices are projected to stabilize by mid-2027, they are unlikely to return to previous level,” IDC senior researcher Nabila Popal says, adding that the sub-$100 phone segment will become “permanently uneconomical.” Next week, Apple is rumored to announce a new edition of its budget smartphone as the “iPhone 17e,” which could give a hint about where things are going.\n\nThe memory shortage is expected to impact budget-friendly Android smartphones the most, as the rising costs of components leave them with “no choice but to pass the costs on to end users,” Francisco Jeronimo, the vice president for IDC’s Worldwide Client Devices, says in the report. That could result in smaller brands exiting the industry, while allowing Apple and Samsung to grab more market share, according to Popal."

Now, Samsung is confirming what we previously only suspected: RAMageddon is partly to blame.\n\nSamsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the COO of its mobile business, tells The Verge that the memory shortage alone made a “significant contribution” to the price. All the increasing material costs factored into the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus costing $100 more than their predecessors this year, as did tariffs, but the memory was “significant,” he tells me.\n\nRelated The RAM shortage is coming for everything you care about\n\nThe S26 does come with double the storage this year at its higher price, with 256GB rather than 128GB, though its $899 price tag is still $40 higher than an S25 with 256GB cost at launch. And though tariffs may have been a factor as well, Samsung has hiked the price in other regions too, not just the United States. The pricier S26 Ultra does come with intriguing upgrades, however, including a built-in privacy screen and the largest vapor chamber cooling system in a phone.\n\nSamsung chip partner Qualcomm warned in its February quarterly results that it was seeing a big dip in its handset business “100 percent” due to the memory shortage, telling investors that the AI industry’s appetite for components would likely define the entire scale of the phone industry all year long.\n\nAnd today, IDC is forecasting the largest drop ever recorded in worldwide smartphone shipments, a dip of 12.9 percent, across 2026. “What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,” writes IDC."

Discovery.\n\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for the legacy studio, and would walk away from the deal.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\n\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\n\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration shelved or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\n\nNetflix had announced its intent to acquire WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks. Paramount’s newest bid, of $31 a share, values WBD at about $111 billion.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey announced that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly half its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.\n\nIt isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\n\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\n\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\n\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The Department of Defense has attempted to force Amodei’s hand by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding. The DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense.\n\nAmodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”\n\nHe added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”\n\nAnthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "In Brief\n\nGoogle announced earlier this week that it was building a new data center in Minnesota that would be powered by a mix of wind, solar, and a very unique battery built by startup Form Energy that’s capable of discharging for days on end.\n\nNow we know the price tag for that feat of electrochemical engineering: about $1 billion, according to The Information.\n\nForm Energy’s massive iron-air battery is capable of delivering a continuous 300 megawatts of electricity over 100 hours. It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.\n\nThe startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.\n\nWith a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round. Form has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook. The company plans to go public next year."

            "content": "Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\n\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nSurprise guests at Prada pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 26, 2026\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\n\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\n\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you."

            "content": "As space companies itch to push the most advanced chips into orbit, the problem of cooling those high-powered processors is top of mind.\n\n“It’s cold in space … [but] there’s no airflow, and so the only way to dissipate is through conduction,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said when asked about space-based data centers during his firm’s most recent earnings call.\n\nNow, Sophia Space has raised $10 million from investors, including Alpha Funds, KDDI Green Partners Fund, and Unlock Venture Partners. The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.\n\nCompanies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob DeMillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monnin — have a different approach.\n\nThe company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.\n\nWhile technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a similar realization.)\n\nSophia, an Nvidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are 1 meter by 1 meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, DeMillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nBy the 2030s, Sophia hopes to be building larger space data centers out of thousands of TILEs, envisioning a 50-meter-by-50-meter structure delivering 1 MW of computing power. DeMillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute.\n\nFirst, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include Earth-observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks.\n\n“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” DeMillo told TechCrunch."

            "content": "A rise in the need for computers and data centers to power AI is causing a massive shortage of RAM, driving memory prices sharply higher. Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest single-year dip in more than a decade.\n\nEarlier this year, IDC reported that manufacturers shipped 1.26 billion devices in 2025. The firm predicts that figure will drop to just 1.12 billion this year.\n\n“The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping the long‑term TAM [total addressable market], the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, in a statement.\n\nImage Credits:IDC\n\nPopal said that because of memory shortage, the average retail price of a smartphone is expected to rise by 14%.\n\n“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, smartphone ASP [average selling price] is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she added.\n\nPopal also noted that rising component costs could make the sub-$100 smartphone “permanently uneconomical,” pricing out phone makers that manufacture devices at that price point.\n\nThe firm said that, because of this trend, shipments in the Middle East and Africa will drop more than 20% year-over-year. China and the broader Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan) will also see declines of 10.5% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The ‘more specs for less money’ model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.\n\n“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei added."

But the Lowe’s hardware store empire is plenty big these days. A tool-filled Lowe’s superstore is now about as big as a New York City block. The focus stays mostly on appliances and tools for the home DIYer, more than large building contractors. I like to pop in for grill and griddle tools, or just some propane. But you can also buy a pre-finished door complete with the frame—or the lumber, sanders, routers, and saws you’d use to make your own door, including the hinges and the wood stain. It’s easy to get lost in the endless aisles if you love the smell of plaster and wood dust, but it’s easier to find the best Lowe’s deals on the website. This roundup includes Lowe’s daily deals, a promo code, and Lowe's offer code for 40% off appliances, plus info on the Lowe’s rewards program and military discounts.\n\nQuick Ways to Save at Lowe’s: Text Alerts and Daily Deals\n\nLowe’s wants to be able to tell you about its deals, hoping you’ll be tempted to take advantage of them. If you’re a consistent DIYer, it’s likely worth getting a heads-up on the Lowe’s Deals of the Day, delivered to your phone via text message. This might be anything from drills to snow blowers or lawn mowers, plus the best package deals on appliances, refrigerators, washers, and dryers. Each of these deals is one-day only. If you \n\nJoin the MyLowe’s Rewards Program, Get Maximum Benefits\n\nIf you’re planning on doing some major work this year, or just like to putter around, it’s probably worth picking up a MyLowe’s Rewards Program membership. Each eligible purchase accrues points that’ll pay out in increments of $5 in-store credit at Lowe’s. Like a lot of loyalty programs, you get more benefits if you spend more at the store, including free shipping on all purchases including the small ones, member-only discounts, and point boosters for better discounts.\n\nThere are three tiers of memberships, depending what you buy. One large appliance might already qualify you for the highest tier of rewards, at which point you might as well. These are the three tiers, based on the total cost of what you’ve bought at Lowe’s in the past year. Bronze ($0-$499): $35 minimum for free shipping; 1 point per $1 spent. Silver ($500-$1,999): Free shipping; 1.25 points per $1 spent. Gold ($2,000+): Free shipping; 1.5 points per $1 spent.\n\nFor contractors, there’s a separate MyLowe’s Pro Rewards Program that offers Lowe’s in-store credit in increments of $1 for every 100 points earned. (Points expire in half-yearly increments, on June 30 and December 31.) Benefits include member-only deals, volume discounts, free standard shipping in the contiguous United States, and a 20% paint discount after annual spend of $3,000 or more. Other benefits include analytics and spend reports, online order quoting, and purchase authorization for specified crew members.\n\n10% Military Discount, Plus Free MyLowe’s Silver Status\n\nAll verified active military, veterans, and military spouses are eligible for a 10% discount on full-price items—meaning things don’t have to be on sale to be on sale. This is available through what Lowe’s calls the Everyday Military Discount program. When you enroll, you also get an immediate upgrade to Silver status on the MyLowe’s Rewards program, which means more rewards points earned per dollar, and free shipping on all orders in the contiguous United States.\n\nGet a free Silver status upgrade instantly when you enroll in our Military Discount program and validate through ID.me. MyLowe’s Rewards Silver status members receive free standard shipping (excludes AK and HI) and earn more points per dollar.\n\nSave 5% on Everyday Purchases at Lowe’s\n\nLike a lot of big retailers, Lowe’s also has a store credit card with discounts attached. The MyLowe’s Rewards Credit Card offers 5% off qualified purchases, with a whole bunch of asterisks. Specifically, the discount applies after all other discounts and can’t be combined with other programs like contractor bulk discounts, employee discounts, or military discounts. It also doesn’t work on Weber, Miele, or Kichler products. Scroll to the bottom here, for APR and exceptions. The smart person signs up during a big purchase: When you sign up and get approved, you get 20% off an in-store purchase (up to $100 off).\n\nAnother way to get 5% off on items you need regularly is to set up a Lowe’s subscription. This is good for items ranging from cleaning products, air and water filters, lawn care, pet goods, plumbing, and batteries. Shipping is free, and delivery happens automatically."

            "content": "Iowa lawmakers voted to advance state House bill 751 last week, legislation that would ensure farmers in the state can freely repair their own agricultural equipment, like tractors. This Tuesday, the bill was renamed to House File 2709, and it will be voted on again. Should the political winds align, it will go through the Iowa House and Senate before the Iowa Legislature adjourns on April 21.\n\nThe bill is the first of nearly 57 state bills supported by repair advocates across the country in 2026. Many of them focus on farm equipment in states like Oklahoma, Wyoming, Delaware, and West Virginia. Repair advocates hope a win in Iowa—the second-highest-grossing state in the US for agricultural products, behind California—will help further legislative and broader efforts to make phones, cars, and other devices more repairable.\n\n“This isn't just a blue state thing; this isn't just a Colorado activist thing,” says Elizabeth Chamberlain, director of sustainability for the right-to-repair advocate arm of iFixit. “Its real. Farmers have trouble repairing their equipment and want change.”\n\nFarmers and their tractors have long been a focal point of the right-to-repair movement, the ever-growing global effort to let product owners fix their own devices and equipment without manufacturer approval. Farmers who use tractors to plant, cultivate, and harvest crops often need to repair their equipment while they work. Waiting for manufacturer approval to get something fixed, or taking the time to bring the equipment to an approved dealership, can cause delays, frustration, and missed opportunities to harvest crops.\n\nThe Iowa bill defines which agricultural equipment it covers, including tractors, trailers, combines, sprayers, balers, and other equipment used to cultivate and harvest crops. It excludes aircraft and irrigation equipment, along with jet skis and snowmobiles.\n\nManufacturers would also be required to provide owners with data—documentation, like manuals, and access to embedded operating software—on their tractors, including future patches and fixes, all without charging for it or requiring authorization for internet access. The bill also limits the use of digital locks—software restrictions that prevent accessing features without manufacturer approval.\n\nOh Deere\n\nThe most prominent opposition to the Iowa bill is tractor manufacturer John Deere, which has a long history of opposing repair efforts and frustrating farmers who want to take more control of their equipment. The company is still fighting a lawsuit the US Federal Trade Commission levied against John Deere in January 2025 for “unlawful” repairability policies. The company has lobbied against the Iowa bill and outright opposes its passing.\n\n“John Deere is steadfast in supporting farmers' ability to repair their equipment,” wrote a John Deere representative in a statement responding to WIRED’s inquiry. “And we back that up by offering industry-leading self-repair tools and resources to both equipment owners and alternative service providers.”"

The transparency mode works just as well, too, with a wider range and clearer audio than a lot of other headphones offer. When it's time to actually turn up the tunes, you can enjoy a wide, natural soundstage that has excellent detail in the midrange and clear, sparkling treble.\n\nThe Gemini integration, unfortunately, leaves a bit to be desired. It's not the smoothest experience, particularly when asking multiple questions, and the Pixel Buds Pro 2 aren't offering anything that other earbuds can't do. Apple's live translations and heart rate monitors are more useful features, but if you're on Android, you're locked out of them anyway.\n\nIf you're interested in upgrading your earbud game, and you already have a Pixel, you can grab the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in hazel for $180 from either Amazon or Best Buy. If that color doesn't suit you, I also spotted lesser discounts on the peony color for $189, or the porcelain color for $210. For anyone who isn't already sold on the Pixel Buds Pro 2, make sure to swing by our guide to the best wireless earbuds, with picks for both Apple and Android owners."

It combines the abilities of Google’s previous release, Nano Banana Pro—like text rendering and web searching—with speedier image generation. This tool will be the new default in Google’s Gemini chatbot.\n\nThe first image model from Google under the Nano Banana moniker dropped last August, and the Pro version arrived three months later. The AI tool was widely adopted online to alter photos of real people, from generating custom action figures to nostalgic images of people hugging younger versions of themselves.\n\nNano Banana 2 is not only faster at crafting images, it’s also a more powerful photo editor. Despite some rough edges and unconvincing generations in my initial hands-on experience through Gemini, Google’s latest release marks the continued improvement of photorealistic AI tools that can manipulate existing images and serves as a stark reminder to always scrutinize unverified images you see online.\n\nGetting Started\n\nIf you want to try the new image model, the easiest way to access Nano Banana 2 is through the Gemini app or website. You can either click the banana emoji to generate images or just put the request in your prompts to the chatbot. This new image model is also available through Google’s Search tools, AI Studio, Cloud, and other services.\n\nGoogle says the Nano Banana 2 image generator pulls real-time information from the web, which can be useful for generating infographics. To test this, I asked Gemini to generate a custom weather report for my upcoming weekend getaway. Here’s my prompt:\n\nI'm going skiing in Dodge Ridge this weekend with some friends. Could you create an infographic that covers the weather conditions?"

Wow.\n\nZoë Schiffer: OK. Leah, you go first.\n\nLeah Feiger: So my WIRED is the show Survivor, which is airing Wednesday night. So excited. This is going to be incredible. It is Season 50, so we have Survivor players of eons past that are coming back to compete for the million dollars. I am so excited. It's going to be incredible. Zoë, my goal in the next few months is just to make you watch one, one, of the episodes. This is very important to me.\n\nBrian Barrett: If you were to make Zoë watch a historical episode of Survivor in isolation, what one hour of Survivor would you show her?\n\nLeah Feiger: Can I say a season, or does it have to be an episode?\n\nBrian Barrett: I want to go with that, because I don't think you're going to get her for a whole season.\n\nLeah Feiger: So I'm going to do the second-to-last episode of the Micronesia season of Survivor. Absolutely incredible season, known for the Black Widow Brigade. Zoë, I actually think you would really like it. Well, anyway, that is my WIRED. My TIRED—and I'm kind of devastated to say this—is Love Is Blind, which is ... I know that my theme was reality shows this week. Look, I have a lot of I wouldn't say love for Love Is Blind, but I have a lot of interest in Love Is Blind. I am an avid Love Is Blind watcher. I think it is a super interesting concept and a very weird show and produces a lot of very weird people. But there is a excellent WIRED article coming out about how MAGA it's gotten, and that those are the people that are going on the show right now, and the conversations that are happening between these couples who met behind a wall and are off to get married several weeks after knowing each other, the conversations are quite sad. They're making me sad. There's a lot of body shaming and it's just very—it's weird. So this season, it's not doing it for me, which that's OK, because Survivor is here to lift me out of the doldrums. That is my WIRED and TIRED. I stand by it. I swear that I read books and stuff too. I do not want this to be my only brand on this show.\n\nZoë Schiffer: Certainly not. Brian, drag us out. I need to get on firmer ground.\n\nBrian Barrett: OK. Well, I'm going to go TIRED. Samsung just announced some new phones. Those aren't TIRED, but TIRED is AI overload in phones. There's too much. So at this point, the new Samsung Galaxy S26 smartphones—similar to Google's conversational photo editor—they have a photo assist thing that lets you use natural language, so you can just type in. If you have a photo that you took, you can say like, \"Hey, give my dog a party hat,\" and then there will be a party hat on the dog. What's the point of taking photos anymore? Why not just prompt something instead from scratch, or just go touch some grass? I am curious about—they've got agents built into the phone, so you can use the phone. You can just say, \"Hey, order me a pizza,\" and the phone will just do that for you. We'll see if it works. I don't know. It seems like it might go off the rails. Anyway, too much too soon for me. That's my TIRED. I didn't plan a WIRED. I was so caught up on the phone, but because it came up earlier, I'll say the new Muppet Show episode with Sabrina Carpenter is really quite good, and I hope that it got a good enough response that Disney makes more of them."

            "content": "AI agents like OpenClaw have recently exploded in popularity precisely because they can take the reins of your digital life. Whether you want a personalized morning news digest, a proxy that can fight with your cable company's customer service, or a to-do list auditor that will do some tasks for you and prod you to resolve the rest, agentic assistants are built to access your digital accounts and carry out your commands. This is helpful—but has also caused a lot of chaos. The bots are out there mass-deleting emails they've been instructed to preserve, writing hit pieces over perceived snubs, and launching phishing attacks against their owners.\n\nWatching the pandemonium unfold in recent weeks, longtime security engineer and researcher Niels Provos decided to try something new. Today he is launching an open source, secure AI assistant called IronCurtain designed to add a critical layer of control. Instead of the agent directly interacting with the user's systems and accounts, it runs in an isolated virtual machine. And its ability to take any action is mediated by a policy—you could even think of it as a constitution—that the owner writes to govern the system. Crucially, IronCurtain is also designed to receive these overarching policies in plain English and then runs them through a multistep process that uses a large language model (LLM) to convert the natural language into an enforceable security policy.\n\n“Services like OpenClaw are at peak hype right now, but my hope is that there’s an opportunity to say, ‘Well, this is probably not how we want to do it,’” Provos says. “Instead, let’s develop something that still gives you very high utility, but is not going to go into these completely uncharted, sometimes destructive, paths.”\n\nIronCurtain's ability to take intuitive, straightforward statements and turn them into enforceable, deterministic—or predictable—red lines is vital, Provos says, because LLMs are famously “stochastic” and probabilistic. In other words, they don't necessarily always generate the same content or give the same information in response to the same prompt. This creates challenges for AI guardrails, because AI systems can evolve over time such that they revise how they interpret a control or constraint mechanism, which can result in rogue activity.\n\nAn IronCurtain policy, Provos says, could be as simple as: “The agent may read all my email. It may send email to people in my contacts without asking. For anyone else, ask me first. Never delete anything permanently.”\n\nIronCurtain takes these instructions, turns them into an enforceable policy, and then mediates between the assistant agent in the virtual machine and what's known as the model context protocol server that gives LLMs access to data and other digital services to carry out tasks. Being able to constrain an agent this way adds an important component of access control that web platforms like email providers don't currently offer because they weren't built for the scenario where both a human owner and AI agent bots are all using one account."

            "content": "Hearing someone talk about digital censorship in China is always either extremely boring or extremely interesting. Most of the time, people are still regurgitating the same talking points from 20 years ago about how the Chinese internet is like living in George Orwell’s 1984. But occasionally, someone discovers something new about how the Chinese government exerts control over emerging technologies, revealing how the censorship machine is a constantly evolving beast.\n\nA new paper by scholars from Stanford University and Princeton University about Chinese artificial intelligence belongs to the second category. The researchers fed the same 145 politically sensitive questions to four Chinese large language models and five American models and then compared how they responded. They then repeated the same experiment 100 times.\n\nThe main findings won’t be surprising to anyone who has been paying attention: Chinese models refuse to answer significantly more of the questions than the American models. (DeepSeek refused 36 percent of the questions, while Baidu’s Ernie Bot refused 32 percent; OpenAI’s GPT and Meta’s Llama had refusal rates lower than 3 percent.) In cases where they didn’t outright refuse to answer, the Chinese models also gave shorter answers and more inaccurate information than their American counterparts did.\n\nOne of the most interesting things the researchers attempted to do was to separate the impact of pre-training and post-training. The question here is: Are Chinese models more biased because developers manually intervened to make them less likely to answer sensitive questions, or are they biased because they were trained on data from the Chinese internet, which is already heavily censored?\n\n“Given that the Chinese internet has already been censored for all these decades, there's a lot of missing data” says Jennifer Pan, a political science professor at Stanford University who has long studied online censorship and coauthored the recent paper.\n\nPan and her colleague’ findings suggest that training data may have played a smaller role in how the AI models responded than manual interventions. Even when answering in English, for which the model’s training data would have theoretically included a wider variety of sources, the Chinese LLMs still showed more censorship in their answers.\n\nToday, anyone can ask DeepSeek or Qwen a question about the Tiananmen Square Massacre and immediately see censorship is happening, but it’s hard to tell how much it impacts normal users and how to properly identify the source of the manipulation. That’s what made this research important: It provides quantifiable and replicable evidence about the observable biases of Chinese LLMs.\n\nBeyond discussing their findings, I asked the authors about their methods and the challenges of studying biases in Chinese models, and spoke with other researchers to understand where the AI censorship debate is heading.\n\nWhat You Don’t Know\n\nOne of the difficulties of studying AI models is that they have a tendency to hallucinate, so you can’t always tell if they are lying because they know not to say the correct answer or because they actually don’t know it.\n\nOne example Pan cited from her paper was a question aboutLiu Xiaobo, the Chinese dissident who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. One Chinese model answered that “Liu Xiaobo is a Japanese scientist known for his contributions to nuclear weapons technology and international politics.” That is, of course, a complete lie. But why did the model tell it? Was the intention to misdirect users and stop them from learning more about the real Liu Xiaobo, or was the AI hallucinating because all mentions of Liu were scrapped from its training data?\n\n“It's much noisier of a measure of censorship,” Pan says, comparing it to her previous work researching Chinese social media and what websites the Chinese government chooses to block. “Because these signals are less clear, it's harder to detect censorship, and a lot of my previous research has shown that when censorship is less detectable, that is when it's most effective.”"

            "content": "If you drive a car that's newer than 2008, a new study finds your vehicle's tire pressure monitoring system can be used to track you.\n\nA group of researchers at IMDEA Networks Institute -- an English-speaking research organization on data networks based in Madrid -- discovered this privacy risk at the end of a 10-week study in which they collected roughly 6 million wireless signals from over 20,000 cars. Their findings point to a serious hacker threat hiding in the tire sensors of most modern vehicles.\n\nThe TREAD Act of 2000 mandated that modern cars come equipped with TPMS for road safety. The system works by releasing wireless signals through tiny sensors attached to each tire, which communicate each tire's pressure information to the car's electronic control unit. A warning light on the vehicle's dashboard indicates low tire pressure.\n\nInstead of using a camera with a clear line of sight to the car, hackers can hypothetically track it using the wireless signals emitted by the car's tire sensors. That signal is continuously sent out as an unencrypted unique ID number.\n\nBasically, anyone nearby with a cheap radio receiver can pick up the signal and later recognize the same vehicle without ever seeing the license plate.\n\nInformation could help users track drivers\n\n\"Our results show that these tire sensor signals can be used to follow vehicles and learn their movement patterns,\" Domenico Giustiniano, research professor at IMDEA Networks Institute, said in the peer-reviewed report. \"This means a network of inexpensive wireless receivers could quietly monitor the patterns of cars in real-world environments. Such information could reveal daily routines, such as work arrival times or travel habits.\"\n\nThe researchers were able to capture signals from more than 50 meters away from moving cars, through walls and from inside buildings. The tire pressure readings helped reveal the vehicle type, its weight and the driving pattern of the driver. It's a cheap, tough-to-detect, potentially covert tracking method.\n\nWhile this may be a startling discovery, Cooper Quintin, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNET it's not the only privacy threat in your car's computer system.\n\n\"Any method that can be misused to surreptitiously track people's movements without their knowledge is concerning,\" he said. \"But so are all of the technologies in modern cars that intentionally violate drivers' privacy by collecting and sharing data for purposes of advertising, insurance risk assessment, and more. It's sad that drivers have to worry about this, and everyone should learn how to protect themselves whenever possible while manufacturers are pressured to do better.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time a group of researchers has raised the red flag about this sensor system in cars. A 2010 study by researchers at Rutgers University and the University of South Carolina warned of the potential privacy threat hiding in a vehicle's tire pressure system. Sixteen years later, the flaw persists.\n\n\"TPMS was designed for safety, not security,\" said Dr. Yago Lizarribar, one of the study's authors. \"Our findings show the need for manufacturers and regulators to improve protection in future vehicle sensor systems.\"\n\nThe study urges policymakers and car manufacturers to design a more secure and privacy-preserving TPMS for future cars."

Whereas the company just in November had estimated a drop of between 0.9% and 5.2% (the latter being its \"pessimistic scenario\"), now it sees a 12.9% decline this year, based on its Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.\n\n\"What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,\" Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for Worldwide Client Devices at IDC, said in a statement.\n\nThe hardest-hit companies are expected to be those selling to the lower end of the market, which can't absorb the higher component costs while maintaining profitable margins. As a result, Jeronimo says, many of those players will pass the added costs on to consumers.\n\nThat also includes regional markets like the Middle East and Africa that sell mostly inexpensive smartphones, which could see a steep 20.6% drop year-over-year.\n\nIDC predicts a steep drop in smartphone sales for 2026. IDC\n\nBy contrast, IDC expects Apple and Samsung to be better able to withstand the crisis. \"As smaller and low-end-positioned Android vendors struggle with rising costs, Apple and Samsung could not only weather the storm but potentially expand market share as the competitive landscape tightens,\" said Jeronimo.\n\nMemory has become scarce due to the insatiable demand to feed generative AI. Essentially all of the memory set to be manufactured this year is already earmarked. What started as a demand for graphics processors has expanded to other components. For example, hard drive manufacturer Western Digital announced in early February that it had already sold out of its supply for 2026.\n\n\"We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points,\" said Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC, projecting a 14% rise in the average selling price of smartphones to $523.\n\nPopal expects memory prices to stabilize by the middle of 2027, but doesn't see them coming down to earlier levels. The sub-$100 segment, made up of approximately 171 million devices, will be \"permanently uneconomical,\" she said. \"In short, there is no return to business as usual for vendors and consumers.\""

            "content": "During Nvidia's quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang said that agentic AI has reached \"an inflection point\" and that AI agents are \"solving real problems.\"\n\nThe company's powerful chips have been at the heart of the AI boom over the last few years, especially for use in data centers -- so much so that Nvidia's annual revenue for fiscal 2026 zoomed to $216 billion, up 65% from the previous year.\n\nHuang called Nvidia an AI infrastructure company, a dramatic evolution from the graphics card company it started as.\n\nThe term agentic AI has been floating around for some time, but now the technology is becoming available for real-world use. Unlike chatbots, which stay within their own boundaries to produce text, images or code, AI agents can take specific actions -- for instance, plan and book a vacation -- without a person constantly giving it commands.\n\nIn a live event just hours before Nvidia released its earnings, Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy S26 lineup of phones, devoting a good deal of time to talking about the \"agentic AI experience\" they'll deliver.\n\nDuring Nvidia's call, Huang said that the world has \"awakened to the agentic inflection\" and that it only happened within the last two or three months. He also said he believes the next inflection will be physical AI, a term that describes the embedding of artificial intelligence in machinery, including self-driving cars and robots.\n\nRobots were a notable presence at CES earlier this year, the consumer electronics extravaganza. Companies showed them off doing everything from folding clothes to serving as companions to handling assembly line work.\n\nWe should hear much more about what to expect from Nvidia at its GTC conference in March. It will likely have more to say about its AI-focused Rubin chip, and may also be ready to take the plunge into laptop chip territory."

            "content": "Paramount Skydance appears set to win its bidding war against Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nLate Thursday, Netflix walked away from its planned acquisition of HBO, HBO Max, and Warner Bros. studios' business. The streaming giant said it \"had declined to raise its offer\" after Paramount submitted a revised all-cash bid of $31 per share on Tuesday to buy WBD in its entirety. WBD had reviewed the rival offer and announced that its board of directors found it \"superior\" to the Netflix agreement.\n\nNetflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement: \"At the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive.\"\n\nThe statement went on to say: \"We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.' iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the US.\"\n\nHowever, according to Netflix, the transaction was more of a \"nice to have\" than a \"must have\" at any price.\n\nIf approved, Paramount's new bid would see it not only pay $31 per share in cash, but also be on the hook for a $2.8 billion termination fee that WBD would owe Netflix for backing out of its agreement. Additionally, Paramount would also be responsible for paying \"a daily ticking fee equal to $0.25 per share per quarter beginning after Sept. 30, 2026,\" according to WBD, and pony up $7 billion should the deal not pass regulatory requirements.\n\nParamount's deal is backed by cash from Larry Ellison, the billionaire father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nThe merger-acquisition plan between Netflix and WBD was originally announced on Dec. 5 for $83 billion (stocks and cash). The deal has since seen several takeover bids from Paramount, prompting Netflix to switch to an all-cash deal in January while Paramount engaged in a back-and-forth to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe announcement arrives on the day of WBD's Q4 earnings call, and the same day that Netflix's Sarandos visited Washington, DC, to meet with officials amid the Paramount bid.\n\nCNET's Corinne Reichert also contributed to this report."

            "content": "Instagram will soon alert some parents if their teen repeatedly tries to search for terms related to suicide or self-harm within a short period. Instagram owner Meta said on Thursday that it's rolling out the new notifications to parents in the US, UK, Australia and Canada, with other regions to follow later this year.\n\nThursday's update follows the 2024 introduction of teen accounts. It applies to parents using the platform's optional parental supervision setting, which requires consent from both teens and their parents to participate. Parental supervision allows parents to see the accounts their teen follows, set a time limit for how long their teen can use the app and more.\n\nIf teens repeatedly make suicide-related searches, parents will receive alerts via in-app notifications and email, text or WhatsApp, depending on available contact information. In addition to informing parents of their teen's searches, notifications will allow them to \"view expert resources designed to help them approach potentially sensitive conversations with their teen,\" according to Meta.\n\nAn example of the alerts. Meta\n\nMeta said it would prompt an alert if a teen attempted to search for phrases promoting suicide or self-harm and phrases that suggest a teen wants to harm themselves. The company said its policy is to block searches for self-harm and suicide content and direct people to resources and helplines.\n\nThis move by Instagram is just one of many digital safety measures aimed at protecting young people online. It comes as governments push their own guardrails: Australia recently enacted the world's first ban on social media accounts for children under 16, and the United Kingdom is considering similar restrictions. These efforts reflect a broader trend toward embedding protective technologies and policies around young people and their online use, even as debates about privacy, autonomy, and effectiveness continue."

            "content": "Samsung has introduced three new S26 handsets at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of the year: the S26, the S26 Plus and the uber premium S26 Ultra. The S26 Ultra continues the company's tradition of Ultra handsets that offer top-of-the-line features that are lacking from the rest of their respective series. And this year, the Ultra's Privacy Display is the clear highlight feature, allowing you to customize how visible your phone is to others around you.\n\nAside from that, the S26 Ultra's other improvements are somewhat marginal. Yes, it's now made out of aluminum, the screen is a touch bigger, a 16GB RAM option is available, the processor is improved and the charging speeds are faster, but the rest of the S26 Ultra's features are similar to that of the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Even the price remains the same at $1,300.\n\nHere is how the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra compares with the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nWatch this: First Look at the Galaxy S26 Ultra: Camera, Battery and AI Updates 02:56\n\nDesign and display\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra only has a marginally larger screen compared to the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Both the S24 Ultra and the S25 Ultra have 6.8-inch AMOLED screens with 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution, while the new S26 Ultra has a 6.9-inch AMOLED display also with a 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution. All three screens have a 1 to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate.\n\nBut it's the pixel-level Privacy Display that's particularly impressive with the S26 Ultra. When activated, the display will remain visible when looking directly at the phone while making it difficult to impossible to see what's on screen from the side. In addition to letting you turn the feature on and off for different apps, you can even have the Privacy Display activate exclusively for notifications while keeping the rest of the screen plainly visible.\n\nThe S26 Ultra's screen uses Gorilla Glass Armor 2 cover glass, while the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra both use Gorilla Glass Armor. Gorilla Glass Armor 2 is said to be more scratch and drop resistant compared to its earlier version.\n\nSize-wise, the S26 Ultra is a touch bigger but also a touch thinner compared to its predecessors. CNET Senior Reporter Abrar Al-Heeti describes the new design as feeling thinner and lighter than prior Ultra phones during her hands-on time. It measures 6.44 by 3.07 by 0.31 inches, while the S25 Ultra's dimensions are 6.41 by 3.06 by 0.32 inches and the S24 Ultra measures 6.4 by 3.11 by 0.34 inches. Also, the S26 Ultra has an aluminum frame. That's a departure from the titanium frame found on both the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nThe cameras on the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nCameras\n\nWhile the S26 Ultra certainly has the best camera hardware of the S26 lineup, it has the same exact camera specs as its predecessors. All three Ultra phones have four cameras: a 200-megapixel wide, a 50-megapixel ultrawide, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and a 50-megapixel 5x telephoto. That said, the S26 Ultra does have larger apertures and to capture better low-light photos. They also all have a 12-megapixel front-facing camera.\n\nMany of the S26 Ultra's camera upgrades come from software. There's the Horizontal Lock feature that'll keep the horizon steady while shooting video, selfies can now capture more natural skin tones and screenshots will now be sorted into its own categories within the Gallery.\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nBattery, processor and RAM\n\nAll three Ultra phones have a 5,000 mAh battery, but the charging speeds differ. The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra have 45W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, while the new S26 Ultra has 60W of wired charging and 25W wireless charging. Just like the S25 Ultra, the S26 Ultra does not include magnets but can support magnetic charging accessories when using a case that includes them.\n\nThe processors in the Ultra phones also get progressively faster and more efficient with each generation. The S24 Ultra has Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the S25 Ultra uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy and the S26 Ultra ships with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy.\n\nWhile all three Ultra handsets come in three storage capacity options -- 256GB, 512GB and 1TB -- the S26 Ultra is the only one with a 16GB RAM option. (This ships with the 512GB and 1TB options.) The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra only ship with 12GB of RAM.\n\nCheck out the below chart to compare more details between the S26 Ultra, S25 Ultra and S24 Ultra."
