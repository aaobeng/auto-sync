            "content": "CRISTIANO RONALDO has extended his incredible business empire even further.\n\nThe Portuguese superstar, 41, boasts a wealth of different ventures, investing his sizeable wages over the years into all kinds of companies to cement himself as football’s first billionaire.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he added to his brimming portfolio by becoming a co-owner of Spanish football club UD Almeria, who were bought by a Saudi investment group last year.\n\nRonaldo bought a 25 per cent stake in the second-tier outfit through his CR7 Sports Investments company.\n\n\n\nHe said: “It has been a longtime ambition of mine to contribute to football, beyond the pitch.\n\n“UD Almeria is a Spanish club with strong foundations and clear potential for growth.\n\n“I look forward to working alongside the leadership team to support the club’s next phase of growth.”\n\nAnd being a part-owner of a football club adds to the long list of side hustles Ronaldo already has – on top of his plethora of sponsorship deals with the likes of Nike, Armani and Tag Heuer.\n\n\n\nHOTELS\n\nEarlier in February, SunSport exclusively revealed Ronaldo is ready to expand his hotel and bar business to the UK.\n\nThe forward signed a deal with Portuguese hotel chain Pestana in 2016 for Ronaldo-branded resorts and bars.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL – BEST CASINO BONUSES FROM £10 DEPOSITS\n\nThe chain have CR7 hotels in Madeira, Lisbon, Madrid, New York and Marrakech.\n\nAnd now Pestana CR7 have applied to register their trademark in the UK.\n\nA source said: “Cristiano is a smart man, and makes smart business decisions.\n\n\n\n“He’s still adored in Manchester and knows there is a market there for him if he ever wanted to open a bar.”\n\n\n\nGYMS & HEALTH\n\nRonaldo, for many, is the epitome of peak physical conditioning.\n\nSo it is no wonder he is capitalising on his hard-earned reputation with a series of health-related ventures.\n\nHe has CR7 Crunch Fitness gyms across Portugal and Spain where his own bespoke training routines are on offer.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d’Or winner is proud of his hair, too – hence investing into Insparya health and medical clinics which focus on hair treatments, with centres in Spain and Portugal and now the Middle East.\n\nRonaldo owns Ursu9, which is labelled as “much more than water” because of its natural antioxidants, alkaline pH and minerals – although it looks and sounds very much like bottled water.\n\n\n\nHe invested heavily in Bioniq in 2024, a health company focused on using blood tests to personalise vitamin supplements.\n\nRecovery is also important for Ronaldo, which helps explain why he set up AvaCR7 – linking up with Ava – to sell various training, massage guns and trackers.\n\n\n\nSPORT\n\nOn a similar theme, Ronaldo has heavily invested in sport – even before putting money into Almeria.\n\nAs well as football, he loves padel and spent around £4.5million to set up the Padel City padel club in Lisbon in 2025.\n\nIn the same year, he became a shareholder in the new WOW FC MMA promotion.\n\n\n\nCLOTHING BRAND\n\nArguably Ronaldo’s most famous and instantly recognisable company is his very own CR7 brand.\n\nHe launched the fashion label way back in 2006 with a boutique in Madeira and then expanded to Lisbon – and beyond.\n\n\n\nOne of the key focuses is underwear – any excuse for Cristiano to strip down to his boxers for a modelling shoot, eh.\n\nBut they also sell shirts, shoes and even fragrances.\n\nWe might not be able to play football like the serial goalscorer, but at least we can smell like him.\n\n\n\nMOVIES\n\nWe all know Ronaldo likes to be in front of the cameras.\n\nHe has featured in various documentaries about himself including a film in 2015.\n\nBut now he is preparing for a life behind the camera.\n\nHe launched the independent UR-Marv movie studio in April 2025 with British filmmaker Matthew Vaughn, husband of Claudia Schiffer and investor in Brentford.\n\n\n\nThey say their style of “embracing innovative technology, with a nod to tradition” is designed to shake up conventional filmmaking.\n\nVaughn said: “Cristiano has created stories on the pitch that I could never have written, and I look forward to creating inspiring movies with him – he’s a real-life superhero.”\n\nRonaldo added: “This is an exciting chapter for me, as I look ahead to new ventures in business.”\n\nRonaldo was also part of the investment group to buy Confina Media, a Portuguese media company that owns the country’s best-selling newspaper and a TV station and which they rebranded Expressao Livre.\n\n\n\nTECH\n\nErakulis could have gone in the health section but it finds itself here as Ronaldo’s flagship app, combining fitness, nutrition and wellbeing in one platform for the goal of longevity.\n\nThe app has the motto “Live Healthier, Live Longer” and Ronaldo says: “You don’t need to be perfect, you just need to be consistent. When you take care of your body and mind every day, life becomes easier.”\n\nHe also launched Viva Ronaldo, a social media network app, in 2013 – two years after his iPhone game, Heads Up With Ronaldo.\n\nIn more recent times, he has invested into tech company Perplexity AI, wearable health brand Whoop and football video game UFL.\n\n\n\nLUXURY & RETAIL\n\nRonaldo is a man of style, as we well know.\n\n\n\nSo although it is a little out of his ordinary wheelhouse, it does make sense that Ronaldo bought a 30 per cent stake in Vista Alegre.\n\nThe famous Portuguese company specialises in porcelain and crystal and sells their high-end products around the world.\n\nHe also stumped up £770m of his own capital to invest in Chrono24 – an online watch marketplace with more than 9m monthly visitors.\n\nRonaldo said: “As a long-term watch collector and regular user of Chrono24, it’s a pleasure for me to become a shareholder in the company now.\n\n“Chrono24 unites millions of watch lovers from all around the world to share in their passion, together – that global unification is something I know well and am thrilled to be a part of.”\n\n\n\nPROPERTY\n\nAnd the last category is Ronaldo’s property.\n\n\n\nRonaldo has no shortage of expensive cars that may appreciate in value over the years, especially with him as an owner.\n\nBut he also has invested heavily in his homes for him to live in with partner Georgina and his kids – with £43m worth of pads all over the world from Madeira to Manchester to Marbella to Madrid and more.\n\nRonaldo has also bought luxury villas on a private island and one of the most exclusive retreats in the world – the Nujuma, Ritz-Carlton Reserve Residence in the Red Sea.\n\nThe secluded resort is only accessible by chartered boat or seaplane and is nearly 26km away from the Saudi Arabian mainland – with stays costing north of £5,500 per night.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nRonaldo described the place as “close to heaven” and said: “The Red Sea is a truly remarkable place. From the moment we first visited, Georgina and I felt a connection with the island and its natural beauty – it’s a place where we feel at peace.\n\n\n\n“Now we have a home here, we can enjoy quality time with family in complete privacy and serenity any time we like.”"

            "content": "ARSENAL signed Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting Lisbon for an initial fee of £54.8million rising to £63.5m.\n\nBut at the end of this season, the Gunners could already have handed over an extra £3.5m in add-ons, meaning they will have so far paid paid £58.3m for the forward.\n\n\n\nArsenal are close to coughing up a further €500,000 (£436,000) as it relates to the number of goals and assists Gyokeres scores for Arsenal.\n\n\n\nSporting are due €500,000 (£436,000) every time the striker hits 20 goals and assists combined.\n\nGyokeres currently has 15 goals and two assists, meaning Arsenal are not far off having to pay out.\n\nSporting will be due another €500,000 (£436,000) if Gyokeres chips in with another 20 goals and assists combined.\n\nBut that will be the final payout related to that add-on because it is capped at €1m (£873,000).\n\nSporting have already had their bank balance boosted by Arsenal this season after Gyokeres made 20 appearances of 45 minutes or more.\n\nThat led to the Gunners paying €1.25m (£1.1m), with the total payout for that add-on capped at €5m (£4.4m).\n\nGyokeres needs to make 80 appearances of 45 minutes or more for Arsenal to pay the full amount.\n\nSUN VEGAS WELCOME OFFER: GET £50 BONUS WHEN YOU JOIN\n\nThe former Brighton and Coventry forward has so far made 30 appearances of 45 minutes or more, so needs to feature in another 10 games for the next pay-out.\n\n\n\nArsenal have at least 14 games left – 10 in the Premier League, one in the FA Cup, the Carabao Cup final and two Champions League ties – so that amount could be reached this term.\n\nThe final add-on of the Gyokeres deal relates to Arsenal qualifying for the Champions League.\n\nEach time the Gunners qualify, Sporting will bank €1m (£874,000), but that is capped at €4m (£3.5m).\n\nThis is why at the end of the season, Arsenal could have so far paid £58.3m.\n\nBut if Gyokeres keeps playing – and scoring – they will be happy to hand over the cash.\n\n\n\nEurotrip\n\nPREMIER LEAGUE clubs usually travel all over the world for pre-season tours, but Arsenal will stay closer to home this summer.\n\nThe Gunners are finalising their pre-season plans but are expected to stay in Europe.\n\nArsenal went to Asia last year and have previously travelled to the USA as well.\n\nBut the World Cup being in the States – and the fact it runs until mid July – means Mikel Arteta’s side will keep travel to a minimum.\n\n\n\nArsenal are looking at playing two friendlies in Europe – with Dublin one city being considered.\n\nThe Gunners have played in Dublin before, taking on Chelsea in a friendly at the Aviva Stadium eight years ago.\n\nArsenal are expected to have much of their squad away at the World Cup, which has also impacted their decision to look at a smaller pre-season tour.\n\nPlayers will be due a break after the World Cup and may not return to training until August.\n\nThe Premier League is due to start a week later next season on August 22.\n\n\n\nThis allows for 89 clear days from the end of the current season and 33 days from the World Cup final.\n\nA ‘bootiful’ moment\n\nA TEENAGE Arsenal fan enjoyed a dream North London Derby after Bukayo Saka gifted him his boots.\n\nOrlando Alexander, 13, was in the away end at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the Gunners’ thumping 4-1 win.\n\nOrlando was there with his dad, David, who surprised him with tickets on the day of the game.\n\n\n\nThe pair are season ticket holders at the Emirates – but this was Orlando’s first time being with the away fans.\n\nIt was a dream afternoon for the youngster, whom Saka picked out at the end of the match before handing him his boots.\n\nOrlando – who is a winger himself for Ware Youth FC Under-14s – now has the boots in his bedroom where they have pride of place.\n\nOrlando told SunSport: “When I got given the boots, it was the best feeling ever.\n\n“I’m an aspiring player myself and looking at them in my room is a real inspiration. Maybe it’s a sign!\n\n\n\n“So many people at my school and even my teachers saw me on Sky and have been celebrating with me.\n\n“What I love most about Bukayo Saka is that as well as being a great player, he is a really nice person and he’s been such a role model for me.\n\n“I hope he pushes on and helps Arsenal win the title this season!”\n\nCelebrate good times\n\nYOU can take the player out of Hale End – but you cannot take Hale End out of the players.\n\nThat seems to be the case for Alex Iwobi and Emile Smith Rowe, who celebrated Arsenal’s win over Spurs while on the bus back from Fulham’s victory at Sunderland.\n\n\n\nThe pair were watching the North London Derby on the coach home and clips of it have gone viral on social media.\n\nFulham defender Ryan Sessegnon, who played for Tottenham, gets plenty of stick from Iwobi and Smith Rowe.\n\nAnd Smith Rowe even celebrated Gyokeres scoring by mimicking the Swedish striker’s famous mask celebration.\n\nSquad games\n\nARTETA has been handed a squad boost for the title run-in after it was made official that no Arsenal player can be suspended for accumulation of yellow cards in the Premier League.\n\n\n\nPlayers who accumulate 10 yellow cards in Prem matches up to and including their side’s 32nd fixture will serve a two-match suspension in the competition.\n\nBut with no Arsenal player currently amassing more than five yellow cards this term, and there being only four games left until that 32nd fixture, Arsenal will avoid any suspensions for yellow card accumulation.\n\nThe Gunners are also yet to receive a red card in the Premier this season and will be hoping to become just the third team in history to win the title without having anyone sent off.\n\nOnly Manchester United (1992-93) and Chelsea (2004-05 and 2016-17) have completed that feat before.\n\n\n\nIt’s a stark change for Arteta’s side, who had previously gained a reputation for a poor disciplinary record during the Spaniard’s first few years in charge at the Emirates.\n\nEll-is of a surprise\n\nJAMES ELLIS leaving his post as Arsenal technical director after just a few months in that job is a surprise.\n\nHe had only been promoted seven months ago, with the intention that he would provide support to new sporting director Andrea Berta.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIn fact, he was doing a lot of work for Berta behind the scenes in terms of the academy, dealing with parents and sorting out contracts like Max Dowman’s plus a number of highly-rated youngsters who have joined the club.\n\nEllis, understood to be a strong character, had very clear plans of the direction he wanted to take the academy during the 2026-27 season and that did not seem to align with those above him."

            "content": "A FORMER Champions League stadium could be demolished due to structural issues.\n\nHajduk Split have been playing their home matches at Stadion Poljud since 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ground is steeped in history as Hajduk celebrated six Croatian league titles in that venue.\n\nThe esteemed club also played four Champions League games at Poljud in the 1994-95 season.\n\nThat was the club’s only appearance in the European competition and saw them making it to the quarter-finals where they were eliminated by Ajax after overcoming Benfica, Steaua Bucharest and Anderlecht.\n\nAccording to Index, however, the 33,987-seater may soon need to be torn down in order to rebuild an improved version.\n\nProfessor Emeritus Ante Mihanovic, who took part in the venue’s structural design back in 1976, found there’s material fatigue in the steel and reinforced concrete structures.\n\nMihanovic specifically found problems primarily affecting the steel elements of the roof structure and the reinforced concrete sections of the stands.\n\nThus the engineer deemed reconstruction was simply not possible.\n\n\n\nTherefore, Hajduk now face three realistic scenarios regarding their home stadium.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL – BEST CASINO BONUSES FROM £10 DEPOSITS\n\nThe first possible solution would see Poljud undergoing technical maintenance while the club constructs a new facility in the Brodarica district.\n\nThe second would involve a deep reconstruction of the entire venue.\n\nThe third would see the entire structure being demolished before the construction of a modern arena in the same location.\n\nPoljud’s roof was significantly damaged during a storm in July and Mihanovic stressed that the structure no longer meets contemporary safety standards.\n\n\n\nHajduk spokesperson, Bozo Pavkovic said last summer: “The roof at the junction of the southern and western stands has sustained significant damage, with a large number of Lexan panels being blown off or carried away by the wind.\n\n“The condition of the remaining panels on the roof is uncertain, and it is unclear how securely they are still in place. There is a risk of further collapses, so we need to assess what and how to proceed and determine how safe it is.\n\n“The pitch is flooded. It has been damaged. This is especially problematic as we are in the sensitive phase of changing the grass. We now need to see how this will affect the first matches of the new season.\n\n“Several offices have also been damaged, as well as the indoor hall, and the stadium has suffered a power outage.\n\n“It’s uncertain how we will restore the electricity. Overall, the damage is quite significant, and for now, things do not look good.”"

We are very sad about it.\n\n\n\n“We have pumped significant money into the club, besides the deposit, and paid for numerous advisors, so there are a lot of sunk costs.\n\n“But unfortunately we have to pull out. We are incredibly sad, as we believe this club is football royalty.\n\n“There is no way to continue the process and get the valuation to a place where there is a fair price.”\n\nHe continued: “We bid a lot higher than £30million.\n\n“That figure is not in the same ball park as our bid.\n\n\n\n“But just because we can’t wrestle with the valuation, it doesn’t discount that somebody else can bid at £30m and I have already wished the administrators luck in finding someone who will.\n\n“Time will tell but I wouldn’t be so hasty to say that somebody can’t hit that number, because avoiding a 15-point deduction is so important for the club and the fans.”\n\nMike Ashley and the Storch family are among potential suitors to save Wednesday.\n\nThe Storch family maintain their interest in the deal, saying: “We remain incredibly passionate about the opportunity at Sheffield Wednesday and seeing the club return to its former glory.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“We wish the preferred bidder well through the process but are ready to step in should the opportunity present itself again.\n\n\n\n“We know all are disappointed by relegation yet wish the team well as they finish the current season.”"

They have utilised only 24 of the 25 permitted slots in their Premier League squad allowance, however, and clubs in a previous position in recent years have taken advantage of being able to sign free agents outside the transfer window.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEven without such a pressing need for reinforcements, Spurs may well wish to explore picking up a free signing or two as a means of keeping costs down during their summer rebuilding efforts. It's a strategy that has served them admirably over the years, whether that involved adding depth to their ranks or securing players capable of making an immediate impact.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe north London club splashed out heavily in January, recruiting Conor Gallagher and Souza for a combined £48million. Results have yet to turn around, however, with the club sacking manager Thomas Frank and installing Igor Tudor as interim boss after failing to win a single league game so far in 2026.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSeveral Premier League players are eligible to sign pre-contract agreements with foreign clubs ahead of their contracts expiring this summer. Spurs could make their move should any of those individuals choose to run down their deals - while also remaining able to speak to out-of-contract stars from other leagues.\n\nWhether the likes of Dusan Vlahovic, Marcos Senesi or Harry Wilson feature on their wishlist remains to be seen - and the same goes for other players out of contract this summer. Even so, fans will be well aware that Spurs have capitalised shrewdly on the free agent market in recent years.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

A Champions League winner with Bayern Munich and Serie A champion with Inter Milan under Conte, the 33-year-old joined on a two-year deal.\n\nThe experienced Croatian had long been a target for Premier League rivals Manchester United, with Jose Mourinho desperate to bring him to England during the summer of 2017. However, Inter rebuffed the Red Devils' approach, and it would take a further five years before the wide player finally made his way to the Premier League.\n\nView 3 Images Ivan Perisic in pre-season action for Spurs (Image: Soccrates Images, Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPerisic made a significant impact during his maiden season at Tottenham, but suffered an ACL injury barely a month into his second season. He joined Hajduk Split on loan in the latter half of the season before moving to PSV Eindhoven in 2024, claiming the Eredivisie title in his debut season in the Netherlands\n\nFraser Forster\n\nFraser Forster touched down just days after Perisic in June 2022, making it two free transfers in two weeks for Conte. The England international stopper signed a two-year deal in north London once his Southampton contract had officially expired and would ultimately extend his stay until 2025.\n\nForster made 34 Spurs appearances in total and four in the Europa League last season. He received a winner's medal despite being absent from the final, but left weeks later and is now back on the south coast with Bournemouth.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nTeddy Sheringham\n\nTottenham announced in May 2001 that legendary striker Teddy Sheringham would be returning, years after a first spell in which he scored 98 goals in all competitions. He had spend the intervening period at Manchester United, winning the Treble under Sir Alex Ferguson in the 1998/99 season.\n\nGlenn Hoddle, Spurs' manager at the time, was a huge fan and had regularly selected Sheringham at international level during a stint as England manager. This history helped Spurs secure a pre-contract agreement to bring the 35 year old back to north London when his deal at Old Trafford expired.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Teddy Sheringham helped Spurs reach a final in his first season back (Image: Phil Cole, Getty Images)\n\nSpurs finished ninth and reached the League Cup final in Sheringham's first campaign back at White Hart Lane, their strongest finish in six years. His second stint yielded 26 goals across 80 appearances, and he ultimately retired aged 42 after stints with Portsmouth, West Ham and Colchester United.\n\nBrad Friedel\n\nTottenham pulled off a shrewd piece of business by snapping up experienced goalkeeper Friedel on a free transfer in June 2011. The USA legend arrived on a two-year deal after more than 100 appearances for previous club Aston Villa.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDuring his time at Spurs, the goalkeeper became the oldest player to appear in a Premier League fixture and was a regular as they secured fourth place under Harry Redknapp in 2011/12. He made 67 appearances for the club before hanging up his boots at the end of the 2014/15 campaign.\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

On two occasions, Aluko, 39, has insinuated Wright should step aside from some of his women's football punditry roles so other former female players have a chance.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn 2025, she said the former England international had been \"dominating\" the women's game in regards to television opportunities. Aluko issued a public apology but Wright refused to accept it, and has since opted to not publicly respond to any other communication from her.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAluko then made similar comments while also including ex-Manchester City star and regular women's football pundit Nedum Onuoha in her criticism. She has since said she is stepping away from British television, describing it as \"a very toxic space for me.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Wright feels 'indignant' towards Aluko but has decided 'he will not dignify her comments with a response.' When it comes to Onuoha, whose punditry portfolio includes the women's Champions League for ESPN, he is described as 'taking the same approach despite his own private indignation.'\n\nThe last time Wright commented directly on Aluko's criticism was in April 2025, when he publicly said he would not be accepting her apology. He said: \"I have to talk about this week and what's going on, I don't want to endlessly be asked about it.\n\nSimon Jordan reveals exactly what he told Eni Aluko during furious off-air row READ MORE :\n\nEni Aluko hints she will step away from British TV during angry row with Simon Jordan READ MORE :\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

But I also want to move on. For anyone watching this, I really don't need any further social commentary directed on any of this. The thing about where the women's game is, it isn't about me - it has to be about the collective.\n\n\"Because of the past, we know the men blocked the women's game for 50 years, because of the past we know the game has serious systemic challenges, and it's going to take everyone to help fixes. So for me, I always give back to the game, it's given me so much.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAluko has also suggested Wright could have done more to help her get more opportunities with ITV, after the broadcaster started using her less, something she claims was due to \"budget cuts\". The Mail has also claimed Wright did try to 'discreetly' help Aluko land more opportunities with the broadcaster, but the final decision on whether that happens was always with ITV bosses.\n\nView 2 Images Eni Aluko recently said she will be stepping away from British television (Image: 2024 Getty Images)\n\nEither way, it appears Aluko will not be in a punditry studio any time soon, given her desire to move away from the UK television industry.

The goal, awarded upon the judgement of the Russian linesman has remained one of the most controversial goals in the history of the competition. England became World champions with a 4-2 victory after extra time. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images)\n\nThere is nothing quite like the World Cup to provide truly epic football moments that last the test of time.\n\nWe don’t know who will lift the World Cup in New York on July 19, but what we can say for certain is that one or two iconic moments will be produced over the course of five weeks in America, Canada and Mexico this summer.\n\nThere is nothing quite like the biggest football tournament on earth for producing special memories which go into folklore, never to be forgotten. And in our brilliant special edition - What in the World? - we take a look back at some of the most memorable moments from past World Cups.\n\nThe World Cup has always been a mix of the good, the bad and the ugly. Truly brilliant moments of individual genius, surreal happenings, sometimes downright notorious. It certainly isn’t just about who bags the winner in the final. There is so much more to the tournament than that. Yes there have been fabulous goals and we feature many of them in detail. Diego Maradona dribbling the ball from halfway before beating Peter Shilton versus Bobby Robson’s England in 1986. Don’t worry, we also cover off the infamy of his handball too.\n\nView 2 Images\n\nMichael Owen against Argentina at France ‘98. Gary Lineker’s hat-trick to down Poland in Mexico and why he regarded the first of those, a tap-in from five yards, as the best of the 300-plus goals bagged throughout a glittering career. Carlos Alberto’s cracker for Brazil versus Italy in the 1970 final, perhaps the artistic team move which, more than any other, coined the phrase ‘The Beautiful Game’, which has become such a popular saying in recent times. But just as easily recounted as the great goals are other World Cup memories, for which the more the years go by, the greater the legend grows.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nGazza’s tears, Cruyff’s turn, that tear-stained, fist-pumping, head-shaking Marco Tardelli screaming goal celebration for Italy in the 1982 final against West Germany. Forget the Peter Crouch robot or Cristiano Ronaldo’s famous leap into the air. Nothing matches Marco.

The Catalan club have always recognised the value in his loan-to-buy arrangement, to the extent they've contemplated selling him on immediately to help ease their own financial troubles.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat's according to La Liga expert Guillem Balague, who has lifted the lid on Barca's thinking regarding the matter. Rashford, 28, has shocked many with just how effective he's been in Spain, making his £26million purchase clause all the more attractive.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUnited were taken aback to discover Barcelona wanted to drive his price down even further. Doing so wouldn't just save them money initially but could earn the Catalans an even bigger profit should one of United's Premier League competitors make a bid for his services in the same transfer window.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It was a loan because they couldn't pay for him, but £30m, they thought that if he did what was expected, they would pay for it,\" Balague told the Manchester Evening News. \"Hopefully, they thought the finances would be in a situation where they didn't need to negotiate that.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\n\"But [Barcelona sporting director] Deco spoke to people at Aston Villa and Manchester United, and they were surprised that Manchester United let him go and that the price was only £30m at 27.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMarcus Rashford to Barcelona transfer hangs in the balance with Man Utd stance clear READ MORE :\n\n\"So they found it was an opportunity in the market. There were two possibilities: If they liked him and did well, they buy him.\n\n\"But they could buy him anyway and sell him on in the Premier League still because he's got obviously a big market there. But his idea was always to stay. The club hadn't decided until recently what to do.\"\n\nBarcelona hold the exclusive right to purchase Rashford for £26m. They had also been hopeful that Premier League clubs might be willing to pay a premium following his time in the spotlight at the Camp Nou.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Guillem Balague is an expert on Spanish football and the wider European landscape (Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nWith that in mind, current indications suggest Barca would be perfectly happy to keep Rashford at the club. After all, it's rare that a player of his calibre at this point in his career becomes available for such a modest fee.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat's particularly true for a club in Barcelona's current financial predicament, still feeling the strain of the Camp Nou's recent renovation costs. Football finance expert Kieran Maguire told Mirror Football in December how Barca's transfer budget this summer could hinge on Champions League glory, highlighting just how fragile their financial situation remains.\n\nThe fee Barcelona are prepared to sell Rashford for might still represent a discount compared to what United would demand from a domestic competitor. As such, it could interest a club like Villa, where he spent the second half of the 2024/25 season, to discover Barca's asking price.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRashford's resurgence started during his loan spell in Birmingham. Unai Emery revitalised the forward after his form declined under then-United boss Ruben Amorim, with Rashford proving particularly crucial in helping Villa progress in the Champions League.\n\nEmery's team ultimately chose not to trigger the £40m purchase clause in the player's contract. However, 12 months later, there could be a chance for the club, or any of their Premier League competitors, to acquire him for roughly the same amount (or less) while Barca still make a healthy profit for their involvement.\n\nSky Sports discounted Premier League and EFL package This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

He suggests that now, though, the likelihood of such a rapid sale has decreased following his outstanding performances for Barcelona.\n\n\"Now they want to keep him,\" he added. \"They want to lower the £26m [€30m], but Manchester United will not touch that. And also, in the next few years, they want to offer less wages to Rashford.\"\n\nJoin our new MAN UTD WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Manchester United content from Mirror Football.

Maguire, 32, sees his current deal expire in June, putting him on course to become a free agent.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe defender has been ever present since Michael Carrick's appointment as interim manager, starting all six games and helping the Red Devils keep three clean sheets. But no decision has been made over his future, with the clock ticking down on his £190,000 per week contract.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the Mail, Bruce sees no reason why Maguire shouldn't be given an extension. \"I wouldn't be surprised if he gets offered a new deal,\" the former United captain said.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Why wouldn't you?

In that fact, he's never let England down either. As I said, I think he became a whipping boy for what was going on around him.\"\n\nMaguire was initially due to be out of contract last season before United triggered a one-year extension clause.

The 32-year-old is evidently in favour under Carrick, but a coach who employs a different style - such as a high defensive line - may well prefer centre-backs with more pace than Maguire, whose strengths are in other areas.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFor now, though, Carrick is the favourite to become the Red Devils' next permanent boss. Bruce added: \"Look, he's put himself in pole position, even after six weeks.\n\n\"He's been quite refreshing in his way and the one thing I've said about him, he understands Man United. I don't mean that disrespectfully at all to anybody coming in, but you don't realise how big a club it is and how the scrutiny on you is like no other.\n\n\"As soon as you walk in there, you're in the spotlight; everything is analysed and he understands the club that way after playing for it for 13 years, this cool, calm demeanour that he's got.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

That is the warning from Professional Footballers’ Association chief executive Maheta Molango, who fears the biggest stars are being put at risk because they are playing too many games.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nChelsea star Palmer has struggled for form and suffered injuries this season which has restricted him to playing just 19 games out of a possible 42.

Signed for £72m as a promising striker filled with potential just two years earlier, he was pushed out of Old Trafford to make way for Sesko over the summer.\n\nImage: Sesko celebrates his winner in the 1-0 win at Everton\n\nSesko is beginning to show signs he can bear the burden of being United's No. 9 - but three of his five goals have come as a substitute and the other two against promoted-side Burnley, currently second from bottom.\n\nHow Sesko copes when he is the regular starter will be the true test of the 22-year-old.\n\n\"It's a lot of pressure,\" Neville said. \"The biggest pressure in English football, that's a Manchester United goalkeeper, but not far behind would be a striker who comes for big money to United.\n\n\"When you come in as a striker with a big price tag, you've got to deliver and he's starting to deliver.\n\n\"There is a danger that maybe that he's sort of getting that super-sub title, but I don't think he's that type. He's a starting player. He has been a super sub in the last few games because he's needed to be.\n\n\"I don't think he's ever going to be the perfect striker, like I said about Gyokeres. But if he can be a handful, contribute with goals, hold things up, link play, that'll be enough. You don't have to be always perfect and [his winner at Everton], it's a big moment for him.\n\n\"If he can get another four or five and finish this season in double figures, in his first season with the struggle that the team were having at the beginning, I think that would be deemed to be a good season.\"\n\nManchester United\n\nCrystal Palace Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\nSesko faced questions about how he copes with the scrutiny of being United's goalscorer after his winner at Everton as the conversation soon turned to whether he would start at Palace.\n\n\"The pressure is something that, if I want to be a good player, it's something that I have to have,\" Sesko said.\n\n\"It's something that has (to be there) if you want to play at the highest level and it's about accepting it and not really caring about it.\"\n\nSesko has made a strong case to be in from the start against Palace. It is now up to Carrick to decide whether now is the right time to open the door for the young striker.\n\nWatch Man Utd vs Crystal Palace on Sunday, live on Sky Sports, kick-off 2pm"

            "content": "Welcome to The Radar, a Sky Sports column in which Nick Wright uses a blend of data and opinion to shed light on need-to-know stories from up and down the Premier League. This week:\n\n9️⃣ Joao Pedro excelling as Chelsea's striker\n\n🧱 Maguire crucial for Carrick at Man Utd\n\n🔍 Two players to watch this weekend\n\nJoao Pedro's evolution\n\nFew forwards have caused more problems for William Saliba and Gabriel this season than Joao Pedro on his last visit to the Emirates Stadium. The Carabao Cup tie ended in defeat for Chelsea but Joao Pedro returns on Sunday aiming for a repeat performance.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Liam Rosenior gave a candid press conference after Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley\n\nThe 24-year-old spent that evening dragging the Arsenal centre-backs out of position and showing impressive strength to hold them off with his back to goal. He linked the play, ran the channels, won twice as many fouls as anyone else and gave Chelsea an outlet.\n\nAll that was missing was a goal but those have hardly been in short supply lately. Joao Pedro has seven in his last nine appearances for Chelsea. Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres is the only Premier League player to have scored more since the turn of the year.\n\nThe increase in his scoring output, from eight goals in 30 appearances earlier this season to seven in his last nine, coincides with the appointment of Liam Rosenior, who said last week that Joao Pedro can become one of the best strikers in the world.\n\nFanciful, some may say, but there is no doubting the strides he has taken. Joao Pedro's goal against Burnley was his 11th in the Premier League this term. He has reached that total despite losing the penalty-taking privileges he enjoyed at former club Brighton.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Joao Pedro has scored more than twice as many non-penalty goals as in any of his previous top-flight campaigns. Erling Haaland and Antoine Semenyo are the only players with more in the Premier League this season.\n\nHaving split his time between the No 10 and No 9 positions for Brighton, and indeed for Chelsea under Enzo Maresca following his £60m arrival in July, Joao Pedro has been used almost exclusively up front by Rosenior, despite the availability of Liam Delap.\n\nImage: Joao Pedro is spending less time out wide and in his own half, and more in the opposition box\n\nChelsea's last meeting with Arsenal showcased his ability with his back to goal, but overall, Joao Pedro is less involved in general play, averaging fewer touches and fewer passes under Rosenior as the new head coach tries to maximise his threat in the box.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

It has allowed him to have roughly twice as many shots. And while he remains capable of spectacular strikes, like his first goal in the Champions League win over Napoli, he has mostly hunted down easier chances.\n\nHis goal against Burnley, forced over the line from Pedro Neto's cross, was his second from inside the six-yard box under Rosenior and put him on five for the season, the joint-highest total by any player along with Leeds striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nImage: Joao Pedro's shot maps show an increased concentration of close-range chances\n\nHelped, of course, by the better service on offer at Chelsea compared to Brighton, Joao Pedro's shot quality is transformed. Excluding penalties, he has gone from averaging 0.12 expected goals per shot at Brighton last term to 0.21 per shot at Chelsea.\n\nRosenior has challenged Joao Pedro to raise the intensity of his play and he has stepped up on that front too, both in terms of his pressing and his attacking movement. He has increased both the volume and effectiveness of his runs in behind.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

But carry on scoring at the same rate and he will eclipse the totals of those to have come closest in Nicolas Jackson, who scored 14 two seasons ago, and Tammy Abraham, who hit 15 in 2019/20.\n\nArsenal\n\nChelsea Sunday 1st March 4:25pm Kick off 4:30pm\n\nBefore all that, though, there is Sunday's trip to the Emirates Stadium, and another opportunity for a striker establishing himself among the elite to test Saliba and Gabriel.\n\nMaguire key to Man Utd resurgence\n\nBenjamin Sesko is another No 9 catching the eye but Manchester United's resurgence under Michael Carrick owes just as much to their defensive performances. It's three clean sheets in six games so far. The return of Harry Maguire has made a difference.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights from the Premier League match between Everton and Manchester United.\n\nMaguire had not started in two months at the time Carrick's appointment due to a thigh issue but his return to fitness has proved timely for the new head coach. The 32-year-old is in line to start a seventh consecutive game against Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\nHe has mostly featured alongside Lisandro Martinez, with Ruben Amorim's back three now a thing of the past. But with Martinez absent due to injury against Everton on Monday, he proved similarly influential next to Leny Yoro, using his experience to guide the young defender and reaching double figures for clearances.\n\nImage: Harry Maguire has the best duel success rate in the Premier League since January 17\n\nThe quality of Maguire's defensive work has been apparent across the last six Premier League games. Having won 36 of his 44 duels in that period, he has the highest success rate of any player.\n\nHis future at Manchester United is uncertain, with his contract due to expire in the summer. A place in England's World Cup is no guarantee either given he has not yet had a call-up from Thomas Tuchel. Clearly, though, he has a lot left to offer.\n\nManchester United\n\nCrystal Palace Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\nPlayer Radar: Who else to keep an eye on\n\nAlex Iwobi and Emile Smith Rowe celebrated their former club Arsenal's North London derby win over Spurs in a video published on social media after helping Fulham beat Sunderland. Next up? Spurs at home, and a chance to inflict more pain on Igor Tudor's side.\n\nOn Friday Night Football, Wolves host Aston Villa live on Sky Sports Premier League and Main Event from 7.30pm, kick-off 8pm.\n\nLeeds against Man City is the Saturday Night Football, live on Sky Sports Premier League and Main Event from 5pm, kick-off 5.30pm\n\nWatch Brighton vs Nottingham Forest, Fulham vs Spurs and Man Utd vs Crystal Palace from 1pm across Sky Sports on Sunday, kicking off at 2pm, before Arsenal vs Chelsea at 4.30pm.\n\nThe last column proved a timely one as it outlined the need for Arsenal to unlock Eberechi Eze's full potential before he went and delivered his two-goal performance against Spurs."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says his task at Tottenham is the biggest rescue-job of his career.\n\nThe Spurs head coach arrived in the Premier League with a reputation for instant-impact turnarounds at previous clubs he's managed, having helped Juventus and Lazio secure European football and Udinese avoid relegation.\n\nHowever, following the 4-1 thrashing at home to Arsenal last weekend in his first game in charge, which ramped up the relegation pressure on Spurs, Tudor admitted the scale of his challenge now is the greatest of his career.\n\nSpurs are just four points above the relegation zone and haven't won a league game in 2026.\n\n\"If I recognised the difficulties there are, probably yes [it is the biggest],\" he said in his press conference ahead of Sunday's trip to Fulham, which is live on Sky Sports.\n\n\"It's an even bigger motivation that we do it,\" he added.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights from the Premier League clash between Tottenham and Arsenal.\n\nTudor also said it is now all about results for Tottenham, regardless of style of play ,such is the severity of their situation.\n\n\"There's not too much time to think about performance or style,\" he said.\n\n\"Every game needs to be prepared in that way: How are we going to take the points? One way or the other way.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it's for me very clear. I'm not that kind of coach who doesn't want to cure style, how we perform - but in this moment it's not possible to think about those kind of things.\"\n\nHe later said: \"The style is second because it's a question of life and death, if I can say that sportingly.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player On The Premier League Show, we assess whether Tottenham Hotspur are too good to be relegated this season.\n\nAnd on the mentality required, he suggested Spurs should see themselves like an underdog.\n\n\"In Italy they use the term, 'have the mentality of a small team',\" he explained.\n\n\"That's the key always, to have the willingness and motivation like you play against bigger teams.\"\n\nChampions League 'not ideal' with 'hard work' key\n\nTudor was keen not to dwell on the defeat to Arsenal - \"The less we speak the better it is\" - and admitted Spurs' Champions League involvement is \"not an ideal situation\" given their relegation battle in the Premier League.\n\n\"It's a beautiful competition to play, everyone wants to play. The problem is the lack of numbers we have in the team. There's the problem. If you need to play every three days with 10,12, 13... Also it's not only about spending physical energy but also mental energy when every game for us in the league is a final.\"\n\nBut he insisted his players were in no doubt about the situation they are in - and how they will have to fight their way out of it.\n\nFulham\n\nTottenham Hotspur Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\n\"The mentality changes by training. Doing the right things there and to have enough training sessions that you can transmit these things to the team so that on Sunday this can be seen from the fans in the stadium.\n\n\"Hard work. There is no other possibility.\"\n\nTudor confirmed Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso will be in contention to play at Fulham on Sunday after returning to training from injury and that Micky van de Ven should also be fine to feature, despite an issue with one of his little toes.\n\nHe also said he remains hopeful Dejan Kulusevski can return to the field before the end of the season.\n\nTudor dismisses suggestion Van de Ven ignored him during derby\n\nImage: Igor Tudor issues instructions to Micky van de Ven and Djed Spence\n\nFollowing Spurs' defeat to Arsenal, fan footage emerged appearing to show centre-back Micky van de Ven ignoring Tudor's encouragement to push up and then the head coach becoming frustrated.\n\nHowever, Tudor insisted that was not the case.\n\n\"It was not an instruction to Micky, it was an instruction to the team to go up,\" he explained. \"It was not about Micky. It was about the team coming up. We want to go up because we want to have this style that we press high but maybe in this moment it's too much for them. That's why there is a little frustration of that. Nothing special happened.\"\n\nPressed on whether Van de Ven had disrespected him, Tudor said: \"If you watch carefully. You see I don't speak with him. After, I say to him come closer and he comes closer. At that moment I say this, it was for all the defence to go up.\n\n\"We didn't even speak about this because there's nothing to speak about. He's a fantastic guy, very good professional. He'd never do [those] things.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Speaking on Sky Sports FC, Jamie O'Hara breaks down where Spurs went wrong in the North London Derby and why he fears for his former side's chances in the race for Premier League survival.\n\nEx-Tottenham midfielder Jamie O'Hara has slammed the attitude and mentality of the Spurs squad and believes they \"haven't got the stomach for a relegation fight\".\n\nHe told Sky Sports News' Fan Club: \"I was expecting a bit of a manager bounce. Arsenal had a couple of sticky performances against Wolves and Brentford, so I was expecting the team to go into this game with a high attitude, a bit of passion, fight, relentless pressing, and not letting easy crosses in the box.\n\n\"[It was the] complete opposite. It was miles away from where I thought it was. I know there's injuries, but the attitude of the players is my biggest concern. The attitude to defend, to run, to compete, to not concede goals. That for me is basic 101, and then you can talk about creativity, whether we're good enough, whether we've got the players, the formation, but the basic defending, basic mentality of a football club.\""

            "content": "Conor Benn will fight Regis Prograis on the undercard of Tyson Fury's April 11 bout with Arslanbek Makhmudov at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nThe announcement follows Benn's industry-shaking decision to sever ties with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing and join Zuffa, the new promotion run by UFC boss Dana White.\n\nBenn's first fight under the new arrangement will see him return to the scene of his victory over Chris Eubank Jr to take on two-time super-lightweight world champion Prograis, 30-3 (24).\n\nBenn said: \"April 11 can't come soon enough, returning to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium again, where I made history against Eubank Jr means everything to me.\n\n\"My last fight there showed the world exactly who I am and what I'm about. Fighting on the biggest stages, in the biggest shows, I fear no one! I'm fully locked in and ready to deliver another statement performance.\"\n\nTwo of Prograis' three losses as a professional have come on English soil in world title fights against Josh Taylor in 2019 and Jack Catterall in 2024.\n\nPrograis added: \"Last time I fought in London, Conor Benn was on my undercard, so this is a full-circle moment for me.\n\n\"But this circle will close with me teaching him a lesson on April 11. He's not fighting some weight-drained super-middleweight. I am in shape and will bring home this victory.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Conor Benn says signing a promotional deal with Zuffa will unlock his American dreams and he plans to face Ryan Garcia next and take his world title.\n\nAnother surprise?\n\nSky Sports boxing journalist John Dennen says...\n\nIt's been a busy news week for Conor Benn, and it's still only Thursday. It was a shock to the industry when he made a promotional switch from Matchroom Boxing to new American entity Zuffa.\n\nIt's also a surprise to see him boxing on an undercard. With Tyson Fury vs Aslanbek Makhmudov the main event on April 11, Benn will be providing the chief support at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nIt's a familiar setting for Benn, in his last two fights he headlined at that stadium against Chris Eubank Jr. But playing a supporting role on the bill will be a step down for him.\n\nNot necessarily a 'tune up' bout as such - Prograis has a track record of real success - but it will be viewed as a contest to prepare him for a bigger fight later in the year, with Ryan Garcia a particular target for the Ilford fighter.\n\nBenn is working his way back down to welter after two consecutive fights at middleweight and he will be the favourite against Prograis.\n\nThe American was in a sensational fight with Josh Taylor when he lost their super-lightweight world title unification at the O2 Arena. He's only lost to top class opposition, Devin Haney and Jack Catterall as well as Taylor.\n\nBut Prograis is a former two-time world champion and if he's sharp, he will be dangerous. At 37 though the question is whether he will be.\n\nThis fight will give us more insights about Benn. Can he make it back to welterweight in good shape, and just how solid a contender will he be there? Benn will start answering those questions against Prograis."

            "content": "The big winners\n\nBodø/Glimt’s 2-1 defeat of Inter at San Siro continued this season’s miracle. The post-match discussion between Inter coach Cristian Chivu and his opposite number, Kjetil Knutsen, was one of admiration, an acknowledgment the Norwegian team had been too good for the runaway Serie A leaders. Even though Inter were without Lautaro Martínez, their standard bearer, a comeback seemed likely as they dominated the early stages. But they found no way through, eventually falling victim to the high-quality, high-speed attacking that had left them with a 3-1 deficit to overcome from the first leg.\n\n“The hardest thing was to create an opening,” lamented Inter’s Nicolò Barella of the long spell of toil that preceded Jens Petter Hauge stabbing in his sixth goal in this season’s competition before Håkon Evjen completed a counter and sealed progress with a brilliant strike.\n\n“We tried everything we could,” Chivu said. Like Manchester City and Atlético Madrid before them, Inter were dumbfounded by the team laying claim to be Scandinavia’s best since IFK Gothenburg picked up two Uefa Cups in the 1980s and reached the European Cup semi-final in 1986.\n\nGalatasaray are into the last 16 after goals by Victor Osimhen and Barış Alper Yilmaz in extra time at Juventus. That tells nothing of the full story of a classic tie, which almost became a classic comeback. Probably the main reason Juve did not fully overturn their 5-2 first-leg deficit was the dismissal of Lloyd Kelly, a red card awarded by video assistant when the on-field official had already awarded a second yellow. How video officials reached that decision was mysterious, controversial; Kelly looked to have accidentally landed on Yilmaz. The Englishman initially believed VAR would come to his rescue but stormed down the tunnel. He missed out on the ecstatic scenes that followed Weston McKennie levelling the tie at 5-5. In injury time, though, Juve ran out of legs, counting the cost of a third red card in four matches.\n\nIn Wednesday’s earlier game, Atalanta had already preserved the dignity of Serie A with a 4-1 defeat of Borussia Dortmund. Atalanta trailed 2-0 from the first leg but perhaps we should have paid attention to a telling stat before kick-off: there has been an Italian team in the last 16 of the competition every season since 1987-88. In Bergamo, Mario Pašalić’s header put Atalanta 3-2 up on aggregate, only for Karim Adeyemi’s lovely goal to push the tie towards extra time. The denouement was bizarre: Dortmund defender Ramy Bensebaini was sent off after his studs caught the head of Atalanta’s Nikola Krstović in the penalty area as he attempted a backheel flick. Lazar Samardžić stepped up in the ninth minute of added time, with all Atalanta’s usual penalty takers subbed off, to score the spot-kick. He lashed it home to maintain the honour of Italian calcio.\n\nJosé Mourinho has now lost his last 10 Champions League knockout ties. At Real Madrid, parking the Benfica bus did not prove a successful strategy. Although this time it was a literal bus: Mourinho, banned after his red card in the first leg, watched the second leg sat in the team coach. Benfica scored first at the Santiago Bernabéu against a rather languid Madrid through Rafa Silva, only to leave space for Aurélien Tchouaméni to score from distance. In the 80th minute, Vinícius Júnior scored the decider of an edgy match, issuing the final word on a tie that concluded with relative calm. The fallout from last week’s first leg, in which Benfica’s Gianluca Prestianni was accused of racially abusing Vinícius, may continue for some time. “Mourinho and I were in contact and share the same feeling: frustration and pride,” said Benfica’s assistant coach, João ­Tralhão. Mourinho’s thoughts remain private. For now, at least.\n\nPlayer of the week\n\nIt all came up Norway, as Alexander Sørloth, the one-time Bodø/Glimt loanee, scored the treble for Atlético Madrid that ended Club Brugge’s participation. Sørloth will probably partner Erling Haaland at the summer’s World Cup. The 30-year-old has a harsh journeyman reputation but his skillset has found its home within a Diego Simeone team undergoing a reboot. The hat-trick was Sørloth’s fifth goal in two matches, after a weekend double against Espanyol. They said it\n\n“There are moments when you lose precision and it’s difficult to recover the level.” Luis Enrique breathed a sigh of relief after Paris Saint-Germain’s 2-2 draw with Monaco, who had Mamadou Coulibaly harshly sent off and missed a golden chance to level the tie when Wout Faes headed wide. As it was, the holders squeezed through 5-4 on aggregate. They remain unconvincing, and are yet to find the stride of last season.\n\nThe pundit’s chair\n\n“Italian teams play at a slow pace. When they find teams that play press and run, they don’t have the quality, aren’t accustomed to playing at a high pace, and make mistakes … As soon as they increase the pace in Serie A, they are stopped because a challenge is too hard, a player’s ear is touched, and they go down. These are the results. We play at a slow pace, unfortunately, and when it happens, it’s hard to be dangerous.” Champions League-winning coach Fabio Capello, speaking after Inter’s exit on Sky Italia, diagnoses the Serie A malaise.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nFriday’s last 16 draw takes place in Nyon, Switzerland, and the playoffs, or “punishment round” as some insiders term it, have opened up some potentially huge ties. Paris Saint-Germain face either Barcelona or Chelsea. Galatasaray’s reward is one of Liverpool or Tottenham, whose interim coach Igor Tudor had a stint with the Turkish club.\n\nManchester City could face familiar foes: Real Madrid, with whom they have clashed plenty of times before in recent years, or Bodø/Glimt, who shocked them in January. There’s also the potential of an all-English tie in Newcastle v Chelsea, and an all-German one in Bayer Leverkusen v Bayern Munich."

            "content": "When the whistle blows to start USA v Argentina on Sunday in Nashville, a new period of the Emma Hayes era will begin in earnest. The team preparing to play La Albiceleste in Tennessee for the 11th SheBelieves Cup, followed by Canada and Colombia, is the first in more than a year to feature no uncapped players.\n\nFor a head coach who spent 2025 setting, challenging or matching all-time USWNT records for capping players, that is a notable shift and it marks the next phase of the team’s World Cup preparation.\n\nThe first two chapters: Nearly two years ago, Hayes took hold of the humbled giants two months before the Paris Olympics. While noting she felt like a “heart surgeon in the middle of emergency surgery”, the first phase was a whirlwind redemption run that culminated in the USWNT’s fifth gold medal.\n\nIt was slow after the tournament, but last year Hayes worked methodically with her team to develop talent, test a broader pool, foster competition and fold new players into the environment. While securing a record of 12 wins and three defeats, Hayes capped 44 players in the calendar year, the most in the team’s history. She gave debuts to 16 players, the most since 1985, with 38 in all getting starts, the second-most in history and the most since 2001. Since taking over, Hayes has doled out 32 debuts and starts to 55 players.\n\n“You got to create competition,” Hayes said last week. “But to create competition, you got to give people experiences.” Indicating that no one, including those previously in starting spots, was 100% safe in their role, Hayes said: “I expect more competition as a result of the decisions we took last year. But you’ve got to perform. That’s the bottom line.”\n\nThe next step: The absence of uncapped players signifies a shift. Rather than trialling and testing an enormous pool, the four-time Women’s World Cup winners are moving toward refining the group Hayes has built as they prepare for the qualifying tournament in November. “I do think there is clarity, a lot more clarity in terms of the squad of players we are building around for the upcoming year,” said Hayes.\n\nFans can expect a few key themes from this period. For one, as Hayes works towards the Concacaf W Championship (which serves as World Cup qualification), observers can expect healthy experimentation and rotation in the starting XI.\n\nView image in fullscreen Chelsea’s Naomi Girma (left) is part of an established USWNT central defensive pairing. Photograph: Ben Whitley/PA\n\nInjuries, as ever, are one cause for this. Catarina Macario, Kate Wiesner, Tierna Davidson, Croix Bethune, Michelle Cooper, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson are absent due to injuries and other fitness precautions, though Hayes indicated they would all compete for roles when fit. As they re-emerge, and club form fluctuates, some in the camp may move to continue their growth with the under-23s or other youth teams.\n\nAnother cause for rotation and fluctuation is the necessary balance between perfecting the team’s core while encouraging competition and building experience in the main pool. Hayes illustrated this point while discussing her first-choice center-backs, Emily Sonnett and Naomi Girma, and the cadre of less experienced options around them: “When you’ve got such experience like Girma and Sonnett and then a big gap below, it’s always a balance between developing them and developing the players who are my starting center-back pair.”\n\nThere are no uncapped players in camp. But outside five players, no one has more than 42; Riley Jackson has one and 12 players have 10 or fewer. Complemented by a spine of veterans, it is still a notably young squad. Hayes will emphasize gaining experience for all of them before the World Cup: “My job as a coach is to recognize I have to get a group of players ready. And if I just selected 14 players all of the time I genuinely think I’d be failing in this job.”\n\nAnother riveting theme this year is the assured competition for starting roles come next summer. Despite the experience gap Hayes illustrated at center-back, numerous players staked their claim last year for roles held firmly by others two years ago. The goalkeeper position feels open. “Triple Espresso” – Wilson, Swanson and Trinity Rodman – stunned for a summer, but the trio have not figured together since. A squad always dense with attacking talent offered other options in the interim. And with Sam Coffey, Lily Yohannes, Claire Hutton, Jaedyn Shaw, Rose Lavelle, Olivia Moultrie, Lindsey Heaps and, when fit, Bethune, all jockeying for lead roles in the midfield, that could quickly become the most interesting part of the pitch to watch.\n\nThey will face interesting competition with varied styles in the SheBelieves Cup. Colombia, ranked 20th in the world, are making their second appearance, and have provided the USWNT entertaining, at times technically masterful and often physically challenging tests in recent meetings. Argentina, ranked 30th, are also making their second appearance and will hope to improve on their last-place finish in 2021. Canada, longtime rivals to the US, enter the fray without a number of marquee names (Olivia Smith is a doubt after an injury in the FA Cup, while Adriana Leon and Ashley Lawrence were omitted to give others a chance) after some disappointing results in 2025, including a 3-0 loss to the USWNT.\n\nThe US, who finished second behind Japan in last year’s edition, will compete to claim their eighth title on 7 March.\n\nGet in touch\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email moving.goalposts@theguardian.com."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says the salvage operation he has taken on at Tottenham is tougher than he envisaged and is most likely his hardest job in management.\n\nThe interim coach, who is preparing for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Fulham, has worked with his new squad since the beginning of last week, having replaced the sacked Thomas Frank. Tudor lost his first game 4-1 at home to Arsenal on Sunday, which left Spurs four points above the relegation zone.\n\nAn alarming fitness situation has improved slightly with the return of Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso to training, meaning Tudor will be without eight injured players at Fulham, plus the suspended Cristian Romero, though Micky Van de Ven is expected to be fit.\n\nSpurs are without a win in nine league matches and Tudor’s eyes are wide open about the scale of the task. “Probably, yes … I agree with you,” Tudor said when asked whether the role was more difficult than expected.\n\n“It’s very tough … but it is how it is. So daily work, focus, raising in all things we need to do – physical condition, mental confidence, performance and waiting for the [injured] players to come back.”\n\nTudor started work as a manager in 2013 and is now in his 12th job. Was it the biggest challenge? “Probably,” he said. “If I recognise the difficulties there are, probably, yes. It’s an even bigger challenge, an even bigger motivation to do this and we do it.”\n\nTudor described Spurs’s plight before the Arsenal game as an “emergency situation” and he warmed to the theme before another derby. “It’s not looking to the style at this moment,” he said. “Because now it’s a question of life and death.\n\n“There is not too much time to think about performance or style. Every game needs to be prepared in that way. How we can take these points, one way or the other?\n\n“In Italy, they use the term ‘have the mentality of a small team.’ That is the key, to always have motivation when you play big teams. So that’s the start, of course, and we work a lot on that. The players are aware of the situation.”\n\nLike Frank before him, Tudor refuses to use the R word – relegation. “I never used it but not because it’s something too scary or it’s a danger word or we won’t sleep,” he said. “It’s about that we need to refocus on ourselves.”"

            "content": "Senne Lammens revels in the “war” of being Manchester United’s goalkeeper in the hugely physical Premier League yet remains bemused at being applauded when entering a primary school classroom on a Wednesday afternoon.\n\nClearly the 23-year-old is still adjusting to a rocketing career trajectory. Following his £18m transfer from Royal Antwerp on 1 September, Lammens made his debut in the 2-0 win against Sunderland on 4 October, and established himself as the first-choice with a faultless start that featured five clean sheets in 21 league games.\n\nTo do so in the relentless glare at United is impressive. In Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton, Lammens was again calm and assured, producing vital saves while navigating the hurly-burly of set pieces and corners as players crowded his goalmouth.\n\nView image in fullscreen Senne Lammens is first to the ball while under pressure from Everton’s Thierno Barry as the United goalkeeper keeps another clean sheet. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n\nLammens shrugs when considering the chaos he faces at dead balls. “Physically Everton was a big battle, a big game so I’m still recovering from that,” Lammens says. “It’s been like this. It’s just the way it is – the Premier League, it’s physicality and a bit of war in the 18-yard box.”\n\nAt 6ft 4in and with a robust frame, the young Belgian is built for the game’s demands. “It’s one of my strengths,” he says, “so sometimes I like the challenge as well. Of course it can get too much sometimes but everyone has to deal with it. It’s not like only one team does it, it’s everyone in general.\n\n“As a goalkeeper you have to get used to that and train for it and get better at it. I’ve been doing a good job at it so I’ll continue to do that. The club said to me that it was the most physical. It’s the best league but the physicality is the biggest difference. We do it as well sometimes, making it hard for the goalkeeper.\n\n“In Belgium it’s less physical but still the principles are the same. Here there are a bit more bodies in front of you, but my team has helped me out with blocking guys. You have to be big and not be pushed around easily.”\n\nLammens suggests that greater protection for keepers may have to be considered. “There have to be certain rules,” he says. “You can’t get to the point where it’s too [unfair]. That’s something the Premier League has to look towards.”\n\nLammens made his debut for Club Brugge in July 2021 before moving to Antwerp two years later. He remained uncapped at senior level for Belgium until November’s 7-0 win over Liechtenstein, replacing one of his heroes. “Thibaut Courtois was always a big thing when I was growing up because his saving is just world class,” Lammens says of the 33-year-old Real Madrid goalkeeper.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘You have to be big and not be pushed around easily,’ says Senne Lammens. Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Shutterstock\n\nBayern Munich’s 39-year-old Manuel Neuer was another source of inspiration. “When I was growing up my biggest idol was probably Neuer,” he says. “I take pride in being an all-around goalkeeper and that’s why I was such a big fan because he didn’t really have a weak point, so that’s something I want to take from him. But I try to learn something from everyone because everyone has strong points.”\n\nLammens is speaking at a Manchester United Foundation event at Partington Central Academy for World Book Day. The surprise at being cheered by pupils draws comparison with being ambushed by paparazzi this month when leaving the Ivy in Manchester after dining with his partner.\n\n“That was one of the more special moments. Special, like I couldn’t believe it. It’s not always the best feeling – they weren’t too bad. But for my girlfriend and I this was the first time with paparazzi. Looking back, it was quite funny. The club warned me that Manchester United is a different animal, especially social media wise.\n\n“It’s a bit new for me, but it’s also probably one of my best feelings when you go into [schools] and see all those children cheering for you and they don’t believe it’s you. Because I was there once in my life, it’s not that long ago. I still remember those times.”\n\nAway from the game, Lammens reads – his favourite book is Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist – and follows other sports. “I don’t really watch a lot of football because on a daily basis you’re doing a lot with football,” he says. “You want to switch off mentally. Of course you still have to watch other people play but everyone has his own experiences so the best learning school is yourself, your own experiences.\n\n“I’m a big sports guy. I love watching other sports and other athletes do their thing. Especially how they prepare for the game and think about their game. Like in the NBA and with, for example, Kobe Bryant or LeBron James.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Senne Lammens with the pupils of Partington Central Academy. Photograph: MUFC\n\nAfter being recommended by Tony Coton, United’s goalkeeping scout, as the replacement for the erratic André Onana, Lammens has developed a rewarding working relationship with Tom Heaton, the third-choice keeper. He served early notice of his quality when gathering a corner with authority against Sunderland. It drew a rousing cheer from the Old Trafford faithful.\n\n“It was really nice getting the support from the fans and my teammates, the best feeling in the beginning. And they also gave me even more confidence to keep going and to make the steps I did after that.”\n\nIn an improving campaign under Michael Carrick that has garnered 16 points from the interim manager’s first six games, Lammens wants to maintain consistency. “I don’t really want to look too much into the past,” he says. “It’s been great but I still have to prove myself every week. I just have to keep going now. It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world but also you have to look through that – it’s still a game of football, the game isn’t that much different.”"

            "content": "ONE TO FORGET\n\nNot so much a bad night at the office as a high-stakes, avant-garde masterpiece of self-destruction, Ramy Bensebaini’s performance for Borussia Dortmund as they crashed out of Bigger Cup is destined to go down in the annals as one of the most hapless in the tournament’s history. While there have been costlier mistakes (hello, Loris Karius) and far more high-profile disintegrations (bonjour, b@nter-era PSG), it is difficult to recall any one elite professional footballer being responsible for quite so many howlers in one game as the hapless Algerian left-back.\n\nDuring a performance labelled “hesitant”, “reckless” and “unfathomable” in your Kickers, your Bilds and your Fußball Jeden Tags, the unfortunate Bensebaini was either directly or indirectly responsible for each of the four goals his team shipped as they threw away a two-goal first-leg lead over Atalanta to capitulate 4-3 on aggregate. He didn’t just open the door for the Serie A side, he rolled out the red carpet, provided valet parking and offered up the combination to the safe. On an evening that started badly and went quickly downhill, Bensebaini’s almost heroic failure to intercept a routine cross trundling through his penalty area allowed Gianluca Scamacca to halve Atalanta’s deficit, before his bizarre attempt to block a Davide Zappacosta shot from distance sent the ball past his own goalkeeper, Gregor Kobel, as the Italians made it 2-0 by half-time. It was slightly unlucky, the kind of thing that could happen to just about anybody but given the myriad misfortunes the gods still had in store for Bensebaini, it was only ever going to happen to him.\n\nView image in fullscreen Ramy Bensebaini and Gregor Kobel after Atalanta’s second. Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty Images\n\nQuite early in the second half, Mario Pasalic nodded home Marten De Roon’s cross to send Atalanta in front on the night and on aggregate, the Croatian midfielder having ghosted in behind the completely oblivious Bensebaini at the far post to rise unmarked. It was at this point the thoughts of concerned citizens turned to that “Stop! Stop! He’s already dead!” gif from The Simpsons, but Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac opted to leave his left-back out there, possibly working under the assumption that things couldn’t possibly get any worse for his experienced defender. Hoo-boy.\n\nAfter Karim Adeyemi came on to pull a goal back and restore parity on aggregate, the tie looked to be heading for extra time but Bensebaini was having none of it. In the eighth minute of added time, Nikola Kristovic flung himself at a Pasalic cross, only to land face-first in the upturned studs of Bensebaini, who had for reasons best known to himself attempted to cut out the delivery by c0cking his left leg in the manner of a dog at their favourite lamp-post. While the referee was prepared to let the incident slide, VAR opted to stick its beak in and Atalanta were awarded a penalty, with our hero receiving his second yellow card of the game. Before Lazar Samardzic could smash the decisive goal into the top corner with the final kick of the tie, Bensebaini trudged off, having had a very public and belated full-stop put on an evening that was the stuff of nightmares. Still, if there’s an upside for him, it’s that it seems inconceivable that he will ever be unlucky enough to endure an evening that awful again.\n\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\n\nJoin Daniel Harris from 8pm GMT for Bigger Vase minute-by-minute updates from Nottingham Forest 1-1 Fenerbahce (agg: 4-1).\n\nView image in fullscreen Fener fans at the team’s hotel in Nottingham.

Barristers for Andy Pilley, who was handed a 13-year prison sentence in July 2023 for selling fraudulent energy contracts, claimed his convictions were unsafe as he experienced “disadvantage through difference” as a result of his ADHD not being recognised at the time of his trial. In his ruling, Lord Justice Edis said the prosecution’s case was “based upon extensive documentary evidence” and that Pilley was “able to engage with complex material” during the trial.\n\ndouble quotation mark Re: yesterday’s Football Daily.

            "content": "A number of European football federations fear they will lose money sending their national teams to the World Cup this summer, with an unusual hike in costs and inconsistencies around tax exemptions among the problems Fifa is being urged to rectify.\n\nAlthough Fifa approved record prize money of £539m for the tournament last December it may not be enough to prevent losses, or reduced profits, for competitors who would usually expect a World Cup to generate vital funds. An investigation by the Guardian and PA Media found particular concerns among football associations about the consequences of missing out on money that would largely be reinvested in local initiatives.\n\nAbout 10 FAs are understood to have shared misgivings between themselves, most recently at Uefa’s annual congress in Brussels a fortnight ago. It has also been informally raised with senior Fifa officials, some of whom appear “embarrassed” about the situation according to an executive from one FA.\n\nTeams that qualify receive $9m (£6.7m) each from Fifa and are handed $1.5m (£1.1m) in preparation costs. Those numbers are believed to have been the same for Qatar 2022, but the previous daily allowance of $850 (£627) per delegation member has been reduced to $600 (£442). One FA estimated that this would mean receiving about $500,000 (£369,000) less if its team remained at the World Cup, which has been expanded in length and number, for a month.\n\nSome FAs have calculated that they will make considerably less money in the US, Canada and Mexico than they did in Qatar; one, a fixture at international tournaments, told the Guardian it will in fact lose a sizeable sum in the event of elimination in the group stage or early in the knockout rounds.\n\nOne particularly aggravating element is a perceived unfairness around tax arrangements. Countries bidding for a World Cup are obliged to provide tax exemptions for FAs that qualify; those have been agreed with Canada and Mexico but no such arrangement has been reached with the US, meaning that nations potentially face vastly differing financial outlooks depending on where they were drawn to play.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Qatar World Cup cost less and was more lucrative for teams, with clear tax arrangements. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nState taxes within the US vary wildly. In California, where Los Angeles and San Francisco will host games, the top rate is 13.3%. In New Jersey, whose MetLife Stadium will stage the final, it stands at 10.75%. Teams largely based in states with lower rates, or outside the US, will find themselves financially advantaged unless an agreement is reached in the next three and a half months. Given that context, there is also frustration that FAs have been left to seek their own tax advice rather than being given specific assistance by Fifa.\n\nOther factors hiking costs include the tournament’s considerable travel demands, unfavourable exchange rates against the dollar, the well-publicised increase in ticket prices and the event’s duration. In Qatar there were four weeks between the opening game and final; this time around the 28-day mark will arrive as the quarter-finals commence.\n\nWhile some figures acknowledge that FAs are responsible for their own bonus structures, which inevitably make for a notable outlay, they point out it would be unworkable to offer a reduced package to that which was promised to their squads in Qatar. Another mitigation offered for this summer’s issues is the potential longer-term benefit of lengthy exposure to the vast North American market.\n\nFifa was contacted for comment."

            "content": "Where will you be when Bodø/Glimt win the Champions League? OK, they won’t win the Champions League, but they could win the Champions League. Could they? Four wins in a row. Manchester City, Atlético Madrid away, Inter, comprehensively, twice. It’s an astonishing run.\n\nI am generally cynical about anything foisted upon us by the game’s overlords, but after a brilliant couple of nights of football Uefa must be delighted with the drama and excitement these playoffs produced.\n\nParis Saint-Germain a Wout Faes glancing header away from being taken to extra time. Juventus thrillingly close to a 10-man comeback against Galatasaray. Atalanta keeping Serie A alive with an injury-time penalty. OK, less jeopardy with Qarabag, but you can’t have everything.\n\nIt is Bodø/Glimt who are the dream. They were of course helped by Manuel Akanji, who picked the wrong time to start buffering, giving the ball away and then going peak complain at anyone and everyone for a mistake that was at the very least 100% his fault.\n\nThere’s never a good time to do that, but especially when you’ve gone full Terry Butcher: Mr Bump-style bandage wrapped around your head. Butcher would’ve row-zedded that before any thoughts of playing out came into his head. Actually, Mr Bump might have at least knocked it down the channels.\n\nBut Glimt’s second goal was a thing of beauty. A glorious pass from Jens Petter Hauge and the touch and finish from Håkon Evjen was perfect. They are a good team, with good players – and this is them in pre-season.\n\nWhat struck me most was how the players and staff reacted at full-time. It is slightly different when you know you are through, when one goal isn’t going to change the game. But this wasn’t delirium at the end. It didn’t feel like Macclesfield knocking out Crystal Palace in the FA Cup: everyone running in different directions, not knowing how to act or who to hug (and to be clear, Macclesfield absolutely should have celebrated like that).\n\nThis was quite measured. You got a real sense that Glimt, if they did not expect it, knew it was achievable. OK, Serie A isn’t the Serie A people of a certain vintage instantly conjure in their minds: Van Basten, Gullit, James Richardson reading the papers. Sadly the 90s were ages ago. But, still, Inter are 10 points clear at the top. They have been in two of the past three Champions League finals.\n\nView image in fullscreen Bodø/Glimt were 2-1 winners in Milan, sealing a comfortable aggregate victory. Photograph: Claudia Greco/Reuters\n\nTransfermarkt figures put the difference in squad value at about €610m (£532m). Glimt’s weekly wage bill (FOR THE WHOLE SQUAD) is just over £150,000. Thanks to Jack Kenmare on Sportbible for listing some Premier League players who earn that on their own: Mateo Kovacic, Noni Madueke, Federico Chiesa, Joelinton, Sandro Tonali, Anthony Gordon and Mason Mount.\n\nTo paraphrase the Norwegian football expert and Football Weekly galáctico Lars Sivertsen – for whom this run is almost as profitable as Ole Gunnar Solskjær taking over at Manchester United – Glimt’s win is good for football. It is good for anyone who loves the game, and especially anyone who supports a team who don’t win anything – which is pretty much all of us.\n\nFootball is about hope. It is about dreaming that one day your team may be the best, or at least beat the best. Reality suggests this is very unlikely. But Glimt were in the second division of Norwegian football a few years ago and on Tuesday night they comfortably beat Inter.\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, they are the good guys. So often you think you’ve found a charming underdog story, only to discover the owner sells AK47s to children or makes videos of kittens vaping. There’s always something. A nation state, some collection of words – hedge bond tax scheme – that is in some way nefarious. But here it’s a tiny town near Father Christmas with a team who are just brilliantly run and well coached. It is all just, well, nice.\n\nAnd although we like to think the European Super League idea is dead, there are still big clubs who don’t think they should have to sully themselves with random sides from just north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nWill other teams, to quote Conor Coady, be “rubbing their lips” at the thought of getting Glimt in the latter stages of the competition? Probably not, but it is human nature to underestimate an opposition like that. Even if they do get knocked out by Sporting Lisbon or Manchester City in the next round, they have still given us the chance to ask: if they can do it, why can’t we?\n\nCambridge United are second in League Two. One defeat in their past 19 matches. Any lower-league fan will understand – it is an odd feeling to start to expect to win. You feel like you’re cheating. You don’t want to jinx it. I don’t even want to write this down. Please don’t be my fault.\n\nBut carry this on and it’s League One. Lincoln City are proving that it’s possible you don’t have to be one of the mega rich to compete in the third tier. OK, a movie star or a rapper or a quarterback may have to give us a few quid to get into the Championship and beyond, but it is possible.\n\nCould Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu be the first footballer to play in all four divisions for two teams? Will Louis Appéré be running the channels at the Etihad in 2028‑29? Fortunately I’ve never written a column wondering who Louis Appéré is, nor a column questioning the loyalty of Neil Harris.\n\nIn the early 90s we went up the divisions to the top of the second tier in consecutive years. It’s different now, but Glimt show good things are possible. Yes, they won’t win the Champions League, and we’ll get gubbed by MK Dons on Saturday. But you never know – and that tiny bit of hope is everything."

            "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo announced on Thursday that he had acquired a 25% stake in Saudi-owned Spanish second division club Almería.\n\n“This strategic investment in UD Almería reflects Ronaldo’s long-term commitment to professional football ownership,” read a statement from his new sports holding company, CR7 Sports Investments, which gave no financial details of the deal.\n\n“It has been a long-time ambition of mine to contribute to football,” the statement quoted Ronaldo as saying. “I look forward to working alongside the leadership team to support the club’s next phase of growth.”\n\nAlmería, who were last in the Spanish top flight in 2024, are third in the Segunda, one point from the automatic promotion places. The club are owned by Saudi group SMC.\n\nAlmería’s president, Mohamed al-Khereiji, suggested the player would be particularly involved in the club’s youth programme. “He is considered the best on the pitch,” Khereiji said. “He knows the Spanish leagues very well and understands the potential of what we are building.”\n\nRonaldo, who has played in the Saudi Pro League for Al-Nassr since 2023 and who also owns a stake in the club, became the first footballer included in Bloomberg’s “Billionaire Index” last October. He recently returned to the Al-Nassr first team after a spat over the way the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the national sovereign wealth fund which controls four clubs in the league, handled the winter transfer window. He has scored four times in the last three games.\n\nRonaldo is set to take part in his sixth World Cup next summer although he has suggested that, aged 41, it could be his last."

It is believed that Ukraine needs to be equipped with “wunderwaffe”.\n\n“Kyiv would be able to claim more favourable terms for ending the hostilities if it possessed a nuclear bomb, or at least a so-called ‘dirty bomb’.”\n\nNo evidence was provided, with British and French officials dismissing the claim as a lie.\n\nThe bluster comes as Western sources say Russia is losing 40,000 troops a month – more than it can replace.\n\n\n\nSince the full-scale invasion in 2022, more than 50,000 of Putin’s soldiers have reportedly deserted.\n\nOver four years of slaughter, Moscow’s forces have seen a staggering toll of 1.25 million troops killed or injured.\n\nYet instead of backing down, Russia unleashed 420 drones and 39 missiles at Ukraine overnight, including 11 ballistic missiles, hammering homes and critical infrastructure across eight regions.\n\n\n\nDozens, including children, were injured.\n\nUkrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha blasted the terror, saying: “When the whole world demands Moscow to finally stop this senseless war, Putin bets on more terror, attacks and aggression.”\n\nThe chaos spilled across Nato’s borders overnight.\n\nPosting on X at 4am UTC, the Polish Armed Forces Operational Command wrote: “Attention. In connection with another massive attack by the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine in recent times, conducted using air assault means, the operation of Polish and allied aviation has commenced in our airspace.”\n\nTwo hours later it confirmed aircraft had stood down and air defences returned to normal readiness.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, US-brokered talks grind on in Geneva, with envoys for President Donald Trump pushing to end the war now entering its fifth year.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky also warned that Putin must be stopped after “already starting” World War Three.\n\nFrom his headquarters in Kyiv, and on the eve of the war’s anniversary, the president argued that only intense military and economic pressure would end it."

I’m amazed someone was able to get anywhere near him because he is usually really closely protected.\n\n“They must have timed it when he wasn’t with prison officers and must have used a weapon to injure him so severely.”\n\nOther inmates locked up in the high-security prison include Sarah Everard’s murderer Wayne Couzens, serial killer Levi Bellfield and Facebook Killer Peter Chapman.\n\n\n\nA Prison Service spokesperson said: “A prisoner is receiving treatment after an incident at HMP Frankland on Thursday morning.\n\n“It would be inappropriate to comment further while police investigate.”\n\nDurham Police said in an update: “The 52-year-old prisoner who was injured during this morning’s assault in the workshop at HMP Frankland remains in a serious condition in hospital following treatment for head injuries.\n\n“Police forensic teams have examined the scene of the attack throughout the day to gather evidence.\n\n“A suspect, a male prisoner in his mid-40s, has been identified by officers investigating the incident. He has not been arrested at this stage but remains in detention within the prison.”\n\n\n\nA North East Ambulance Service spokesperson said: “We received a call at 9:23am to reports of an incident at HMP Frankland in County Durham.\n\n“We despatched two ambulance crews to the scene and requested support from the Great North Air Ambulance Service.\n\n“One patient was transported to hospital by road.”\n\nThe Soham killer is serving life in HMP Frankland for the murders of 10-year-old girls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.\n\nHuntley attacked by lags in prison Huntley’s vile crimes have led to fellow inmates attacking him behind bars at least twice before. In May 2018, he said that a violent prisoner armed with a makeshift “shank” knife tried to kill him in his cell. In a prison recording leaked to The Sun, the Soham killer says the attacker “came in with a razor blade on a toothbrush”. Details of the alleged incident have never been made public. Huntley explains on tape: “There was an attempt on my life last year. “I have no problems telling you his name, it was a prisoner who tried to kill me. A guy called Simon Maskrey. “He came into my cell armed with a weapon and tried to cut my throat. “I managed to kick him in the chest and then to the stomach. I took the weapon off him and he was on the floor. “At that point, one of my friends turned up and I said, ‘He has got a weapon’, just as this Simon was getting back to his feet. “This Simon then looked at him then looked back at me and then my friend grabbed him from behind. “Shortly afterwards staff arrived.” Huntley almost died in a previous blade attack when prisoner Damien Fowkes tried to cut his throat with a shank in 2010. Huntley had 21 stitches which left him with a scar from his jugular to the other side of his windpipe. He says: “It was 2mm away from my jugular. The only thing I could think of was get a message to my family to say I was OK.” Murderer Mark Hobson also threw boiling water over him in Wakefield Prison in 2005.\n\n\n\nThe 52-year-old carried out the double child killing in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in 2002.\n\nSchool pals Holly and Jessica vanished after leaving a family barbecue in Soham to go and buy some sweets.\n\nBut school caretaker Huntley lured the girls to his home and murdered them before disposing of their bodies in a ditch.\n\nHe later returned to the scene and tried to set them on fire.\n\n\n\nPolice and the local community rallied together in a huge search effort to find the children.\n\nTheir bodies were not found until more than a week later – near an airbase, 12 miles from Soham.\n\nSuspicions were raised after the school caretaker gave detailed interviews to the press about the girls, and he appeared to take an unusual interest in the case.\n\nHe gave a detailed account when asked how the girls might react to a stranger in one interview.\n\nChillingly, he described how Holly would likely go quietly but Jessica would “put up a real fight and a real struggle”.\n\n\n\nJournalists raised their concerns to the police after feeling something was off with his responses.\n\n“He knew how they’d react because that’s how they reacted when he killed them,” one reporter said later.\n\nLocals also came forward with information about the caretaker after seeing him on the news.\n\nHuntley, one of Britain’s most infamous killers, was convicted in 2003 after pleading not guilty.\n\nHis then fiancée Maxine Carr, a teaching assistant at Holly and Jessica’s school in the Cambridgeshire town, had given him a false alibi.\n\n\n\nShe was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail for perverting the course of justice and issued with a new identity on release.\n\nCarr infamously turned on Huntley as he sat in the dock during his murder trial, describing him as “that thing in the box”.\n\nShe was granted a lifelong anonymity order in 2005, which protects her new identity indefinitely.\n\nSchool caretaker Huntley has continually failed to give the grieving families the closure they need.\n\nIn court, he claimed both 10-year-olds died accidentally, lying that Holly drowned in his bath and that he inadvertently suffocated Jessica while trying to stifle her screams.\n\n\n\nYet in tapes recorded behind bars in 2018, the beast confessed to deliberately killing Jessica to stop her raising the alarm.\n\nHe still insisted Holly’s death was an accident.\n\nIt comes after we reported how Huntley had his red Manchester United-style shirt seized by jail bosses — after The Sun revealed he was strutting around in it.\n\nOfficers stormed into his cell and confiscated the top, which has a white No 10 on the back in an apparent sick reference to his schoolgirl victims.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nLags had complained about the top — similar to ones worn by 10-year-olds Holly and Jessica on the day he murdered them in 2002.\n\n\n\nGuards also seized framed pictures of Huntley with ex Maxine Carr plus other items including DVDs."

            "content": "SKI HORROR Snowboarder dragged more than 50ft to her death after her backpack got stuck in ski chairlift\n\nNEW details have emerged about the tragic death of an Australian woman who died in a freak ski accident in Japan.\n\nBrooke Day was snowboarding with friends when she suffered critical injuries at Tsugaike Mountain Resort in Otari.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 22-year-old died after her backpack became hooked on a ski lift.\n\nAccording to Japanese outlet Yomiuri Shimbun, Brooke was pulled along by the lift for 18 yards before staff pressed the emergency stop button.\n\nInvestigators believe she was unable to get off the chairlift after an unfastened buckle on her backpack became caught on the carriage.\n\n\n\nAs the lift continued moving, she was left dangling above the ground.\n\nBy the time the lift ground to a halt, Brooke was hanging 26 feet in the air.\n\nIt took rescuers 15 minutes to bring her down.\n\nShe reportedly suffered cardiac arrest during the ordeal and was rushed to hospital.\n\n\n\nDespite doctors’ efforts, she was pronounced dead on January 30.\n\nIn a statement to 7NEWS Australia, Tsugaike Gondola Lift Co. said the accident occurred after a “buckle at the end of an unfastened waist belt attached to a backpack carried by a customer became in the lift carriage”.\n\n“Since the chest strap was fastened, the backpack remained attached to the body,” the statement continued.\n\n“Subsequently, staff pressed the stop button to halt the lift. Prompt rescue efforts were carried out, and the customer was transported by ambulance.”\n\nBrooke had been working at a physiotherapy clinic at the resort as a receptionist.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was “providing consular assistance to the family of an Australian who died in Japan”.\n\nThe tragedy follows a string of terrifying chairlift incidents around the world.\n\nIn December, a tourist was killed in Montenegro when a ski lift suddenly slid backwards and slammed into the chair behind.\n\nThe violent collision trapped the victim’s wife and sent the man plunging from the lift.\n\nHis wife was left stranded for hours in the damaged chair, forced to endure the aftermath of the horror incident she had just witnessed.\n\n\n\nHe was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIn January 2025, two young women were left in intensive care and at least 30 others were seriously injured when a ski lift pulley snapped at a Resort in Spain\n\nThe mechanical failure left around 80 skiers and snowboarders dangling helplessly from their chairs as emergency crews rushed to the mountain to reach those trapped in the terrifying ordeal."

            "content": "AN ELITE American fighter jet pilot has allegedly betrayed his country by training Chinese military pilots.\n\nGerald Brown, 65, earned invaluable knowledge by commanding units responsible for delivery nuclear weapons – then shared his experience with his sworn enemies, prosecutors say.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flying ace began training Chinese military pilots three years ago, 27 years after leaving active service, federal prosecutors said in a complaint.\n\nHe allegedly negotiated with Stephen Su Bin – a Chinese national who conspired to hack into US defense contractors computer networks and steal sensitive military and export-controlled data for China.\n\n“Throughout these communications, Brown consistently stated his intent to train [Chinese] military pilots in combat aircraft operations,” the department alleged in its press release.\n\nBrown wrote in his resumé that his “objective” was to work as an “instructor fighter pilot.”\n\nREAD MORE US NEWS GUNNED DOWN Four US speedboat passengers killed by Cuba coastguard as 'guns found on board'\n\n“A co-conspirator told Brown that he hoped Brown would be assigned to ‘my base, but otherwise you’ll go where is the local equivalent as the [U.S. Air Force] Weapon School,’ the release alleged.\n\n“Later, he stated to a co-conspirator that, upon his arrival in China, ‘Now…. I have the chance to fly and instruct fighter pilots again!'”\n\nBrown traveled to China in December 2023 to start his job, training China’s military pilots.\n\nAfter arriving in the communist regime, he “answered questions for three hours about the US Air Force,” the department alleged.\n\n\n\nHe remained in China until he returned to the United States earlier this month – when he was arrested.\n\nWho is U.S. Air Force officer and pilot Gerald Brown? More on the flying ace's background Gerald Eddie Brown, Jr., also known by the call sign “Runner,” 65, is a U.S. citizen The ex-F-35 Lightning II instructor pilot has decades of experience flying U.S. military aircraft\n\nBrown served for over 24 years in the U.S. Air Force\n\nHe left active duty in 1996 with the rank of Major\n\nBrown commanded sensitive units with responsibility for nuclear weapons delivery systems\n\nHe also led combat missions\n\nBrown served as a fighter pilot instructor and simulator instructor on a variety of fighter and attack aircraft\n\nThese included the F-4 “Phantom II,” F-15 “Eagle,” F-16 “Fighting Falcon,” and the A-10 “Thunderbolt II” (Warthog)\n\nBrown then served as a commercial cargo pilot\n\nMore recently, he was a contract simulator instructor for two different U.S. defense contractors\n\nHe trained U.S. military pilots to fly the A-10 and the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter\n\n“The United States Air Force trained Major Brown to be an elite fighter pilot and entrusted him with the defense of our nation,” said assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg.\n\n“He now stands charged with training Chinese military pilots.\n\n“When US persons – whether military or civilian – provide training to a foreign military, that activity is illegal unless they have a license from the State Department.\n\n“The National Security Division will use all tools at its disposal to protect our military advantages and hold to account those who would violate the AECA.”\n\n\n\nBrown “allegedly betrayed his country by training Chinese pilots to fight against those he swore to protect,” said assistant director Roman Rozhavsky of the FBI’s Counterintelligence and Espionage Division.\n\n“The Chinese government continues to exploit the expertise of current and former members of the U.S. armed forces to modernize China’s military capabilities.”\n\nRozhavsky said that the pilot’s arrest served “as a warning” to others keen to betray the US and the country’s many allies.\n\n\n\n“The FBI and our partners will stop at nothing to hold accountable anyone who collaborates with our adversaries to harm our service members and jeopardize our national security,” Rozhavsky vowed.\n\nUS Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro for the District of Columbia accused Brown of allegedly “betraying the country, jeopardizing the safety of our servicemembers and allies.”\n\n“As an Air Force Officer, Brown took an oath to defend our nation against all enemies foreign and domestic – he broke that oath,” Pirro claimed.\n\n“The Department of Justice and my prosecutors are steadfast in our commitment to use every lawful tool available to keep American military expertise where it belongs – here in America,” the attorney added.\n\n\n\nThose who leak US military training secrets to adversaries, such as China, “represent a significant threat to national security,” said Lee M. Russ, executive director of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations Office of Special Projects.\n\nRuss accused Brown of “violating trust and endangering our service members.”\n\nThe complaint alleges that, since at least in or around August 2023, Brown willfully conspired with foreign nationals and Americans to provide combat aircraft training to pilots in the Chinese Air Force, known as the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).\n\nThe PLA serves the Communist Party of China (CPC), which recently practised a daring decapitation strike drill on Taiwan.\n\n“This training was a defense service under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR),” the Office of Public Affairs’ release added.\n\n\n\n“Brown, a U.S. person under the ITAR, lacked the required license from the State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) to provide that training to foreign persons or foreign military units.”\n\nThe ex-US Air Force officer has been charged with giving and conspiring to provide defense services to Chinese military pilots without authorization, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).\n\nBrown, also known by the call sign “Runner,” is today expected to have his initial appearance before a Magistrate Judge in the Southern District of Indiana.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nHis arrest comes just two months before President Donald Trump is due to visit China, where he is expected to talk about Taiwan, soybeans, and evil Vladimir Putin’s bloodthirsty war in Ukraine.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping has set an ambitious goal of shaping the PLA into a “world-class”force by 2049, warned the U.S. Naval Institute last October."

The school caretaker turned prolific killer is believed to have been targeted by another inmate before 9.30am this morning, at the notorious HMP Frankland in County Durham. An insider has reportedly revealed the horror unleashed in the early morning attack on one of the UKs most famous inmates.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe 52-year-old was reportedly battered in the head with a metal pole and left in a pool of his blood before being rushed to hospital.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

A source revealed the chaos the infamous prison was left in following the attack, according to The Sun.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe insider said: \"It was absolute chaos and Huntley was in a terrible state. I'm amazed someone was able to get anywhere near him because he is usually really closely protected.\"\n\nPrison Services did not confirm the identity of the injured inmate but did confirm a prisoner was taken to hospital. A spokesperson said: \"It would be inappropriate to comment further while police investigate.\"\n\nAn air ambulance was seen landing at HMP Frankland but the North East Ambulance Service said a prisoner was taken to hospital on the road.

It is believed unauthorised items, including DVDs, USB sticks and magazines, were found in his cell.\n\nHuntley was a school caretaker in Soham, Cambridgeshire, when 10-year-olds Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman vanished. Their bodies were tragically found two weeks later in a ditch near RAF Lakenheath, in Suffolk. The caretaker had lured the girls into his home but what exactly happened inside is not known - the cause of their deaths were ruled as asphyxiation.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nView 5 Images Huntley was being housed at HMP Frankland, in County Durham (Image: Simon Greener / Chronicle Live)\n\nIn December 2003, Huntley was convicted of the murder of both girls and sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment.

In the Thursday afternoon Manchester rain they climbed on board the party’s battle bus - joined by party deputy leader Lucy Powell - outside the giant Tesco store in Gorton.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAsked who their main opponent is, Mr Burnham said: ‘Reform, as we’ve said that all along. You know, Greater Manchester is based on partnership and unity, as Angeliki has said. You want to see unity, and not let division into Greater Manchester and that message has really got through in this byelection.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNigel Farage ridiculed in Brexit bus stunt as by-election battle intensifies READ MORE :\n\nView 3 Images Andy Burnham, Labour candidate Angeliki Stogia and Deputy Leader Lucy Powell (Image: PA)\n\nPolls opened this morning in what is seen as a tightly contested three way battle between Labour, Reform and the Greens.\n\nGreen party leader Zack Polanski said his party was “neck and neck” with Reform UK to overturn Labour’s 13,000-vote majority, and that Labour will need to “search their conscience” if Reform UK wins.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nKeir Starmer has said only Labour can see off Nigel Farage’s Reform, saying that a vote for the Greens was “in effect, a vote for Reform”.\n\nLabour candidate Ms Stogia remained bullish, saying: “We've got more than 1,000 volunteers out, as we speak. We're expecting more people to join us, later on, people are enthused with the campaign, and we are going to carry on knocking, and, you know, we've got the blessings of the Manchester rain!”\n\nView 3 Images Andy Burnham, Labour candidate Angeliki Stogia and Deputy Leader Lucy Powell (Image: PA)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAsked if he was disappointed that he was blocked from standing, Mr Burnham said: “No we have a brilliant candidate and she hasn’t put a foot wrong, she’s been out every day, she’s done us proud.”\n\nMs Powell added: “We’ve got one team here and Angeliki has been right in the middle of that.”\n\nVictory would buy Mr Starmer some breathing space after a period in which his leadership of Labour has been questioned. Defeat is likely to pile the pressure back on, with some suggesting a third-placed finish in a previously safe part of Greater Manchester could spell the end for the Prime Minister.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe PM has said: “The choice at today’s by-election could not be more stark. Unity or division. Driving down the cost of living with Labour or driving a wedge between communities under Reform. Moving forwards together, or opening up anger and division that holds our country back.\n\n“Reform’s Matthew Goodwin thinks people who aren’t white can’t be English and wants women who choose not to have children to pay more tax. Vote Labour in Gorton and Denton today to send him and his toxic politics packing.”\n\nGR News presenter Matt Goodwin – who has faced criticism for his comments on women, Muslims and British citizenship – is standing for Reform UK while Hannah Spencer, a Trafford councillor and plumber by trade, is the Green party candidate."

            "content": "Donald Trump's unhinged latest as Epstein probe looks into 'withheld' docs naming him\n\nDonald Trump is out of the public eye today - and in his absence, things haven't exactly stayed on message. Meanwhile, the US rolled out the red carpet for Tommy Robinson, for some reason\n\nView Image Trump's agenda has been thrown off course by Epstein...again (Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nDonald Trump spent yesterday out of the public eye - and has no scheduled public appearances today. Presumably having to stand up for nearly two hours on Tuesday night tuckered out the poor lamb.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nStill, in his absence, everything's staying on message - right? All of the Trump administration's attention focused on affordability from now until the Midterms?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNah, everyone's talking about Jeffrey Epstein again. Of course they are. Hillary Clinton is giving evidence to Congress about the crimes of a man she never met. On the other hand, the Justice Department is \"looking into\" whether it improperly held back evidence from the Epstein files which directly accuse Trump of wrongdoing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMeanwhile in Trumpworld\n\nTommy Robinson has entered the chat\n\nJD Vance \"turns the screws\" and halts healthcare funding\n\nTrump spent less than 3 minutes talking about the cost of living at the State of the Union\n\nHere's everything you need to know\n\n‌\n\n\n\n1. Hillary Clinton to testify on Epstein\n\nHillary Clinton is, as we speak, gearing up to testify to the House of Representatives' probe into Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nUnfortunately, the questioning will happen behind closed doors in Chappaqua, New York - despite Hillary and Bill Clinton's bid to have the depositions held in public.\n\nBill will give evidence tomorrow, the first time a former President has been forced to testify before Congress.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nVideo of both depositions are expected to be released \"at a later date'. It's unclear when, or indeed, why. It's also not entirely clear why Hillary is being interviewed at all, given she never, to her recollection, met Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nMore to follow.\n\n2. Justice department 'looking into' whether it withheld Epstein files on Trump accusations\n\nThe Justice Department says it is looking into whether it had improperly withheld documents from the Jeffrey Epstein files after several news organisations reported that some records involving uncorroborated accusations made by a woman against President Donald Trump were not among those released to the public.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe announcement followed news reports saying that a massive tranche of records released by the Justice Department did not include several summaries of interviews that the FBI conducted with an unidentified woman who came forward after Epstein’s 2019 arrest and claimed to have been sexually assaulted by both Trump and Epstein when she was a minor in the 1980s.\n\n“Several individuals and news outlets have recently flagged files related to documents produced to Ghislaine Maxwell in discovery of her criminal case that they claim appear to be missing,” the Justice Department said in a post on X.\n\nIt said that if any document is found to have been improperly withheld and is responsive to the federally enacted law mandating the files’ release, “the Department will of course publish it, consistent with the law.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\n3. Trump Administration welcomes Tommy Robinson\n\nThe US State Department welcomed a British guest to their Washington DC HQ yesterday - but it wasn't new Ambassador, Christian Turner. Nope, it was that other great ambassador of the United Kingdom, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as far-right grifter and provocateur Tommy Robinson.\n\nThough we in the UK may be relieved to see the back of this son of Luton, his having an indirect line to the Leader of the Free World is something of a cause for concern. So why has Tommy entered the chat?\n\nWell, he was a guest of Joe Rittenhouse, a State Department aide, who posted a picture of them together on Twitter yesterday, and wrote: \"Honored to have free speech warrior @TRobinsonNewEra at Department of State today. The World and the West is a better place when we fight for freedom of speech and no one has been on the front lines more than Tommy.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOn his own Twitter, Robinson confirmed the visit, saying he was in the US \"making alliances and friends.\" A state department spokesperson said: \"Tommy Robinson visited the state department in an unofficial capacity on a tour today.\"\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nRobinson also interviewed Florida Republican member of Congress Randy Fine for whatever online streaming website still lets him post his grot these days, and said he was meeting with MAGA figure Jack Posobiec.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe weirdest bit is that he was allowed into the United States at all. He was denied a visa to visit in 2018, and was jailed in the UK for ten months in 2013 for trying to enter the US using a friend's passport.\n\nRobinson is understood to be based in sunny Miami, Florida during his stateside jaunt. It's unclear who is paying for him to be there, but his son posted an Instagram video of his accommodation and it looks pretty swish - a huge house with a swimming pool and a Lambo in the garage. Incidentally, other current residents of Miami who have had legal trouble in the UK, and who appeal to sad boys on the internet include Andrew and Tristan Tate.\n\n4. JD Vance 'pauses' funding for medical system used by millions of low income families\n\nWhile Trump rested up, Vice President JD Vance gave a speech from the White House, announcing a \"temporary halt\" in funding for Medicaid - the medical insurance system used by millions of low income families - in Minnesota.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe was acting in his new, Trump bestowed role in charge of cracking down on fraud in government welfare programmes. He is, it seems, displeased with the way Minnesota has been handling distribution of government funds, and the months-long operation by law enforcement and officials underway in the state to crack down on fraud.\n\nSo he's announced he wants to \"turn the screws on them a little bit so they take this fraud seriously.\"\n\nGenuinely, he said those words about defunding a programme that provides healthcare to children.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I guarantee there are going to be voices in the media and the state of Minnesota who say 'this is hurting children,' he said, correctly, as TV physician-turned for some reason high level government health official Dr Oz hovered over his shoulder.\n\n\"No. It's hurting fraudsters. The way to protect kids is to go after those fraudsters, which is what we're doing.\"\n\nSo how can Minnesota Governor Tim Walz convince Vance and Oz* to loosen the screws a little bit? Well, they just need to audit every healthcare provider who gets Medicaid funds in Minnesota.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThing is, just like they did a month or so ago when the Trump administration demanded Minnesota (and no other state) audit all childcare providers because some YouTuber turned up at nurseries with cameras and demanded to see the children, the state says they're already cracking down on Medicaid fraud.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a statement that his team has secured over 300 Medicaid fraud convictions since he took office in 2019. And he noted that he called on the Legislature earlier Wednesday to give him more staff and new legal tools to combat Medicaid fraud.\n\n\"Courts have repeatedly found that their pattern of cutting first and asking questions later is illegal, and if the federal government is unlawfully withholding money meant for the 1.2 million low-income Minnesotans on Medicaid, we will see them in court,” Ellison said.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n*...which makes them sounds so much like a vaudeville double act you half expect them to launch into a version of Who's On First?\n\n5. State of the Union by the numbers\n\nAhead of Tuesday's State of the Union, we were all told his focus would be on convincing voters his was the right approach for the US economy - and on easing the cost of living for struggling families.\n\nWhat happened in reality was Trump spent most of the speech lecturing the public on how great everything was with him in charge, and telling them that if they thought times were a bit rough for everyday Americans just trying to get by, they were wrong.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nOf course, the Democrats have run the numbers, and it turns out Trump spent less than three of the 108 minutes in his speech talking about affordability."

In the UK, up to 75% of women experience thinning or loss, meaning it's a real concern for most of us. And while getting to the bottom of why hair is shedding is never easy, there are some products that aim to slow general hair shedding.\n\nTake Pantene's Grow Abundant Anti-Hair Loss Scalp Serum. Though inexpensive at £10 (currently on sale from £20), it's receiving glowing reviews from buyers who say it makes their hair look thicker after a couple of weeks of use. Of course, results will vary depending on what the cause of your shedding is (i.e age, diet, genetics or lifestyle), but nearly 150 people seem to think it's worth adding to your hair regime.\n\nThe Anti-Hair Loss Scalp Serum is designed to focus on the root of your shedding problem- quite literally. Powered by a pro-vitamin complex and niacinamide, the lightweight treatment delivers nourishing micro-nutrients directly to the scalp to help strengthen hair at the root and improve how well each strand is retained.\n\nWith regular use, it’s clinically shown to support denser-looking hair over time, with studies suggesting visible improvements in thickness and density after eight weeks, and a noticeable reduction in hair loss, making it a targeted option for anyone looking to give fine or fragile hair a fuller, healthier look.\n\n\n\nView 2 Images The hair serum has racked up 150 near-perfect reviews (Image: Pantene)\n\nOne impressed user writes: \"I hàd been finding hair falling out over the last couple of months. I put this down to the medication I was taking. I saw the Pantene Grow Abundant Serum advertised, and as I could get it at the discounted price of £10, I thought no harm in trying. I have been really surprised at how effective it is. No more bundles of hair coming out each morning as I brush it. I have only been using it for a couple of weeks, so I can't feel that my hair is a lot thicker, but it certainly looks fuller!\"\n\nAnother says: \"I have been using this stuff for 3 months and I wouldn't be without it now. I am on my 3rd bottle, but I use it every day, and it's totally worth it. I was losing a large amount of hair due to weight loss medication, and my hair was feeling so thin. I saw a video on TikTok about this product, so I decided to give it a try. My hair stopped falling out after a couple of weeks of use, and now, after 3 months, I have so many new hairs growing that it is unbelievable. It is so easy to apply, just run the dropper along the scalp as you squeeze and massage it in. It doesn't make my hair greasy and dries in pretty quickly.\"\n\n\"I’ve been using this for about 3 weeks now, I can’t speak to any hair growth as of yet. However, my hair feels noticeably thicker, and it doesn’t shed half as much as it used to. Will definitely repurchase,\" adds a third.\n\nHowever, a fourth gave a slightly different opinion, saying: \"It didn't feel like it absorbed well into the scalp and like it was just sitting on my head.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nIf you're shopping around and have a bit more budget to spend, we can also vouch for Rhute's viral Density + Repair scalp serum, £55. It's recently come back into stock after selling out last year when it launched as a new product to the hair market. Developed by dermatologists, it's packed with bio active peptides and stem cell extracts to boost healthy hair growth.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

He explained: \"Based on the severity and depravity of his crimes, Huntley will have lived his prison life largely segregated from the rest of the prison population.\n\n\"He would be classed as a vulnerable prisoner and likely held with other prisoners - ie sex offenders. However, as a child killer he would also be disliked by sex offenders. Even sex offenders have boundaries that would not cross.\"\n\nHuntley was convicted in December 2003 of the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, who had disappeared from the Cambridgeshire village of Soham in August 2002. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 40 years set in 2005 by High Court judge Mr Justice Moses.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Marcus Johnstone specialises in criminal defence for those accused of sexual offences (Image: Marcus Johnstone)\n\nDescribing his time behind bars, Mr Johnstone explained: \"His early years may well have been spent in isolation at HMP Frankland (and other high security prisons), but there is a duty on the prison authority to try to rehabilitate a prisoner, not just punish. Over time, Huntley would have become eligible to attend offending behaviour courses - which may result in him having contact with non-vulnerable prisoners.\n\n\"He may also have medical problems, and as we have seen on other cases, attacks can happen in the medical wing. Movement around the prison, even attending for visits (legal and domestic), can place such a prisoner at an increased risk of attack.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Ian Huntley was reportedly 'ambushed in a prison workshop' (Image: PA)\n\nHMP Frankland, a Category A prison, holds roughly 800 inmates, all males over the age of 21 who have been convicted of serious crimes. Most inmates are serving sentences of four years or longer, with many serving life sentences for violent crimes. Mr Johnstone spoke of his own experiences visiting Frankland as a lawyer.\n\n\"Over the years, I have visited HMP Frankland on several occasions, as well as many other high security prisons across the country. Consistently, almost every sex offender inmate I have met lives in fear for their lives - and a great many violent offenders I have spoken to would jump at the opportunity to attack a man like Huntley. This enhances their 'reputation' in the prison estate.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFollowing the attack on Huntley, a Durham Constabulary spokesperson said: \"Police were alerted to an assault which had taken place within HMP Frankland in Durham this morning. A male prisoner suffered serious injuries during the incident and was transported to hospital. A police investigation is now underway into the circumstances of the incident and detectives are liaising with staff at the prison.\"\n\nA Prison Service spokesperson said: “A prisoner is receiving treatment after an incident at HMP Frankland on Thursday morning.

The 56-year-old businessman - who has not been identified - was pulled over by police traffic cops on the A96 motorway near the city of Lindau. When they questioned him they discovered he had not declared the Aston Martin Vantage V8 at the border.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe told officers he was just transferring the luxury sports car - the brand favoured by James Bond - from Switzerland to the Czech Republic as part of a relocation — bringing it into the European Union.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut the vehicle, valued at £63,000, had not been properly declared for import.

            "content": "Conor Benn is set for a return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after agreeing to share top billing with Tyson Fury and Arslan Makhmudov and fight Regis Prograis in his first outing for new promotion Zuffa Boxing.\n\nThe British fighter announced his split with long-time promoter Eddie Hearn last week after 10 years of working together, with Benn instead joining Hearn's rival Dana White's fledgling company in an eight-figure deal.\n\nHearn revealed that he was 'devastated' by the defection, not least because he stood by the boxing dynasty scion throughout his ordeal over two failed drug tests in 2022.\n\nBenn previously fought in north London when he faced off with Chris Eubank Jr last year, with the fighter gaining his revenge after first being defeated by Eubank Jr in their initial meeting at the stadium.\n\nHis match-up with US light welterweight Prograis is set to take place on Saturday April 11, with their main event coming ahead of Fury's return to the ring after his retirement last year.\n\nThe evening is also set to be Netflix's first-ever live broadcast, following a number of events shown from the United States - including Anthony Joshua's meeting with Jake Paul last December - by the streaming giant.\n\nConor Benn will fight Regis Prograis on April 11 on the same card as the returning Tyson Fury\n\nFormer world champion Prograis last faced off with Jack Catterall on British soil at the Co-op Live in October 2024, with the Louisiana native losing to the Englishman by unanimous decision.\n\nBenn's decision to desert Hearn cast ripples through the boxing world, with Frank Warren sharing his comment in the form of a quote first made by former US President Harry S. Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980.

Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God.

The cameras were forced to cut away before medics attended to the fighter.\n\nReplays show that late in the first round, the two boxers clashed heads, with George coming away dazed and shaken. It appears this was the reason for his sudden fall to the canvas.\n\nThe 36-year-old made it back to his feet following medical attention and was taken to a Detroit hospital to be monitored. Oberlton was then awarded the victory by technical knockout, extending his unbeaten record to 15 wins.\n\nFrightening scenes in Detroit. Light heavyweight Joseph George suffered a head clash in the first round and then collapsed during the break between rounds. 😱\n\n\n\n#ShieldsCrewsDezurn2 pic.twitter.com/qH3AMEoDgw — Permante (@PermantexG) February 23, 2026\n\nJoseph George had to be rushed to hospital after collapsing during his fight with Atif Oberlton\n\nHylon Williams, George's trainer, has since confirmed that the fighter is 'undergoing an MRI' and is 'in stable condition at a Detroit hospital'.\n\nOberlton confirmed that he did get the chance to speak to George as he was escorted out of the ring, but he was 'a bit confused'.\n\n'I'm so glad that he got up on his feet and that he's OK,' said Oberlton. 'I'm a true champion, true warrior. We can do whatever you want to do it, but I'm just happy that he's OK.\n\n'I just wanted to make sure he was safe. At the end of the day, we're warriors, but we want to leave here the same way we come out.'\n\nLater in the night, Shields defended her undisputed heavyweight championship in dominant fashion, dispatching Crews-Dezurn by unanimous decision.\n\nThe 30-year-old American won 100-90 on all three judges' scorecards and remains unbeaten in her professional career, with a record of 18 wins."

            "content": "Tyson Fury's comeback opponent, Arslanbek Makhmudov, has sensationally been filmed wrestling a bear ahead of their April bout.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on April 11.\n\nAnd 36-year-old Makhmudov, who has a 21-2 record and a knockout ratio of over 90 per cent, has been seen going to extreme measures to train himself up ahead of their meeting, including wrestling a 'three-metre tall and 400kg' brown bear.\n\nIn the video, Makhmudov can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm. The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "Chelsea suffer largest ever pre-tax loss of £350MILLION in 2025 - the biggest in English football history - but here's why the Blues are adamant it is not bad news\n\nChelsea recorded the highest pre-tax loss in English football history in the 2024-25 season, according to financial data revealed by UEFA on Thursday.\n\nThe European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report listed the 10 largest losses for 2025, which showed the club owned by Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly booked a €407million (£350m) deficit. That has only ever been beaten by Barcelona’s total of €555m in 2020-21.\n\nIn the 2024-25 campaign, Chelsea were competing in the Conference League, which they won. They also finished fourth in the Premier League to return to the Champions League before going on to win the Club World Cup in the summer.\n\nIt was during that tournament in the United States that Chelsea were hit with a €31m fine for breaching UEFA's financial rules, with that figure potentially rising to a record-breaking €91m should they fail to comply within the next four years as part of a settlement agreement.\n\nHowever, sources within Chelsea say as a result of their accounting clean-up, the club is now profitable on an operating basis and they are aligned with UEFA’s financial framework.\n\nThe source added their squad cost ratio should sit comfortably within UEFA thresholds, which are considered stricter than the Premier League’s, and they expect to meet all the obligations of their existing settlement agreement with European football’s governing body.\n\nDespite winning two trophies - including the Club World Cup - last season, Chelsea are thought to have recorded a staggering record pre-tax loss\n\nEssentially, Chelsea believe further regulatory settlements going forward will not be required, as they are currently compliant with the parameters which were set.\n\nChelsea’s creative financing has helped their position in the Premier League, such as the infamous internal selling of their women’s team to the club’s parent company.\n\nUEFA’s rules are more stringent, and their report, which was sent to the media on Thursday morning, explained how Chelsea’s squad at the end of the club’s 2025 financial year was, again, officially the most expensive ever assembled with a combined transfer cost of €1.746billion.\n\nThat was up €90m on the record they set the previous year. Manchester City’s squad cost €1.584bn by comparison.\n\n\n\nIt is said Chelsea believe the UEFA report is not reflective of their finances moving forward. On the pitch, the club are pushing to stay in the Champions League, with them currently sitting fifth in the Premier League – a position which is set to be enough to qualify for Europe’s elite competition at the end of this season. They face league leaders Arsenal away next."

            "content": "Ian Wright suggested that some of Tottenham's biggest stars are unwilling to give new interim manager Igor Tudor a chance, after Micky Van de Ven appeared to blank him during the north London derby.\n\nAppointed following the overdue sacking of Thomas Frank earlier this month, Tudor arrived with the challenging brief of ensuring that Spurs avoid relegation.\n\nThe Europa League champions currently sit 16th and only four points away from 18th-placed West Ham - and Tudor's arrival in the capital was made no easier by his first match in charge being the north London derby.\n\nAs Spurs fell 4-1 to Arsenal at home, Tudor was spotted apparently giving vocal instructions to Van de Ven from the sidelines, only for the defender to fail to acknowledge him.\n\nFor Wright, the fact that the players were not eager to engage with their new head coach was a troubling sign.\n\n'Against Arsenal I saw Igor Tudor try to speak to Van de Ven, he blanked him, totally blanked him,' Wright said to his co-hosts on The Overlap's Stick To Football podcast.\n\nIgor Tudor appeared to be ignored by Micky Van de Ven just days into his tenure as Tottenham interim head coach\n\n'That says to me they have checked out already.'\n\nGary Neville thought that Wright's verdict was a 'harsh' one, while Roy Keane argued that the players 'did that with' Frank, but the Arsenal legend was in no mood to back down.\n\n'This guy is new, he wants him to come up and Van de Ven just looks at him and stays there,' Wright continued. 'You think to yourself, that doesn't look good. That does not look good.'\n\nFor his part, Tudor denied conflict between himself and Van de Ven on Thursday afternoon, sharing that he had been addressing the whole team.\n\n'If you watch carefully, I don't speak to him (in that moment),' Tudor said in his pre-Premier League weekend press conference. 'Afterwards, I said to him to come closer, and he comes closer.\n\n'We didn't talk about it because nothing happened. He's a fantastic professional and a fantastic guy, he would not do something like (ignoring me).'\n\nBelgium head coach Roberto Martinez stressed that whatever Tudor can do to ensure Spurs do not spend next season in the Championship, his first order of business should be 'accepting where they are' at this stage in the campaign.\n\n'When I was at Wigan you almost prepared for that last third of the season because that is your opportunity,' Martinez said. 'The last third for us was that we are going to get out of trouble.\n\n'The problem is when you are going into the last third hoping you are not going to get dragged down into a relegation battle because your club wasn't ready for that. This is where it becomes very, very dangerous.\n\nThe stop-gap manager has a challenging task attempting to keep Spurs from the drop - and began his reign with a dismal north London derby\n\n'What happens now is that you should forget about these general terms that \"we shouldn't get dragged down\", what does this mean to a player (looking to hear) \"do I need to run more, less\".\n\n'It is basic language (you use to a player) about everything you can control, \"you have to do 12km, six sprints into the box and run to the near post\". Everything has to be so measurable. It is about winning the next game.'\n\nSpurs' torrid winter has been only exacerbated by a number of injuries to key players leaving their squad painfully short.\n\nBut Martinez was keen to warn that Spurs cannot wait for stars to return and simply expect fortunes to change.\n\n'I think Spurs will get one or two players back from injury, you win a game and then you have got too much (of a gap),' he added.\n\n'The problem is there are no easy games in the Premier League. As a player at Spurs you might think there are easy games we can win, no - there are no easy games. It is about reducing that to, it is the next game and you have an opportunity to get points rather than if you don't win and you are out.\n\n'The moment that the club see it as \"wow, if we don't win...\" - the mindset is so negative and it drags you down. We have seen teams that are \"too good to go down\" go down because they weren't prepared for that final third of the season.'\n\nSpurs will stay in London for their next Premier League test, travelling to Craven Cottage to play Fulham on Sunday."

            "content": "Dean Windass fears his children will make the same mistakes he did before his father died - with the Hull City legend revealing he has fallen out with them so badly that he does not even know where son Josh lives.\n\nIn an appearance on Daily Mail Sport podcast Whistleblowers, the ex-footballer - who has been vocal about his previous struggles with substance abuse and suicidal thoughts - detailed the row he had with his father five months before he was killed by a heart attack.\n\nWindass, who suffers from dementia, last month shared a public birthday message to Wrexham star Josh begging him to 'get in touch' and admitted that it was hard not speaking to either of his sons.\n\n'It breaks my heart,' Windass told podcast co-hosts Mark Clattenburg and Gordon Smart. 'I've said that to them, I've texted them. It's just fallen on deaf ears.\n\n'Because I had an argument with my old man, and for five months, I never spoke to him. And for 41 years of my life, he was my best mate. I had a row - don't want to go into it, it was personal - with my kids, and he died in those five months. And it f***ed me up.\n\n'And I blamed myself, and that's when I didn't want to hear from anybody, I didn't want to speak to anybody, I was drinking, trying to commit suicide, all that s***, which is f***ing stupid, looking back now. And yeah, some days, they give you wake-up calls. I went to Sporting Chance (a therapy service for sportspeople) for 26 years, and it was the best 26 years of my life, the rest is history.'\n\nDean Windass has revealed that such is the extent of his estrangement from his sons, he does not even know where Wrexham star Josh lives\n\nAppearing on Whistleblowers, the Premier League cult hero (pictured with Josh) said he is constantly reaching out to both of his sons\n\nHe continued: 'I thought my dad dying was my fault. And it wasn't, he had a heart attack out of the blue, but I'm thinking, \"if I'd have knocked on his door...\" and that's why I don't want my kids to make the same mistake.'\n\nRevealing that he was trying to reach out to Josh and his other son, Jordan, he added: 'I text them every day. And I watched Josh last night, at Wrexham, (he's a) good player, married with a kid - I ain't seen my grandchild for a year.\n\n'It's a tough thing, and people will say, \"why are you mentioning it?\" - but I want to mention it. Because I don't want my kids to make the same mistakes that I made. It's my responsibility as a parent, and I thought it was my dad's responsibility as a parent.\n\n'But when the s*** hit the fan... I was working for Soccer Saturday and this is how stupid it was, I should have done it. I was living in Leeds, and I was driving (to work), I was a little bit early, and I thought, \"f*** it, I'll just pop in at my dad's.\"\n\n'I've not spoken to him for five months. And if I'd have knocked on his door, he'd have f***ing punched me in the face, or whatever, and gone \"come in, give us a kiss\", we'd have had a cry, and it would be all done with. But my attitude was, \"why should I knock on his f***ing door, he's the dad.\"\n\n'And now the roles are reversed with me. I want to knock on Josh's door. I don't even know where he f***ing lives, that's how bad it is, he's in Chester somewhere, or Cheshire, I don't know. And now my youngest son has decided not to speak to me over a family issue. So I don't speak to my two boys.'\n\nSuch is the chasm between father and sons that Josh admitted in 2025 that he did not find out about his father's dementia diagnosis from him directly, but through a friend at a coffee shop.\n\nWindass added: 'The reason why (I speak about this publicly is) if I can get this message over to my children, please don't make the same mistake, because I nearly lost my life for it.'\n\nDespite the distance between them, Windass remains a proud supporter of his sons' achievements, admitting that he was the 'f***ing proudest man in the world' when Josh scored the winning goal at Wembley to send Sheffield Wednesday up to the Championship at the end of the 2022-23 season.\n\nJosh echoed his father's greatest achievement on the pitch, with Windass himself netting the winner in 2008 to see Hull promoted to the Premier League.\n\nJoking that his son's display 'took the heat off' him, he added: 'The kid's a f***ing player, and I'm very proud of it.\n\n'But that's testament to them. Josh is teetotal, Jordan's teetotal, and I'm f***ing proud of that (too).'"

            "content": "Jurgen Klopp 'could QUIT Red Bull role and is eyeing a return to coaching', sensational Austrian report claims, with 'Premier League manager lined up as his replacement' - as RB chief issues feisty response\n\nJurgen Klopp has been sensationally linked with a return to management, with an Austrian report claiming he could quit his role at Red Bull.\n\nKlopp was appointed as Global Head of Football by the Austrian sports drink powerhouse in January 2025 - signing a five-year contract after bidding an emotional farewell to Liverpool.\n\nIn this role, the 58-year-old oversees the fortunes of RB Salzburg (Austria), RB Leipzig (Germany), New York Red Bulls (USA) and Bragantino (Brazil). But reports in Austrian publication Salzburger Nachrichten claim the German is seeking pastures new, with the quartet of clubs having achieved little success since his arrival.\n\nThey add that things are particularly bad at RB Leipzig, with the club currently fifth in the Bundesliga and in a four-team tussle to secure a qualification spot for the Champions League next season.\n\nSalzburger Nachrichten conclude that Red Bull would not stand in Klopp's way should he wish to return to coaching in the summer - with outgoing Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner already lined up as his replacement. Glasner previously worked at RB Salzburg as an assistant manager between 2012-14.\n\nBut when asked about that report on Thursday, Red Bull CEO Oliver Mintzlaff shut it down and branded it as 'complete nonsense'.\n\nJurgen Klopp will not be leaving Red Bull to make a return to management, insists their CEO\n\nRed Bull CEO Oliver Mintzlaff (left) has rubbished an Austrian report that Klopp will leave\n\n'That is complete nonsense and entirely fabricated,' Mintzlaff told Sky Sports Germany.\n\n'On the contrary: we are extremely satisfied with Jurgen Klopp's work. He invests a great deal of effort, is in constant communication with our coaches and sporting directors, and is sustainably developing our Red Bull football philosophy.\n\n'We are convinced that he is the right man for this job. That is where we are placing all of our focus and energy.'\n\nKlopp has not been in a managerial dugout since leaving Liverpool at the end of the 2023-24 season, citing that he needed to take a break. He has since been linked with a number of jobs this coming summer, including Real Madrid.\n\nSpeaking last week, Klopp's agent revealed that he was approached by Manchester United and Chelsea as well as by England the USA to become their manager once he left the Reds.\n\n'Before joining Red Bull, Jurgen could have coached the USA or England,' said Klopp's long-term representative Marc Kosicke in an interview with German website Transfermarkt.\n\n'Probably also Germany, if Julian Nagelsmann hadn't already been there.\n\n'Even Chelsea and Manchester United inquired, although Jurgen had clearly stated that he would not coach any other club in England. These enquiries keep coming.\n\n'He's extremely happy with what he's achieved. And it's still wonderful to go down in history as one of the few coaches who only managed three clubs and were never fired.'\n\n\n\nWhen approached for comment, both Chelsea and Manchester United denied the agent's claims."

            "content": "If you had told a Liverpool fan in the first half of the season that Ibrahima Konate would get to within four months of being able to leave on a free transfer, some might have shrugged.\n\nThe Frenchman had a difficult start to the campaign and Arne Slot said he was ‘too much at the crime scene’ in damning quotes after a 3-3 draw at Leeds United, which ended up being buried when Mohamed Salah dropped his bombshell that the club had thrown him ‘under the bus’ five minutes later.\n\nAs the Reds won just four of 15 games between late September and an early-December win at Inter, Konate was far from his best. Far from the only problem – there were plenty, and nearly every player saw a drastic dip in form – but certainly a big issue.\n\nFast-forward a few months, however, and the defender is now back to a top level. Maybe not his best just yet, but certainly close to it.\n\nYet throughout his up-and-down form, one question hasn't gone away: where will he be playing his football next season? As it stands, he is free to join any club on July 1, with his Liverpool deal set to expire at the end of the campaign.\n\nTo put it simply: forget that dip in form and take Konate’s five years at the club in the round – extending the defender’s contract must be top of Liverpool’s priority list in the next three months.\n\nIbrahima Konate has turned his season around after a disappointing start to the campaign, but where will he be playing his football next year?\n\nKonate can already agree a pre-contract with overseas clubs and will be a free agent on July 1 if Liverpool can't sort out a new deal by then\n\nThis is not to say the above isn't already the case. The club have made several concerted efforts to sort out the 26-year-old’s future.\n\nIf they had their way, Konate would have committed to them long ago, for it was autumn 2024 when they first made contact with his representatives over a new deal. The two parties have thus far been apart in their demands.\n\n‘We are in talks with him so that tells you what we want,’ said Slot a fortnight ago. ‘It’s clear we would like him to stay but negotiations are ongoing so let’s see where that ends. We wouldn’t be in negotiations if we didn’t want him to stay.’\n\nWe don't know exactly where Konate’s head is at in this saga – but it is clear he loves the club and enjoys his life at Liverpool. Real Madrid had posted an interest earlier in the season but that seems to have cooled.\n\nKonate is crucial to Liverpool, though, and with Virgil van Dijk turning 35 in the summer, he could be the bridge between the present and future at the club with young Jeremy Jacquet and Giovanni Leoni, 20 and 19 respectively, both primed as long-term defensive options.\n\nThere was also a heart-warming moment on Sunday at Nottingham Forest where Konate gave a journalist his match-worn shirt as a gesture of gratitude for some dates, a popular snack with Muslims after breaking their Ramadan fasts.\n\nNo concrete updates have been offered in 2026 but he is certainly not as clear-cut a candidate for leaving Liverpool as he may have been. Even Slot openly discussing the club’s desire to keep him was telling – he did not do that with Salah or Van Dijk last year until new deals were close to being signed.\n\nJust like the hierarchy did not panic about Slot’s future based on a few bad months, the club would not have let a tough start to the season cloud their judgment on Konate. They, rightly so, are desperate for him to renew.\n\nVirgil van Dijk turns 35 this summer and his centre-back partner could be a crucial bridge to the new generation of Liverpool defenders\n\nReds are set-piece kings!\n\nMove over Arsenal, Liverpool are better than you at set-pieces. In 2026, that is, anyway.\n\nFrom taking a gulp and hoping for the best before Christmas, the Reds are now packing a punch in the six-yard box.\n\nAt the turn of the year, Slot’s men were rock bottom of the set-piece table, which is all the rage this season especially.\n\nThey had scored a league-low three goals from set-pieces (Arsenal and Manchester United, for comparison, had 13), while conceding a league-high 12.\n\nFast forward three months and Liverpool are TOP of the table (from New Year’s Day to present), with no one scoring more than their six goals from set-pieces in the period.\n\nThey have also conceded just two — which puts them above all but four teams.\n\nAs we know, Aaron Briggs lost his job as set-piece coach just before new year and it started to be a more collaborative effort.\n\nEagle-eyed fans will have spotted analyst Lewis Mahoney on the bench now. The young coach is taking on lots of the set-piece work. Liverpool do not want to put the spotlight on him but let’s give credit where it is due.\n\nMahoney, only 27, has previously been at Southampton, Bristol Rovers and Swansea, having achieved a first-class degree in sports performance analysis at Cardiff University.\n\nLiverpool have rapidly improved their defending of set-pieces in 2026\n\nJaros is back\n\nGoalkeeper Vitezslav Jaros has seen a positive loan spell at Ajax cut short after suffering a serious injury.\n\nThe Czech shot-stopper, 24, suffered a nasty knee injury during training last weekend and was sent to hospital, where it became clear surgery was required.\n\nJaros will not feature again for Ajax, for whom he had made 26 appearances. He follows young midfielder James McConnell in needing surgery after being recalled from Ajax.\n\nThe former Sturm Graz keeper has made two first-team appearances for Liverpool.\n\nVitezslav Jaros has played his last game for Ajax after picking up a nasty knee injury during training last week\n\nNew boys and big dogs\n\nJust after Rio Ngumoha did his first external interview with the media on Sunday, reporters also tried to stop Joe Gomez for a chat – but the response was emphatic.\n\n‘Why do you want to talk to me, wait for one of the big dogs, Virgil or Mo,’ he said, laughing, as we poked back, ‘Come on, Joe, you’re one of the big dogs, you’ve been here the longest of any player!’\n\nNgumoha would have been just six when Gomez signed for Liverpool, which highlights his service to the club. He may be injury-prone but, when he is fit, he is a manager’s dream given his versatility.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the future holds for him this summer. Gomez had inquiries from clubs at home and abroad in the summer but was asked to stay given Liverpool were low on defensive numbers and missed out on Marc Guehi.\n\nIf he were keen to leave this year, though, they surely would not stand in his way.\n\nHow much did Premier League triumph help Reds?\n\nThe full benefit of Liverpool playing Champions League football should be made clear in the coming days with the club poised to release their latest set of financial accounts.\n\nIn the last set of accounts, which covered the financial period up until the end of May 2024, published in late February 2025, the club posted an overall loss of £57million.\n\nMuch of that was thanks to a drop of £38m in media revenue related to Liverpool only playing in the Europa League and not the Champions League in the previous season. That highlights the importance of a top-five finish again this term, which is still far from guaranteed.\n\nLiverpool are one of the best-run clubs in the world and their finances should reflect that. A successful commercial year plus increased matchday revenue – the opening of the new Anfield Road Stand has boosted this – will also be shown in the accounts.\n\nKlopp Kids: Where are they now?\n\nIt is normally a question you would ask 10 years down the line but two years after winning the Carabao Cup at Wembley with a severely weakened team due to injuries, that famous photo of Jurgen Klopp’s kids is interesting to look back on.\n\nTwo years after winning the Carabao Cup at Wembley with a severely weakened team due to injuries, that famous photo of Jurgen Klopp’s kids is interesting to look back on\n\nMaybe it has not worked out as planned for some of the youngsters who failed to kick on at Liverpool – though others certainly have played a big role.\n\nHere is a who’s who of that picture taken two years ago yesterday…"

            "content": "Chelsea are ‘shattered’ with Cole Palmer and his fellow stars suffering from burnout, according to the PFA chief executive Maheta Molango, who wants the footballing calendar eased.\n\nMolango used Palmer as an example of why the game’s biggest names are being overworked, highlighting how he is facing a third successive summer without rest. After representing England at the 2024 Euros, and winning the 2025 Club World Cup with Chelsea, he may now head to the 2026 World Cup if selected by Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel.\n\nPalmer registered 33 Premier League goal involvements in 2023-24, and 23 in 2024-25. This season, he has yet to reach double figures, having struggled with injuries which have seen him appear in only 19 of Chelsea’s 42 games in all competitions.\n\nMolango revealed at the FT Business of Football Summit event in London on Thursday how he had visited Chelsea's training ground after the Club World Cup, and saw first-hand how they were struggling. ‘I was at the training camp of Chelsea when they came back (from the Club World Cup),’ Molango said. ‘They were shattered. This is just the reality.\n\n'You wonder whether this is what we wanted as an industry. I'm not sure. I think sometimes we need to be honest with ourselves and understand that sometimes less is more.’\n\nChelsea were left 'shattered' after the Club World Cup, says PFA chief Maheta Molango\n\nPFA boss Maheta Molanga warned that players can only give 60-70 per cent of themselves\n\nHaving already referenced Palmer’s schedule, Molango continued: ‘People say he is a millionaire. Yeah, he is, but it doesn't give you an extra lung or an extra leg.\n\n‘Come to a stage where, you know, “I want to see Cole Palmer on the pitch because he's the one who makes me dream”. The reality is that the fans pay right now 100 per cent of the ticket and a lot of time they get 70 per cent if they're lucky of the show or 60 because players start regulating themselves.\n\n‘The Premier League is the best product in terms of football. They make north of £4billion for 38 games. Surely there's an element of valuing the scarcity.’\n\nMolango added: ‘When I look at the last international window and I see (Jude) Bellingham out, Lamine Yamal out on the one side, Lucy Bronze out. Is this the football we want to see? Because frankly, people didn't want to spend money just to watch someone like me play.’"

            "content": "A big weekend of Premier League action awaits and several managers are taking their press conferences today to preview the matches. Stay here with Daily Mail Sport for all the latest...\n\nThis job is harder than I thought, admits Tudor\n\nIgor Tudor fears the size of the task Tottenham is bigger and more challenging than he expected.\n\nTudor is less than a fortnight into his salvage operation, and his only game in charge was the 4-1 defeat at home to Arsenal.\n\n'Probably, yes, I agree with you,' replied the interim boss when asked if the job was tougher than he thought it would be. 'Very tough.'\n\nA run of nine Premier League games without a win has plunged Spurs to within four points of the relegation zone.\n\nArsenal thrashed Tottenham 4-1 in Igor Tudor's first match in charge last Sunday\n\nTudor’s appointment until the end of the season after Thomas Frank’s sacking was based upon his reputation for making an instant impact on ailing teams, including at Juventus and Lazio in Italy, but the 47-year-old Croatian agreed the scale of this task seemed greater because of the implications of relegation for a club of Spurs’ illustrious stature.\n\n'Probably, if I see, if I recognise the difficulties there are, probably, yes,' he said. “It’s even a bigger challenge, even a bigger motivation to do this and we do it.'\n\nTudor said style of play and entertainment would have to take second place behind the desperate need for points. 'The style needs to be in the second moment, because now it’s a question of life and death,' he said. 'If I can use that term in a sporting way.'\n\nLike Frank, however, he will not be throwing around the word ‘relegation’.\n\n'No, I never used it,' said Tudor. 'Not because it’s too scary, or a \"danger word\", or because we won’t sleep. It’s because we need to refocus on ourselves. The same way I speak with my players. To be focused on ourselves, on the training.\n\n'That’s the only thing we can change so there is nothing to think about. The future, or the points, even. The points come as a consequence of the training and the game. That’s the main and only focus we need to have.'\n\nTudor did, though, suggest his players may have to adopt the mindset of a 'small team' when asked whether he may have to settle for 'winning ugly' rather than playing good football.\n\n'I think yes. We are working in that direction. In Italy they use the term, you know, have the mentality of a small team. In Italy that is the key, to always have motivation when you play big teams, so that’s the start of course and we work a lot on that. They are aware, of course they are aware.'\n\nPedro Porro and Kevin Danso are back in training and available for the trip to Fulham on Sunday, but Spurs are still without eight injured first teamers and Cristian Romero, who will serve the third of his four-match ban at Craven Cottage.\n\nMicky van de Ven has a toe problem that is not expected to rule him out.\n\nTudor also responded to a video clip which has drawn attention online with Spurs fans claiming Van de Ven had been ignoring touchline instruction from the new boss during the Arsenal game.\n\nTudorsuggested Dejan Kulusevski is not far away from a return after a bad knee injury\n\n'It was not an instruction to Micky,' said Tudor. 'It was an instruction to the team to go up. Micky is a fantastic guy, a very good professional, he would never do these things.'\n\nOther injuries, he said, were being monitored on a ‘weekly basis’, including Dejan Kulusevski, who has not played this season and is still on a long road back from a serious knee injury.\n\n'I know him from Juventus,' said Tudor. 'Fantastic player, fantastic guy. Difficult moment. He’s had really big problems, as you know, here. But he’s positive. Also, the doctors are positive. So we’ll see, next week, how it’s going.'\n\nMatt Barlow\n\nOkafor the only absentee as Farke urges his Leeds underdogs to bite back\n\nDaniel Farke says Leeds are ready to thrive on their 'underdog' status against Manchester City at Elland Road on Saturday.\n\nLeeds have lost only two of their last 14 league games in their fight for survival, while City are chasing a fourth straight win to keep the heat on title rivals Arsenal.\n\nFarke said: 'We're looking forward to this game. We're facing the best and most successful side in the UK and world football over the last decade. They've won everything.\n\n'It's a challenge we're looking forward to. It's always great to play at a packed Elland Road. We are of course the underdog, but we've shown several times that we can deliver convincing performances.\n\n'We've worked so hard to be able to play against the top sides so we value being capable of being competitive with the best teams in the world.'\n\nLeeds, for whom Noah Okafor is the only absentee, will take heart from the reverse fixture at the Etihad Stadium in November when they fought back from 2-0 down to level before losing out to Phil Foden's stoppage-time winner.\n\nFarke added: 'It was definitely a really good away performance and one that gave the players more belief. We were able to give one of the best teams in the world a proper go.'\n\nLe Bris offers support to Mundle after racist abuse\n\nSunderland boss Regis Le Bris has branded racist abuse directed towards Romaine Mundle 'unacceptable'.\n\nThe winger featured from the bench in the Black Cats' 3-1 defeat to Fulham on Sunday on a weekend that saw four separate cases of Premier League players receiving racist abuse and Le Bris reiterated the club's support for Mundle.\n\nRomain Mundle was sent racial abuse on social media after Sunderland's defeat at Fulham\n\n'What happened to Romaine is unacceptable, we stand with him,' said Le Bris. 'There is no room for racism or abuse in football or anywhere else. That's clear for us, we stand for respect, inclusion and diversity, these are the values of football and the values of the club, so it's clear.'\n\nSpeaking about wider racially motivated incidents in football in recent months, he added: 'I don't know really why but I repeat, we don't want to accept that.\n\n'We have to have a clear position and I think it's the case here at Sunderland, we want to defend values and when someone, a group of people, want to threaten those values it's important to react.'\n\nMundle has joined Jocelin Ta Bi, Nordi Mukiele and Brian Brobbey on the sidelines, while Dennis Cirkin and Reinildo Mandava are progressing well after injury but Saturday's game against Bournemouth comes too soon.\n\nLe Bris said: 'About (Mundle's) injury, it might be a difficult injury and he might be sidelined for a few weeks or months. We still have further assessments to make but we'll have a clear picture soon.\n\n'Jocelin might be in the same position as Romaine with a different injury, he might need surgery so a couple of weeks or months, still a bit early as well.\n\n'It will be shorter for Nordi and Brian, between two or four weeks depending on the way they respond to treatments and rehab, so let's wait a bit, but it won't last too long.'\n\nEmery out to win at Wolves...at last\n\nUnai Emery has warned Aston Villa to avoid treating Wolves lightly due to his own poor record against the Premier League’s bottom club.\n\nEmery has never won at Molineux as manager of Arsenal or Villa, losing three of his four games there and drawing the other.\n\n‘We’ve been together three-and-a-half years, and we’ve drawn twice at Molineux and lost once,’ recalled Emery. ‘When I was at Arsenal, we were 3-0 down at half-time (before losing 3-1).\n\nUnai Emery has seen Villa drop off the title pace with just one win in four league games\n\n‘We beat them 1-0 earlier in the season and we didn’t deserve to win. They’ve lost some other games, against Chelsea and Bournemouth, where they haven’t deserved to lose. In their last home game, they drew with Arsenal, the best team in the Premier League and maybe the world.\n\n‘Everything we have analysed makes us feel it is not an easy game, and it’s also a derby. They will want to show what they can do in front of their own fans.’\n\nTom Collomosse\n\nHurzeler's birthday plans: pasta and Forest on TV\n\nBrighton boss Fabian Hurzeler plans to celebrate his 33rd birthday by watching weekend opponents Nottingham Forest over dinner.\n\nRelegation-threatened Forest host Turkish side Fenerbahce on Thursday in the second leg of their Europa League knockout phase play-off before travelling to the Amex Stadium for Sunday's Premier League clash.\n\nHurzeler was presented with a cake ahead of his pre-match press conference and will spend the evening dividing his attention between friends, family, food and Forest.\n\n'I think it will be: here's the iPad with the game and here's my pasta,' he said. 'That's how I expect the evening (to be), and sometimes conversation with others.\n\n'Definitely we will have a look at this game. Of course we already prepared for Nottingham but there are always new things you can see, you adapt.\n\n'It will definitely be a mix of having a good time, good dinner with my friends and family, but also watching a little bit of Nottingham Forest.'\n\nBrighton snapped a six-match winless run in the top flight by beating Brentford 2-0 last weekend to ease growing pressure on Hurzeler.\n\nSeagulls midfielder Yasin Ayari is pushing to feature against Forest following four games out with a dislocated shoulder."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe NFL combine is rolling through Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis this week -- a key event in the lead-up to the 2026 NFL draft. More than 300 prospects will converge on Indy, where they will receive official measurements, undergo medical evaluations, interview with teams and work out in front of NFL scouts, coaches and front office executives.\n\nThe on-field drills begin Thursday, and draft experts Mel Kiper Jr., Matt Miller, Jordan Reid and Field Yates are here to break down what they're looking for out of the best players in the class. Which prospects are going to make an impression? Who has the most to prove or gain? Which quarterbacks could turn heads, and of course, who will run the fastest 40-yard dash? NFL reporter Kalyn Kahler also shared one new tweak to the combine workouts that could matter.\n\nDefensive linemen, linebackers and special teams are up first Thursday at 3 p.m. ET. Defensive backs and tight ends perform their workouts at 3 p.m. ET Friday, followed by the quarterbacks, wide receivers and running backs at 1 p.m. ET Saturday. The offensive linemen finish things with their workouts at 1 p.m. ET Sunday.\n\nHere are some top names to watch and what to expect over the next four days.\n\nJump to:\n\nTop workout watch | Prospects with a lot to prove\n\nTop QBs to watch | Fastest 40-yard dashes\n\nExplosive jumps | Measurements that matter\n\nMedicals to watch | Latest buzz | Bold predictions\n\nWhich prospect is going to dominate his combine workout?\n\nMiller: Kenyon Sadiq, TE, Oregon. The buzz surrounding Sadiq's skills has been growing since the junior tight end first took the field as Terrance Ferguson's backup in 2024. Now, the 6-foot-3 245-pounder has his shot to impress scouts and GMs. Evaluators I've spoken to are predicting Sadiq will leap north of 41 inches in the vertical jump and could run the 40-yard dash in the low 4.5-second range. The top tight end in the class, Sadiq has varying grades from teams, with some placing him in the top 20 while others see him in the back end of Round 1. A big week of testing could push him to the top of that range.\n\nReid: Sonny Styles, LB, Ohio State. At 6-foot-4, 243 pounds, Styles has the potential to be the talk of the combine after his workout. Speaking to scouts, the expectation is for Styles to run in the mid-to-high 4.5 range in the 40-yard dash and exceed 40 inches in the vertical jump. Don't be surprised if he touches 11 feet on the broad jump, too. He is already viewed as a potential top-10 pick, but Styles is likely to put on a show not only during the testing portion but also in on-field drills.\n\nKiper: Kadyn Proctor, OT, Alabama. Man, Jordan took mine. Styles is going to light up the vertical and 40. But I'll go with Proctor, who is extremely explosive for his 6-foot-7, 366-pound size. We saw his athleticism on display during the season, as he took a screen pass 11 yards against Georgia and plowed his way to a first down against Missouri. And he has a ton of raw upper-body strength. I think he could post some really good numbers in the combine testing and help make the case that he should stay at left tackle in the NFL -- and go in Round 1.\n\nYates: Monroe Freeling, OT, Georgia. Fans of the \"First Draft\" podcast are familiar with my feelings about Freeling, who is among my top 15 prospects in the entire class. The 6-foot-7, 315-pound tackle is one the best O-line athletes expected to work out in Indianapolis, and he'll have a chance to showcase the smooth movements, transitions and footwork that helped him become a standout pass protector. My sentiment is that Freeling will keep on climbing draft boards, and I wouldn't be stunned if he works his way into the top 10.\n\nWhich prospect has the most riding on his workout?\n\nKiper: Rueben Bain Jr., Edge, Miami. There is no arguing Bain's production (including 9.5 sacks and 71 pressures last season), technique and overall upside. His game is built on sheer power, nonstop hustle and a deep arsenal of pass-rush moves to beat offensive tackles. But his arm length at 6-foot-3, 275 pounds is a question for scouts, and his 40-yard dash time will be key in seeing his true speed. Bain needs a good workout and some solid testing numbers to prove he can be just as dominant in the NFL as he was in college. I have him ranked ninth overall right now, but he could end up going top-five if he puts a stamp on his evaluation in Indianapolis.\n\nYates: Kadyn Proctor, OT, Alabama. Few players have generated as strong of opinions from scouts as Proctor, who at his best is a hulking, powerful, overwhelming tackle with flashes of proactive athleticism that wow you. But he endured difficult stretches throughout his Alabama career, leaving some scouts skeptical that he has the foot quickness to hold up against top NFL pass rushers. As Mel said above, Proctor's workout will be essential in stating the case that he has the goods to hold up in pass protection and secure his spot as a potential top-25 selection.\n\nMiller: Ty Simpson, QB, Alabama. Simpson (QB2 in my rankings) made the right move by deciding to throw at the combine, but a lot is now riding on how he performs there. The junior started only 15 games in college (all last season) and looked noticeably different over the second half of 2025. I want to see what Simpson's arm looks like in person and what type of velocity and drive power he can generate. Listed at 6-foot-2 and 208 pounds, Simpson's measurements will also be scrutinized as scouts home in on his hand size and height.\n\nplay 0:53 Mel Kiper Jr. makes case for Steelers drafting Ty Simpson Mel Kiper Jr. joins \"Get Up\" and breaks down why Ty Simpson would be a good option for the Steelers in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nReid: Caleb Banks, DT, Florida. He came into the 2025 season as a potential top-20 pick, but Banks played only three games due to a foot injury. With plenty of question marks entering the predraft process, Banks revived his draft stock a bit during a strong week of practices at the Senior Bowl. But now scouts will want to see him put it all together at the combine; a strong showing in testing and on-field drills could help him resurface as a mid-to-late first-round pick. He's my No. 29 overall prospect.\n\nWhat do scouts want to see from this quarterback group?\n\nReid: The QB class is wide open after Indiana's Fernando Mendoza. And with Mendoza opting to wait until his pro day on April 1 to throw, there's a prime opportunity for another quarterback to claim the spotlight Saturday. Who will make a statement?\n\nSimpson (Alabama) and Garrett Nussmeier (LSU) are viewed as the potential QB2 and QB3 of this class. After their highly inconsistent seasons, scouts are interested to see how both throw the ball during the throwing session. Simpson is still receiving a mixture of late Round 1 and early Day 2 grades, while Nussmeier's grades are sporadic. Some scouts see him as a Round 3 prospect, while others feel he's a Day 3 dart throw.\n\nCole Payton (North Dakota State) is also gaining steam, and his development is well ahead of the curve despite being a one-year starter. Early Day 3 is still seen as Payton's target area, but Round 3 isn't out of the question if he performs well during the predraft process. Saturday will be key.\n\nWhich quarterback has the chance to rise the most Saturday?\n\nKiper: Taylen Green, Arkansas. The eighth QB on my board has a legitimate chance to toss his name in the wide open QB3 ring with a good performance this week, though that admittedly speaks more to the uncertainty of the quarterback class beyond Mendoza and Simpson. He looks the part at 6-foot-6 and 224 pounds, he has a big arm to push the ball downfield, and he is a terrific runner with 35 career scores on the ground. But Green's accuracy has been very inconsistent. Consider that his completion rate was below 60% in half of his games last season, and his 11 interceptions tied for 14th in the nation.\n\nGreen needs to run as well as expected and throw with precision Saturday. He can't be missing high and low on passes during the workout, especially with no defenders in coverage. I want to see a jump in his ball location. A good workout could have teams buzzing about a guy with a lot of coveted physical traits.\n\nPick a four-man relay team of prospects who will light up the 40-yard dash\n\nMiller: This was an easy year to pick a 4x40 team. Let's start off with Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love. The 6-foot, 214-pound first-rounder has the runaway speed, as shown by his two 90-plus-yard touchdown runs last season. He will cook in the low 4.4s. We also have to get Mississippi State receiver Brenen Thompson on the team, as he's my pick to run the fastest 40 in Indy. Watch for him to run in the mid-4.2-second range, though I don't think he's catching Chiefs receiver Xavier Worthy (record 4.21 in 2024).\n\nFor the last two, I polled scouts and heard that Iowa wideout Kaden Wetjen (high 4.3s) and Wake Forest running back Demond Claiborne (low 4.4s) are two must-sees when it comes to the best 40 times in this class. If I had to call out a player on defense, I'd keep an eye on Clemson cornerback Avieon Terrell. He can fly.\n\nplay 1:36 Why Louis Riddick considers Jeremiyah Love a massive difference-maker Louis Riddick breaks down why Jeremiyah Love is the biggest offensive difference-maker in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nWhich prospect is going to turn heads with his broad/vertical jumps?\n\nYates: Brandon Cisse, CB, South Carolina. He is one of the most explosive players in the draft, which is apparent when watching his tape. A vertical jump north of 40 inches would come as no surprise (expect an impressive broad jump, too), and he'll blaze the 40 as well. Cisse was a movable chess piece during his college career. A strong week in Indy will strengthen his case to be a first-round selection.\n\nWhich prospects' measurements will scouts really be focused on?\n\nMiller: Rueben Bain Jr., Edge, Miami. The arm length concerns have been loudly rumored when discussing Bain, and we'll get a firm number on just how long his arms are this week. Does it matter? Some teams will knock a player with sub-32-inch arms along the defensive line -- even if that player had 71 pressures and 9.5 sacks like Bain did last season. His weight will also be of interest.\n\nWill he come in at his listed weight of 275 pounds, or will he look to cut or bulk up to force teams into viewing him as either an outside or inside D-lineman? If Bain weighs in at 285 or more, we can assume teams will talk about kicking him inside to tackle. But he could also cut weight to fit more as an edge rusher in the NFL.\n\nWhose medical reports will teams be paying close attention to this week?\n\nReid: If we're strictly ranking this class of receivers by talent, a strong argument could be made that Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson is the best of the bunch. But he has struggled to stay healthy. He never completed a full college season, missing three games in 2025. He's always battling nagging injuries, so there will be teams hesitant in taking Tyson in Round 1.\n\nTennessee cornerback Jermod McCoy sat out last season after tearing his ACL, so teams will want to know more about his recovery. Talent-wise, there's no doubting McCoy is one of the 10 best prospects in this class. He has squeaky-clean technique, as he can turn and run with any receiver while also having the hip mobility to break at any point. And at 6-foot, 193 pounds, he also has great size for a versatile corner. But where is he at in his rehab and timeline to return?\n\nFinally, Penn State quarterback Drew Allar, who broke his left ankle in an October loss to Northwestern, will be one to watch. He's my QB5 right now.\n\nWhat's the best piece of buzz you've heard heading into the combine workouts?\n\nKiper: Missouri's Zion Young could be the first defensive end off the board -- ahead of Bain, Akheem Mesidor, etc. (but not quite in the same class as top outside linebackers Arvell Reese and David Bailey). The 6-foot-5, 262-pound edge rusher plays with strong hands, plenty of quickness and the ability to seal off the run. He's No. 22 on my board, but he has a lot of fans around the league and could push higher -- especially if he has a good week at the combine.\n\nMiller: Penn State guard Olaivavega Ioane could be a top-15 pick and a future All-Pro. The 6-foot-4 330-pounder is a favorite of many evaluators I've talked to since the Senior Bowl. \"He's a mauler with ballerina feet,\" one NFC South area scout said. Guards aren't usually seen as smart investments in Round 1 due to positional value, and the rookie wage scale dictating a high salary for first-rounders, but Ioane is seen as one of the safest picks in this class.\n\nReid: If you're looking for two names that scouts are high on despite not getting much Round 1 buzz, consider Illinois edge rusher Gabe Jacas and San Diego State cornerback Chris Johnson. Jacas (6-foot-3, 275 pounds) has created plenty of momentum after recording 11 sacks last season and followed that up with a strong performance at the Senior Bowl. Don't be surprised if Jacas, my No. 46 overall player, sneaks into the back end of the first round.\n\nJohnson (6-foot, 185 pounds) has been repeatedly brought up by scouts in this deep cornerback class. After a dominant 2025 season that resulted in him earning Mountain West Co-Defensive Player of the Year, the big question mark that scouts want answered is Johnson's straight-line speed. His 40-yard dash time is one to watch very closely. I have him in Round 2 at the moment.\n\nYates: Michigan edge rusher Jaishawn Barham is picking up steam in the scouting community, which I don't expect to slow down anytime soon. He began his college career at Maryland and was a stand-up linebacker for much of his college career, but at 6-foot-3 and 243 pounds, he played a hefty dose of edge snaps in 2025 and showed unique explosiveness. He's a Day 2 prospect now who will only create further intrigue with a big week.\n\nWhat is one way the combine workouts have changed this year?\n\nKahler: The combine has added a new bench press drill -- an isometric hold to measure a prospect's force -- multiple club sources at the combine told ESPN. Prospects will start with elbows bent at 90 degrees and push the barbell as hard as possible for 3-5 seconds. Prospects will do at least two reps, with 60 seconds of rest.\n\nLast year, only 25% of prospects participated in the bench press, where prospects max out reps at 225 pounds. And over the past four years, only 30% of prospects participated in the bench press. The session has been part of the combine since 1985, but it hasn't been popular among prospects or NFL clubs in recent years because it's not viewed as an actual indicator of football strength. The introduction of the isometric hold this year looks to be a move to measure functional strength, instead of the endurance strength of the bench press. And because it is less physically taxing, prospects might be more likely to participate in it. Prospects will still have the opportunity to complete the traditional bench press, as well.\n\nIn 2020, president of National Football Scouting Inc. Jeff Foster told Sports Illustrated that he had discussed options to replace the bench press that year with a committee of five general managers.\n\nGive us your best prediction for combine week.\n\nReid: The buzz coming out of the combine will surround the depth atop the offensive tackle class. I currently have seven players with top-50 grades. Freeling (Georgia), Max Iheanachor (Arizona State) and Blake Miller (Clemson) currently have second-round grades, but I believe all three will firmly be in the Round 1 picture after this weekend. In speaking with multiple scouts and evaluators over the past month, there's no set order on when they're expected to come off the board, but tackles will be selected frequently -- and early.\n\nYates: We're going to come out of this week with a lot of questions on the top players. In recent years, top prospects have bypassed even some of the fundamental tasks of the week (i.e., no drills, no weigh-ins, etc.), and I'm not here to blame them or question them. But in a class with fewer blue-chip prospects than usual, there are players projected to go early who have questions about their size, health, athletic profile or otherwise. Many of those questions will not be answered in Indy.\n\nKiper: Tennessee wide receiver Chris Brazzell II will run something in the ballpark of 4.47 in the 40-yard dash and push himself into the first-round conversation. I love his 6-foot-5 size, sure hands, overall toughness and strength at the catch point. But NFL front offices will be paying close attention to his timed speed. He's quicker than you'd expect out of his breaks at that size, but showing good straight-line speed will round out his scouting report. He's the type of player who might rise over the next few weeks as teams get a closer look at his tape. He's WR6 on my board.\n\nMiller: Ohio State will dominate the combine -- and the draft. We've already seen linebacker Sonny Styles, safety Caleb Downs, edge rusher Arvell Reese, defensive tackle Kayden McDonald and wide receiver Carnell Tate taking top spots at their respective positions in multiple rankings. We should see them all do very well in testing this week, too. Like Jordan mentioned earlier, Styles is a name that pops up frequently with scouts and coaches when talking about potential workout stars. Those five players listed are seen as first-round talents, which is why Round 1 could have a scarlet-and-gray feel to it."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nMore than 300 prospects will be in Indianapolis this week for the combine, but only 32 of them will ultimately go in Round 1 of the 2026 NFL draft on April 23. Let's project those picks with my second mock draft for this cycle.\n\nYou'll notice some similarities to my January predictions; there hasn't been a ton of movement on the board quite yet. But I suspect we will have some big risers during combine workouts, and remember that NFL team needs will change quickly during free agency in March, shaking up the first round. I'm not projecting any trades in this mock draft, but four selections have already changed hands: The Rams have the Falcons' selection, the Jets have the Colts' selection, the Cowboys have the Packers' selection and the Browns have the Jaguars' selection.\n\nHere's my current thinking on how Round 1 could look based on what I'm hearing from execs, scouts and coaches in the league. And for more, check out \"NFL Draft Daily\" at 3 p.m. ET on ESPN2 all week long.\n\nMore on the 2026 NFL draft:\n\nKiper's Big Board | Latest mock drafts\n\nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana\n\nI won't waste a lot of time here: Mendoza to the Raiders seems pretty obvious at this point. The Geno Smith trade didn't solve the post-Derek Carr quarterback problem in Las Vegas, and new coach Klint Kubiak will want a signal-caller to build his offense around. Mendoza is the No. 1 prospect on my board and far and away the best QB in the class. He is competitive and precise with his ball location.\n\nIf the Raiders bring in a receiver or two during free agency and maybe shore up the O-line a bit, this offense could take a step forward with Mendoza, Kubiak, running back Ashton Jeanty and tight end Brock Bowers.\n\nCaleb Downs, S, Ohio State\n\nThis would be the highest draft slot for a safety since Eric Turner went No. 2 in 1991. Downs is worthy, though. He reads the offense so well, and then he has quickness, physicality and ball skills to make plays against both the run and the pass. He can truly impact a defense's ceiling from the back end, with six interceptions, 18 tackles for loss and 22 run stops over his three college seasons. The Jets' defense didn't have a single INT in 2025 -- yes, you read that right -- and only the Cowboys gave up more points (29.6 per game). Plus, Andre Cisco is hitting free agency.\n\nDavid Bailey, OLB, Texas Tech\n\nTough call here between Bailey and Ohio State's Arvell Reese. I have Reese one spot higher on my board, but the Cardinals might opt for the more proven production. Bailey had 14.5 sacks, 23 tackles for loss, 71 pressures and three forced fumbles last season. Simply put, he gets after the QB. That's what the Cardinals need after managing just 30 sacks last season, tied for the third fewest in the NFL.\n\nAnd yes, the team might need a quarterback this offseason if it moves on from Kyler Murray. But it's also too early to reach for the draft class's QB2 when Arizona has other big holes in the roster. I would expect the Cardinals to address their quarterback situation in free agency and turn their attention to defense in Round 1 -- despite new coach Mike LaFleur's offensive background.\n\nArvell Reese, LB, Ohio State\n\nReese's instincts and burst are all over the tape. I'm still ranking him as a linebacker at the moment, and he could help Tennessee there. But new coach Robert Saleh might very well move him to the edge, where he played the majority of the time in 2025. Although the Titans' 42 sacks tied for 12th most last season, 11 of them came from defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons on the interior. The edge is a weakness. Reese could be a high-impact player in this unit no matter where he lines up.\n\nSpencer Fano, OT, Utah\n\nIn January, I had Ohio State receiver Carnell Tate here. I think that's still very possible, as New York needs a WR2 opposite Malik Nabers. But it doesn't matter who Jaxson Dart is throwing to if he doesn't have enough time to get the ball out. Fano started 36 games over three seasons, and he allowed just four sacks (and only one over the past two years once flipping from left tackle to right tackle). His technique and power are outstanding. If free agent Jermaine Eluemunor doesn't return, I like Fano sliding into the RT spot in the lineup, helping keep Dart clean and driving defenders out of the way for running back Cam Skattebo.\n\nCarnell Tate, WR, Ohio State\n\nLike the Giants, the Browns need offensive line and receiver reinforcements. Unlike the Giants, the Browns have two first-round picks. So, although Miami lineman Francis Mauigoa is tempting here, Cleveland would likely take its pick of the entire WR class and kick the can down the order on the OL. Tate is at the top of the receiver list right now, with great hands and savvy route running. Cleveland wideouts combined for just four touchdowns last season, so after an 875-yard, nine-TD season, Tate could step in as the top option for the Browns.\n\nSonny Styles, LB, Ohio State\n\nThis would be the fourth Ohio State player off the board -- the most ever in the first seven picks for one school, per ESPN Research. Styles is getting a lot of love around the league right now, and he's going to be fun to watch at the combine if he works out. The former safety has real speed on a 6-foot-4, 243-pound frame.\n\nWith the Commanders' defense getting crushed for 6.0 yards per play last season (tied for third worst) and potentially losing 35-year-old free agent Bobby Wagner up the middle, this fit makes sense. But also keep an eye on Miami edge rusher Rueben Bain Jr. and the receiver class as a whole if the board falls this way.\n\nMakai Lemon, WR, USC\n\nQuarterback Tyler Shough flashed down the stretch of his rookie season, but now the Saints must help him take the next step in Year 2. I had Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson to New Orleans in my first mock draft, and though I'm sticking with the same position, I'm going with Lemon this time around. He attacks the ball in the air and would be a productive player for Shough after amassing 1,156 yards in 2025. Regardless of whether Chris Olave is in the team's long-term plans, New Orleans could improve the offense with someone like Lemon running routes out of the slot.\n\nWhich teams could draft Jeremiyah Love, Carnell Tate, Jordyn Tyson and Makai Lemon? ESPN\n\nJeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame\n\nLove is No. 2 on my Big Board, showcasing elite-level vision and burst. He can make a house call any time he touches the ball, and with his hands out of the backfield, he can stick on the field on third down. Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt are free agents, and they weren't exactly lighting up the ground game last season anyway. Love -- who had 1,372 rushing yards and 18 rushing TDs in 2025 -- could bring a whole new element to the Kansas City offense.\n\nRueben Bain Jr., DE, Miami\n\nIf Bain is still on the board at No. 10, the Bengals should sprint the card in with his name on it. This has been a very rough defense for a few years now, and things could look a lot worse if Trey Hendrickson leaves in free agency. Last year's Shemar Stewart pick hasn't yielded immediate returns, either. But Bain has the ability to wreck opponent game plans. He brings power, speed and bend, and he had 9.5 sacks in 2025. Defensive coordinator Al Golden could move him around on the D-line to find matchup advantages and turn him loose in the pass rush.\n\nFrancis Mauigoa, OT/G, Miami\n\nThe Dolphins' quarterback situation is unsettled, as they explore trade options for Tua Tagovailoa. But Alabama's Ty Simpson is still a reach here. So, let's instead look at the offensive line. Right tackle Austin Jackson -- the team's last first-round pick on the offensive line back in 2020 -- has struggled to stay on the field, and fill-in Larry Borom is a free agent. Mauigoa comes with 42 starts of experience and a mauling attitude. Plus, he'd be able to keep his parking pass at Hard Rock Stadium as he comes over from the Hurricanes.\n\nIf Jackson stays healthy and takes ownership of the RT spot, Mauigoa could easily kick inside to guard. Some scouts think he's a better fit there, and plenty of attention will be paid to his arm length measurements this week at the combine.\n\nMansoor Delane, CB, LSU\n\nNo team gave up more passing plays of 25 or more yards last season than the Cowboys (46). Trevon Diggs was cut at the end of the season, and DaRon Bland is coming off his second surgery on his left foot in two years. If there weren't already enough signs for Dallas, the entire cornerback class is still available at No. 12 here. Delane can shut down opposing receivers while also making a bunch of plays on the ball. He broke up 11 passes and pulled down two interceptions last season.\n\nJermod McCoy, CB, Tennessee\n\nNo change for the Rams' first pick from my last mock draft. McCoy didn't play at all in 2025 after tearing an ACL last January, and the medical checks this week in Indianapolis will be key for him. But there's no arguing his on-the-ball production. He had four picks and nine pass breakups in 2024.\n\nThe Rams have the sort of roster that can go to the Super Bowl, and quarterback Matthew Stafford is set to return for another season. But cornerback is a definite weak spot; GM Les Snead has to make that position a priority this offseason.\n\nJordyn Tyson, WR, Arizona State\n\nThe Ravens should bounce back in 2026, but they will be looking for a true outside receiver with the hands to soak in a bunch of Lamar Jackson targets. Going with Tyson here would allow Zay Flowers to live in the slot -- where he is at his best -- and lift the whole offense. Tyson caught eight TD passes in 2025, and he excels on contested catches thanks to his 6-foot-2 frame and overall strength.\n\nIt would be the sixth time that Baltimore took a pass catcher in the first round since 2015, but the team clearly needs more options in the pass game. Rashod Bateman has been inconsistent, and DeAndre Hopkins, Isaiah Likely and Tylan Wallace are all free agents.\n\nCJ Allen, LB, Georgia\n\nLavonte David had 114 tackles last season, but he can't play forever. He's 36 years old and joins fellow linebacker Anthony Walker Jr. in free agency this offseason. Allen is a three-down linebacker who mixes speed with power to make plays in coverage, against the run and as a blitzer. He might be LB3 in the class, but he's a top-25 prospect overall. He'd be a good fit under coach Todd Bowles as the Bucs try to retool a bit to reclaim the NFC South.\n\nPeter Woods, DT, Clemson\n\nThe Jets are back on the clock, and after I handed them a difference-making safety in Caleb Downs earlier, I'll go with a Quinnen Williams replacement this time around. Three Jets defensive tackles are hitting free agency, and they've lacked a real impact player in the middle of the D-line since trading Williams at the deadline. Woods didn't have elite production in 2025, but the tape was still really good. He has the power to be a force at 3-technique for New York.\n\nI had the Jets taking Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson here in January. I could still see it. But the Jets have three first-round picks in 2027, when the QB class should be much better. It makes more sense to find a bridge in 2026 and focus on rebuilding the defense before going with someone like Arch Manning or Dante Moore next spring.\n\nZion Young, DE, Missouri\n\nWe've been begging the Lions to add a long-term threat off the edge opposite Aidan Hutchinson for a while now. Al-Quadin Muhammad had a surprise breakout last season with 11 sacks, but he's a free agent. Tyrus Wheat was next best in sacks among pure edge rushers ... with 1.5. So, although the interior offensive line might warrant a look (Penn State's Olaivavega Ioane?), Detroit has to address the lack of depth on the edge. Young has strong hands and good quickness, and he had 6.5 sacks and 46 pressures last season.\n\nDillon Thieneman, S, Oregon\n\nHarrison Smith is 37 years old; he might retire this offseason, and even if he returns, the safety room in Minnesota still has to be replenished. How about a Smith clone? Thieneman might not have Smith's 6-foot-2 size (he's 6-foot), but he reads the QB well and is savvy. That matters a lot in defensive coordinator Brian Flores' defense, which asks a lot of rookies. Plus, Thieneman has versatility to move around the alignment, is a force against the run and had a six-INT season at Purdue back in 2023 before transferring to Oregon. He'd be a seamless fit in the Vikings' defense.\n\nKeldric Faulk, DE, Auburn\n\nThe Panthers took a leap forward last season, but the pass rush is still lagging behind. Their 30 sacks tied for the third fewest in the NFL, and their 26.6% pressure rate was second lowest. I liked what I saw out of second-round rookie Nic Scourton (five sacks), but Carolina needs more. Faulk is a people mover, and although he managed only two sacks last season, he had seven in 2024. If defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero can unlock Faulk's potential, this pick could look like a steal in a few years.\n\nAkheem Mesidor, DE, Miami\n\nIt's an all-defense first round for Dallas -- first cornerback (Mansoor Delane at No. 12), now edge rusher. Of course, Mesidor wouldn't be a one-for-one replacement for Micah Parsons, who was sorely missed in Dallas last season. But with 12.5 sacks in the final season of a six-year college career, Mesidor would at least jump-start the pass rush and start to build that unit back up. Jadeveon Clowney was the lone Cowboys player to crack six sacks in 2025 (8.5), and he's a free agent. Jerry Jones has to commit to using premium picks on the edge, especially with one of the league's tighter cap situations.\n\nTy Simpson, QB, Alabama\n\nThe Steelers have to think about the QB position with a longer-view lens. They could bring back Aaron Rodgers or opt for another veteran stopgap to keep them in contention next season, but even if they go that route, they should still address their future at the position. Simpson has just 15 starts to his name, and his 2025 season was uneven, but his game has a lot of promise. He navigates the pocket well and threw 28 touchdown passes to just five interceptions last season. Pittsburgh could let him learn behind a veteran for a little while before turning the offense over to him.\n\nOlaivavega Ioane, G, Penn State\n\nA lot of the Chargers' offensive line woes can be traced back to injuries to tackles Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater. But the interior had its own problems. Zion Johnson (now a free agent) and Mekhi Becton both struggled at guard. GM Joe Hortiz has to do something to prevent all these hits quarterback Justin Herbert is taking every Sunday, and Ioane has a great combination of sheer power and agility. He hasn't given up a sack since 2023. Plus, Ioane could help open some rushing lanes for Omarion Hampton in the back's second year.\n\nKenyon Sadiq, TE, Oregon\n\nIf Philadelphia doesn't bring back free agent Dallas Goedert, it would be smart to draft a top-end replacement. Quarterback Jalen Hurts found Goedert for a team-high 11 receiving touchdowns last season, and he was the third-most-targeted pass catcher on the roster. In other words, Hurts likes throwing to his TE1. Sadiq had eight touchdown receptions last season, and he's explosive and does a lot of damage after the catch. NFC defenses would have a tough time matching up with him because of his speed and 6-foot-3, 245-pound size.\n\nplay 0:18 Dante Moore throws 21-yard touchdown pass to Kenyon Sadiq Dante Moore throws a 21-yard touchdown pass to Kenyon Sadiq\n\nMonroe Freeling, OT, Georgia\n\nThe Browns went with Carnell Tate earlier, but their entire starting offensive line from last season is unsigned: Cam Robinson, Joel Bitonio, Ethan Pocic, Wyatt Teller and Jack Conklin. And Dawand Jones, who would have started, is coming off a season-ending knee injury. So we know where this pick has to go.\n\nFreeling has started only 18 games, but he's a solid pass protector. He just needs some work as a run blocker. His ceiling is high, and I like the idea of pairing the 6-foot-7 Freeling with the 6-foot-8 Jones as the O-line's bookends.\n\nKayden McDonald, DT, Ohio State\n\nIt's probably a little early for Texas A&M's Cashius Howell, Clemson's T.J. Parker or Oklahoma's R Mason Thomas. The Bears obviously need more edge rush support, but the board just isn't lining up. But with Gervon Dexter Sr. signed for only one more season and Grady Jarrett turning 33 in April, it would make sense to pad the defensive tackle group. McDonald is actually the DT1 on my Big Board, and he has a nose for the football. He had 17 run stops in 2025. Having him on the interior would be huge for a Bears team that allowed 5.0 yards per carry last season (fourth worst).\n\nDenzel Boston, WR, Washington\n\nBoston's hands, catch radius and vision would quickly make him a go-to option for quarterback Josh Allen. He finished with 881 yards and 11 scores last season, bullying opposing cornerbacks along the way.\n\nBuffalo's receiver room has a lot of questions and lacks a true WR1, all due respect to Khalil Shakir. After being called out by ownership last month, Keon Coleman's future with the team is murky. Brandin Cooks and Gabe Davis are free agents. Joshua Palmer was injured and limited to 22 catches on the season. And Tyrell Shavers tore an ACL in the playoffs. So, this one seems obvious.\n\nKadyn Proctor, OT/G, Alabama\n\nProctor's tape is all over the place. The highs are really, really good. The lows raise a lot of questions. But in the right situation, he could become a standout tackle in the NFL. And there might not be a better situation than learning behind one of the best to ever do it in San Francisco. Trent Williams will be 38 by Week 1, and he's entering the final year of his contract. So, Proctor could develop in Year 1 while kicking inside to guard and/or playing a swing tackle role before perhaps taking over for Williams in 2027. He has 40 career starts -- all at left tackle -- and is reliable in pass protection. This would be an upside pick for GM John Lynch.\n\nCheck out 'NFL Draft Daily' on ESPN2 Want to know more about the 2026 NFL draft class? ESPN's new show 'NFL Draft Daily' airs Monday-Friday at 3 p.m. ET on ESPN2, ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Join Mel Kiper Jr., Field Yates and other experts for the latest on top prospects.\n\nJadarian Price, RB, Notre Dame\n\nPer ESPN Research, this would be the fourth time two running backs from the same school both went in Round 1 -- and the first time since 2008, when Arkansas' Darren McFadden and Felix Jones were Day 1 selections. But just because Price was second on the Fighting Irish's depth chart to Jeremiyah Love doesn't mean he can't be an RB1 in the NFL. He's a powerful runner who plays a one-cut-and-go brand of football. There are ball security concerns (four lost fumbles over three years), and we haven't seen a ton from him as a pass catcher, but Price is dynamic. He ran for 11 touchdowns, caught two TD passes and scored two more times on kickoff returns last season.\n\nThe Texans lacked juice in the run game. Woody Marks is probably more of a change-of-pace guy, Nick Chubb is a free agent, and Joe Mixon's future is uncertain. Time for an upgrade.\n\nBlake Miller, OT, Clemson\n\nRob Havenstein retired, and Warren McClendon Jr. is entering the final year of his deal. That means there could be a big hole at right tackle. Miller has 54 career starts, and his game just keeps growing on me. In pass protection, he stays square and handles most pass-rush moves with ease. And as a run blocker, he can get to the second level to spring big gains. The blocking is so important to the Rams' excellent run game, and having a savvy right tackle is key.\n\nThe Rams' first pick in this mock draft went to the defense (Jermod McCoy), but I really like the idea of L.A. adding to the offensive line with its second one.\n\nEmmanuel McNeil-Warren, S, Toledo\n\nThe Broncos have two solid safeties in Talanoa Hufanga and Brandon Jones, so this pick might not reap immediate rewards. But neither did the Jahdae Barron pick last April. Denver is planning ahead in the secondary and building something there, as coach Sean Payton focuses on keeping this defense strong.\n\nMcNeil-Warren is a bit of a sleeper right now, but I think he could have been a top-15 pick had he played for a Power 4 team. His performance against Kentucky at the beginning of the season got my attention. He had 11 tackles and a fumble recovery in that game. His tape shows real speed to the football, and he has five interceptions and 12 forced fumbles over his four-year career.\n\nR Mason Thomas, OLB, Oklahoma\n\nAs they try to get back to the Super Bowl with a talented roster, the Patriots could use another solid edge rusher or two. Thomas can get offensive tackles leaning and then beat them with either speed or power. He uses his hands well and shows good bend off the edge. He had 15.5 sacks over the past two years. K'Lavon Chaisson is hitting free agency, so New England would love to have someone like Thomas getting after the quarterback.\n\nAvieon Terrell, CB, Clemson\n\nLet's close out Round 1 with a talented cornerback to replace free agents Riq Woolen and Josh Jobe, giving this Super Bowl champion defense yet another playmaker. The brother of A.J. Terrell Jr., Avieon Terrell can fly in coverage, and he had 27 pass breakups over three seasons. He could slide into the lineup opposite Devon Witherspoon, with Nick Emmanwori in the slot."

Smith call out Jets coach Aaron Glenn for claiming to have \"playcalling superpowers.\" (2:46)\n\nMad Dog is mad at Aaron Glenn for claiming to have superpowers (2:46)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nThe Jets and Titans agreed to a rare player-for-player trade Thursday, with New York sending pass rusher Jermaine Johnson to Tennessee for defensive tackle T'Vondre Sweat, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nThe trade can't be processed until the start of the league year on March 11.\n\nThe deal marks the latest move in a protracted teardown of a once-formidable defense for the Jets, who also traded away defensive stars Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams -- both former first-round draft picks -- in November.\n\nJohnson will be reunited with Titans coach Robert Saleh, who coached the Jets when they selected Johnson with the 26th overall pick in the 2022 draft.\n\nJohnson, coming off a down year (three sacks), has only one year remaining on his contract and is due to make a guaranteed $13.4 million in 2026, the amount of his fifth-year option.\n\nJohnson generated interest last season before the trade deadline, but the Jets opted to keep him for the remainder of the season. His departure reinforces the belief that the Jets will take an edge player with the No. 2 pick in this year's draft, with Ohio State's Arvell Reese and Texas Tech's David Bailey as the leading candidates.\n\nIn Sweat, the Jets are getting a 6-foot-2, 366-pound interior presence on a team-friendly contract. A second-round pick in 2024, he is signed through 2027 and will count only $1.7 million on the Jets' salary cap.\n\nScheme factored into the trade for both teams. The Jets, who could be using more 3-4 fronts, wanted to add more size up front. The opposite is true for Tennessee, where Saleh's scheme puts a premium on smaller, faster linemen.\n\nSweat, drafted 38th overall in 2024, posted 85 tackles and three sacks in 29 games for the Titans. He suffered an ankle injury in Tennessee's season-opening loss to the Broncos and missed five games last season.\n\nThe Titans are counting on Johnson regaining his form from 2023, when he posted a career-high 7.5 sacks and was named to the Pro Bowl as an injury replacement. His 2024 season didn't last long. In Week 2, at Tennessee, he tore an Achilles tendon and missed the remainder of the season.\n\nJohnson rehabbed to make it back for the start of the 2025 season, but he didn't have the same burst as before the injury. In 14 games, he finished with only three sacks and six quarterback hits, later admitting his performance wasn't up to his standard. Both he and the team acknowledged that the Achilles injury probably affected his performance.\n\nIn four seasons -- 47 games -- with the Jets, Johnson has 13 sacks and 131 tackles.\n\nESPN's Turron Davenport contributed to this report."

            "content": "Why the Rams should address their CB needs in NFL draft (0:41)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Former Tennessee cornerback Jermod McCoy said he is fully healed from a knee injury that cost him the entire 2025 season and expects to perform a full slate of on-field drills at his upcoming pro day.\n\nMcCoy, speaking Thursday at the NFL combine, expressed confidence that he is completely recovered, saying \"I can do everything. No limits.\"\n\nMcCoy, who sustained a torn ACL in January 2025 while training after the conclusion of the previous season, underwent medical exams at the combine but won't perform on-field drills yet. He said he preferred to wait until the Tennessee pro day in order to give himself additional preparation time.\n\nRegarding his decision to enter the draft, McCoy said it was a clear-cut choice despite his injury, his remaining eligibility and the prospect of NIL income. McCoy is expected to be one of the first defensive backs selected.\n\n\"I just feel like when you're ready, you're ready,\" he said. \"I felt ready to come out and talked with my family, my agent, my coaches. They're all on the same boat as me and agree with everything I was seeing.\"\n\nMcCoy began his career at Oregon State in 2023, transferring to Tennessee in 2024.

He was cleared to practice, he said, and considered the idea of a comeback. But he ultimately decided against it.\n\n\"I got cleared,\" he said. \"I was doing everything, practicing, everything. I just didn't feel ready yet.\"\n\nESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper lists McCoy as the No. 13 player on his Big Board."

The Blue Jays could choose to ramp him up slowly, prompting him to join the rotation in-season.\n\nAs Scherzer has pitched into his 40s, he has increasingly lost time to injury. He threw a total of 85 regular-season innings for the Blue Jays in 2025 after accumulating only 43⅓ for the Texas Rangers in 2024.\n\nBlue Jays manager John Schneider raved about Scherzer's competitiveness and preparation, and he threw well enough to earn three big starts for Toronto in the postseason -- in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, when he worked through early-inning trouble to stifle the Seattle lineup, and in Games 3 and 7 of the World Series.\n\nFive years after he throws his final pitch, Scherzer will make a speech in Cooperstown, and presumably his election into the Hall of Fame will be unanimous or close to it. Scherzer has finished in the top five of Cy Young Award voting eight times. He has a career 221-117 record with a 3.22 ERA, and his career Adjusted OPS+ of 131 is equivalent to that of Sandy Koufax.\n\nScherzer was a first-round draft pick of the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2006, and he debuted in the big leagues two years later. His delivery at that time drew a lot of scrutiny because of how he snapped his head to the left as he released the ball.\n\nArizona officials discussed the possibility of turning him into a closer, but the Diamondbacks instead shipped him to the Detroit Tigers as part of a three-team trade with the New York Yankees. With the Tigers, Scherzer flourished, going 82-35 over five seasons while establishing himself as one of the game's premier pitchers.\n\nHe signed with the Washington Nationals after the 2014 season, and he and Stephen Strasburg helped them to a championship in 2019. Over the course of his career, he has grossed nearly $370 million in salary, a reflection of his excellence on the mound.\n\nMLB Network was first to report Scherzer's agreement with Toronto.\n\nESPN's Buster Olney contributed to this report."

As stewards of the university's resources, the Athletics Department has a duty to do so. We thank Brendan for his time at Cincinnati and wish him success in the future.\"\n\nThe lawsuit said that Sorsby signed an 18-month NIL contract with the Bearcats that covered the 2025 and 2026 seasons. It was set to expire on Dec. 15, 2026.\n\nThe university claims Sorsby notified the football team on Dec. 1 that he was done playing for the Bearcats and wouldn't compete in their postseason game against Navy in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl on Jan. 2.\n\nSorsby entered the transfer portal on Jan. 2 and almost immediately signed an NIL deal with the Red Raiders.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Sorsby violated the terms of his NIL deal with Cincinnati when his image appeared on a large digital billboard in New York's Times Square announcing his commitment to Texas Tech.\n\nSorsby, a senior from Denton, Texas, was one of the top-rated quarterbacks in the transfer portal. After playing his first two seasons at Indiana, he started at Cincinnati the past two seasons.\n\nIn 2025, he completed 61.6% of his passes for 2,800 yards with 27 touchdowns and five interceptions. He also ran for 580 yards with nine scores, leading the Bearcats to a 7-5 record.\n\nCincinnati claims that although it paid Sorsby a substantial amount last season, \"it did so with the express expectation that it would realize the majority of the benefits during the following season, 2026, after Sorsby's play developed and his brand grew.\"\n\n\"Despite the clear contractual obligation to do so, and despite his ability to pay, Sorsby still has not paid the University the $1 million in liquidated damages he agreed to pay,\" the lawsuit said. \"Sorsby has benefited greatly by the NIL agreement he entered into with the University, along with the University's sustained efforts to promote him and help establish him as a top collegiate quarterback. Now, the University seeks to enforce its rights under that same agreement and to recover the amount Sorsby is contractually obligated to pay.\"\n\nIn a statement later Wednesday night, Sorsby's agent said the QB will fight the lawsuit, calling it \"misguided.\"\n\n\"University of Cincinnati, through its revenue-share structure, paid him $875,800 for a season he fully completed and in that time, he generated millions in value for the program,\" Ron Slavin of Lift Management said. \"Attempting to recover those funds now sends the wrong message to current and future student-athletes and risks damaging the long-term credibility of Cincinnati football. This is further disappointing given that Brendan parted ways with UC in what was a mutually agreeable manner. The money the university seeks to recover from him is nothing more than an unlawful penalty under Ohio law.\"\n\nCincinnati isn't the first college athletics program to sue a former player for liquidated damages after breaking an NIL contract and transferring. In December, Georgia sued former edge rusher Damon Wilson for $390,000 in damages after he transferred to Missouri following the 2024 season.\n\nGeorgia asked a judge to force Wilson into arbitration to settle the dispute. Wilson countersued Georgia in a Missouri court, alleging the Bulldogs had \"weaponized\" a liquidated damages clause in an unenforceable way to \"punish Wilson for entering the portal.\"\n\nWilson transferred to Miami in January after playing one season for the Tigers.\n\nDuke officials sued former quarterback Darian Mensah on Jan. 20 in an attempt to prevent him from transferring to Miami and to try to enforce the multiyear NIL contract he signed with the Blue Devils.\n\nThe sides reached an undisclosed settlement on Jan. 27, allowing Mensah to join the Hurricanes."

            "content": "Olympic gold medal winner Hilary Knight said Wednesday that a widely circulated comment from President Donald Trump about the United States women's team was a \"distasteful joke\" and that she's more focused on celebrating the women's accomplishments at the Milan Games.\n\nDuring the American men's team's locker room celebration in Milan, Trump extended an invitation to the players to come to Washington for the State of the Union address. \"I must tell you, we're going to have to bring the women's team, you do know that,\" adding with a laugh that if he didn't also invite the women's team, \"I do believe I probably would be impeached.\"\n\nAppearing on \"SportsCenter\" on Wednesday, Knight said, \"I thought it was sort of a distasteful joke, and unfortunately that is overshadowing a lot of the success, the success of just women at the Olympics carrying for Team USA and having amazing gold medal feats.\n\n\"We're just focusing on celebrating the women in our room, the extraordinary efforts, and continue to celebrate three gold medals in program history as well as the double gold for both men's and women's at the same time. And really not detract from that with a distasteful joke.\"\n\nKnight later said that she was looking forward to \"celebrating all great things that have come out of the Olympics and feeling the love and support and getting back in our respective communities and sharing this journey with them. And that's what this is all about.\"\n\nSeveral players on the men's team appeared to laugh at Trump's comment, a reaction that drew criticism when the video went viral. Jack Hughes, who scored the men's gold medal game winner, and his brother Quinn were asked about the situation Tuesday and focused on the team's relationship with the women's squad.\n\n\"Our relationship with them, over the course of being in the Olympic Village, I think we are so tight with their group,\" Hughes said in an interview he and Quinn did on \"Good Morning America.\" \"After we won the gold medal, we were in the cafeteria at 3:30 a.m. in the morning with them. We go from there, pack our bags and we're on the bus.\n\n\"People are so negative about things. I think everyone in that locker room knows how much we support them, how proud we are of them. The same way we feel about them, they feel about us.\"\n\nKnight echoed that the teams get along well.\n\n\"I think there's a genuine level of support there and respect,\" she said. \"I think that's being overshadowed by a quick lapse. I think the guys were in a tough spot, so I think it's a shame this storyline and narrative has kind of blown up and overshadowing that connection and genuine interest in one another and cheering each other on.\"\n\nGoaltender Jeremy Swayman told reporters in Boston after returning to practice with the Bruins that the men \"should have reacted differently\" to Trump's remarks.\n\n\"To share that gold medal with them is something that we're forever grateful for,\" Swayman said. \"And now that we're home we get to share that together forever and see the incredible support we have from the USA and share this incredible gold medal.\"\n\nHughes said the moment did not reflect the views of the men's team.\n\n\"You're in the moment and the president calls. We're blaring the music. It is what it is,\" Hughes said Wednesday night after his first game back with the New Jersey Devils. \"We have so much respect for the women's team and they have so much respect for us. We are all just proud Americans.\"\n\nWhile the men's team did attend the State of the Union address, the women's team, which won gold for the third time since the Olympics added the women's hockey competition in 1998, declined an invitation, citing logistics and scheduling concerns.\n\n\"We are sincerely grateful for the invitation extended to our gold medal-winning U.S. Women's Hockey Team and deeply appreciate the recognition of their extraordinary achievement,\" the U.S. women's team said in a statement released Monday. \"Due to the timing and previously scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games, the athletes are unable to participate. They were honored to be included and are grateful for the acknowledgment.\"\n\nKnight scored the tying goal against Canada on a redirection in the final two minutes. Megan Keller scored in overtime to lift the Americans to the 2-1 victory.\n\nThis was the final Olympic game for Knight, 36, who with her second gold medal became the most decorated player in U.S. women's hockey history. She announced in May that these Games -- her fifth -- would be her last.\n\nShe ends first among American skaters -- men or women -- in Olympic goals (15) and points (33) in a career.\n\nKnight told \"SportsCenter\" that this whole situation is a \"really good learning point, to really focus on how we talk about women, not only in sport but in industry. Women aren't less than, and their achievements shouldn't be overshadowed by anything else other than how great they are.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

Of those, 12 places are reserved for UEFA qualifying group winners, with the other four coming via the play-offs.\n\nThe 12 group runners-up will be joined by four teams who finished outside the top two of their respective qualifying groups, who were the 'best performers' in the 2024/25 Nations League.\n\nImage: Troy Parrott's stunning hat-trick against Hungary saw the Republic of Ireland secure a shock play-off spot\n\nHere are the final standings from each of the 12 groups:\n\nGroup A: Germany qualified, Slovakia and Northern Ireland into play-offs\n\nGermany qualified, and into play-offs Group B: Switzerland qualified, Kosovo and Sweden into play-offs\n\nSwitzerland qualified, and into play-offs Group C: Scotland qualified, Denmark into play-offs\n\nScotland qualified, into play-offs Group D: France qualified, Ukraine into play-offs\n\nFrance qualified, into play-offs Group E: Spain qualified, Turkey into play-offs\n\nSpain qualified, into play-offs Group F: Portugal qualified, Republic of Ireland into play-offs\n\nPortugal qualified, into play-offs Group G: Netherlands qualified, Poland into play-offs\n\nNetherlands qualified, into play-offs Group H: Austria qualified, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Romania into play-offs\n\nAustria qualified, and into play-offs Group I: Norway qualified, Italy into play-offs\n\nNorway qualified, into play-offs Group J: Belgium qualified, Wales and North Macedonia into play-offs\n\nBelgium qualified, and into play-offs Group K: England qualified, Albania into play-offs\n\nEngland qualified, into play-offs Group L: Croatia qualified, Czech Republic into play-offs\n\nCould every home nation be at the World Cup?\n\nNo!

            "content": "Thousands of African nationals have been drawn into Russia’s war in Ukraine, often through a calculated pipeline of deception and exploitation.\n\nAlthough definitive statistics are unavailable, informed estimates suggest as many as 4,000 Africans are involved, according to a February 2026 analysis by the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI). This represents the largest involvement of Africans in an international war since the French Indochina War in Vietnam in the 1950s.\n\nAfrican civic society and media analysis of the phenomena has, however, been fragmented and largely anecdotal. African regulators and other authorities have also been slow to quantify or respond to the growing mobilisation.\n\nThis African Digital Democracy Observatory (ADDO) resource-kit seeks therefore to support a more analytical approach by providing a consolidated summary of publicly verified factual evidence that spotlights the specific methods, channels, and coercive tactics used to enlist or trick African citizens into fighting in the war.\n\nThe resource kit includes a fact sheet overview of the most notable trends or insights, a consolidated summary of credible publicly reported evidence, and a database of Africans named as war recruits or casualties. ADDO will update the resource kit on a regular basis and offer support for African researchers investigating the issue.\n\nStatistical Overview\n\nScale and Risk:\n\nTotal identified fighters: At least 1,436 people from 36 countries in Africa have been identified by Ukrainian authorities as frontline fighters for Russia, with one independent French researcher suggesting that as many as 3,000–4,000 Africans in total are fighting alongside the 18,000–20,000 foreign fighters in the Russian military. Those estimates are likely to change significantly, after Kenyan intelligence agencies told parliament in late February that over 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited to fight for Russia. There are no current public estimates for Africans fighting for Ukraine, but in 2022 Russia said they had identified 249 Africans in Ukrainian uniform.\n\nHigh mortality: 42% of foreign fighters die within four months of service in the Russian army, based on data supplied by Ukrainian authorities.\n\nConfirmed casualties: Reports estimate that approximately 150 Cameroonians, 50 Burkinabe and 25 Egyptians have died.\n\nVerified cases: Propaganda is everywhere. Code for Africa (CfA) has therefore begun independently verifying cases, and has confirmed 60 cases across 16 African countries, with 42% (25 individuals) confirmed deaths, 15 being prisoners of war, 9 returnees, and 4 being incommunicado. This excludes the new Kenyan intelligence estimates, which don’t include itemised evidence or data.\n\nPrimary recruitment and enticement strategies:\n\nCommission-based agents: A ‘layered ecosystem’ of Russo‑African networks is recruiting fighters. Freelance African diaspora fixers in Moscow work with local travel agencies (for example Fly Away Travel & Tour in Ghana and St. Fortunes Travels and Logistics in Nigeria), assisted by Africa Corps (formerly Wagner Group) across West Africa and the Sahel (especially militias in CAR and Burkina Faso), alongside Russian embassy-supported affinity groups and African non-state armed groups, to quietly recruit and transport men, often under misleading ‘security’ job offers on tourist visas that researchers believe amount to human‑trafficking chains abetted by corrupt officials at borders.\n\nFor factory workers, recruiters target 18- to 22‑year‑old women with secondary education by promising hospitality/automotive jobs, but placing them in drone assembly. This recruitment is far more public and institutional, running directly through Russian embassies (for example, in Côte d’Ivoire, the Russian embassy openly advertises Alabuga Start on its website), African education ministries, universities, businesspeople (some African businesswomen have signed MOUs to deliver thousands of workers, later claiming they themselves were ‘manipulated’), BRICS‑linked women’s and youth organisations and pro‑Russia civil society groups that market the scheme as scholarships and career opportunities.\n\nFinancial exploitation: Recruiters explicitly target candidate groups that face severe economic hardship, with IFRI researchers noting most fighters are low‑income urban civilians (including teachers, junior civil servants and students) with no prior military experience, and an ideologically motivated minority who see themselves as fighting Western domination via Russia.\n\nIncentives: Agents advertise high financial rewards, including salaries up to $3,500 and sign-on bonuses as high as $13,000.\n\nDeceptive promises: Many victims were initially lured with promises of lucrative civilian jobs or non-combat roles.\n\nFalse roles: Commonly presented positions included security guard, factory worker, driver, or artisanal roles.\n\nFalse legitimacy: High-profile agents, many based in the diáspora or formerly associated with African political or military structures, are sometimes used to manipulate victims and create a false impression of legitimacy.\n\nRecruitment channels and intermediaries:\n\nSocial media campaign surge: The use of social media platforms (VKontakte, Facebook, Telegram, TikTok, X) grew dramatically, with posts promoting military service to foreigners on VKontakte alone rising from 621 to 4,600 between June and September 2025.\n\nAgent networks: Recruitment is largely conducted through agents and influencers who receive payment for each secured hire. Key players, like Polina Alexandrovna Azarnykh (known as ‘Friend of Russia’), use Telegram to target men in Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Morocco and Nigeria.\n\nExtortion by agents: In addition to commissions, victims are also charged fees, with some agents taking a substantial cut of the promised bonuses, such as one agent who received over $25,000 from the signing bonuses of 14 trafficked Ghanaians.\n\nGaming platforms: Agents have used military simulation video games, such as Arma 3, to successfully recruit players.\n\nCitizenship as incentive: African recruits are enticed with promises of Russian citizenship after service. Although no Africa-specific statistics are available, more than 3,300 foreign fighters were reportedly granted Russian citizenship between January and November 2024.\n\nCoercion and non-voluntary enrolment:\n\nRecruitment from prisons: Convicted individuals, often students jailed for drug trafficking (like Zambian citizen Lemekani Nathan Nyirenda), were recruited directly from Russian prisons in exchange for a pardon or shortened sentence.\n\nVisa threats and deportation: Russian officials reportedly threatened not to extend the visas of African students and workers unless they enlisted, forcing some to choose between fighting and deportation.\n\nDeceptive contracting: Once recruited, individuals are forced to sign Russian-language contracts for 9–12 months, often without an interpreter or lawyer present (sometimes at a police station), agreeing to terms different from what agents originally proposed.\n\nPropaganda: Russian media promotes military service with glowing reports from volunteers, offers of rewards and service awards like the medal for courage. It also promotes stories of undocumented immigrants who were offered military service as an opportunity to stay in Russia instead of deportation.\n\nMaltreatment and service conditions:\n\nPassport confiscation: After signing contracts, African fighters report that their passports are seized for ‘safekeeping’ making it impossible for them to leave the country.\n\nDeployment as ‘cannon fodder’: Recruits receive minimal combat training, sometimes less than two weeks, before being deployed to high-intensity frontlines such as Bakhmut and Zaporizhzhia as ‘cannon fodder’ or ‘disposables’, while Russian soldiers are kept behind.\n\nRacial abuse: African fighters report being subjected to racial abuse from commanders, who called them ‘used condoms’ and other unsavoury names.\n\nHarsh conditions: Survivors reported severe conditions, including lack of water and food for up to five days, bodies left to decompose, and instances of being robbed by agents or other Russian soldiers, with promised compensation for casualties not reaching families.\n\nAfrican government responses:\n\nBotswana: The government has not spoken out on recruitment of fighters, but has reacted to public concern about Alabuga Start by opening investigations. Interpol has been involved in probing potential trafficking aspects of the programme. ​Some Botswana influencers who initially promoted Alabuga jobs have since distanced themselves.\n\nCameroon: IFRI notes an estimated 150 active service soldiers deserting from the Cameroonian military to Russia, prompting Yaoundé to issue internal orders to restrict foreign travel and training for lower ranks. The measure reframes recruitment as an internal cohesion threat rather than a human rights issue.\n\nEgypt: The government announced it would revoke the nationality of any citizen who fights for Russia and has imposed a security clearance requirement for citizens travelling to Russia. Authorities have also warned that serving in any foreign military can result in a life prison sentence upon return to Egypt.\n\nKenya: Kenya’s National Intelligence Service told parliament on 20 February 2026 that more than 1,000 Kenyans had been recruited to fight on behalf of Russia, a significant increase on the 200 fighter estimate given by Kenya’s foreign affairs ministry in November. The reports said Kenyans had been lured by “rogue recruitment agencies”, with many cases qualifying as human trafficking scams. Authorities have opened investigations and arrested intermediaries as they tried to move a new group to Russia, and widely publicised these cases to warn citizens. Nairobi has also engaged Moscow diplomatically on repatriating fighters and the bodies of those killed.\n\nNigeria: The ministry of foreign affairs issued a public statement on 15 February 2026 warning about growing illegal recruitment of Nigerian citizens into foreign armed conflicts, without naming any specific country, but noting that citizens are being lured under false pretences and are being deployed into combat zones after being coerced into signing military service contracts. The government stressed that recruitment violates Nigerian and international laws governing mercenary activities, and that Nigerians who participate in foreign conflicts outside approved governmental frameworks do so at their own risk.\n\nSouth Africa: A political scandal erupted when 17 South Africans serving with Russian forces appealed for help to return, saying they had been sent for ‘bodyguard training’ by the opposition MK Party founded by former president Jacob Zuma. ​Police have opened investigations into possible mercenary activity, while Zuma’s daughter, Duduzile Sambudla-Zuma, faces potential legal action as she has been accused of tricking the men into going. South Africa’s current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced in February that Russia has agreed to repatriate the 17 fighters. South African authorities have meanwhile also launched investigations into Alabuga Start, with government departments issuing public warnings about Russian job offers, and influencers who promoted the scheme walking back or apologising for their initial support of it.\n\nADDO researchers have formally asked the ministries of defence of both Russia and Ukraine to confirm the number of African citizens currently fighting on their behalf, as well as asking for clarity on the number of Africans injured, killed or captured during the conflict. No response had been received at the time this fact sheet was published.

            "content": "The Minister for the Interior, Muntaka Mohammed-Mubarak, has officially launched Ghana’s Medicinal Cannabis Programme, marking what he described as a historic milestone in the country’s drug control and economic development framework.\n\nSpeaking at the launch in Accra on Thursday, February 26, 2026, the Minister said the rollout follows the passage of the Narcotics Control Commission Amendment Act, 2023 and the Narcotics Control Cultivation and Management of Cannabis Regulation, 2023, which together establish the legal and regulatory regime for the cultivation and management of cannabis strictly for industrial and medicinal purposes.\n\n\"Today’s event marks a significant milestone in Ghana’s commitment to responsible drug control, public health and safety and economic development,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he stressed that recreational use of cannabis remains illegal under Section 45 of the Narcotics Control Commission Act, 2020.\n\nAs part of the launch, the government introduced stricter entry requirements for investors seeking licences in the sector.\n\nMr Mohammed-Mubarak announced that applicants must secure confirmed buyers before they can be granted operational licences.\n\n“We won’t give you the licence if you don’t show us who you are going to sell it to. You need to have an off-taker,” he said.\n\nAccording to him, the off-taker requirement is intended to prevent diversion of cannabis into the illegal market and safeguard public safety. Authorities will not permit cultivation without proof of a secured market.\n\nThe directive applies across the cannabis value chain, affecting farmers, processors and investors.\n\nThe Minister explained that a total of 11 separate licences are required for different activities, including cultivation, processing, transportation, import and export. Each licence is activity-specific and non-transferable.\n\n“You cannot cultivate and assume you can transport. You need another licence for that,” he said.\n\nHe further disclosed that Ghana does not yet produce the specialised low-THC cannabis seeds required under the programme. As a result, seeds must be imported under licence.\n\n“Government is not positioning itself to provide the seeds. It is a business opportunity for those who want to import,” he said, encouraging research institutions to develop local seed capacity over time.\n\nTo ensure compliance, the Interior Ministry, in collaboration with the Narcotics Control Commission and other security agencies, will deploy surveillance and enforcement mechanisms, including GPS tracking, drone monitoring and unannounced inspections of licensed facilities.\n\nAgencies such as the Police, Immigration Service, Prisons Service and the National Investigations Bureau will support enforcement.\n\nLicensed facilities must also not be located within 100 metres of schools or residential areas, and operators are required to submit quarterly returns.\n\nMr Mohammed-Mubarak warned that regulatory breaches could damage Ghana’s international standing.\n\n“If we get it wrong, Ghana could easily be blacklisted, and all the efforts will come to nothing,” he said.\n\nWhile acknowledging the revenue potential of the sector, he emphasised that public safety remains the government’s primary concern.\n\n“Our emphasis is more on security and public safety than the money. If we do it right, the benefits will come,” he said.\n\nThe introduction of the off-taker requirement is expected to reshape participation in the emerging industry, raising the entry threshold for prospective operators and limiting licences to investors who can demonstrate full commercial readiness from production to sale.\n\nMr Mohammed-Mubarak said the government remains open to engagement but firm on enforcement.\n\n“Our doors are open 24-7, but we will make sure the intent of the law is fully achieved,” he said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

In 2023, Piesie Esther’s nomination was widely described as historic, a rare and powerful moment for gospel music to dominate mainstream conversation. However, she lost to Black Sherif, after weeks of extensive campaigns.\n\nHer hit releases, consistent airplay, massive church and public event performances, and strong fan mobilisation positioned her as a serious contender. Many within the gospel fraternity openly declared that it was “her year.”\n\nDuring the interview, Piesie Esther, staring into the eyes of the host George Quaye, said: “your public comments prior to the awards influenced discourse and affected how people viewed my chances of winning that ultimate award of that night.\"\n\nWhile she did not go into detail about the exact statements, she expressed how deeply the situation affected her emotionally.\n\n“For George to pinch me that hard…” she said, her words reflecting lingering hurt.\n\nShe admitted that she was pained at the time and remains in pain over how events unfolded.\n\n“I was pained, and I am still in pain,” she confessed.\n\nWhile acknowledging the competitive nature of the category, Piesie Esther suggested that “If not for your public comments, I would have won that award.”\n\nShe added that in an industry where narratives can shape opinions overnight, even a single influential voice can tilt conversations dramatically.\n\nIn a lead-up to the 2023 ceremony of the awards, George Quaye, a former Head of Communications for Charterhouse, the organisers of the scheme had objected to activities of some lobbyists from the camp of Piesie Esher.\n\nGeorge had vehemently spoken against members from Piesie's camp calling music industry stakeholders to vote for her to win the Artiste of the Year slot.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Finance Minister Dr Cassiel Ato Forson\n\nThe Ghana Gold Board (GoldBod) is partnering with the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources to strengthen land reclamation efforts across the country’s mining areas.\n\nFinance Minister Dr. Cassiel Ato Forson told Parliament that the collaboration aims to promote sustainable mining practices while formalizing Ghana’s gold sector.\n\nThe initiative is part of GoldBod’s broader commitment to environmental stewardship, targeting the restoration of degraded land using advanced remediation techniques and sustainable land-use planning. Abandoned mining sites are set to be transformed into productive agricultural land, community spaces, and restored natural habitats.\n\n“The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources and the Ghana Gold Board shall support and scale up sustainability initiatives such as land reclamation,” Dr. Forson said.\n\nIllegal mining, popularly known as galamsey, has severely degraded more than 4,000 hectares of land, including 34 forest reserves across seven regions. Recent government interventions, including banning mining in forest reserves and launching rehabilitation programs, are part of efforts to secure the nation’s lands.\n\nStudies show that major rivers, including the Pra and Ankobra, are heavily polluted with mercury and cyanide, exceeding WHO safety limits. Deforestation in mining areas has also reduced carbon sequestration, increasing climate vulnerability.\n\nRestoration strategies such as afforestation, biochar application, and phytoremediation have met with limited success due to weak policy enforcement, financial constraints, and low community engagement.\n\nThis partnership signals a renewed commitment to reversing the environmental impacts of mining while promoting sustainable land use and community development.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Award-winning Ghanaian gospel musician Piesie Esther has revealed that she has not yet made a firm decision on working with secular artistes.\n\nSpeaking on Prime Time with George Quaye on Joy Prime, Piesie Esther addressed one of the most debated topics in Ghana’s gospel music industry: gospel and secular music collaborations.\n\nOver the years, gospel musicians featuring secular artistes and vice versa have sparked mixed reactions from fans, religious leaders, and industry stakeholders. Some see these partnerships as an opportunity to expand reach and promote unity within the creative space, while others believe they could dilute the spiritual essence of gospel music.\n\nAsked whether she would consider recording a song with a secular artiste, Piesie Esther responded with caution.\n\n“I have not made up my mind yet to make music with secular musicians,” she stated.\n\nPressed on whether there were particular secular artistes she would like to collaborate with, she admitted it would be difficult to mention names at this time.\n\nAccording to her, the hesitation is not rooted in criticism of secular musicians. She clarified that she does not see anything inherently wrong with such collaborations.\n\n“There’s nothing wrong with doing a song with secular musicians,” she explained.\n\nHowever, she acknowledged that the reaction from her own gospel community remains a significant consideration.\n\n“My own people will be the ones to bash me because they may not understand,” she added.\n\nHer remarks highlight the pressure gospel artistes often face in balancing artistic growth and broader industry engagement with the expectations of a faith-based audience. In Ghana, where gospel music is closely tied to church culture and Christian values, musicians are frequently held to high spiritual and moral standards by their followers.\n\nDespite anticipating criticism, the award-winning singer remains optimistic that perspectives will eventually shift.\n\n“For now, they may lack understanding, but I believe a time will come when it will be easier to collaborate with secular artistes,” she said.\n\nFor Piesie Esther, any decision to collaborate will require careful thought, prayer, and discernment. As one of Ghana’s most respected gospel voices, she appears committed to protecting both her ministry and her relationship with her core audience.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

The company has also built a strong outgrower network and operates a mill with a processing capacity of 30 tonnes per hour.\n\n\n\nIts products supply major refineries in Ghana and reach markets across the ECOWAS sub-region.\n\n\n\nMr Madjie said the company is seeking additional investment to scale up production and meet the growing demand for vegetable oils in Ghana and across West Africa.\n\n\n\nHe noted that expanding domestic processing capacity would not only strengthen local value addition but also reduce dependence on imported vegetable oils, while creating employment opportunities along the value chain.\n\n“This initiative represents the type of long-term, productive investment that can anchor rural industrialisation and generate sustainable returns,” he said.\n\n\n\nMadjie stressed that the investments would shape the future of Ghana’s tree crops industry, mobilised today, adding that the opportunities within the sector remain significant.\n\n\n\n“The opportunities before us are enormous,” he told participants. “I invite you once again to partner with us as we reset, rebuild and grow a sustainable and globally competitive tree crops industry that delivers prosperity for investors and opportunity for our people.”\n\n\n\nThe summit was held under the theme: “Sustainable Growth through Tree Crops Investment: Resetting and Rebuilding Ghana’s Green Economy.”"

He noted that such dysfunction severely compromises response times, particularly in trauma and time-sensitive emergencies.\n\n\n\n“In trauma cases, obstetric emergencies, strokes, cardiac events, and other time-sensitive conditions, minutes determine survival outcomes,” he stressed.\n\nHe further linked the tragic incident to the persistent “No Bed Syndrome,” explaining that the issue goes beyond mere bed shortages.\n\n\n\n“It reflects deeper systemic inefficiencies, including weak referral coordination, inadequate triage management, insufficient high-dependency and step-down facilities, and the overburdening of tertiary hospitals,” he noted.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, when critically injured patients are transferred from facility to facility in search of space, public confidence is eroded, and lives are endangered.\n\n\n\n“Emergency healthcare is not optional. It is the foundation upon which public trust in the health system rests,” he emphasised.\n\n\n\nThe MP called for immediate reforms, including a nationwide technical audit of ambulances, ring-fenced maintenance funding, and the deployment of a real-time national bed availability dashboard to improve coordination and reduce avoidable delays.\n\n\n\n“When citizens call for help, they must be confident that an ambulance will arrive and that a hospital will admit and treat them with dignity and urgency,” he concluded.\n\n\n\nGhanaian man and his Nigerian girlfriend found dead in Morocco apartment"

She stressed the importance of early detection, mental resilience, and timely medical intervention in improving survival outcomes.\n\n\n\nDrawing from both her professional and personal journey, she encouraged women to prioritise regular screening and proactive healthcare.\n\n\n\nAlso addressing the gathering was Lovelace B Kwadzo Edzor, Deputy CEO of The Health Project and Parliamentary Health Coordinator for the Madina Constituency.\n\n\n\nHe conveyed institutional support for the initiative and noted that the Member of Parliament for Madina had expressed enthusiasm about the project. According to him, the campaign aligns with ongoing local health priorities focused on preventive care and community education.\n\n\n\nThe Tatas Festival is being driven by the Six Degrees Plugs initiative, a network established to strengthen community engagement efforts. The initiative seeks to build a group of ambassadors capable of mobilising people within their respective communities and translating awareness goals into practical action.\n\n\n\nOrganisers say the objective is to ensure that conversations around breast cancer prevention, screening, and survivor care remain active throughout the year rather than being limited to seasonal campaigns.\n\n\n\n“The Tatas Festival is about breaking the silence and the stigma. By bringing together voices like Joycelyn’s and the support of leaders like Edzor, we are building a community where no one has to fight this battle alone,” a representative stated at the launch.\n\n\n\nBreast cancer remains one of the leading cancers affecting women globally, and health advocates continue to emphasise the importance of early detection and accessible screening services as critical tools in reducing mortality rates."

The Minister further assured businesses of government’s support in accessing standards certification, credible programmes and market linkages, including opportunities under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\n\n\nIn addition, she challenged the association to prioritise mentorship and youth development through internships, apprenticeships and practical skills training, stressing that building the next generation of entrepreneurs was key to sustaining Ghana’s industrial transformation.\n\n\n\nIn his acceptance speech, President of the Board of Trustees of the KBAA, Kwabena Adjare Danquah, described the inauguration as a defining moment in the collective journey of Kwahu entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\nHe said the association marked a transition from individual business accomplishments to organised influence rooted in unity, innovation, strategy and sustainable growth.\n\n\n\n“Our broader objective is straightforward job creation, enterprise expansion, true partnership and long-term prosperity through disciplined organisation,” he stated.\n\n\n\nDanquah outlined four key focus areas for the association: advocacy, membership value, innovation and business development.

The NPP is vindicated every day due to the unsatisfactory showing of Mahama’s government,” he said in a statement made available to GhanaWeb.\n\n\n\nHis remarks come amid growing criticisms of the government’s performance across key sectors, including cocoa and energy.\n\n\n\nOne of the sharpest criticisms has come from the Minority Chief Whip in Parliament, Frank Annoh-Dompreh, who accused the government of failing to properly brief Parliament on the recent reduction of the producer price of cocoa to GH¢2,587 per bag for the remainder of the 2025/2026 crop season.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, February 25, 2026, Annoh-Dompreh said, “It is interesting and very revealing that when you were doing the haircut, you didn't remember that there was a House of Parliament. The haircut, the poor cocoa farmer, you didn't consider it important to come to this House. Suddenly you find it prudent to come to this House. When farmers were crying, our cocoa farmers were crying, you were busily in your office doing engaging haircuts. That way you didn't find it important to come to this House and make a statement.”\n\n\n\nHindu's return signals growing unity around Bawumia - Musah Superior\n\n\n\nHe urged the finance minister to show accountability, stressing that cocoa farmers are demanding legal frameworks to protect the industry from political interference and ensure fair treatment.\n\n\n\n“We are tired of the haircuts. He was busily in his office engaging in haircuts enterprise, reducing the price of cocoa anyhow. And now you find your way to Parliament,” he stated.\n\n\n\nGhanaian man and his Nigerian girlfriend found dead in Morocco apartment"

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "The US says it will licence entities to sell the oil to Cuba except those linked to the Cuban government and military.\n\nAfter months of a crippling oil blockade on Cuba imposed by the United States, the fuel-starved country may now see some relief after the US government said it would begin authorising companies to resell Venezuelan oil, even as tensions between the two reach a head.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US Department of the Treasury said it would allow the resale of Venezuelan oil for “commercial and humanitarian use” in Cuba as the small island nation faces one of its worst fuel crises in decades.\n\nVenezuela is the largest provider of oil to Cuba. However, since US forces abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in January and imprisoned him to face drugs and weapons charges in a New York court, the Donald Trump administration has taken control of Caracas’s oil and halted exports to Havana.\n\nWashington has long had frosty relations with Cuba, but Trump’s administration is specifically seeking regime change there by the end of 2026, US media has reported.\n\nThe US’s policy shift this week, however, comes after Caribbean leaders sounded the alarm about the dire situation in Cuba, an island nation of 10.9 million people.\n\nAt a regional meeting of Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries on Wednesday, attended by US Secretary of State and Cuban-American Marco Rubio, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness called on Washington to ease the pressure.\n\n“Today, many Cubans are facing serious economic hardship, energy shortages, and growing humanitarian challenges,” Holness said. Cuba is not a CARICOM member but shares close ties.\n\n\n\n“We are sensitive to their struggles. But we must also recognise that a prolonged crisis in Cuba will not remain there. It can impact migration, security and economic stability across the Caribbean, including Jamaica,” he added.\n\nWhat’s the situation in Cuba now?\n\nCuba’s state-dominated economy was already struggling under a US embargo which has been in place since 1962, dating back to Havana’s alliance with the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n\nSince then, sanctions on Cuba have eased and tightened under various US administrations.\n\nThe long-running sanctions have severely weakened Cuba, causing the country to become highly dependent on imports, and high inflation routinely leads to food and energy shortages. Mass emigration of Cuba’s skilled labour force, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, has added to the country’s difficulties.\n\nWith Trump’s latest oil embargo, the US has added a severe energy crisis to the mix. Widespread power blackouts of up to 20 hours at a time are now being reported across Cuba, impacting hospitals, businesses and households alike.\n\nSurgeries have been suspended, schools have cancelled classes, and waste trucks are parked as rubbish piles up in the streets.\n\nFour United Nations special rapporteurs warned in early February that the situation is contributing to a severe public health problem in the country and said it could lead to a “severe humanitarian” crisis.\n\nCuba has lost 90 percent of its fuel supply, and despite shutting beach resorts and restricting aviation fuel sales, the country could experience a total blackout as early as late February, according to Ignacio Seni, a risk analyst writing for the US-based intelligence firm Crisis 24.\n\nWhy has the US blocked oil deliveries to Cuba?\n\nCuba produces crude oil but does not have the capacity to refine enough to meet domestic demand.\n\nVenezuela was providing as much as 50 percent of Cuba’s oil before the US government took control of its oil industry at the start of this year, about 35,000 barrels per day.\n\nUnder a special barter agreement in place since 2000, Cuba provides support for education, healthcare, and security services in return for discounted Venezuelan fuel. Indeed, about 30 members of Maduro’s security detail who were killed in the operation to abduct him in January were from Cuba.\n\n\n\nThen, days after Maduro was abducted, Trump turned his aim at Cuba itself, warning Havana to “make a deal before it is too late”. He did not, however, give details about what type of deal he wanted.\n\nOn January 29, Trump issued an executive order imposing new trade tariffs on any countries selling oil to Cuba because of what he called the “policies, practices and actions” of the Cuban government, which, he said, pose an “extraordinary threat” to the US.\n\nTrump also claimed, without evidence, that Havana funds “terrorism”.\n\nBesides Venezuela, Cuba was also sourcing oil from Mexico, Russia and Algeria, but all oil imports into the country ceased. Trump’s order, therefore, effectively amounted to a blockade.\n\nThe US has also reportedly seized fuel tankers in open waters transferring oil to Cuba, according to a New York Times investigation into ship movements in the Caribbean Sea published last week.\n\nThe US began building up its naval presence in the area in September last year as it prepared to attack Maduro, and its troops continue to patrol the waters.\n\nIn mid-February, one tanker loaded with Colombian oil was intercepted by the US Coast Guard as it came within 70 miles of Cuba, the Times reported. The vehicle, called the Ocean Mariner, was previously used to covertly transport oil between Venezuela and Iran.\n\nBefore Maduro’s capture, US forces also struck multiple Venezuelan boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean that the US claimed – without evidence – were trafficking drugs.\n\nHow have Cuba and others reacted to the US blockade?\n\nCuban authorities under President Miguel Diaz-Canel have accused the US of imposing collective punishment on the country.\n\nOn Wednesday, it also accused the US of links to armed men who entered the country’s waters on a Florida-tagged speedboat. Four Americans of Cuban origin were killed in the altercation, and two were injured.\n\nIn the past, Havana has said it is open to “reciprocal dialogue” with Washington, but Diaz-Canel has also said Cubans will “defend the Homeland to the last drop of blood”.\n\nMeanwhile, on February 12, a UN expert panel condemned the US’s directive as illegal and said the claim that Havana funds terrorism “lacks credibility and appears designed to justify the use of extraordinary and coercive powers”.\n\n“It is an extreme form of unilateral economic coercion with extraterritorial effects, through which the United States seeks to exert coercion on the sovereign state of Cuba and compel other sovereign third States to alter their lawful commercial relations,” the panel said.\n\nOther countries are trying to help. Mexico has sent two deployments of humanitarian aid to Havana between mid-February and this week, while Russia has floated the possibility of sending fuel to Cuba.\n\nOn Wednesday, Canada pledged food aid with 8 million Canadian dollars ($6.7m).\n\nWhat relief has the US announced now, and will it change anything?\n\nWashington said on Wednesday it would issue companies with special licences to resell Venezuelan oil to Cuba “in solidarity” with the Cuban people.\n\n\n\nThat came after Washington announced $6m in humanitarian aid to Cuba to be distributed by the Catholic Church in early February.\n\nHowever, “persons or entities associated with the Cuban military, intelligence services, or other government institutions” will be barred from obtaining oil sales licences, the US Treasury Department said this week.\n\nTransactions should only support “exports for commercial and humanitarian use”, the statement added.\n\nIt is unclear if the new order will allow Havana to continue buying Venezuelan oil at a heavily subsidised rate as it was previously doing. If it does not, the situation may not ease significantly for Cuba, experts say.\n\n“Without significant oil imports or a relenting of US pressure, Cuba’s economy is unlikely to recover, and the degradation of conditions is likely to accelerate,” Seni, the Crisis 24 risk analyst, wrote."

            "content": "Indian PM throws his weight behind Israel’s Netanyahu even as genocide continues in occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has wrapped up a two-day visit to Israel, which was marked by a welcoming embrace from his counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, and a conspicuous silence about Israel’s genocidal war in occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nDuring the visit, which began on Wednesday, the two leaders lauded their strong friendship, which they said has deepened bilateral ties, and signed agreements on a range of issues, including innovation and agriculture.\n\n“You are a great friend of Israel, … Narendra. You are more than a friend. You are a brother,” Netanyahu told Modi when both leaders addressed the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem on Wednesday.\n\nNetanyahu showed Modi around Yad Vashem, a memorial in Jerusalem to the victims of the Holocaust, and hosted a dinner after they had spoken to the Knesset, where Modi was conferred with the parliament’s highest honour.\n\nThis was the second ever visit by an Indian prime minister to Israel after Modi’s first visit in 2017. That time, he also did not visit Palestine despite India’s long history of supporting the Palestinian cause.\n\nWhile India opposed the creation of Israel in 1948 and formalised diplomatic relations only in 1992, relations between the two countries have improved since then, flourishing particularly since Modi became India’s prime minister in 2014.\n\nSince then, their ties have blossomed, anchored in defence and the shared nationalistic leanings of their leaders.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from Modi’s trip to Israel:\n\nFull support for Israel, silence on Gaza genocide\n\nWednesday was the first time an Indian leader had addressed the Knesset. Modi received a standing ovation after declaring: “India stands with Israel firmly, with full conviction, in this moment and beyond.”\n\n\n\nModi told the Israeli parliament that he carries “the deepest condolences of the people of India for every life lost and for every family whose world was shattered in the barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7” in 2023.\n\n“We feel your pain. We share your grief. India stands with Israel firmly, with full conviction, in this moment and beyond,” he said. “No cause can justify the murder of civilians. Nothing can justify terrorism.”\n\nThe Indian prime minister referred to the Mumbai attacks in 2008, which New Delhi has blamed on neighbouring Pakistan, saying: “Like you, we have a consistent and uncompromising policy of zero tolerance for terrorism with no double standards.”\n\nModi also threw his weight behind United States President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza peace plan, stating that India “supports all efforts that contribute to durable peace and regional stability”.\n\nWhile Modi said he backed “dialogue, peace and stability in the region”, he skipped any mention of the continuing genocide in Gaza, where the Israeli army has killed more than 72,000 Palestinians since October 2023.\n\nAnwar Alam, a senior fellow at the Policy Perspective Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi, said the timing of Modi’s visit is “too poor and has grossly compromised India’s historical pro-Palestine stand”.\n\nAlam argued that while New Delhi, a leader of the anticolonial nonalignment movement, can continue to maintain ties with Tel Aviv, “India cannot allow itself to display such insensitivity to Palestinian sufferings and stand with the coloniser.”\n\nModi emphasises ‘civilisational ties’ with Israel\n\nOne reason Modi, unlike previous Indian leaders, has displayed such warmth towards the Israeli prime minister is the Indian Hindu right’s enthusiasm for the ideology of Zionism, analysts said.\n\nModi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has roots in a philosophy, Hindutva, which ultimately seeks to transform India into a Hindu nation and a natural homeland for Hindus anywhere in the world – similar to Israel’s view of itself as a Jewish homeland.\n\nDuring his speech to the Knesset, therefore, Modi doubled down on what he called the “civilisational ties” between the two nations. He started his address to the Knesset by announcing himself as “a representative of one ancient civilisation addressing another”.\n\n“We are both ancient civilisations, and it is perhaps no surprise that our civilisational traditions also reveal philosophical parallels,” he said, quoting the Israeli “principle of ‘tikkun olam’ about healing the world”.\n\n\n\n“In India, there is great admiration for Israel’s resolve, courage and achievements,” Modi said. “Long before we related to each other as modern states, we were linked by ties that go back more than 2,000 years.”\n\nModi mused about “returning to a land to which I have always felt drawn”. “After all, I was born on the same day that India formally recognised Israel – September 17, 1950.”\n\nWhile India formally recognised Israel in 1950, two years after its formation, it only established diplomatic relations with it in 1992.\n\nDeepening defence ties\n\nThese days, India is Israel’s largest weapons buyer, pumping billions of dollars into Israel’s defence industry each year. In 2024 as Israel waged its war on Gaza, Indian weapons firms sold Israel rockets and explosives, according to an Al Jazeera investigation.\n\nOn Thursday, Modi held talks with Netanyahu focused on further boosting ties in the areas of defence and security along with trade, technology and agriculture.\n\n“We have decided to establish the Critical and Emerging Technologies Partnership. This will give new momentum to cooperation in areas such as AI, quantum, and critical minerals,” Modi said.\n\n\n\nThe two countries are also currently negotiating a free trade agreement.\n\nElevating strategic ties\n\nIndia and Israel are reportedly inching closer to an alliance, along with other global powers, to boost security cooperation.\n\nBefore Modi’s visit, Netanyahu pitched a “hexagon of alliances” that he said would include India, Greece, Cyprus and other unnamed Arab, African and Asian states to collectively stand against what he called “radical” Shia and Sunni Muslim “axes” of adversaries in the region.\n\nModi has not confirmed this plan but did call for cooperation on multilateral projects, including the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and the I2U2, consisting of India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and US.\n\nThe IMEC envisions connecting India with the Middle East and Europe through an integrated rail and shipping corridor. The economic corridor would pass through India, the UAE, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Europe. It was unveiled in September 2023 during a Group of 20 summit in New Delhi.\n\n“IMEC is very ambitious in bringing together these countries in ways that at one point would have been incomprehensible,” said Harsh Pant, vice president of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank. “Today, it has become possible because India’s footprint has grown in the Middle East and in Europe.”\n\nGeopolitical analysts have referred to the I2U2 as “the West Asian Quad” in reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a forum of the US, Japan, Australia and India.\n\nModi also referred to the Abraham Accords, brokered by the US since 2020 for Gulf and North African countries to normalise relations with Israel, and “applauded your courage and vision”.\n\n“Since then, the situation has changed significantly. The path is even more challenging. Yet it is important to sustain that hope,” Modi said.\n\n‘Dehyphenating’ India from Israel-Palestine\n\nPant said, like some Arab nations, India wants to dehyphenate its relations in the region to suit its own strategic interests better. Dehyphenation is a foreign policy under which a country aims to maintain independent relationships with nations that may be in conflict with each other.\n\n\n\n“India’s own relationships have developed to a point where India is no longer hyphenating its relationships in the region,” Pant said.\n\nAnalysts argued New Delhi has bet on Israel for its own strategic interests, even if at Palestine’s expense. From the Indian government’s point of view, “this is the beginning of a new strategic imagination for the region,” Pant told Al Jazeera.\n\nModi remarked in his speech to the Knesset that many Indians have migrated to Israel for work, adding that Indian youth have contributed to the building of modern Israel, including “also on the battlefield”. Thousands of foreign nationals have served in the Israeli military, including nearly 200 soldiers who are dual citizens of India and Israel.\n\nModi, however, did not mention Colonel Waibhav Kale, a former Indian army officer who died in May 2024 when a United Nations vehicle was struck by the Israeli army in Gaza. He was the first international UN worker in Gaza to die in the war.\n\n“India’s stance is clear: Humanity must never become a victim of conflict. A path to peace has been created through the Gaza peace plan. India has fully supported these efforts,” Modi said before departing on Thursday.\n\nHowever, analysts said the divergence from earlier Indian support for Palestine is stark and India will not call out Netanyahu for war crimes in Palestinian territory.\n\nWhile governments before Modi laid the foundations for current bilateral ties, Modi has brought “this relationship out into the open”, Pant said. “What used to be hush-hush behind closed doors is now a matter of fact.”\n\n“India is trying not to make ties with Israel a hostage to the issue of Palestine,” he argued.\n\nAzad Essa, the author of the 2023 book Hostile Homelands: The New Alliance Between India and Israel, said that earlier, India had positioned itself as a friend of Palestine “because it suited its national interests to be seen as pro-Palestine”.\n\nPopular political forces in New Delhi have shifted that stance since then, however. Given the deep defence and security tie-up between Israel and India, Essa said, “It will be very difficult for opposition parties to promise a U-turn because being pro-Israel has become integral to the national interest.”\n\n“To be pro-Palestine is now seen as being against the Indian national interest,” he said. Some have been detained and charged for expressing support for Palestine in India.\n\n“India will have to become far more democratic and break out of the grip of majoritarian politics if it is to change more than just its tone on Palestine,” Essa told Al Jazeera."

            "content": "After the beginning of Trump’s second term, the connections between capitalism, white supremacy and imperial domination became increasingly clear. These have been highlighted through ICE raids as modern-day slave patrols, global criminal operations such as the kidnapping of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, and United States assistance to Israel’s genocide in Gaza as a bipartisan US and transnational corporate experiment.\n\nThe growing understanding that people in the Global South, along with Black, Indigenous and other People of Colour (BIPOC) within the imperial core, face a common enemy has galvanised an anti-colonial, revolutionary movement committed to radical transformation.\n\nAnd then the release of the Epstein files flooded public discourse.\n\nEpstein and the media\n\nJeffrey Epstein was a financier convicted of sex crimes involving minors. After renewed federal charges in 2019, he died in jail (officially ruled a suicide). The case triggered public outrage about ruling class impunity, media focus on unsavoury associations between the political and corporate class and a plethora of conspiratorial narratives about cover-ups.\n\nThe Epstein case became far more than a criminal proceeding; it reflects a symbolic exposure of ruling class impunity and concentrated power and a spectacle of corruption within an empire in deep crisis and decline.\n\nThe Epstein case exposed ruling class criminality while simultaneously displacing structural accountability.\n\nImportantly, “spectacle” does not mean “fake”; it means the organisation of politics through symbolic drama that displaces structural political analysis. With spectacle, social contradictions (inequality, social crises and instability) are dramatised rather than structurally challenged.\n\n\n\nThe enduring media and public fixation on the Epstein files, particularly as their release proceeds with little accountability and continued narratives that discredit and isolate survivors, serves less as accountability and more as a political diversion from systemic injustices: Racism, capitalism, the growth of the police state and ongoing international impunity.\n\nMore troubling still, it marks another step in the erosion of democracy and the consolidation of expansionist, war-driven fascism.\n\nFascist spectacle\n\nIn work by Walter Benjamin, Hannah Arendt, Guy Debord, Umberto Eco and others, fascist spectacle involves anti-intellectual and emotionally driven mass mobilisation around simple moral binaries (pure people v the corrupt ruling class), where action is revered while thought is reviled; the replacement of institutional process with symbolic imagery and drama; and mythic narratives of national decay and rebirth. Political theorist Roger Griffin calls this rebirth “palingenic ultranationalism”, that is, destruction as a precondition for rebirth.\n\nThe function of spectacle is to subvert principled analysis and resistance to oppression with emotion – outrage, disgust, despair and helplessness.\n\nConspiracy theories are the narrative engine of spectacle. They transform systemic crisis and social instability into simple, emotionally gripping stories of social taboo-breaking, centred on hidden and untouchable enemies, laying the groundwork through which authoritarian solutions are marketed as necessary and even redemptive.\n\nWhen structural violence becomes visible, but accountability remains absent, public anger often seeks explanation through personalised and conspiratorial narratives rather than systemic analysis.\n\nAmid growing distrust and corruption in mainstream media and the rise of citizen-driven and alternative social media ecosystems, conspiracy theories surrounding the Epstein case have blossomed: Claims of secret global cabals engaged in immoral sexual criminality, ritualistic fantasies involving human sacrifice, cannibalism and ancient symbolic structures and explicitly racist and anti-Semitic tropes about hidden rulers, among others.\n\nTheories like these, whether wholly true, partially true or false, are not new; fascist movements have historically mobilised around the idea that the nation is being secretly corrupted by a degenerate ruling class, with a radical cleansing necessary to return to a righteous path.\n\nThese narratives do not expose a corrupt system; they obscure and mystify it. By sensationalising corruption into myth and providing explicit, though untouchable, targets for public outrage, they displace rigorous anti-colonial and material analyses of structural exploitation, greed and state violence with collective authoritarian longing for a strongman and the suppression of dissent to restore order.\n\n\n\nThe criminality of Epstein and the powerful figures who orbited him and participated in his abuses have come to symbolise a degenerate ruling class with identifiable names and faces, targets who could be exposed and jailed, thereby clearing the narrative space for a heroic white knight to ride in with promises of salvation.\n\nAs Hannah Arendt warned, conspiracy thinking thrives when trust in institutions collapses. The Epstein scandal intensified the sense of a ruling class operating above the law and of a justice system which protects its own, conditions ideal for authoritarian movements to exploit by insisting the system is irredeemably rigged and that only a strong leader can tear it down.\n\nAs such, the spectacle of the Epstein scandal can absorb and manipulate public outrage, redirecting it away from necessary structural accountability in the form of decolonisation and redistribution of wealth, ultimately reinforcing the very systems it appears to challenge.\n\nIn doing so, it promotes the aesthetics of politics – the spectacle – rather than grounded critiques of capitalism and imperial power. Further, it serves to distract from failures ultimately promoting oppression and war. According to Federico Caprotti, various forms of fascist spectacle produce a “collage” which both expresses and obscures the syncretic ideology of the regime.\n\nThe grand spectacle: War\n\nWhen politics becomes theatre rather than collective progress dependent on accountability, transformation or reform, crisis becomes emotional drama, drama demands release (internal resolution) or escalation and escalation inevitably finds its expression in externalised war, in which the nation performs a grand spectacle of unity and sacrifice on the largest possible stage.\n\nWar acts as a stabilising force when internal contradictions cannot be resolved through collective mobilisation. With its uniforms and marches, war channels discontent by uniting a fragmented, outraged population against an externalised enemy, transforming righteous anger at the violence, oppression and greed of a ruling class into manufactured unity, heroism and meaning through violence against “the other”.\n\nThese dynamics, outlined by Benjamin decades ago, feel alarmingly familiar in the present moment, including in the spectacle surrounding the Epstein scandal.\n\nIn this context, external conflict functions not only as policy but as emotional consolidation, redirecting internal disillusionment towards collective national purpose.\n\nFascist forces deploy such spectacles to distract and mobilise, and are doing so presently; accelerating the dismantling of what remains of US democracy and the post-war international order, to be replaced by a system ruled by force and naked self-interest.\n\nSpectacle politics does not require loyalty to specific leaders but to the emotional narrative they embody, rendering individual figures ultimately expendable.\n\nIn this logic, even Trump could be discarded, sacrificed to clear the way for a “purer” white male strongman (Vance? Pence? Carlson?) who promises to cleanse the ruling class and by extension its foreign so-called “handlers” (enemies like Russia, China and Iran or even allies like Israel and Europe, the latter already being threatened by Trump), of its unsavoury elements, particularly if Trump’s baggage with Epstein proves politically irredeemable.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, liberation and reconciliation and an end to capitalist oppression, with its accompanying genocidal violence and planetary destruction, require a steadfast structural framework aligned with broader leftist, antiracist and anti-colonial principles. Such a framework prioritises systemic transformation over spectacle. Within this view, the Epstein scandal is not treated as the disease itself, but as a symptom of capitalism’s inherent corruption.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."

            "content": "Recent comments by United States and Israeli officials supporting the concept of a “Greater Israel” have raised alarm bells across the region and shed light on a vision once only rarely publicly spoken about.\n\nAn interview aired last week by the American right-wing podcaster Tucker Carlson with US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee started the current furore. Carlson, an influential figure who has been vocally critical of Israel over the past year, repeatedly asked Huckabee whether he supported Israel controlling all the land between the Nile River in Egypt and the Euphrates River in Iraq.\n\nHuckabee, a Christian Zionist, would not disavow the belief that the Bible promised that land to Israel – even though it now encompasses all or part of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Syria.\n\n“It would be fine if they took it all,” Huckabee said, leading to anger from those countries and others in the region, many of which are close US allies.\n\nThen, speaking on Monday, Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said that he would support “anything that will allow the Jews a large, broad, strong land and a safe haven for us”.\n\n“Zionism is based on the Bible. Our mandate over the land of Israel is biblical, [and] the biblical borders of the land of Israel are clear … Therefore, the borders are the borders of the Bible,” the apparently secular Israeli politician said.\n\nSo what is Greater Israel exactly? And is it really an ultimate goal for some Israeli politicians?\n\nDefining Greater Israel\n\nThe most expansionist claim for a Greater Israel is based on a biblical verse (Genesis 15:18-21), which narrates God making a covenant with Abraham that promises his descendants the land between the Nile and the Euphrates.\n\n\n\nThat would include the Jewish people, with the tribes of Israel believed to be descended through Abraham’s son, Isaac. But it would also include the children of another of Abraham’s sons, Ishmael (Ismail), regarded as the forefather of the Arabs.\n\nOther definitions based on different biblical verses are narrower in their territorial scope and specify that the land of Israel would be promised to the tribes of Israel descended from Isaac.\n\nHow has Israel worked to achieve expansion?\n\nThe current state of Israel emerged from the British Mandate for Palestine in 1948. The mandate, created by the League of Nations in the wake of World War I and the occupation of Palestine by the British, geographically limited Israel upon its creation.\n\nThe 1948 war that followed the end of the mandate led to Israel taking control of all of Mandatory Palestine, with the exception of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n\nBut Israel soon expanded by force – in 1967 it defeated Arab forces and took control of the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, and Syria’s occupied Golan Heights. Israel continues to occupy all of those regions, with the exception of the Sinai, which it returned to Egypt in 1982.\n\nSince then, Israel has ignored international law and continued occupying Palestinian and Syrian land, and has shown little respect for its neighbours’ sovereignty, occupying more land in Syria, as well as in Lebanon.\n\nHow popular is the idea of Greater Israel?\n\nThis needs to be broken down into two separate concepts – the expansion of Israel into the territory that immediately borders it, and the most extreme definition of Greater Israel: between the Nile and the Euphrates.\n\nIn terms of expansion into its immediate surroundings, Israeli Jews by and large support the annexation of East Jerusalem, which is occupied Palestinian territory, and the Golan Heights.\n\nThe Israeli government continues to move towards the de facto annexation of the occupied West Bank. Israeli politicians vary in how open they are in their support for the formal annexation of the West Bank, but most mainstream Israeli politicians are supportive of the illegal Israeli settlements in the territory.\n\nAn expansion of Israeli settlements into Gaza is not as popular, but is supported by far-right Israeli parties.\n\nA Greater Israel, including parts of Jordan, or the most irredentist definition between the Euphrates and the Nile, is more controversial. Pre-1948, many Zionists sought not just Palestine but also Jordan for their future state – one of the most important Zionist armed groups at the time, the Irgun, even included the map of both Palestine and Jordan in its emblem.\n\n\n\nBut after the foundation of Israel this took a back seat, and open calls for a vastly expanded Israel were largely restricted to the fringes. But those fringes – far-right figures like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir – are now in government, reflecting a wider radicalisation within Israeli society itself.\n\nThat means the Israeli ‘mainstream’, politicians such as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and centrists like Lapid, are either more open in their support for some form of Greater Israel beyond the West Bank, or less willing to publicly oppose it.\n\nHow threatened do regional countries feel?\n\nRegional states have said that the annexation of the West Bank would be a red line, but have been unable to reverse Israel’s occupation.\n\nHints at a wider expansion have led to an angry reaction from Arab countries. This goes further back than Huckabee’s recent comments. For example, Jordan condemned Smotrich – Israel’s finance minister – when he gave a speech in 2023 at a podium that displayed a map that showed Jordan as part of Israel.\n\nAnd Huckabee’s support for Greater Israel was roundly condemned by more than a dozen states, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkiye.\n\nFor Arab and Muslim states, the anger at the comments partially emanates from the sense of a lack of respect towards the sovereignty of regional states by a US official. But it also highlights fears that the balance of power in the region is weighted towards an Israel that is increasingly willing to attack across the Middle East, and has little interest in peace.\n\nEven if the takeover of the land between the Nile and the Euphrates is not feasible, a region where Israel is the primary hegemon will likely lead to more attacks, more wars, and, if Israel determines it necessary, more occupation of land."

            "content": "The World Economic Forum boss, a former Norwegian foreign minister, had dinners and exchanged messages with Epstein.\n\nBorge Brende has resigned from his roles as the president and CEO of the World Economic Forum (WEF), following revelations of his links with the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBrende, a former Norwegian foreign minister who became president of the WEF in 2017, announced his departure on Thursday, joining the ranks of prominent figures to have left their jobs or faced criminal investigations after their contacts with Epstein were revealed in files released by the US Department of Justice last month.\n\n“After careful consideration, I have decided to step down as President and CEO of the World Economic Forum. My time here, spanning 8-1/2 years, has been profoundly rewarding,” Brende said in a statement, which made no mention of Epstein.\n\n“I am grateful for the incredible collaboration with my colleagues, partners, and constituents, and I believe now is the right moment for the Forum to continue its important work without distractions.”\n\nBrende’s departure came several weeks after the WEF, organiser of the annual Davos summit,⁠ launched an independent investigation into his relationship with Epstein, following revelations in the files that the Norwegian had three business dinners with the financier and had also communicated with him via email and text message.\n\nEpstein was convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008, spending about a year in prison before his release.\n\nHis contacts with a network of wealthy and influential figures continued in the wake of his conviction until an investigation into the wealthy financier was reopened in 2019. Epstein died by suicide in prison that year while facing charges of sex trafficking underage girls.\n\nDinners, emails\n\nBrende said in a statement earlier this month that during a visit to New York in 2018, he received an invitation from former Norwegian politician Terje Rod-Larsen to join him for dinner with several other leaders, plus “someone who was presented to me as an American investor, Jeffrey Epstein”.\n\n\n\n“The following year, I attended two similar dinners with Epstein, alongside other diplomats and business leaders. These dinners, and a few emails and SMS messages, were the extent of my interactions with him,” he said.\n\n“I was completely unaware of Epstein’s past and criminal activities.”\n\nHe said that had he known about Epstein’s background, he would have declined any contact with the convicted sex offender, adding that he regretted not having conducted a more thorough investigation into his past.\n\nInvestigation concluded\n\nIn a separate statement, Andre Hoffmann and Larry Fink, co-chairs of the WEF, said the independent review ⁠conducted by outside counsel into Brende’s ties with Epstein had concluded.\n\nThe findings stated there were no additional concerns beyond what had been previously disclosed, it ⁠added.\n\nThe co-chairs said the WEF’s Alois Zwinggi will serve ⁠as interim president and CEO, and that the forum’s board of trustees would oversee the leadership transition, including a plan to identify a permanent replacement.\n\nArrests and resignations\n\nEpstein had ties to a long list of business and political leaders, whose links to the disgraced figure have now come under close scrutiny, resulting in arrests and resignations.\n\nIn Norway, Thorbjorn Jagland, former prime minister and former secretary-general of the Council of Europe, has been charged with “aggravated corruption” amid an investigation into his connections to Epstein, while Rod-Larsen and his wife Mona Juul, both diplomats, have also been charged.\n\nCrown Princess Mette-Marit, the wife of Crown Prince Haakon, heir to Norway’s throne, has also come under heavy scrutiny following the revelation of her close friendship with Epstein, issuing a public apology for her long association with him.\n\nIn the UK, prominent figures including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor – formerly Prince Andrew – and Peter Mandelson, the former diplomat, minister, and adviser to multiple Labour Party prime ministers, have been arrested over alleged crimes linked to their relationships with Epstein.\n\nIn France, financial crimes prosecutors have opened an investigation into former Culture Minister Jack Lang, while in Slovakia, Miroslav Lajcak, former president of the UN General Assembly, resigned as security adviser to the country’s prime minister amid growing criticism over his correspondence with Epstein, uncovered in the files.\n\nA growing number of prominent business and academic figures have also left their posts after their ties to Epstein were revealed."

            "content": "Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThis is Lowpass by Janko Roettgers, a newsletter on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week.\n\nThese days, if you \n\nWeb data aggregator Bright Data has been pitching streaming service operators on an alternative approach for apps running on Samsung’s Tizen and LG’s webOS platform — one that comes without ads and sky-high fees. All publishers have to do to unlock a new revenue source is integrate the company’s Bright SDK into their TV apps and convince viewers to opt into Bright’s monetization network.\n\n“We don’t do any kind of tracking,” explained Bright Data’s chief product officer, Ariel Shulman, during a webinar for streaming industry insiders two years ago. “We work silently in the background, and completely anonymously. Users don’t actually see or don’t feel anything.”\n\nThe catch? With Bright’s SDK, a viewer’s smart TV becomes part of a massive global proxy network that crawls and scrapes the web. Including apps running on desktop PCs and mobile devices, the company claims to operate 150 million such residential proxies worldwide. Together, these devices gather petabytes of public web data from a wide range of different locations and IP addresses. This approach allows the company to capture localized versions of websites, but also helps to circumvent web crawler blacklists. The gathered data is then resold to companies to train AI models, among other things.\n\nHere’s how Bright’s smart TV partnerships work: When a consumer downloads and installs a participating app, they’ll see an opt-in screen asking them to confirm their willingness to participate in Bright’s proxy network. For instance, for an app called Petflix that was until recently available on the Roku app store, the note reads:\n\n“To enjoy Petflix for free with fewer ads, you are allowing Bright Data to occasionally use your device’s free resources and IP address to download public web data from the internet. Bright Data will only use your IP address for approved business-related use cases. None of your personal information is accessed or collected except your IP address. Period.”\n\n“Our network is based on consensual individual participation,” explains Bright Data spokesperson Jennifer Burns. “All users can opt-out at any time via a fast two-click process.”\n\nOnce a consumer opts in to Bright Data’s network, their smart TV starts downloading publicly available webpages as well as audio and video data, which is then forwarded to Bright’s cloud servers. The company claims to only do so when it doesn’t impact the device’s bandwidth or processing capacities, with Shulman saying that individual devices download only around 50MB of data per day. In reality, there is no way for a user to know whether the SDK downloads web data at any given moment.\n\nIn some cases, your smart TV may even crawl the web for Bright as soon as you turn it on. “On some operating systems, [...] our SDK is given permissions by the user to run in the background,” Shulman explained during his webinar. “This means that our monetization continues even if the app itself is not running.” All it takes for consumers is to run the app once and opt in to Bright’s network, and the device will keep crawling the web every day until they opt out again or uninstall the app.\n\nBright Data is not the only company operating such residential proxy networks. Some of its competitors have come under fire for unsavory business practices. Last month, Google took action against the IPIDEA network, which Google’s Threat Intelligence Group called “the world’s largest proxy network.” IPIDEA worked with a number of SDK providers to distribute its code in third-party apps, including on smart TVs.\n\nOnce devices were enrolled in its network, IPIDEA’s operators allegedly rented out those resources to hacking groups in China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia. “We [...] observe IPIDEA being leveraged by a vast array of espionage, crime, and information operations threat actors,” Google’s Threat Intelligence Group wrote in a January blog post.\n\nTo be clear: Google’s security researchers did not draw any connection whatsoever between IPIDEA and Bright Data, and Bright goes to great lengths to set itself apart from bad actors. “Our SDK, along with all of our technology, is reviewed by Apesteem, Google, McAfee, and more, and audited regularly, most recently by PwC,” says Burns. “Bright SDK implements rigorous partner selection criteria and vets every application through strict compliance processes.”\n\nThe company has nonetheless been impacted by a broader backlash against residential proxy activities. Google has adopted policies against proxy SDKs running in the background, and is now telling developers that they’re only allowed to use proxy services “in apps where that is the primary, user-facing core purpose of the app.” Amazon added a provision to its developer policies that outright bans “apps that facilitate proxy services to third parties.” Roku also bars developers from using Bright SDK and similar proxy services.\n\nAll those changes have made it more difficult to figure out how widespread the use of the SDK on smart TVs actually is. A few dozen Fire TV apps still mention the SDK on Amazon’s app store, but don’t appear to make use of it anymore. I was able to download a few apps from Roku’s store that were still using the SDK, including the aforementioned Petflix app. However, those apps disappeared from the store after I contacted Roku for this story.\n\nNew restrictions against proxy SDKs have had a direct impact on Bright’s addressable market in the smart TV space. The company used to pitch its solution to Roku, Android TV, and Fire TV app developers, but Burns tells me that it no longer supports these platforms. Bright does still list Samsung’s Tizen OS and LG’s webOS as supported smart TV platforms, and has published more than 200 first-party apps to LG’s app store alone. LG spokesperson Léa Lee tells me that Bright SDK is “not officially supported by LG, and their operation on the webOS platform is not guaranteed.” Samsung did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThere are arguably many legitimate use cases for web crawling. “Our network serves exclusively legitimate purposes, supporting journalists, non-profits, academic researchers, cybersecurity companies, and other leading businesses worldwide,” says Burns.\n\nThe problem is that consumers have no idea whether that legitimate purpose is something that aligns with their own personal values. Case in point: Bright Data does support a number of nonprofits, including some that use its proxy network to track hate speech on social media. However, the company also works with AMCHA Initiative. The group maintains an “anti-zionist faculty barometer” and includes student and faculty statements against Israel’s war in Gaza, as well as calls for schools to divest from the country, in its antisemitic incident tracker.\n\nWith AI companies facing scrutiny over their environmental impact, treatment of intellectual property, and potential to replace human labor, some consumers may also feel uneasy about their TVs gathering data to train AI models.\n\nNow, some consumers may decide that such concerns are overblown, and willingly opt in to Bright’s network if it means that they get to watch fewer ads or pay less for their streaming services. I, for one, would rather watch an extra ad break or two."

During an earnings call on Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery streaming head JB Perrette said a global expansion “will start in 2026,” as reported earlier by The Wrap.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery has ramped up its paid sharing initiative in the US over the past year, introducing “more aggressive” prompts in August that push people toward paying an extra $7.99 per month to add another user to their account. Now that HBO Max has launched in several European countries and Latin America, with rollouts planned in the UK, Ireland, and the Asia-Pacific, the streamer likely sees more opportunities to squeeze international subscribers sharing their memberships.\n\n“We are in the second inning of our password sharing enforcement,” Perrette said during the call. “It is just beginning to get scale.” HBO Max added 3.5 million subscribers across the globe during the last quarter of 2025, bringing its total to 131.6 million. Warner Bros. Discovery says it expects to reach 150 million subscribers by the end of this year."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\n160 Democratic lawmakers from across the country are backing a soon-to-be-introduced bill that would reverse the Trump administration’s decision to eliminate IRS Direct File. The Direct File Act, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA), would bring back the option to file taxes directly with the government for free.\n\nThe Biden administration first started testing the IRS Direct File system in select states during the 2024 tax season, and it even expanded the system to 25 states in 2025. But uncertainty surrounding IRS Direct File swirled after President Donald Trump came into office, until IRS head Billy Long confirmed that it’s “gone” last August. The IRS later notified states that Direct File is no longer available.\n\nAccording to Sen. Warren, TurboTax parent company Intuit donated more than $1 million to Trump’s inauguration and has lobbied heavily against the program. (Companies like TurboTax offer similar tax filing services, but for a fee.)\n\nUnder the Direct File Act, taxpayers would not only have the option to file their taxes directly to the IRS, but it would also ensure that the IRS doesn’t enter into agreements that “restrict its ability to provide free online tax preparation or filing services.” The IRS would have to enable “seamless integration” between state tax filing systems and Direct File, as well as publish annual reports on Direct File usage. Additionally, the bill would push the IRS to make Direct File available to at least 50 percent of taxpayers in participating states by the 2028 tax season.\n\nIRS Direct File isn’t to be confused with the agency’s Free File service, which allows taxpayers to file their taxes using one of its partners, such as TaxSlayer and FreeTaxUSA. TurboTax and H&R Block left the Free File Alliance after the IRS began prohibiting services from hiding free filing options.\n\n“Donald Trump canceled Direct File after giant tax prep companies spent millions lobbying to protect their profits,” Sen. Warren says in the press release. “We’re fighting to lower costs for families by bringing Direct File back and making it the law of the land.”"

Nano Banana 2 (also known as Gemini 3.1 Flash Image) is rolling out today across the Gemini app and other Google AI platforms, making knowledge and rendering features that were previously exclusive to Nano Banana Pro available for everyone. Google says the update aims to bring “high-speed intelligence of Gemini Flash to visual generation,” making complex images faster, cheaper, and easier to generate.\n\nLike Nano Banana Pro, the Nano Banana 2 model utilizes real-time information, web search images, and Gemini’s real-world knowledge base. Google DeepMind product manager Naina Raisinghani says that this provides more relevant data for creating infographics or diagrams, and allows Nano Banana 2 to render “specific subjects” more accurately, though examples of such subjects were not provided.\n\nOther features inherited from Nano Banana Pro include the ability to generate images with accurate, legible text, and localized translation. These capabilities previously required a paid subscription to Google AI Plus, Pro, or Ultra to access in Gemini, but now they’ll be expanded to free Gemini users and AI Mode in Google Search.\n\nThis AI “infographic” image example generated with Nano Banana 2 makes me nervous, but hey, at least the text is readable? Image: Google\n\nNano Banana 2 also provides more creative control over generated images compared to the original Nano Banana model. Google says that visual improvements include more vibrant lighting, richer textures, and sharper details, alongside the ability to adhere to complex image requests more strictly. The appearance of up to five characters and 14 objects can also be maintained more consistently in a single workflow, and users get “full control” over aspect ratios and image resolution, ranging from 512px up to 4K.\n\nThe new Nano Banana 2 model will replace the option for Nano Banana Pro across the Gemini app’s Fast, Thinking, and Pro generation modes. Google says AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will still be able to access Nano Banana Pro “for specialized tasks” by selecting the three-dot menu on images to regenerate them. The new model is also rolling out to AI Mode in Search, Google Lens, the Google app, and browsers for mobile and desktop, alongside being the new default image generation model in Google’s AI video tool, Flow."

It will be rolling out soon “across Europe,” starting with results for lodgings, with “flights and other services” following later.\n\nThis update could address one of the core issues the European Commission highlighted when it ruled last year that Google was in violation of the Digital Markets Act, which aims to rein in anticompetitive practices by leading tech companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft. Companies that fail to comply with DMA regulations can face fines of up to 10 percent of their annual revenue.\n\nGoogle initially pushed back against demands for it to rearrange search results, with Google’s head of competition, Oliver Bethell, claiming in a post on LinkedIn last year that early changes to search results forced European users to search longer and pay higher prices. However, Google could potentially face billions of dollars in fines if it doesn’t make adjustments to comply with the DMA."

As job search companies increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to sort through applications, job seekers wonder how to best position themselves with those filters in mind.\n\nWe decided to speak directly with job search leaders about how a resume should look when you’re thinking about AI optimization, and what works in a job applicant’s favor. The Verge senior AI reporter Hayden Field spoke to representatives from Indeed, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and Greenhouse, as well as Hilke Schellmann, author of The Algorithm. Their answers had a clear theme: Resume hacks won’t get you far with these AI systems.\n\nFor instance, a common technique is to take keywords from job postings and include them throughout the resume, also known as “keyword stuffing.” Often, the words may even be hidden in white font. Glassdoor’s chief economist, Daniel Zhao, says this might get you past an initial screen, but once it reaches a human review it may not get far.\n\n“I’ve actually seen myself as a hiring manager, an application came in from a candidate who had put a bunch of text in all white at the bottom of the resume, but the system actually highlighted it. And so it was very clear that this was not actually relevant to their skills or experience. I would say that if you’re using that to put information that is not actually applicable to your skills and experience, that’s gonna be really hard to explain to an employer.”\n\nVirtually everyone we spoke to echoed a similar sentiment: that adding a human touch to your job application is now more important than ever.\n\n“ Think about the fact that you are creating your resume for two different audiences, right? You’re creating it for an algorithm and you’re also creating it for a human,” says Priya Rathod, workplace trends editor at Indeed.\n\nWatch our video to learn more about how the current hiring landscape looks in the age of AI and what else the experts say about standing out."

            "content": "Meeting notetaker Read AI on Thursday launched an AI-powered email-based assistant called Ada, saying it helps users manage their schedules, answer questions based on a company’s knowledge base, and reply to out-of-office emails.\n\nThe company is calling Ada a “digital twin” that handles tasks for you around the clock. Read AI said that the assistant will be available to all users, and they can start configuring it by sending an email to “ada@read.ai” and writing “Get me started.”\n\nWhen you ask Ada to find a time to meet with someone, it replies to the other person in the thread with your availability. If the other person replies that they are unavailable at those times and would like a different time slot, Ada responds with new options. While Ada has access to your calendar through Read AI, it does not reveal the nature of those meetings with other people.\n\nAda can also answer questions using a company’s knowledge base, topics discussed in your prior meetings, and public internet searches. For instance, you can ask, “Ada , can you provide an update on how we are tracking for Q1 goals?” to get information.\n\nIf someone else asks a question in a thread, Ada will prepare a response for you and help you refine it before it is sent to the other person. The startup said that Ada doesn’t reveal any sensitive information without your permission.\n\nRead AI’s VP of Product, Justin Farris, said that the new feature doesn’t rely on MCPs (Model Context Protocols, a technical standard for connecting AI tools to external services), and instead builds a knowledge graph based on meeting data and connected services for more contextual answers. He added that over time, the assistant will also take proactive actions for you. For instance, if you mentioned a follow-up item in a meeting, Ada will ask you to set that up after the meeting with contextual data.\n\n“The way I describe our solution is that when you are bringing on a new employee, you train them. When you add Ada to your workflow and connect more services to give more context, it starts to ramp up and handle more tasks for you,” CEO David Shim told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

He mentioned that the company sees 50,000 sign-ups every day and has a broader base of 100,000 users who consume Read AI’s content, like meeting summaries, without creating an account.\n\nFor Read AI, the U.S. remains the largest market with strong international growth. While 60% of users are outside the U.S., the revenue is split roughly equally.\n\nThe company, which has raised over $81 million in funding, is increasingly adding AI-powered tools to its suite. Last year, it launched Search Copilot for knowledge discovery for users, and last month, it added the ability to update customer-service relationship software, send a custom emails from within a meeting report, and stay up to date on topics based on internal and web knowledge.\n\nOther meeting notetakers are also offering new tools to extract more insights and actions from meeting notes. Last September, Granola added “recipes” in the form of repeatable prompts to surface knowledge from meeting data. Quill, which came out of stealth with a $6.5 million funding round this week, also connects to various tools like Linear, Notion, and CRMs, and aims to automate tasks."

For users in the U.S., the profile guidance feature can be augmented with an AI photo feedback tool, which can “help you choose the best photos and show up as your most authentic self.”\n\nAccording to Bumble’s blog post explaining these features, it doesn’t seem like the insights from these AI tools are particularly groundbreaking — for example, Bumble says that its AI photo tool might encourage you to ditch photos where you’re wearing sunglasses that cover your face, and add a wider variety of photos, like ones taken outdoors or with friends. It’s advice you could’ve easily gotten from a friend ten years ago, but it’s still new information to many users.\n\nIn Canada, Bumble is testing another, non-AI feature called “Suggest a Date.” When a conversation stalls, a user can signal that they are open to meeting in person, which the company says is “a simple way to signal that they’re ready to connect offline.”\n\nOf course, another way for people to “signal that they’re ready to connect offline” is to literally ask someone on a date. But realistically, it doesn’t seem like users are taking the plunge, so having an in-app way to indicate interest may motivate some potential couples to move their conversation IRL.\n\n“With Suggest a Date, we’re creating a clear expression of intent and giving members a way to bypass the traditional back-and-forth and move toward meeting in real life,” Bumble CTO Vivek Sagi said in a statement. “When we reduce friction at the moments that matter most, we help people connect with clarity and confidence, and increase the likelihood of meaningful relationships forming offline.”\n\nBumble and other popular dating apps, like Match Group’s Tinder and Hinge, have all embraced AI-powered features in recent months. For instance, in December, Hinge introduced a tool to help generate more interesting conversation starters than “How are you?”\n\nTinder may take things a step further. In Australia, Tinder is piloting a tool called Chemistry, which asks users to provide the app with access to their camera roll, which is a concerning amount of data to feed into an AI tool. Based on a user’s camera roll and answers to a series of questions, the AI can learn more about someone’s interests and personality to supposedly reduce “swipe fatigue” and suggest better matches.\n\nMeta’s Facebook Dating tool does something similar — in October, it launched a feature that asks to use its AI on your camera roll that you haven’t yet shared in order to suggest AI edits.\n\nAs these companies try to come up with new ways to keep users happy, some young people have thrown in the towel on online dating altogether, instead seeking more real-world experiences that are not intermediated by an app."

            "content": "Walmart has agreed to pay $100 million to settle a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over deceptive pay practices within its Spark Driver service, which uses gig workers to deliver online orders from local stores to customers. The retailer was accused of misleading drivers about their potential base pay and tip amounts, and then deceived customers by saying that 100% of tips went to the drivers, when they did not.\n\nIn its original complaint, the FTC was joined by Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin. The lawsuit alleged that Walmart, since 2021, had made false representations about Spark driver earnings.\n\nAmong these, Walmart was accused of frequently splitting a customer’s order between drivers, which would lead to splitting the tip. Meanwhile, customers were told their driver — as in one single driver — would get the full tip. In batch orders, Walmart would remove tips from some of the orders without informing the driver. Walmart also promised tips to drivers in advance of taking orders, but then failed to collect a tip from the customer, leaving the driver without a tip entirely.\n\nOther issues had to do with reductions Walmart made to drivers’ base pay after they had accepted an offer or other misrepresented incentives that could have provided drivers with extra cash.\n\nWalmart also told customers that drivers would get 100% of their tips, but that wasn’t always true.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that these practices caused drivers to lose millions of dollars they were promised and generated thousands of consumer complaints.\n\nAs a result of the settlement, Walmart will have to implement an earnings verification program to ensure drivers are paid the promised earnings and tips. It’s also prohibited from adjusting the base pay, incentives, or tips after the initial offer, except if the driver fails to provide the service or a customer cancels. Walmart has been banned from misrepresenting earnings in future driver offers, as well.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "Einride has secured an oversubscribed $113 million PIPE (private investment in public equity) ahead of its public debut that’s expected for the first half of 2026.\n\nThe Swedish startup is most well-known for building both electric trucks and autonomous pods that are designed to carry freight with no room for a human driver. Einride announced its plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, Legato Merger Corp., last November.\n\nThe deal values Einride at a pre-money valuation of $1.35 billion — down from the $1.8 billion figure initially attached to the SPAC deal. Despite a drop in valuation, there’s still clearly investor appetite for the firm. The PIPE exceeded the company’s earlier target of up to $100 million.\n\nEinride’s PIPE comes from new and existing investors, including a global asset management company based on the West Coast of the United States, and Stockholm-based EQT Ventures.\n\nIn total, Einride has secured around $213 million tied to this transaction, including $100 million previously announced crossover financing.\n\nThe SPAC, which will see Einride trading on the New York Stock Exchange, had been expected to deliver roughly $220 million from Legato’s trust account. With the addition of the $113 million PIPE, the companies now project total gross proceeds of about $333 million before redemptions and expenses. Though they say they may seek additional capital before closing.\n\nThe proceeds will support Einride’s technology roadmap, global expansion, and autonomous deployments in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\nOutside of Sweden, Einride operates a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE for companies like Heineken, PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has also done limited deployments of its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers including Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the U.S.\n\nEinride is not the first autonomous vehicle company to have pursued a SPAC merger in recent years for additional funding. Aurora Innovation went public via a SPAC merger valued at $13 billion in 2021 and has since launched a commercial self-driving trucks operation (with a human observer on board). Kodiak AI also took the SPAC road to the public market in 2025."

Some of the affected organizations are said to be critical infrastructure. The company did not provide specifics, but “critical infrastructure” can refer to everything from power grids and water supply to the transportation sector.\n\nSeveral governments, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, warned in an alert that threat actors are targeting organizations “globally.”\n\nU.S. cybersecurity agency CISA ordered all civilian federal agencies to patch their systems by end-of-day Friday, citing an imminent threat and unacceptable risk to the federal government. The federal cybersecurity agency, which is currently running at reduced capacity due to a partial government shutdown, said it was aware of ongoing exploitation.\n\nNeither Cisco nor the governments attributed the attacks to a specific threat group or nation state, if known, but tracked one cluster of activity as UAT-8616.\n\nIn December, Cisco warned of a similarly rated 10.0 vulnerability in the Async software that runs most of its products, which was being actively used to hack into its customer networks."

            "content": "A group of notable open source programmers are joining with a VC investor to launch a nonprofit called the Open Source Endowment in hopes of permanently solving the perennial issue with developing open source software: funding.\n\nBackers of the Open Source Endowment include Thomas Dohmke (the former GitHub CEO who raised a record $60 million for his dev tool startup Entire); Mitchell Hashimoto (founder of HashiCorp, which sold to IBM for $6.4 billion last year); Supabase founder and CEO Paul Copplestone; an NGINX co-founder; the creators of Vue.js and cURL; plus execs from Elastic, Spotify, and others. All told, the project has over 50 donors so far.\n\nThe nonprofit, which just achieved formal 501(c)(3) status, has currently raised more than $750,000 in commitments. But if things go according to the plan of its founder, Konstantin Vinogradov, it will have $100 million in assets within seven years.\n\nVinogradov is a venture investor specializing in open source, AI, and infrastructure software, and was previously a general partner at Runa Capital. As such, he has “some experience with university endowments,” which are some of the largest investors in venture capital funds, he told TechCrunch.\n\nVinogradov says as he scoured the world for open source projects, one complaint kept popping up: “There is no source of sustainable funding for open source maintainers. And that’s a really big problem.” (“Maintainer” refers to the developers who work on open source projects, such as debugging, choosing and verifying features submitted by the community, or programming new features themselves.)\n\nThe endowment will support projects based on criteria such as its number of users, or how many other projects rely on that specific software to operate. It will also choose projects that are not already well-supported by grants, donations, or umbrella organizations such as Linux’s Alpha-Omega. Vinogradov has already assembled a board for the nonprofit.\n\nCash strapped, burned out\n\nThe lack of money in open source is hardly new. Open source software is typically given away, and since the community often contributes time and efforts freely, up to 86% of open source developers are not paid for their work.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nThis isn’t much of a problem for hobbyists or for professional developers paid by their companies to maintain projects, but such a system stands on shaky ground. Open source software is the bedrock upon which the internet stands, and virtually every large company uses open source tools in some way. In fact, open source software accounts for up to 55% of the tech stack in organizations, and is present in everything from databases to operating systems.\n\nWhile it is certainly possible for open source developers to commercialize their free projects to gain wealth beyond their wildest dreams, the odds, to misquote the Hunger Games, are not in their favor.\n\nThere is, and has been for decades, a core of developers who volunteer their time and efforts for free to manage popular, important, and critical projects. And many of them are burned out.\n\nThis issue came into the public’s consciousness briefly in 2014, with the OpenSSL Heartbleed disaster, where a bug was found in an open source security project, used by most of the internet, that was maintained by a single developer.\n\nThere have been many attempts to fix the funding situation over the years. Some projects take donations from corporate sponsors. For instance, The Linux Foundation, which brought in about $300 million last year largely from corporate sponsors, doles out grants to select projects through its Alpha-Omega Project. In 2025, Alpha-Omega issued $5.8 million to 14 projects, it said.\n\nSome projects take donations directly from corporate donors. In January, for instance, Anthropic donated $1.5 million to the Python Software Foundation. While the Foundation said it was thrilled to have that cash, Anthropic itself raised $30 billion this month. Such a donation is couch-change to the AI lab.\n\nStill, not every developer wants to take corporate donations, as there are worries of granting too much influence to donor companies. For instance, there was a big hubbub last year in the Ruby community surrounding some long-time maintainers leaving and its big sponsor Spotify, The Register reported.\n\nThe Open Source Endowment hopes to support projects while displacing such risks.\n\n“The only way to support open source sustainably is private funds,” says Vinogradov.\n\nWhy hasn’t an endowment been tried before? Endowments require patience, Vinogradov says. They invest many of their assets, spending only a fraction of their income in any given year, and require years or even decades to grow to a meaningful size.\n\nBut if done right, that patience will result in an independent fund that could support critical open source projects forever."

In November, the company released Nano Banana Pro, which allows users to create more detailed and high-quality images.\n\nThe new Nano Banana 2 retains some of the high-fidelity characteristics of the Pro model but produces images faster. The company says you can create images with a resolution ranging from 512px to 4K, in different aspect ratios.\n\nImage Credits: Google\n\nNano Banana 2 can maintain character consistency for up to five characters and fidelity of up to 14 objects in one workflow for better storytelling. Users can also issue complex requests with detailed nuances for image generation, Google says. In addition, users can create media with more vibrant lighting, richer textures, and sharper detail.\n\nImage Credits: Google Image Credits:Google\n\nWith the launch, Nano Banana 2 will become the default model for image generation across all apps in the Gemini app. The company is also making it the default model for image generation in its video editing tool, Flow.\n\nIn Search, Nano Banana 2 will become the default for Google Search results via Google Lens and in AI Mode across 141 countries on the Google app and on the web across desktop and mobile.\n\nOn Google’s higher-end plans, Google AI Pro and Ultra, subscribers can continue use Nano Banana Pro for specialized tasks by regenerating images via the three-dot menu.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

It has not indicated how many researchers it will hire.\n\n“The UK brings together world-class talent and leading scientific institutions and universities, making it an ideal place to deliver the important research which will ensure our AI is safe, useful, and benefits everyone,” said Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI, in a statement.\n\nThe plans bring OpenAI into direct competition for top research talent with Google DeepMind, the AI lab run by British researcher Demis Hassabis, which is headquartered in London. DeepMind has long-running partnerships with Oxford University and the University of Cambridge, where it sponsors professorships, funds research, and works alongside researchers.\n\nGot a Tip?

Here are a few other items that we like.\n\nCourtesy of REI\n\nHestra Fall Line 3-Finger Gloves for $190: I've long admired Hestra gloves from across the lift line, impressed by the Swedish company's elegant stitchwork and thoughtful design touches. This was the year I finally got to try a pair for myself, and the Fall Line are exactly what they look like. There are six sizes available so you can get the perfect fit in this glove. The cowhide is buttery smooth and has already broken in a bit with five days' use. The wrist strap means you never have to fret about dropping your glove from the lift when checking your phone, and they're very warm without making me sweat. If you do sweat, the lining is removable so you can wash it without damaging the leather. —Martin Cizmar\n\nCourtesy of Crab Grab\n\nCrab Grab Snuggler Mitts for $89: These mini sleeping bags for your fingers are packed full of Primaloft insulation and benefitting from a sherpa fleece lining, they are toasty warm, and with a 15K membrane, impressively waterproof too. All-season mittens with durable construction for under $100? Yes Please!\n\nCourtesy of Mons Royale\n\nMons Royale Yotei Merino Classic Long Sleeve for $98: As I type this, I’m nowhere near a mountain, but I’m still wearing the Mons Royale Yotei long sleeve top. It is ridiculously comfortable, made from 190-gsm-weight, 100 percent merino wool, and has a mercifully relaxed cut, so I remain warm, but don’t feel like a sausage. On the mountain however, the merino wool works its magic, wicking away sweat—especially on a hike up to some fresh powder—and keeping me comfortable. Paired with a shell and the Patagonia R1 Thermal Hoodie, I’m warm enough during a bitter arctic blast.\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket and Bib Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket for $498 and Bib for $398: Seniq is another all-women’s outdoor brand that launched in 2024. It's styled a little more Gen Z, leaning into fun color blocking over the monochromatic look. The Seniq Powder Puff Down Jacket has a dry-touch finish. It’s meant for drier days on the mountain, but a PFC-free DWR coating and YKK AquaGuard zippers do provide water resistance. The asymmetric front zipper helps you avoid chin rub when you have the jacket fully zipped. It also features cool asymmetrical quilting lines, side pockets-in-pockets that provide access to your bib (their bibs have a pocket on the front, so you can get in there without unzipping your jacket), an oversized removable hood, a forearm pass pocket, soft and stretchy wrist gaiters, and a large internal pocket that can absolutely handle a sandwich. This jacket was warm, pillowy, and comforting, like a super-soft hug.\n\nThe silky shell bibs are slightly barrel cut, which gives them a flattering shape without being fitted. The adjustable racer back-style straps and low back (with a stretchy waist) also provide a nice shape and breathability. There are two pockets on the front chest, pockets on either leg, two-way zip thigh vents, and a butt zipper for bathroom breaks. These fit easily over my boots, and the instep guards were a nice touch. With a durable three-layer membrane and a 20,000-mm waterproof rating, these will hold up against any and all weather the mountain throws at you. When I wore them on a wet snowy day, they beaded and sloughed off moisture well. —Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket for $259: This puffy hoodie is a great mid-layer for under a shell jacket. The insulation is made from recycled rope scraps, and the outer is coated in wind-resistant PFC-free DWR coating. The hem falls at the hips, and the high collar and tight hood keep most of the face covered. I like wearing this piece under shells for snowboarding, but I know it’ll pull double duty as a comfy hiking and camping jacket, too, so it’s a solid multipurpose investment. It’s exceptionally lightweight and warm, though from a volume standpoint, it is on the bulkier side for a mid-layer and isn’t the most packable piece. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Evolved Air Half Zip for $112: This fleece pullover has a waffle-like texture that traps heat and wicks moisture. With a high zippered collar and cinchable hem, you can adjust the fit to make it more air-tight or breathable. This mid-layer felt wonderfully lightweight while still keeping my toasty. It’s not bulky at all, only a little thicker than a base layer, laid comfortably under my jackets, and moved with me on the mountain. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Lifa Base Layer Long-Sleeve Crew for $115 and Pants for $115: These base layers hit the weight sweet spot; they’re not too thick or thin, but just right. They’re slightly looser than other options on this list, so if you prefer something that isn’t so fitted, these are a great pick (but note that they run long too). These combine merino wool with Helly Hansen’s LIFA fibers, which add more moisture-wicking capabilities. They’re soft, lightweight, warm, and don’t hold onto smells. I love the cute designs and how well they regulate my temperature under insulated jackets and pants. The waist digs in a bit but doesn’t roll, and they stay in place and move well. —Kristin Canning\n\nHow to Layer AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We have a full guide on how to layer, but here are your essentials. Base layer: A good set of thermals is essential in the fight against cold, especially when you’re working hard. The best fabrics wick away sweat as you heat up, which helps regulate your temperature. Merino wool is the best at this, but also the most expensive. Synthetic fabrics are getting better, though, and please avoid cotton at all costs, as it gets wet and stays that way, making you cold and uncomfortable. Mid layer: Whether you choose a hooded fleece or puffer-style jacket, this layer does the bulk of the work in cold conditions. Combined with the base layer, it traps warm air in, while also allowing moisture to be expelled. Synthetic insulation such as Primaloft Gold is brilliant and doesn’t lose its properties if it gets wet. Down jackets offer the best warmth-to-weight ratio, but they don’t pack down as small, and should never get wet. A fleece with an insulated vest is a great option if you really feel the cold. Jacket: While ski jackets with insulation offer bonus warmth in Arctic-like conditions, for most people a waterproof shell will be enough, as it offers protection from both the snow and the wind. A cold wind will chill you to your bones faster than a bit of wet snow. Ideally choose a jacket with a waterproof membrane such as Gore-Tex (make sure it is free from PFAS, or forever chemicals), but also check for taped seams for added waterproofing, plus plenty of pockets for snacks and lift passes, and wrist cuffs and ski skirts to help keep out the snow. Socks: As with your base layer, socks keep you warm and maintain your temperature when you’re building up a sweat. Natural fabrics work well, but a blend of merino wool with synthetic stretchy fibers is the way to go, as they stay up better and can be used for more than a day. Avoid cotton again, and never wear two pairs, as you’ll almost certainly get colder feet. Gloves: You’ll be surprised by how wet ski gloves get when it’s snowing, even if you don’t fall very often. As a result, waterproof options work best in most cases, although well-made leather designs can be almost as waterproof as a pair with Gore-Tex. Mittens are generally warmer than gloves, but what you gain in toasty fingers you lose in dexterity. Check out our Best Ski Gloves and Mittens guide for more information. Waterproofing and breathability ratings: Waterproofing is measured with a hydrostatic head rating, or HH. That means if you put a 1-inch, endlessly long square tube on top of the fabric, you could pour 20,000 millimeters of water before it would seep through. Breathability is rated in how many grams of vapor per square meter can can pass through the fabric in 24 hours. How We Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I've been reviewing winter sports gear for more than 15 years. In that time, I have worn an untold number of jackets, pants, mid-layers, thermals, gloves, and mittens. I called on industry experts and professional skiers, and solicited opinions from fellow winter sport enthusiasts on the WIRED team. While a basic fit check can be done in the office, nothing replaces on-mountain testing in variable conditions. We put in the time on various trips to the French Alps, as well as in resorts in Vermont, Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "The first time Alesandra Madison’s husband incorporated AI into their relationship was in late 2024.\n\nShe’d forgotten to do her “nightly kneeling ritual,” and he asked ChatGPT how to properly discipline her. The large language model suggested “a two-in-one punishment,” she says—write 100 lines of “I will remember to kneel for my Dom every night” while kneeling the entire time.\n\nThough the couple started exploring kink in their marriage 15 years ago—they are in a dominant-submissive relationship—the AI-generated punishment was new territory for them.\n\nSince then, Madison, who is 44 and lives in Los Angeles, says she has come to think of AI as “a powerful enhancement tool” for kink. “A lot of the times in dom-sub dynamics, when the submissive misbehaves—if it’s consented to—you will have a punishment. You want something specific to fit the crime, basically. It’s like a fresh set of eyes on your relationship.”\n\nAI represents a unique evolution in how power is distributed for people into bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism—BDSM. The lifestyle structure, as everyone WIRED spoke to for this story noted, is grounded in the core tenets of consent, safety, communication, and trust. But for those dealing with trust issues, or who simply want a nonjudgmental space to ask questions about BDSM, AI is becoming an increasingly appealing option.\n\n“I’ve gotten value out of AI helping me understand myself better as a submissive. I sometimes ask it questions or describe something that feels confusing to me and ask it to help me understand,” one user posted in the r/SubSanctuary subreddit, where discussions involve topics like impact play, the feeling of “being owned,” and how to move on when the relationship has reached its end. Madison says there are different reasons why AI doms appeal to certain subs. They are always available, easily customizable—“You can make them playful or sadistic,” she noted in a video—and there is low risk to exploring for newbies.\n\nBut not everyone is on board. In the same subreddit, AI doms were blasted for being “hollow entertainment,” “dangerous,” and “dystopian.” “It can feel like a checklist,” says San Francisco–based sex educator Amp Somers, who is 36 and switches between dom and sub roles, of the demands an AI dom gives out.\n\nAs debates swirl and intensify, the marketplace has gone boom. Joi AI is one of the many services—along with Character.AI, Replika, and Soulmaite—that let users create and customize chatbots for BDSM role-play. According to the company, which bills itself as an “AI-lationships” platform, and an antidote to dating apps, its “user base has grown five times in 2025 compared to 2024.” Several sex workers, including Alix Lynx and Jenna Starr, have licensed their likeness to Joi (the company declined to share exact user numbers). Developers are also sprinting to create applications for role-play chatbots that are “not just erotic content spam, but something focused on immersive, intelligent conversation with a dominant persona.” Even Oxy shop, an online BDSM gear retailer for sub men who like to wear chastity cages, has started to offer an AI-driven “BDSM chat” for members, which allows them to indulge in all sorts of dominatrix fantasies; “Surrender to Mandy” or “Submit to Mike,” the page advertises.\n\nWatching porn can be a passive experience, but “an AI chatbot allows people a forum to talk about, express, and articulate their sexual fantasies,” says Carolina Bandinelli, an associate professor at the University of Warwick whose research focuses on the digital culture of love. “The idea that you can program your domination exactly the way you want. That is one of the fantasies underpinning the relationship between humans and AI—the fact that we can shape and model our partner.”"

            "content": "You might think you’ve got enough headphones. Most of us have accrued at least two or three pairs over the years, and might have a few more half-working pairs stuck in a drawer somewhere. But I’m here to tell you, if you haven’t fully explored the fabulous world of specialized headphones that has exploded in the past decade, from open earbuds to sports and travel cans, you’re not maximizing your sonic potential. The best headphones are now so varied that they often depend entirely on what you intend to use them for. That means the best headphones for you probably come in many shapes and sizes, and you might actually want more than one pair.\n\nBalling out on lots of headphones for every one of life's situations doesn’t necessarily mean spending a lot of money. Unless you’re successfully riding the “boomcession,” there’s a fair chance spare cash is tight right now. Luckily, there’s a veritable explosion of impressive budget brands making great stuff, alongside household brands pitching to the cheap seats.\n\nAs an audio reviewer for well over a decade, I’ve tried hundreds of models across every color in the headphone rainbow. Here’s how to shop right so you can get the most out of any and all of them, as well as the best headphones I can think of in every category right now.\n\nNoise-Canceling Earbuds: The 2026 Baseline\n\nLet's start with the modern one-and-done choice: Noise-canceling earbuds are the ultimate jack-of-all-trades. If you only want to own one pair, this is it. The best noise-canceling earbuds sound great, fit neatly in your pocket, and are equally adept at letting in or blocking out environmental sounds to adapt to any situation.\n\nIt’s probably no surprise that the wildly popular AirPods Pro are the best headphones for iPhone owners, thanks to impressive performance, loads of features, and seamless integration with all things Apple. They’re a massive step up from the standard AirPods, which offer similar Apple-friendly features and a touch of noise canceling, but don’t perform nearly as well as even most budget earbuds.\n\nBose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor more phone-agnostic options, Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 are the ultimate noise killers, while Sony’s new WF-1000XM6 offer great sound and utterly natural transparency mode. Technics' EAH AZ100 are among my favorites for sound quality.\n\nIf those are too pricey, fear not! Budget earbud options are varied and plentiful, from Android-optimized midrangers like the Google Pixel Buds 2a to the stylish Nothing Ear (a) or highly affordable Soundcore Space A40. If you’re keeping to one pair, I’d put in all your chips for better performance, but there’s no shortage of great affordable options, and new pairs at all prices keep rolling in.\n\nNoise-Canceling Over-Ears: Comfort Meets Performance\n\nAnyone who’s taken a long flight can probably relate to the fact that sticking something in your ears for five hours-plus isn’t an exercise in comfort. Enter travel headphones like the best noise-canceling over-ears, which have adapted from early models like Bose’s stalwart QC 25 to become among the most advanced and downright luxurious audio products for your money. They’re great for other tasks too, from working in a busy office to commuting or simply chilling at home in tranquil reverie.\n\nAirPods Max Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nThe latest and greatest, like Sony’s WH-1000XM6 and Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra, apply uncompromising noise cancellation, plush comfort for long listening, and a pile of advanced features like pausing when you speak or automatic sleeping and waking. The Ultra are my favorite for sheer comfort, but there are plenty of rivals like Sonos’ equally comfy Ace, the iconic (and heavy) AirPods Max, or the utterly immersive B&W Px7 S3. Cheaper options abound, but some of my favorites include Sony’s high-punching WH-CH720, the crazy-affordable Soundcore Life Q30, or its newer cousin, the Space One. These won’t bring the same level of performance or tranquility, but they still work great for long flights and beyond.\n\nOpen Earbuds: For Keeping Alert\n\nHere’s where things get really fun: Open earbuds have exploded faster than any other audio segment in recent memory, with a kaleidoscope of options from virtually every audio brand. Designed to keep your ears open while delivering satisfying sound, the best open earbuds aren’t ideal for everything you do, but they're fantastic for specialized activities like ebike riding, where wind resistance renders artificial transparency modes useless. Over time, I've found tons of other cool use cases, from walking the dog to sneaking in some Olympics at the bar.\n\nOpen Earbuds come in various design types, from wacky bone-conductors to wraparound models and—my personal favorite—clip-ons. Their light and ergonomic housings aim to essentially disappear on your ears for all-day listening, and it works better than you might think.\n\nYou could spend a lot on pairs like Bose’s excellent Open Ultra, but you really don’t have to, since even the best models are limited in performance. Soundcore’s Aeroclip are my favorite value-to-performance pair, but plenty of cheaper options get the job done, like Acefast’s nearly free Acefit Air or Soundpeat’s Pearclip Pro. Open earbuds are easily my favorite new audio trend.\n\nWorkout Headphones: Keep Moving\n\nThere’s an obvious Venn diagram overlap between open earbuds and workout headphones, but if you don’t like the idea of keeping your ears open, traditional sports models are a great alternative. My favorite is the revamped Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, which offer tons of features in a wraparound design that’s nearly unshakeable. I like that they’re optimized for Apple devices, but still work well for Android, and they come with great noise canceling and transparency mode, but also a high price.\n\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nLike open earbuds, there are plenty of cheap options, including the similarly unshakeable (but much more basic) Jlab Go Air Sport, which run a mere $30 or less on sale. If you’re not into the minimalist thing, WIRED editor Adrienne So swears by the BlueAnt Pump X over-ear headphones for weightlifting, in large part due to their cooling-gel earpads that go in the fridge overnight to keep sweat at bay. They’ve also got noise canceling and plenty of battery life at over 50 hours per charge. For jogging or cycling, open earbuds are likely a better fit, while some folks simply use the AirPods Pro, but it can be nice to just have a dedicated pair in your gym bag.\n\nWired Headphones: Plug It In\n\nCourtesy of Shure Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Shure SE-112GR $69 Amazon $69 Adorama\n\nThe youth delight in resurrecting old tech that the more seasoned among us have long left for dead (cassette tapes?!). In the case of wired headphones, there’s good reason to plug in, starting with improved performance for your dollars. If you’re a content creator, musician, or simply a cash-savvy sound connoisseur, you can get an impressive return from wired options that avoid the sound degradation of many wireless options.\n\nSome of our favorite affordable options include affordable and classic-looking earbuds like Shure’s iconic SE-112 and Sennheiser’s impressive IE200, and studio-friendly over-ears like Audio-Technica’s ATH-M20x, If you’re willing to spend a bit more, the fantastic Sennheiser HD6XX offer the best sound for the money I’ve heard in any headphone segment. Based on the much pricier HD 650, these are open-back headphones that let in exterior sounds, but the performance is incredible. If you want even better sound and design, there are tons of options, but they’ll cost you.\n\nFancy Headphones: The Audiophile Angle\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nCourtesy of Grado Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Grado Signature S750 $1,675 Grado\n\nIf you really want to optimize the wired connection, there’s a whole segment of audiophile headphones made with high-quality materials, innovative speaker technologies, elevated designs, and accordingly elevated pricing. There are a whole bunch of varieties, but for the sake of levity I’ll break them down into two categories: in-ear monitors (IEMs), the fancy version of in-ear headphones, and over-ears.\n\nIEMs generally use dynamic drivers, the traditional driver type in most headphones and speakers, balanced armatures, much smaller and more accurate speakers, or a mix of both. My favorite pairs come from Ultimate Ears, like the UE 18+ Pro, which are customized for your ears using 3D printing and other techniques. (You’ve likely seen these on TV for musicians and broadcasters.) Other IEMs we like include Sennheiser’s IE 900 and models from Campfire Audio.\n\nMeze Poet Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor over-ear headphones, Audeze’s planar magnetic headphones are among my favorites, starting as low as $500 (yeah, I know) in the excellent LCD-S20 closed-back headphones. Another incredible pair I recently tested are Meze’s Poet, which are not only the most gorgeous-looking pair I’ve reviewed, but also offer among the clearest and most articulate sound I’ve laid ears on. There are dozens more to try, as audiophilia is its own journey, but this is a good starting point. We recently reviewed the Grado Signature S750, which have an effortlessly expansive sound that feels like it can't possibly be coming from mere centimeters away from your eardrums.\n\nOther Headphone Types and Upcoming Features\n\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\n\nCourtesy of Best Buy Save to wishlist Save to wishlist SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3P Wireless $110 Amazon $110 Best Buy\n\nAs I’m sure some of you have already noted, there are still more types of specialty headphones, including Gaming Headsets, which are another animal altogether, and even TV Headphones, which quickly transition from the screen's internal speakers to let you listen in silence without latency. I’m currently testing a new TV headphones bundle from Sennheiser, the RS 275, which includes a dedicated pair of headphones in the HDR 275 and Sennheiser’s new BTA1 Auracast transmitter (verdict to come).\n\nSpeaking of Auracast, it’s an increasingly cool new type of Bluetooth protocol that allows connection of an infinite number of devices at up to 100 meters, like an FM radio signal. Its implementation is still in its early stages, but it’s a good feature to look for in new headphones. Other features to consider include an app with an EQ and presets (which the majority of my recommendations include), multipoint pairing to connect to two or more devices at once (again, pretty ubiquitous), and spatial audio features for video formats like Dolby Atmos."

            "content": "Things Fall Apart Rolling out this week, WIRED’s journalistic commissions on technological decommissions—from broken-down electric cars to falling-down space stations.\n\nAccording to the TOP500, which ranks these mega-machines, Sierra was once the second-fastest supercomputer in the world. She was conceived in a Chicago hotel conference room more than a decade ago, at a technical discussion for officials from America’s national labs. The ultimate designer baby, Sierra was assembled from thousands of IBM Power9 CPUs and Nvidia Volta V100 GPUs—a daring, offbeat architecture for Livermore at the time.\n\nLike other supercomputers, Sierra was girthy. She was composed of thousands of compute nodes, stored one on top of another in racks—basically cabinets—that held up her processing innards. She had 240 of these racks, spread across roughly 7,000 square feet. All of this was needed to support her life’s main occupation: performing specialized, super-high-security simulations for the National Nuclear Security Administration. At the time of her death sentence, her processing power ranked a still-respectable 23rd in the world.\n\nNow, why did Sierra have to die? After all, an enormous amount of time and resources went into Frankensteining her together. The leadership of the lab won’t confirm how much she cost to build, but she was expensive—the government spent at least $325 million on her and her fraternal twin, a supercomputer called Summit at the Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee. (Summit was decommissioned in late 2024.) Also, she still totally worked. “At the end of the life of a machine, you could think, Oh, we have all these sunk costs. You should just keep running the machine forever,” says John Allen, the lab’s organizational information security officer. But that’s wrong. “Its good and faithful service is over, and we have to move on.”"

            "content": "Once the most talked-about TV show in the country, South Park, is on Paramount+. Don’t you want to know what got Trump in such a tizzy?\n\nStream the much buzzed-about South Park, fan-favorite Yellowstone, original series MobLand, and rebooted crime drama Dexter & Dexter on Paramount+. The streaming network has a bingeable TV series for almost everyone. And whether you want to remember Lindsay Lohan’s old face in the classic Mean Girls flick, or wonder just how many more sequels Tom Cruise has left in him with Top Gun: Maverick, there’s a bevy of films to stream, too.\n\nIf you’re like me and have at least half a dozen streaming services, our Paramount+ coupon codes can help you save so you can watch the content you want without having to get rid of one of your other beloved content platforms. (I love pretending the world isn’t full of suffering around me and instead focus on Sylvester Stallone’s ever-changing Play-Doh face in Tulsa King.)\n\nTry Paramount+ Free With a One-Week Trial\n\nIf you’re unsure if you’ll actually want to commit to Paramount+, or if there’s a sports event like March Madness games and you only need to access the content for a little while, Paramount+’s free trial is a great option. The trial lasts one week, is for new subscribers only, and can’t be paired with other offers.\n\nThere are tiered plans, including Essential, which allows for 3 devices, select Showtime series, NFL games, and can be streamed on up to 3 devices at once, but has ads; and Premium, which includes all that except there are no ads, downloadable content, CBS live, and all of Showtime content.\n\nFind the Right Paramount+ Plan Pricing and Get the Latest Deals\n\nIt’s important that you choose the right Paramount+ streaming plan for you so that you can get the best bang for your buck. Lucky for you, all plans come with a 7-day free trial so you can make sure you’re choosing the right plan for you. The first is Paramount+ Essential, which is $8 per month. It has ads included, but you’ll have access to over 40,000 episodes and movies. And you’ll be able to stream on 3 devices at once, be able to watch NFL games on CBS and UEFA Champions League, and select Showtime series are also available. Paramount+ Premium is the next tier (and the most popular choice), which starts at $13 per month (after the free trial ends), and you’ll get everything mentioned in the previous tier, without ads. You’ll have all that as well as the ability to watch in 4K UHD, Dolby Vision or HDR10, downloadable movies and shows, streaming CBS live and all of Showtime’s content library.\n\nCan You Cancel Paramount Plus at any Time?\n\nIf you find the service isn’t right for you, or just need to cut down on subscriptions, you can cancel Paramount+ any time. However, the cancellation process depends on where you signed up. If you signed up directly on the website, you’ll need to go to your account page.\n\nSave on a Paramount+ Subscription With Student and Military Discounts\n\nIf you’re a student now (or have your student ID lying around somewhere), you can get a Paramount+ plan at only $4 a month. All you have to do is verify your student status and you’ll get 50% off any plan of your choosing for the first year. Or if you’re a military member, Paramount+ gives 50% off any subscription for life.\n\nWatch Paramount+ Originals and Fan Favorites\n\nThere’s truly something for everyone in the family, with movies, kids’ shows, and Paramount+ originals included in every plan. If you’re feeling spooky, I’d recommend Dexter: Resurrection, or Yellowjackets, but if you’re looking for something more family-friendly, there’s super popular cartoons like Rango or Sonic the Hedgehog to choose from.\n\nLooking for specific recommendations? I’ve got you. There are tons of great new releases coming to Paramount+ this month, including Landman season 2, new Paramount+ original comedy series Crutch starring Tracy Morgan, and new episodes of (my favorite) newly premiered Ink Master Season 17. There are also tons of new movies, including The Cut, a boxing drama starring Orlando Bloom, dark comedy Shell, and true-crime tale My Nightmare Stalker: The Eva LaRue Story. Plus, Paramount+ will be playing the important NFL holiday games.\n\nCheck out the wide breadth of TV and movie content to choose from on Paramount+ (and use the Paramount+ promo codes above to save on whatever plan you decide).\n\nStream Live Sports and Events on Paramount+\n\nFor better or worse, I’m a Chiefs fan (cue the booing). I usually get a Paramount+ plan during the football season to keep up with my favorite beefy, TBI-ridden men. You can stream all of the NFL coverage you want all season long, plus, 24/7 live channels are now streaming on Paramount+, so you’ll never need to give your brain the time to process the horrors.\n\nStream UFC Fights Live on Paramount+\n\nParamount+ has all the man-on-man action you want, from bloody brawls to KO’s. Paramount+ is your one-stop shop to stream UFC live so you can catch every fight. This includes UFC 326: Holloway vs. Oliveira 2, airing March 7 and UFC Fight Night: Emmett vs. Vallejos, airing March 14.\n\nWatch March Madness With Paramount+\n\nThe annual tournament that determines which men’s and women’s Division I teams will win the NCAA Basketball championships, March Madness, will be streaming on Paramount+ this spring. You can watch any men's March Madness games that are being broadcast on CBS with Paramount+. Let the games begin!\n\nDon’t Miss the Champions League Soccer on Paramount+\n\nIf football (or soccer) is more your jam, Paramount+ also has you covered. You can watch Champions League Soccer at Paramount+, including fan favorites and heated rivalries from Real Madrid, AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Barcelona, and more."

If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nThe most complex AI models are those powering AI video generators. After spending years developing chatbots and image generators, AI bigwigs like OpenAI, Midjourney and Adobe started building even more advanced tech that could animate photos and create short video clips. But not all AI video companies can rise to that challenge, and there's a big difference in the quality of their outputs. That’s why CNET reviewers have spent time thoroughly testing each program to find the best one for you, no matter your project, budget or creative needs.\n\nPHOTO EDITING SOFTWARE DEALS OF THE WEEK PhotoDirector 365 12-Months Subscription Plan : $40 (save $25)\n\nDirector Suite 365 12-Months Subscription Plan : $100 (save $40) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article.\n\nThe best AI video generators create clips that align with what you want while having as few errors as possible. But hallucinations happen with even the best AI programs, so those with more advanced features and hands-on controls let you further customize your videos, offering better odds of getting the clip you want. Testing a service’s creativity, accuracy and response speed are just the beginning, though. You also ought to consider the legal and ethical ramifications of using creative AI.\n\n\n\nMany creators, publishers and content catalog owners are worried that their content was used to train AI models without their permission or compensation. There are also concerns that AI-generated content could violate existing copyright protections and that AI companies aren’t able to prevent the creation of potentially abusive and illegal AI content. No AI company is immune to these issues, including our top picks below, but some come with less information and protection than others. This is why you should always check a service’s privacy and usage policy before using it and always disclose your use of AI.\n\nThis is everything you need to know to pick the best AI video generator for you. For more, check out the best AI image generators and CNET’s AI essentials.\n\nWhat’s the best AI video generator?\n\nThe best AI video generator for you is going to depend on your skill level, budget and project. The best free AI video generator is Sora 2 from OpenAI, which creates fun clips you can share on the Sora social media app. The best paid AI video generator for cinematic videos is Veo 3 by Google. If you want to use AI videos in your professional work, you’ll want to use Adobe Firefly. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\n\nPhoto Gallery 1/1 Best free AI video generator for anyone Sora by OpenAI 8.0 /10 SCORE Pros Excellent audio and video quality\n\nFree to use\n\nCan share AI videos on Sora social media app, if you want to do so Cons Sora model and social media app can be used to create deepfakes If you’ve heard of AI video, odds are you’ve heard of Sora. OpenAI recently dropped the second generation of Sora, which brought a ton of important updates, including audio and a brand new social media app by the same name. Sora videos are often fun and outlandish. Sora excels at realistic prompts -- sometimes a little too well, with the app’s cameo feature sparking concerns about deepfakes. No matter what method you use to access Sora, it’s an undeniably powerful model, capable of realistic and fantastical video generation. Sora is a great choice for people who want to create AI videos without spending a dime, especially shorter clips that are social media-ready. ...

That means you can use the AI images, videos and audio you make with Firefly in your professional work. That’s undeniably a major perk for creators, as is the ability to use several non-Adobe AI models through Firefly and other programs like Photoshop. The Firefly platform lets you set your resolution (540p-1080p), choose from a wide variety of styles and camera motions and upload reference videos for composition and motion. These expanded controls are great for creators who want to constraint the model’s creativity to fit specific projects. Firefly videos are vibrant, detailed and great for nearly any project.

Reviewers spend time using each program to create a wide variety of content. AI video generators are given a battery of tests that measure how well they handle a diverse set of prompts, from photorealistic to fantastical scenarios. We consider a service’s speed, creativity, errors known as hallucinations and its ease of use. We also closely inspect each program’s privacy and usage policies, as these can have a significant impact on how people use (and potentially misuse) each service.

We’ve seen a massive rise in deepfakes and low-quality, weird videos that have been dubbed AI slop. AI companies have guardrails in place intended to stop users from creating illegal, abusive or otherwise inappropriate videos, but we’ve already seen how imperfect these systems are. If you’re using a service that lets you upload reference images, use name brands in your prompts or use another person’s likeness, you need to be extremely careful. You could be infringing on existing legal protections (like copyright) or find yourself in a position where you don’t have the rights to use your AI-generated content or have created content of no value, wasting energy needed to power AI. If you want to make AI videos, some best practices to mitigate your legal and ethical risks include not using someone’s likeness without their permission and avoiding brand names and logos. Two of the best rules of thumb are the simplest, too. If you think you shouldn’t make a certain AI video, don’t do it. And always, always disclose your use of AI when sharing them online and with others.\n\nFactors to consider Accuracy is one of the most important factors to consider when selecting an AI video generator. You want to pick a program that has strong prompt adherence, meaning it is able to do what you ask it to do in your prompt. Writing a good prompt is essential to this process, but the model should be capable of handling nearly any request. AI video generators are prone to errors known as hallucinations, especially when it comes to following the laws of physics. For example, a great AI video generator isn’t going to have a person floating through solid objects or have objects appear from out of nowhere (unless instructed to do so). While every AI program messes up sometimes, a capable generator won’t regularly produce these kinds of errors. Because hallucinations are unavoidable with AI, the ability to edit your content is also important. More creative AI platforms are introducing tools to edit your output, which is great as it gives you more hands-on controls to perfect AI outputs. If many clarifying prompts are required or if you’re not able to edit your content, those are signs you may want to switch to another program. Creativity is also important. Creative AI tools are often used for brainstorming, exploration and planning. The best AI video models can bring a wide variety of artistic ideas to life and build off your reference images. Response speed is another factor. Generating AI videos is a complex task, so most models are able to create them between 2 and 5 minutes. Models that take longer to generate videos may be annoying to use, but if they result in better videos, the trade-off may be worthwhile. On the flip side, a model that produces good results quickly is noteworthy, too. You’re also going to want to read the fine print, meaning a company’s privacy and usage policies. There are a lot of concerns about how AI models are created and whether copyright-protected content was used. Creators, celebrities and public figures have loudly voiced concerns over the ability of AI video generators to make content that’s too indecipherable from reality. This is especially worrisome as we’ve seen how companies’ guardrails against creating illegal and abusive content aren’t perfect. You ought to understand how the AI company is using your data, moderates content and what ownership or rights you retain over the videos -- these vary by service.

            "content": "Google couldn't let Samsung have all the fun and attention this week. The Gemini-maker dropped Nano Banana 2 on Thursday, the second generation of its viral AI image editing tool.\n\nYou might remember Nano Banana from last fall, when it made many fans and shocked AI users with its photorealistic capabilities. It quickly leapfrogged AI image tools from competitors like Midjourney and OpenAI, particularly with its ability to adeptly handle photo edits on top of generating entirely new images. The Pro version came out a few months later and built on those capabilities with better text generation. Now Google is promising that Nano Banana 2 is, like Hannah Montana, the best of both worlds.\n\nNano Banana 2 levels up Google's base AI image model. The company said it should have the speed of the original model with the accuracy and detailed work of the Pro version. It uses the world knowledge that was built into Gemini 3, previously restricted to the Pro model. That means AI images should be more rooted in reality and less likely to be hallucinations.\n\nText generation in images, like when you create greeting cards, should be clearer, too. Character consistency, something that creators have said Nano Banana excels at, is also getting a boost. Google said the new base model \"delivers vibrant lighting, richer textures and sharper details,\" along with the ability to generate in different aspect ratios and in resolutions up to 4K.\n\n\n\nSince Nano Banana's launch, and partly because of it, we're all now anxiously wrestling with the role AI-generated content plays in our online ecosystems. Advanced models like the ones from Google create fabricated images and videos that are nearly indistinguishable from real ones. Low-quality AI content, sometimes called slop, has flooded social media. The vast majority of social media users believe they see AI-generated posts, but less than half (44%) are confident they can spot it, a CNET survey found. Photorealistic images like the kind Nano Banana can make are a big part of that problem.\n\nThe new model is available now everywhere you use Gemini. Nano Banana 2 will replace the original, so you'll have to choose between it and the Pro alternative. If you create AI images with the new model, Google will attach invisible watermarks called content credentials to them. So if you want to know if an image was made with AI, you can upload it to Gemini, and it may be able to identify it. That only works if it was made with Google AI, though."

            "content": "If you're a lifelong coffee drinker, you probably have your routine down, and your small collection of tools for brewing drip, espresso or pour-over. While the brewer is a key component in making consistently good coffee, it's one of many factors that affect what ends up in your mug.\n\nGetting the coffee-to-water ratio right is essential, and experts suggest the golden ratio to do so. Beyond weight and measurements, the fineness or coarseness of the grind is just as important, and it's often overlooked in coffee brewing.\n\nGrinding freshly roasted beans at home is what most experts recommend, but reaching for whatever grinder is in your kitchen could compromise the outcome.\n\nThe best coffee grinders produce evenly ground beans, giving you greater control and a more balanced brew. And when we talk about the best, we're referring to burr grinders.\n\nWhat is a burr grinder, and how does it work?\n\nA burr grinder gives you maximum control over the beans you use to make a cup of coffee -- it's one of the most important coffee tools you can own. Patrick Holland/CNET\n\nUnlike a blade grinder, which grinds coffee beans by slicing them, burr coffee grinders crush them. Burr grinders use two abrasive or notched discs or plates, known as burrs, that rotate either parallel to one another or concentrically.\n\n\"A burr grinder gives you maximum control,\" Kaleena Teoh stresses. Teoh is co-founder and director of education for Coffee Project New York, and praises burr grinders for \"giving you the power to brew the coffee exactly the way you want it to be.\"\n\nBurr grinders are able to grind beans evenly and to a precise coarseness. Kuzmik_A/Getty\n\nAs the coffee beans are squeezed between them, they're crushed to a preset size determined by the distance between the two burrs, which is adjustable to suit both the type of coffee being made and personal preference.\n\nWhen you use a burr grinder, the coffee beans get crushed to a predetermined size -- which is more consistent than a blade grinder.\n\nWhy a burr grinder is preferable to a blade grinder\n\n\"With a blade grinder, there's no way for us to guarantee how the beans move within the grinder, which essentially works like a blender,\" says Teoh. \"You're basically cutting and chopping the beans at different angles,\" as they fly around haphazardly within the chamber of the grinder.\n\nNo matter how long you run the grinder, you're still likely to get a wide variety of particle sizes in the finished grind, \"from really fine powdery sizes to really big boulders in there,\" she says.\n\nBlade grinders don't really grind at all. Rather, they hack and chop the beans at different angles, resulting in uneven grinds. Pablo Jeffs Munizaga, Fototrekking/Getty\n\nBy comparison, the primary purpose of burr grinders is consistency, as the grinder's shape forces beans to move between the burrs in a specific manner. (One of two specific ways, outlined below.) \"You'll always have slightly different particle sizes,\" says Teoh, no matter what kind of grinder you use, \"but for the burr grinder, that range is way smaller compared to a blade grinder.\"\n\nFlat burr grinders vs. conical burr grinders\n\nThere's a slight difference in particle size distribution between conical and flat burr grinders, but both can achieve professional-level results. Created by CNET\n\nBurr grinders come in two forms: flat burr grinders, where the two ring-shaped burrs are stacked on top of one another in a parallel fashion. Beans are then inserted into the inner circle and are forced between the burrs before emerging on the sides. Conical burr grinders consist of one ring-shaped burr, and one conical burr, which work concentrically, with the beans passing between them and coming out through a chute below.\n\n\n\n\"Both flat burrs and conical burrs are able to give you great results, says Teoh, \"as long as you're able to understand how to dial in the grind for your coffee.\"\n\nBurr grinders of either style may be pre-calibrated for specific coffee styles, such as pour-over or espresso, or may offer a wide range of grind sizes. However, all will be adjustable, allowing you to fine-tune the grind to achieve the flavor you want in the finished brew.\n\nThere are two types of coffee grinders you can pick from: burr grinders or flat conical grinders. Patrick Holland/CNET\n\nThere is a slight difference in particle size distribution between flat and conical burr grinders, which mainly comes down to a matter of preference. \"A flat burr gives you a grind where the majority of particles after grinding will be a consistent size, and with a conical burr, it gives you two sets of grind sizes, with one group that is slightly finer and one group that is slightly coarser,\" says Teoh.\n\nThe argument for a conical burr grinder is that this gives you a more complex shot of espresso because of having two different extraction rates; however, \"the Specialty Coffee Association did a lot of research and blind-tasting and determined that it's very difficult for people to tell the difference.\"\n\nThe key to choosing a burr grinder is to select one that matches your use, as some burr grinders are pre-calibrated to produce a specific range of grounds for a particular style of coffee: extremely fine, powdery grounds for espresso or large, sea-salt-sized grounds for pour-over or French press. Some burr grinders offer a wide range of settings for various types of coffee.\n\nBurr grinders: Good brands and average cost\n\nYou don't have to spend a lot of money on a burr coffee grinder, but make sure you pick one from a reputable brand. Chris Monroe/CNET\n\nBurr grinders come in either electronic or hand-crank models and, like any kitchen appliance, you can spend a lot of money on one, but you don't necessarily have to. Teoh says she uses a variety of different grinders with Coffee Project New York; among the professional brands she likes, such as Mahlkönig and Victoria Arduino, there are several she recommends for home use:\n\nThe beans also matter\n\nThe primary purpose of burr grinders is consistency, so it's worth putting one in your kitchen if you're a coffee lover. OXO\n\nIf you're thinking of getting serious about the burr grinder, you should also get serious about the beans. Your average supermarket whole beans are probably not worth the splurge. Notably, for burr grinders, especially hand-crank models, the darker the roast, the more brittle it is and the easier it is to grind. Therefore, factor your preferred roast into your buying decision.\n\nAs far as optimizing consistency and control with a burr grinder goes, \"buy coffee from your local roasters,\" advises Teoh. \"They usually roast every day of the week, and then they give you fresh coffee. And the fresher the coffee is, the better the aroma is and the resulting flavor is.\""

            "content": "They're so sleek, no one even thinks to ask if they're smart glasses. Standing up on a stage about to give a talk at a conference in Rust, Germany, I wore the Even Realities G2 glasses to prove a point. In my field of view, a glowing monochrome 3D text display brought up notes on a teleprompter window. I tapped to navigate with a metallic ring on my right forefinger.\n\nAnd like that, my talking points drifted in a slow scroll to match the moments when I mentioned key terms as I improvised.\n\nThis was my first time trying smart glasses with a teleprompter in a real-life situation where I couldn't risk failure. The $599 G2 glasses only half passed the test. While these camera-free smart glasses have the lightweight framing I want, fit my extremely myopic prescription and have battery life to last a full day and then some, they don't work nearly as fluidly as I'd want. Which is why, midway through my live talk, I basically abandoned the teleprompter function and improvised the rest of the way.\n\nSmart glasses right now are like early smartwatches a decade ago, a wild mix of ideas thrown against the wall by an increasing number of companies, mixing features and AI services and interfaces in different combinations. There are no clear standards for smart glasses yet, like there are for phones, earbuds or even watches.\n\nScott Stein/CNET\n\nWhile Meta has stolen most of the spotlight and market with its AI-enabled and chunky Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses, they're not the only forms in the wild. Meta's glasses have cameras and microphones, and onboard speakers, acting as face-worn recording devices. Only one model right now has a display. The Meta Ray-Ban Displays have a single color display in one eye, and they don't have lenses that can be made for my high-index eye prescription. They also have battery life that can't last a full day, or even just a few hours.\n\nEven Realities' glasses are a totally different story. The second-generation models can fit a wide range of prescriptions, even beyond mine (up to +/-12). The battery life lasts well over a day. They have dual, larger displays in monochrome green. And they don't have cameras at all. Or speakers. Just displays and microphones.\n\nI got fitted for a prescription pair to try, thanks to Even, and have been wearing them on and off since the start of the year (prescription lenses cost at least $159 to add to the glasses). I wore them at CES in Las Vegas, and out to a German immersive entertainment conference called Aurea. I've worn them into New York. And I've been trying them along with a separately sold $249 smart ring, the Even R1, that controls the glasses and doubles as a heart rate-measuring fitness tracker.\n\nI love that these glasses are so trim and compact. So discreet. And that they fit my eyes and have amazing battery life. I just wish the rest of it worked as well as it promised. Some AI features are great, but I wish there were more.\n\nThe Even G2 glasses do have a remarkably compact design. Seen next to them: the separately-sold R1 control ring that's also a fitness tracker. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nEveryday-looking thin glasses\n\nThe most impressive aspect of the Even G2 is its shockingly lightweight frame and design. I've shown these glasses to people, and they had no idea they were smart glasses. They seem too unimposing.\n\nThe frame, in particular, is the standout. The metal frame around the lenses and arms is thin, with the only bulge in small bulb-like parts at the ends of the arms, where you'll find the batteries and touchpads to control the glasses. The display projectors live inside thicker parts of the arm near the lenses, but again, it's really subtle. The glasses are really lightweight, too: at 35 grams, they feel lighter than my regular glasses.\n\nThe G2s are a particular type of glasses design, though. They're small for my taste, and come in either square or round frames. And after a while, those bulky end bits on the metal arms start making my ears uncomfortable. They charge via an included glasses case that's bulkier than the Meta Ray-Bans case, but connects with USB-C the same way and is easy to tuck in a bag.\n\nThe separately sold R1 ring is an odder duck. It's similar to other smart rings like Oura in that it can track steps and heart rate. But the R1 also has a touch bar on one side that acts like a touchpad to control the Even G2 glasses. Double-tapping wakes the screen, swiping moves you through menus, and pressing and holding moves back a menu level.\n\nMe getting ready to talk on-stage, taking a quick selfie. The Even G2s do feel remarkably lightweight. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nThe ring's meant to be worn on your index finger, resting before the first knuckle so you can comfortably use the touchpad with your thumb, and that can get weird. I'm worried it'll fall off. When I was giving that stage presentation with teleprompter mode, as I held a microphone in one hand and a remote to control the slide deck in the other, it was super-hard to click the ring.\n\nLuckily, the glasses have their own touchpad controls, one at the back of each arm. They're often covered with my hair at the back of my ears, but they can navigate more reliably. Then you don't need to get the ring.\n\nAnd sometimes, the ring just stops working. A big problem with both the glasses and the ring is their spotty connectivity, even with multiple firmware updates. Sometimes it feels like a Bluetooth issue. Other times, I wonder if the background connection the glasses forge with my iPhone ends up timing out. Right now, in fact, the ring just stopped functioning as a touch control for some reason. And sometimes the glasses don't auto-dim the green micro LED display, keeping it on far longer than I need and getting in the way of my vision.\n\nThe micro LED display is big and bright enough indoors and in dimmer light, but it gets washed out in bright daylight. It's 3D and shows up across both eyes, looking like panels of green text overlaid on top of the transparent lenses. The small waveguide patches on each lens are subtle but do show up in light, and sometimes the displays can be seen through the lenses, too.\n\nBut the displays are clever, because they fade away when you're not looking at them. It's a bit of peripheral-vision magic because the green displays appear when you look up. But looking down at the rest of my world, like when typing this review, they seem to fade away.\n\nI'd skip the ring and just get the glasses, but even then, I don't think I'd want the glasses in their current software form. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nAI: Bits and pieces\n\nI love that Even Realities' onboard software has a unique application to use AI with, a mode called Conversate. However, it's one of the only useful AI features on the glasses for me.\n\nConversate is a live mode that auto-transcribes a conversation (or whatever you're listening to), displaying the text on-screen as captions while also listening for random key phrases the AI considers noteworthy. Those get pulled out into another pop-up window that defines the term loosely. For instance, as I listened to a presentation on virtual worlds, the term \"biomimicry\" was defined for me on-glasses. When would I get another phrase pulled out? I had no idea.\n\nI used the Even G2 glasses in Conversate mode for most of a whole day, listening to other keynote presentations, and was able to save the transcripts into the Even Realities phone app. None of this used much of the glasses' battery life, impressively, and the onboard microphones had no problem picking up audio from across the room.\n\nThe transcripts include AI summaries and key-term breakdowns, which is helpful. I can also look over the pulled-out terms of note that got defined during Conversate mode. I kind of fell in love with keeping these on as a helpful listening partner, but not having control over Conversate's focus on particular phrases to define wasn't great.\n\nBut it made me wonder about a future where talking with people could generate helpful information to guide me, via subtle pop-up prompts. Even's Conversate mode is a stab in that direction, but crudely. I can't choose other AI services to run on the glasses, just the company's own Even AI, which doesn't clearly list what models it uses to function.\n\nThere's also a dedicated Even AI mode that responds to voice prompts, but it's worse than anything you'd use on your phone. It sometimes answers in a strange way and with less detail than ChatGPT and Gemini. It also relies on relatively limited display screen real estate to show answers, so it's basically a one-question-at-a-time experience. The text replies also roll in pretty slowly for my comfort.\n\nA look at the other side of the lens: the thicker arm part is where the display lives. A small patch on-lens is where the display gets reflected onto, Scott Stein/CNET\n\nEven Realities has an on-glasses maps-based navigation mode called Navigate that provides pop-up turn-by-turn directions. Not having any of these modes hook into existing phone apps or services is a huge downside, though. I have to ask for things from scratch and hope Even AI delivers.\n\nOn-glasses translation can handle 35 languages, far more than Meta's glasses can do. There's no need to download language packs either, but you do have to select the language pairs from the phone app to make it work. Oddly, you can't do it in glasses.\n\nTeleprompter mode is one of my other favorites, and maybe the best next to Conversate. You can cut and paste notes or speeches into the app and then roll them on glasses. It listens in and keeps up with what you're saying, even skipping ahead if you're at a later point. While this worked well generally, in a live stage experience, I couldn't control the ring well enough to get the teleprompter to start up. I had nervous jitters, combined with a less-than-responsive ring touchpad.\n\nAnd that's about it for the Even's features. Seriously. I'm struggling to think of what else I'd even use these glasses for, which is why I'm usually taking them back off again.\n\nThey're not even a good replacement for a smartwatch. Notifications can appear in-glasses, but many still don't pop up for me when paired with an iPhone. Incoming calls don't show up either. I can't respond to texts (or apparently see them). On Meta's Ray-Bans, I can at least answer calls and use the glasses like AirPods. You can't do that on Even's glasses. You can't listen to music. And you can't use them as cameras, because there aren't any.\n\nThe good news is that there are apparently a number of developers working on AI apps for the glasses that could emerge soon. These glasses are trying to be the Pebble watch of smart glasses in that respect. But I need those features and the customization to hurry up and get here. Right now, there's not enough to do to justify wearing them.\n\nThe right form, the wrong function\n\nI've come away from my Even G2 test drive realizing that, yes, smart glasses can be as small and prescription-friendly (and battery life-friendly) as my dreams desire. But that comes at a severe cost to everything else. Phones just don't work well with smart glasses right now, no matter what company makes them. The G2 tries, but its wonky phone app, buggy connectivity, limited customization and lack of deeper phone hook-ins to its AI (and lack of support for other AI services) keep it feeling a step behind.\n\nI can't wait for glasses to actually feel like truly deeper phone extensions, things that could assist people on the terms they choose with the apps they want. Meta hasn't gotten there. Even Realities hasn't. Maybe Google will, with its glasses coming later this year.\n\nI hope other smart glasses have the battery life, prescription lens support and size advantages Even does. It's sorely needed. It's just extremely disappointing that these glasses can't live up to the promise of all the rest yet. I'll check back later if more apps come, and see if they can be the Pebble for my face I was hoping for."

            "content": "If you regularly deal with a drafty home, a space heater can make it a lot more bearable. If you have one, you might even be able to cut your heating bill during the cold season if you know where to put it.\n\nHowever, these portable warmers can also cause problems, especially when used improperly or in the wrong locations.\n\nSpace heaters are a leading cause of home fires in the US during the winter months, yet many of these fires are preventable with proper placement. It's critical to keep an eye on your space heater while it's on and never leave it running without supervision. It's also important to avoid placing them in areas that increase fire risk.\n\nFor a safe, warm winter, here are nine places your space heater should never be.\n\n\n\nSpace heaters, even those with tip-over safeguards, don't belong on rugs. Getty Images\n\n1. On a carpet, rug or flammable surface\n\nSpace heaters can't sit on any surface that can easily scorch or catch on fire. That means you can never place one on a carpet or rug. You should also avoid using them on more delicate hardwoods or meltable vinyl, especially for long periods.\n\nWhat if you have only carpet in a cold room? You can look for a ceramic or otherwise heatproof base to position under the heater. It must be larger than the heater itself by about 3 inches on all sides.\n\n2. Near walls and furniture\n\nYour space heater needs a safety zone: Keep it at least 3 feet away from any walls or furniture to avoid burning hazards. Unfortunately, this also means that under your desk or dining table is a no-go. Try aiming space heaters toward these areas instead of placing them directly under them.\n\n3. Near blankets, pillows or curtains\n\nSpace heaters become an even greater fire risk if someone accidentally puts a blanket or pillow against them -- and in winter, that can easily happen. The same is true if the heater is pushed against any hanging curtains. Keep all these flammable items at least 3 feet away from the heater at all times.\n\nKeep space heaters away from everyday objects to play it safe. Cris Cantón/Getty Images\n\n4. Anywhere easily accessed by pets or small children\n\nSpace heaters can easily burn the unwary, and while many newer models have automatic shut-offs if they're tipped over, a fallen space heater can still be a serious fire hazard. Also, pets and kids may not pay attention to where they put toys or blankets, which can create additional risks.\n\nUse space heaters in areas that very young children and larger pets can't access or rarely visit. When they're paying attention, teach them to give the heater a wide berth.\n\n5. Bathrooms and laundry rooms\n\nSpace heaters play poorly around water, which can affect operation and greatly increase the risk of electrical shock. They are also more at risk of tipping over in these environments.\n\nUnfortunately, bathrooms and laundry rooms frequently suffer from brrr-level temperatures if heating is lacking. We suggest positioning a heater outside these rooms for maximum effect and safety.\n\nStaying near a space heater is fine, but always check that it's not overloading your system. Getty Images\n\n6. Plugged in alongside a lot of other appliances or lights\n\nSpace heaters are a big drain on the amps an electrical circuit uses. That's usually fine for newer 15-amp home outlets, since modern space heaters are designed to work with them. The circuit and breaker that manage that room/area have their limits.\n\nPlugging in a space heater along with a bunch of other appliances (kitchen appliances, big entertainment systems, etc.) can overload the system. At best, the breaker flips, and power cuts out. At worst, it overheats wiring and causes an electrical fire.\n\n\n\nThis overload risk is also more common in colder months because the holidays often lead to plugging in more light-up decorations, which further increases amp loads on home circuits. You can help mitigate problems by alternating devices to reduce overall power consumption and by monitoring with smart plugs.\n\n7. Plugged into an extension cord or power strip (or both)\n\nExtension cords and power strips aren't necessarily rated for the power space heaters require, and can increase the risk of an electrical fire, even if the outlet and breaker can handle the heater. Plugging an extension cord into a power strip before connecting the heater only increases the danger.\n\nIf you badly need a heater in an out-of-the-way location, look for a model that comes with a wireless power cable. Some extension cords are designed to support higher-amperage appliances, but you must be very careful when matching them to a heater -- we'd rather you avoid it altogether.\n\nWatch where you plug in a heater before warming those toes. Evgen Prozhyrko/Getty Images\n\n8. Plugged into an old or non-GFCI outlet\n\nA ground fault circuit interrupter is a handy bit of technology that shuts down an outlet if there's a problem with its electrical current, especially if it could complete a circuit elsewhere. It's a useful protection against shocks, overheating appliances and other issues. Always make sure that your space heater is plugged into a GFCI outlet.\n\nLikewise, avoid plugging the heater into an especially old outlet or one that's had problems before, such as suddenly not working. This raises the risk of causing wiring damage and resulting fires.\n\n9. Near anyone who gets winter allergies\n\nSpace heaters aren't always a great mix with allergy sufferers. Grace Cary/Getty Images\n\nWinter allergies are often caused by dust, dust mites and particles that accumulate during the closed-up winter days. Those kinds of allergies don't do too well if a device is blowing hot air around a room. That's particularly true if a heater or room hasn't been cleaned recently and there's a lot of built-up dust that can be spread around. If someone has particularly sensitive allergies, try to avoid using the space heater near them and see if you can find other ways to warm up.\n\nFinal tip: Never use fuel heaters inside\n\nOnly use electric or radiant heaters inside. Never use heaters that require fuel, such as kerosene, propane or other gas, in indoor spaces -- including the garage.\n\nFuel will always produce exhaust fumes, and those fumes need a dedicated vent to escape the home (as a gas fireplace does). Without venting fumes, those heaters will fill enclosed spaces with carbon monoxide, which could lead to carbon dioxide poisoning, the worst of news. The exception is certain oil-filled heaters that don't actually combust the oil, but these are relatively rare.\n\n\n\nRemember, if you're heading out or going to bed, remember to turn off the space heater -- never leave it on and unattended inside your home.

            "content": "It seems like Netflix's presence at award shows gets bigger every year, and now that the 2026 Academy Award nominations are out, that presence continues to grow. Six Netflix original films earned 18 nominations this year, including nods for Train Dreams and Frankenstein in the Best Picture category, Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song for KPop Demon Hunters, and Best Documentary Feature for The Perfect Neighbor. The streaming giant's combination of original films and a diverse library of films from other production houses makes it a reliable source of entertainment, although it can sometimes be hard to narrow down what to watch.\n\nThis week, the survival thriller Fall just arrived on the platform, and if you like a movie that will make your heart pound and your palms sweat, this is the perfect film for you. Fall is the harrowing story of two friends who become stranded 2,000 feet above ground at the top of radio tower in the remote desert after the ladder they used to climb up breaks off. It's pulse-pounding fun, but maybe not for anyone with a fear of heights.\n\nIf you'd rather go with a series, peruse our picks for the best TV shows to watch on Netflix.\n\n\n\nWatch movies at Netflix\n\nLionsgate Fall (2022) Adventure-loving friends Becky (Grace Caroline Currey) and Hunter (Virginia Gardner) decide to climb up a decommissioned 2,000-foot radio tower in the middle of the desert. Cell signals are weak, help is out of reach. So when the ladder to the tower breaks after they reach the summit, they find themselves trapped with no way down. Facing the elements, vertigo, and dehydration, they must figure out how to survive before gravity has its way with them.\n\nSony Pictures Classics Blue Moon (2025) Blue Moon was released in theaters in 2025 and it's currently nominated for two Oscars, one for Ethan Hawke's lead performance as songwriter Lorenz Hart and another for Best Original Screenplay. In the film, a depressed Hart struggles to accept the success of his former songwriting partner Richard Rodgers (played by Andrew Scott). Bobby Cannavale and Margaret Qualley also co-star. The film, directed by Richard Linklater, marks his ninth film collaboration with Hawke.\n\nWarner Bros. Best in Show (2000) Christopher Guest directed Best in Show, a mockumentary about people entering the prestigious Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show. The largely improvised movie features an ensemble of actors who appear often in Guest's films: Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean and, of course, Catherine O'Hara. (The movie is so beloved that O'Hara, who died on Jan. 30, was actually honored with a tribute at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on Feb. 3.)\n\nSony Pictures Casino Royale (2006) The debate over which actor is the best James Bond has existed for decades but you can decide for yourself who's the superior 007 now that Netflix has dropped 25 James Bond movies from every era, including Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, No Time To Die and Casino Royale. (We've suggested Casino Royale here because if you like a modern action film, Daniel Craig's version of Bond, especially in Casino Royale, has it all: excitement, romance, glamour, high stakes card games... The film truly revived the franchise. Hot take alert!)\n\nNetflix The Perfect Neighbor (2025) Directed and produced by Geeta Gandbhir, The Perfect Neighbor is a harrowing documentary about the killing of Ajike Owens, a Florida woman who was shot to death on June 2, 2023, by her neighbor, Susan Louise Lorincz. The film's use of police body camera footage and 911 calls lay out the neighborhood disputes stemming from Lorincz's erratic and unsettling behavior and the escalating tension that led to the killing.\n\nNetflix KPop Demon Hunters (2025) The Netflix original animated film KPop Demon Hunters premiered in June and quickly rose through the ranks to become the platform's most-watched original film of all time. The film, about a KPop group that performs by day and hunts demons in their downtime, has a soundtrack that's already been certified Platinum thanks to hits like \"Golden\" and \"Soda Pop.\" The film stars Arden Cho, May Hong and Ji Young Yoo as the titular girl group tasked with fighting off a demonic boy band. (Can't get enough of the movie? Check out the theatrical sing-along version and lyric videos that are also available to stream.) The film was also honored with two Golden Globes this year for Best Original Song and Best Animated Motion Picture and nabbed two Oscar nods.\n\nSony Pictures Animation Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018) Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is the first animated Spider-Man feature in the Marvel canon, and the film follows Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as he becomes the new Spider-Man and teams up with other Spider-People from various parallel universes to save his universe from the Kingpin (voiced by Liev Schreiber). The film's other Spider-Men are played by Jake Johnson, John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn and Nicolas Cage. Tthe rest of the cast is top-notch, too.\n\nStand By Me (1986) Stand By Me, based on a novella by Stephen King and directed by Rob Reiner, is a coming-of-age story about four 12-year-old boys (played by River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'Connell and Corey Feldman) who hear about a dead body on the outskirts of town and go on an adventure to find it. The film earned an Academy Award nomination and has often been lauded as a classic, timeless coming-of-age story. The film will be available to stream on Netflix until Feb. 28.\n\nNetflix Jay Kelly (2025) George Clooney and Adam Sandler received Golden Globe nominations for their performances in Noah Baumbach's Jay Kelly, which arrived on Netflix this December. Clooney stars as the title character, a movie star grappling with his age, career and relationships during a trip to Europe.\n\nUniversal Pictures The Sting (1973) The 1973 Oscar-winner The Sting stars Robert Redford and Paul Newman, who reunite with director George Roy Hill, with whom they previously collaborated on the wildly successful Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

Watch The Only Girl in the Orchestra on Netflix\n\nNetflix 1917 (2019) The critically lauded Oscar-winning film, 1917, directed by Sam Mendes about World War I, was remarkable for the fact that it was filmed with the intent of making it appear as though the entire movie was shot as two long, continuous takes.

Luckily for us, there were cameras rolling the entire time as dozens of the world's most famous musicians pulled the epic all-night recording session.

            "content": "Samsung just supercharged one of its most-used AI features on the new Galaxy S26 lineup, and it's even more impressive than before.\n\nCircle to Search, which first appeared on the Galaxy S24 phones and then expanded to other devices as Google Lens, felt like magic: Circle anything on your screen and get instant results. The AI-powered visual search tool can identify objects, translate text and surface contextual results without ever leaving the app you're on.\n\nNow it's gotten even smarter.\n\nAndroid's Circle to Search feature originally launched on Samsung Galaxy S24 and Pixel 8 phones in January 2024. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nInstead of just identifying a single item, it can recognize and surface information about multiple things you've presented it with, including an entire outfit. The feature can be used for just about everything, from identifying bird species to translating text, but Samsung says fashion and shopping are hands-down the most popular use case.\n\nSo of course I had to put it to the test at Samsung's Unpacked event in San Francisco by having it scan my outfit -- and I was genuinely floored. In the crowded event space under harsh lighting, I was skeptical it could deliver. It did.\n\nFirst, it pulled up an AI summary describing the scene: \"The look features a vibrant blue structured blazer, white top, dark fitted leggings and classic black leather boots.\" Right below that, I pressed the \"Find the look\" button and watched it do its magic.\n\nWithin seconds, I was staring at the exact same in-your-face cerulean blazer I was wearing, with a link to the online store I'd bought it from, along with a slew of strikingly similar shopping options ranging from upscale alternatives to budget-friendly picks. As someone who regularly looks to TV shows, movies and red carpet events for outfit inspo, this level of stalking would've taken me at least 20 minutes to lock down.\n\nScrolling down revealed the same for my glossy black leggings. Despite being from many seasons ago and not available anymore, it returned convincing dupes from different retailers. It did the same for my decade-old knee-high boots and even pulled up a used pair from Postmark; a nod at the fact that mine are old AF. The only thing it failed to surface was the shirt I was wearing under the blazer that was clearly visible in the shot. Maybe layers is the next frontier for Circle to Search.\n\nSurprisingly, the hardest part of the process was figuring out how to use the feature. I had to ask a Samsung employee to take a full-body picture of me. Once I had it on the screen, I long-pressed on the home button at the bottom of the screen, which triggered a Google overlay. I then had to circle myself from head to toe. It's the kind of feature I'd program on an action button if I could -- although my wallet would likely suffer the consequences.\n\nIn doing this, Samsung and Google have virtually removed the friction between liking someone's outfit, and pressing the trigger on buying it. It wasn't that long ago that the closest alternative involved screenshotting a look, posting it to Pinterest and attempting to track down similar pieces. This is faster, cleaner and almost dangerously good for fashion lovers like me.\n\nIf this gets any better, Samsung may need to add a few guardrails for those of us prone to a little too much impulse shopping."

            "content": "I'm no stranger to music -- I sing and play bajo and theremin in my band, Ropetrick. I also taught myself guitar (still a work in progress). But there's one instrument I haven't conquered yet: the piano.\n\nInstead of going through private lessons or stumbling through YouTube video tutorials, I went on a quest to see if a new gadget could get me up to speed quickly on how to read and play.\n\nThat's where the Roli Piano Learning System comes in. It promises to make piano lessons fun by using an iPad app paired with Roli's Piano -- a 49-key midi controller -- along with the Airwave, an instrument and controller that uses camera sensors to track your hand movements.\n\nIn this episode of Prove It, embedded above, I go through the process of teaching myself with a high-tech musical system.\n\nThis isn't just one device -- it's multiple machines coming together to be your teacher.\n\nAt the center is the Roli Piano, a $599 midi controller with keys that light up like a Simon memory game. It has one port for your sustain or expression pedal, and it has an USB-C port for charging and data transfer. You can also connect the piano to your phone or tablet with Bluetooth and access the ROLI Learn app.\n\nBecause it's a midi controller and not a standalone keyboard, it doesn't have a headphone jack or output for an instrument cable on the piano; its sound comes through whatever device you have it connected to. And if you connect it to your phone via Bluetooth and connect your phone to Bluetooth headphones or a speaker, you will notice latency between the time you strike a key and the time you hear the note.\n\nThe Airwave retails for $349 and is a new type of instrument Roli calls an \"expressive controller.\" It has two USB-C ports for charging and data, a pedal input, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It magnetically connects to your Roli Piano and uses USB-C to sync with the Roli Learn app on compatible iPads.\n\nBut the real draw of the Airwave is in the infrared cameras it uses to track your hand movements at a rate of 90 frames per second using something called Vision Technology. These cameras track your hands in real time, and the Airwave creates an animated version of them on screen. This allows the Roli Learn app to help correct your hand posture and it color-codes your fingers to match the color of the keys that you should play with them. If you're an experienced piano player, you can use the Airwave to create some seriously cool musical effects, like layering in multiple sounds with just a wave of your wrist.\n\nThe Roli Learn app ($14.99 a month) is so much fun to use. It combines YouTube-style video tutorials with an interactive interface that looks and feels a lot like Guitar Hero. The introductory courses are really easy to follow -- anyone could do it. (My colleague Bridget Carey says her 6-year-old enjoys using the included games to learn how to play.)\n\nI really appreciate the diversity of human instructors in the video lessons and love that the app features popular music, like Sabrina Carpenter's \"Espresso\" and MGMT's \"Kids,\" in addition to piano classics and skill exercises.\n\nIf you wanted to get started with Roli, there are cheaper ways in, such as using the iPhone app with the smaller Roli Piano M model for $249 -- and you can add on from there.\n\nMy biggest issues when learning a new instrument are finding ways to keep it fun and staying motivated to practice. And after playing with the Roli Piano Learning System for a month, I think I could actually become a decent pianist by learning this way.\n\nWatch this episode of Prove It as I put it to the test, and see if it's something that would work for you."
