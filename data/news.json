            "content": "SunSport’s Kevin Dunne is back with his picks for a huge FA Cup weekend.\n\nCOURSE and distance winners, we all know Pep Guardiola and Man City get the trip.\n\nSix times in the last eight seasons, it’s been those sky blue colours fluttering away on the Premier League trophy come that sunny day in May.\n\n\n\nAnd as they round the turn with long-time leaders Arsenal right in their sights, the Etihad outfit are hitting their stride.\n\nFive wins in all competitions in February and only one defeat in the league since last November.\n\n\n\nThe Gunners, despite an impressive 4-1 win at Spurs last weekend, have given City room up the inside – having shipped out leads and frittered away four points with draws at both Wolves and Brentford this month.\n\nAs it stands, if City win their remaining 11 league games, including the blockbuster at home to Arsenal on April 18, Pep and his side will land a magnificent seven-timer.\n\nStill the market doesn’t believe they will. The Gunners are currently a best-priced 4-7 with Betway, while City can be had at 7-4 with Sporting Index.\n\nSo which horse would Coral’s John Hill rather be on? He said: “It was an important win over Newcastle last weekend, and a good sign for Pep that his side were able to gut it out.\n\n“Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi are proving to be excellent signings, and are giving them the lift they need.\n\nBET BALLS Man City to win both halves at Leeds tonight is 14-5 with BetGoodwin\n\nBrighton to beat Forest tomorrow, BTTS, is 11-4 with BetGoodwin\n\nMan United to win from behind against Palace tomorrow is 13-2 with BetGoodwin\n\nArsenal and Chelsea to draw 2-2 is 12-1 with BetGoodwin Get a 10% bonus on all winning accas – 18+ T&Cs apply\n\n“All told I’d be backing City; they’ve been here before. I just think the pressure of being chased could get to Arsenal and they’ll end up the bridesmaids again.”\n\nIf anyone knows anything about being bridesmaids, it’s City’s hosts tonight, Leeds.\n\nThey were First Division runners-up twice in the 1960s and three times in a row, just like this Arsenal side, in the early 70s.\n\n\n\nNow back in the elite after being relegated in 2023, they are doing an increasingly good job of staying there.\n\nSince narrowly losing 3-2 at City on November 29, the mighty Whites have been beaten only by Arsenal and Newcastle in the league.\n\nAnd having kicked off the season as 7-5 third-favourites to go down, that run has given them a six-point cushion on the drop zone and they are now out to 12-1 for relegation.\n\nThat run has included wins over Chelsea and a draw at Stamford Bridge, two draws with Liverpool, and an impressive point at third-placed Villa last weekend.\n\nTonight, then, will be no canter for Pep’s thoroughbreds, even though they are heavy odds-on to win at Elland Road.\n\n\n\nThe home side are a best-priced 22-5 with MGM, with the draw trading at 18-5 with Sporting Index.\n\nBut with the stakes as they are for the title-chasers, City can’t be opposed here. But with just two clean sheets in their last eight league games, nor can the likelihood of Leeds scoring.\n\nCity win and BTTS is a best-priced 21-10 with Ladbrokes Coral and bet365, while the visitors winning 2-1 at 8-1 with 365 has most appeal in the correct-score market.\n\nWhile prolific, Erling Haaland hasn’t scored twice in a Prem game since December so the 4-1 he does tonight with BetGoodwin looks a decent shout.\n\nYelland Road then.\n\n\n\nGoodwinners’ Enclosure\n\nWHAT could be more Spursy than to win the Europa League one year, then get relegated the next?\n\nAnd on the evidence of Sunday’s flimsy north London derby showing, here, at BetGoodwin Towers, we’re not sure that Tottenham’s players have the bottle for a relegation fight.\n\nThey are now into 17-4 to take their billion pound stadium into the Championship, with West Ham 4-6 and Forest 11-5 to join doomed Wolves and Burnley for the drop.\n\nAnd getting buried 4-1 at home by Arsenal was a huge blow to Spurs’ chances in our eyes, especially with Vitor Pereira starting to lay some positive roots at Forest.\n\nOne side we don’t see in the relegation conversation is Leeds. Their form under Daniel Farke since December has pushed the Whites six points clear of the bottom three.\n\n\n\nBut it’s not just the points that have impressed us, it’s the nature of their points that has.\n\nThey’ve picked up key wins and draws against top-class sides and Stach-ed up another one at Villa Park last weekend after Anton scored.\n\nTonight they host title-chasing Man City and both come into this game at Elland Road in great form.\n\nAnd with the reverse tie at the Etihad a close-run 3-2 home win affair, we see City to win and over 3.5 goals as a great bet at 11-8.\n\nLast weekend in the ring, Burnley’s last-gasp equaliser at Chelsea didn’t do our punters any favours, sinking an armada of accas, while Brighton’s win away at Brentford was also a great result for us.\n\n\n\nAs far as the title race goes, Arsenal remain rightful jollies in our eyes after their huge win against Spurs. They are 4-9, with City out at 6-4.\n\nBut Pep’s boys have a habit of going on huge winning runs towards the end of the season, so we see this going right down to the wire, especially with City and Arsenal facing off at the Etihad in April.\n\nAt least there’s a few more runners in the top-four race! And with Man United putting together a monumental run under Michael Carrick to storm up the league, we now have them joint-favourites with third-placed Villa to finish in the top four at 8-15.\n\nLiverpool are close behind at 8-11, with Chelsea now 2-1. But we fancy United to be best of the rest – and an Arsenal-City-United straight tricast can be backed at 100-30.\n\nAnd we’re sticking with the big guns for this week’s Nap Acca, going for Liverpool, United, Arsenal, Man City and Newcastle all to win for 10-1.\n\n\n\nChampions League\n\nNAPOLEON famously said: “I’d rather have a lucky general than a good one.”\n\nSo he’d have liked Mikel Arteta, who qualified again on both counts after yesterday’s Champions League draw.\n\nHaving already had Portsmouth, Wigan and Mansfield in the FA Cup, Arteta’s Arsenal will now face Bayer Leverkusen (sixth in the Bundesliga) in the last-16 in Europe.\n\nThat would be followed by the prospect of surprise packages Bodo Glimt or Sporting Lisbon in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe bookies swiftly cut the Emirates outfit into 11-4 favourites to win it, a best price with Ladbrokes, Coral and 888.\n\n\n\nMan City were not so lucky, pulling out Real Madrid in the last-16, with probably Bayern Munich to follow.\n\nChelsea will be 4-1 underdogs when they go to Paris Saint-Germain for their first leg, while Newcastle are odds-against 15-8 for their first leg at home to Barcelona.\n\nArne Slot’s Liverpool are heavy favourites to dispense with Turks Galatasaray, with Spurs massive 13-2 outsiders for their first leg at Atletico Madrid.\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE OUTRIGHTS (best prices): 11-4 Arsenal; 11-2 Bayern Munich; 13-2 Barcelona; 8-1 Man City; 10-1 PSG; 11-1 Liverpool; 12-1 Real Madrid; 25-1 Chelsea; 33-1 Newcastle; 40-1 Tottenham; 125-1 Bodo Glimt.\n\nDark Horse\n\n219-1: Man City are second in the Premier League, in the Carabao Cup final against Arsenal, and still in the Champions League and FA Cup. They are a best priced 219-1 with bet365 to win an unprecedented Quad.\n\n\n\nTV Previews\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest\n\nLAST TIME Brighton won consecutive league games was against Brentford and tomorrow’s visitors Forest.\n\nWell, they ended a run of one win in 13 Prem games at Brentford last weekend.\n\nRelegation-fighting Forest were a shade unlucky to lose 1-0 at home to Liverpool on Sunday but have now failed to score in 13 of their 27 Prem outings.\n\nNarrow home win and Diego Gomez to score anytime at 4-1 with BetVictor.\n\n\n\nFORECAST: 2-1\n\nMan United v Crystal Palace\n\nOLD TRAFFORD has been Gold Trafford for Palace, who’ve won four of six there, including the last two.\n\nThe Eagles have also chalked up six road wins this term and scored in six of their last seven aways.\n\nSo while charging United, six wins from seven under interim boss Michael Carrick, should oblige, it could be tight.\n\n\n\nConsistent Ismaila Sarr is the 4-1 anytime scorer pick with Sky Bet.\n\nFORECAST: 2-1\n\nArsenal v Chelsea\n\nIT’S five years since Chelsea beat Arsenal – a long time for the reigning world club champions.\n\nIn three meetings this term, the Gunners won two by a single goal, with the other drawn.\n\n\n\nTomorrow, with City breathing down their necks, leaders Arsenal will have to force the pace.\n\nAn opening for the Blues, who can take at least a point. Penalty-taker Cole Palmer is the anytime scorer shout, 10-3 with Sky Bet\n\nFORECAST: 2-2\n\nTop Tips\n\nPro bet\n\nNewcastle to beat Everton, Fulham to beat Spurs, Swindon to beat Bristol Rovers, Fleetwood to beat Newport, Oldham to beat Crawley.

It’s three unbeaten in the league with a win over Nottingham Forest prior to those draws.\n\n\n\nThat’s ensured Leeds go into the weekend six points clear of danger and their good run of form at home has been a real help to that.\n\nBar a thumping 4-0 defeat by Arsenal, it’s four wins and two draws at Elland Road in their last seven games and in the ‘home’ league table, they would find themselves in 12th.\n\nBut similar to that doing handed out by the Gunners, they welcome a team with a title to win and a Manchester City side in red-hot form.\n\nCity have won seven and drawn one – that collapse as Spurs – in their last eight games and have four clean sheets in that time too.\n\n\n\nIt’s usually about the time of the season where Pep Guardiola’s men start motoring and that’s what looks like happening.\n\nThough their recent Achilles heel has been their away form, with the win at Anfield putting an end to a winless run on their travels.

The England international came through the ranks at Everton but left for Newcastle in 2023, with the circumstances surrounding his exit leaving a bitter taste among a number of Toffees fans.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGordon came on as a late substitute when Newcastle cruised to a 4-1 win at Hill Dickinson Stadium in November. He has featured five times against his former club, claiming victory on two occasions, though he is yet to win a match against Everton from the starting line-up.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Liverpool-born winger netted seven times in 78 appearances for the club where he began his career, chipping in with eight assists along the way. He has since racked up 36 goals and 28 appearances for Newcastle, having commanded a sizeable £45million fee, including a first senior hat-trick against Qarabag in the recent Champions League play-off.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEverton head into Saturday's fixture two places and one point above Newcastle in the Premier League standings.

Gordon, who had remained an unused substitute for Lampard's final match in charge, returned to training on January 27.\n\nView 2 Images Gordon has thrived since leaving Everton for Newcastle (Image: Aziz Karimov, Getty Images)\n\nAt the time, Everton and Newcastle were understood to be haggling over a price for the player, with the selling club looking for £60m and the buyers pursuing a £40m move. In the end, he went for closer to the lower end of that scale.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTransfer Request\n\nGordon's departure was announced on January 29, with Everton taking the unusual step of referencing a transfer request from the player as they confirmed the deal. \"The 21-year-old forward leaves Everton after having submitted a formal transfer request,\" the club said in a statement.\n\n\"Gordon joined the club's academy at the age of 11 and made his senior debut as a 16-year-old in a Europa League tie in December 2017.

United welcome Crystal Palace to Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon (2pm kick-off).\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhilst Michael Carrick has enjoyed nearly a week to prepare his side, the Eagles were competing in UEFA Conference League action on Thursday night. The additional time should prove advantageous for United, with players afforded extra opportunity to recover from any potential knocks. It also grants those on the injury list further time to advance their rehabilitation.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe victory over Everton, however, did present one injury concern: defender Lisandro Martinez was absent from the match with a knock, and Carrick delivered the latest update.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSenne Lammens has provided the perfect response after Paul Scholes Man Utd claim READ MORE :\n\nLiverpool surprise transfer confirmed as late deal done in Trent Alexander-Arnold repeat READ MORE :\n\nFull-back Patrick Dorgu will also continue to be sidelined after sustaining an injury during the victory against Arsenal.\n\nSpeaking to MUTV, Carrick said: \"Patrick is a little bit further down the line really, in terms of a number of weeks but he's progressing well.\n\n“Licha is a lot closer than Patrick is. It will be a matter of days, hopefully, it won’t be too long. We’ll assess him over the next day or two, and see where he is.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDefender Matthijs de Ligt will be unavailable, though he is advancing towards a return. \"Matthijs, he's had a back issue, which has been a little bit slower to progress, really,\" Carrick said.\n\n\"It's something we've been working through, and he's getting there. He's in the right direction, but, as I said, he's just a little bit further behind.\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

Carrick has confirmed he is edging 'closer' to a return, though the fixture against the Eagles may arrive too soon for the player.\n\nThere are also concerns surrounding defender Martinez, who sat out Monday night's clash with Everton due to a knock.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOliver Glasner faces a comparable headache at Crystal Palace. Striker Jean-Phillipe Mateta remains on the mend from a knee injury, with Glasner hopeful of welcoming him back 'in the next two or three weeks'.\n\nView 2 Images Jean-Philippe Mateta was close to leaving Crystal Palace and hasn't featured for Palace since his failed deadline day move.

Carrick has steered the side into genuine top-four contention after securing five victories and one draw from his opening six fixtures in charge.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere around Carrington is understandably buoyant as the players believe they may have reached a turning point after a torrid few years. Part of that optimism stems from Carrick restoring the so-called 'United DNA', which involves playing thrilling and attacking football.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnother element is reliance on emerging talent from the academy, something embedded in the club since before the Class of '92, and one Carrick seems eager to maintain. Recent results and his footballing philosophy suggest a promising future at Old Trafford, where talented youth team graduates can combine with current first team stars and new signings to take United back to the very top.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMirror Football now examines what the Red Devils' starting line-up could theoretically look like in five years' time if they continue on their present course, with an emphasis on their academy prospects.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\nGK - Senne Lammens\n\nThe 23-year-old Belgian shot-stopper was signed for £18.2million last summer. So far, Lammens looks to be an outstanding signing and United supporters will be hoping he can continue to go from strength to strength in the seasons ahead.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRB - Michael Kayode\n\nBrentford's Kayode is the ideal right-back to succeed Diogo Dalot further down the line. The Italian, still only 21, possesses explosive athleticism, relentless overlapping runs, outstanding one vs one defending and a secret weapon in the form of a gigantic throw-in.\n\nRCB - Leny Yoro\n\nView 5 Images Yoro is a talented defender (Image: 2025 James Gill - Danehouse)\n\nYoro, 20, is still learning what it takes to be a top-class Premier League centre-back, but the Frenchman still has plenty of time on his side. Signed for £52.2m in 2024, Yoro is undoubtedly regarded as the long-term defensive cornerstone at United.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLCB - Cristian Romero\n\nTottenham captain Romero is reportedly keen to leave the north London club, and United would be wise to bring him in this summer. The Argentine World Cup winner boasts a wealth of experience despite being just 27 years old, making him the ideal candidate to bring stability to a young and promising defensive unit. A fee of around £50m should be sufficient to sign Romero.\n\nLB - Harry Amass\n\nAmass stands out as one of the most gifted United academy prospects and could be the man to finally replace Luke Shaw. The 18-year-old is technically secure and progressive in possession. Should his loan spell at Norwich City prove successful, there is every reason to believe Amass can make the left-back berth his own at United.\n\nCM - Kobbie Mainoo\n\nView 5 Images Kobbie Mainoo is a future United captain (Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn five years' time, Mainoo will still be only 26. The England international already boasts considerable experience in high-profile matches and has returned to prominence under Carrick, who is impressed by Mainoo's press resistance and ability to glide through traffic. United's entire midfield identity could be built around the former academy starlet, and he is the most likely long-term captain in this side.\n\nCM - Adam Wharton\n\nWhile Mainoo would be the more adventurous of the midfield axis, long-term target Wharton, 22, could be signed as the chief orchestrator from deep, dictating the tempo much like Carrick himself did during his prime. With Crystal Palace enduring a thoroughly miserable campaign, the Englishman is valued at around £65m, making this the prime moment to bring him to Old Trafford.\n\nCAM - Shea Lacey\n\nView 5 Images Shea Lacey could be United's future talisman (Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLacey, 18, is the jewel in United’s academy crown at the moment. The left-footer, who made his first-team debut in December, is highly versatile, being able to play off the wing, though his creativity makes him the perfect long-term successor to Bruno Fernandes.\n\nRW - Kai Rooney\n\nThe son of United hero Wayne Rooney, Kai is destined to reach the first-team squad, having joined United's youth system at 11. At 16, he still needs more physical development to secure his place in the first-team XI, but he is already catching the eye with his clever off-the-ball movement from the right flank, cutting inside and displaying composed finishing.\n\nLW - JJ Gabriel\n\nView 5 Images JJ Gabriel is destined for the first team (Image: Getty)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJJ Gabriel is among the most talented youngsters currently playing in the academy. The 15-year-old is raw and electrifying, delivering that same fearlessness on the wing that a certain Cristiano Ronaldo showed over two decades ago.\n\nST - Benjamin Sesko\n\nSummer signing Sesko has appeared increasingly like the player United fought hard to sign last summer as the season has progressed. Still 22, the Slovenian's physicality and ball-striking could make his £66.2m transfer fee seem like a bargain in five years’ time."

A Muay Thai fighter, he has starred in ONE Championship and while he admires Verhoeven, even Harrison doesn't expect him to beat Usyk.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Is this one of the best comebacks seen in combat sports? ONE's Liam Harrison recovers from two knockdowns to win against Muangthai PK Saenchai in Muay Thai\n\nHarrison told Sky Sports: \"I think Rico's going to have to boot him in the leg if he wants to get any sort of advantage over him!\n\n\"No one can beat Usyk in a boxing fight, I don't care who you are. He's the best heavyweight on this planet and he's the best heavyweight of this era. If guys like Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua can't put a dent in him, no one's going to be able to put a dent in him I'm afraid.\n\n\"Rico's going to have to throw a few leg kicks if he wants to get one over on him in there!\"\n\nBut he understands why the event is taking place. \"Again Rico's a legend in kickboxing. Guys like that who paved the way in kickboxing have been the GOATs [greatest of all time] in their generation, they deserve to get these sort of paydays and these sort of chances to showcase what they can do and get some big money,\" he said. \"It'll be nice to see.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player A look back at some of Liam Harrison's big hits during his ONE career\n\nBoxing promoter Frank Warren represents both Fabio Wardley, who was Usyk's previous mandatory challenger, and Agit Kabayel, who will be Usyk's mandatory for the WBC belt.\n\nHe was, however, expecting Usyk to take a 'crossover' bout like this fight with Verhoeven. \"All he's doing now he's looking at fights, what is the value for him of a fight. That's why he wants this,\" Warren told Sky Sports.\n\n\"He's probably looked at what AJ's done, what Tyson did when he fought [Francis] Ngannou and thinking he'll have some of that and they look at it sometimes as being an easier job. Whether it is or it's not, we will see.\n\n\"Usyk just wants the paydays now. He's stamped his mark in boxing. He's the heavyweight of the 21st century and that's where he's at.\""

Up 2lb for that victory, he has obvious claims under Dylan Johnston.\n\nTwinjets scored by 10 lengths when beating off Heltenham over this track and 2m 4f trip in November and can be forgiven a poor run when unseating at Cheltenham in January. He returns from a short break with an excellent chance for trainer Paul Nicholls who has won this race a record nine times.\n\nIssam justified favouritism when landing a Kempton handicap chase last time and shapes as if he could have plenty more left in the tank.\n\nHeltenham, the 2024 winner, is another with each-way claims for Dan Skelton and Charlie Todd.\n\n2.30 Doncaster - King's Threshold and Dartmoor Pirate feature\n\nA splendid renewal of the Virgin Bet Grimthorpe Handicap Chase at Doncaster where King's Threshold and Dartmoor Pirate headline a field of 13.\n\nEmma Lavelle's King's Threshold had options at the Cheltenham Festival next month but has chosen to come here and could be the one to beat under James Bowen. The form of his latest Newbury win is solid, and he must be taken seriously.\n\nDartmoor Pirate seeks a hat-trick after winning at Lingfield before taking the Great Yorkshire Chase at this venue last time and he looks a danger from 5lb higher in the weights. New Order was second in that contest and merits respect off the same mark.\n\nNeil Mulholland has three runners in here with Kelce the pick under Conor O'Farrell. The eight-year-old racked up a third success over fences and the extra couple of furlongs to 3m 2f ought to suit this strong stayer.\n\nStablemates Broomfields Cave and Lord Accord complete the shortlist.\n\n2.35 Lingfield - Red-hot Ten Carat Harry faces Richie's Rocket\n\nLingfield stages a trappy-looking Listed BetMGM Spring Cup Stakes where in-form Ten Carat Harry faces seven rivals.\n\nA perfect six wins from six starts on the all-weather, Jamie Osborne's charge has been progressing through the grades this winter and deserves a crack at this better race. The manner of his latest Newcastle victory was impressive and the step up to seven furlongs should not inconvenience him.\n\nRichie's Rocket, third on debut at Newmarket in October, made a sparkling all-weather debut when clearing away to win by nine lengths over this trip and track the following month. Well-backed on that occasion, he quickened stylishly despite showing signs of greenness and rates one to follow.\n\nOf the others, Hilitany has some useful form from Meydan this year, while Sir Albert and Bella Lyra are worth a mention.\n\nBest of the rest\n\n5.40am Randwick - Group One Verry Elleegant Stakes where Golden Eagle winner Autumn Glow features and Trinity College debuts for Waller. Sir Delius appears too!\n\nMeydan - Super Saturday\n\n2.50 Meydan - Group Three with Symbol Of Honour and Run Boy Run involved.\n\n3.25 Meydan - Group Three with Apollo One declared.\n\n4.00 Meydan - Group Two where Quddwah and Alakazi clash.\n\n4.35 Meydan - Group Two Al Maktoum Classic with Mendelssohn Bay and Heart Of Honor fancied.\n\n5.10 Meydan - Group Two Dubai City Of Gold - Rebel's Romance tops eight runners.\n\n5.55 Meydan - Group Three with Audience representing David O'Meara.\n\n6.30 Meydan - Talk Of New York is expected to be useful for Charlie Appleby.\n\n2.40 Newbury - Rodney bids for a four-timer.\n\n3.15 Newbury - Brave Kingdom and Eldorado Allen headline Veterans' Chase. Mister Coffey, Hang In There and Capodanno also feature.\n\n4.58 Newbury - Joe Tizzard's Fairy Park rates an intriguing debutant.\n\n1.25 Doncaster - Listed mares novices' hurdle with Coolanna and Broomfield Aderra fancied.\n\n1.55 Doncaster - Mighty Bandit and Queens Gamble headline classy handicap field.\n\n3.52 Lingfield - Royal Jet bids for another success.\n\n6.30 Southwell - Unbeaten Chantelle features for Sir Mark Prescott.\n\n7.00 Southwell - Aisling Oscar is back again!\n\n7.30 Southwell - Charlie Appleby saddles two newcomers.

            "content": "Tim Henman feels Emma Raducanu is better off without a coach despite the British No 1 reuniting with Mark Petchey on an informal basis ahead of Indian Wells - live on Sky Sports Tennis.\n\nRaducanu parted company with Francisco Roig in the wake of her second-round defeat at the Australian Open.\n\nShe enjoyed a strong run of form while working with Andy Murray's former coach Petchey early in 2025 in a temporary arrangement, but hired Roig in August as she sought a new permanent fixture.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights of the Transylvania Open final as Raducanu struggled in defeat against Sorana Cirstea\n\nFollowing a six-month spell in which she has endured disappointing results, Roig, who formerly coached Rafael Nadal, became the ninth coach to depart since Raducanu's 2021 US Open win, with the pair gelling well on a personal level but not aligning on style of play.\n\nHer next tournament in Romania saw her reach her first final since her victory in New York in 2021, and since the split from Roig, Raducanu insisted she is happy working only with hitting partner Alexis Canter, a 27-year-old British former player who reached a career-high ranking of 779 last year.\n\nThe 23-year-old, coming off a first-round defeat to Antonia Ruzic at the Dubai Tennis Championships, is set to retain Canter as part of her setup as well as working with Petchey in the lead-up to Indian Wells next week.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Marion Bartoli believes Raducanu will learn more from playing the top players after she exited the US Open\n\nSky Sports analyst Henman thinks British No 1 Raducanu doesn't need a coach and should concentrate on working on her physicality to match the likes of fellow Grand Slam champions Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Elena Rybakina and Coco Gauff.\n\n\"I just wonder whether she's better off without a coach and that's nothing against Petch,\" said the four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist. \"He's someone I've known for a long time and he's a very, very good coach but we know it's not going to be a full-time appointment because Petch has his broadcast commitments.\n\n\"Emma has talked about her identity, her game style and she wants to own it. She's been around long enough on the tour so I wonder whether that might be a good option for her but it's her prerogative.\n\n\"I worked with three coaches in 15 years. I like the consistency and continuity and we know that coaches don't last long working with Emma.\n\n\"An aggressive game style is how you have to play. You have got to be aggressive because if you don't your opponent will be and for me. I want to see her build her physicality: to get stronger, more resilient, to hit the ball harder.\n\n\"And I think if she does that, that'll mean that she has less interruptions and less little setbacks physically. She'll be able to compete at a high level for longer periods, so if I could add one element it would be the physical side.\n\n\"Raducanu does work on her physical side. I think her tennis game is outstanding but when you think of the physicality of Sabalenka, Swiatek, Rybakina, Gauff, she's not in the same league.\n\n\"The physicality is the biggest challenge.\"\n\nPetchey helped inspire the most productive period of Raducanu's season as she reached the quarter-finals at Queen's before running Sabalenka close in the third round of Wimbledon.\n\nEmma Raducanu's NINE coaches\n\nNigel Sears\n\n\n\nBest known for coaching former top five players Amanda Coetzer, Daniela Hantuchova, Anett Kontaveit and Ana Ivanovic, Sears joined her team in April 2021 and oversaw her incredible breakthrough run to the Wimbledon fourth round.\n\n\n\nAndrew Richardson\n\n\n\nGuided Raducanu to her historic Grand Slam title at the US Open as a qualifier. Raducanu opted not to extend his trial contract immediately after the victory.\n\n\n\nTorben Beltz\n\n\n\nAngelique Kerber's former coach lasted only five months. They split in April 2022 with Raducanu transitioning towards a new training model involving LTA coaching support.\n\n\n\nDmitry Tursunov\n\n\n\nRaducanu took on the former pro on a trial basis during the summer of 2022 but Tursunov decided not to continue, later citing red flags in her camp that he felt could not be ignored for a long-term commitment.\n\n\n\nSebastian Sachs\n\n\n\nThe German joined in late 2022 but the partnership was cut short when Raducanu required multiple surgeries, leading to a mutual split.\n\n\n\nNick Cavaday\n\n\n\nThe 14-month stint was her longest professional partnership, helping her return to the top 60 before he stepped down in early 2025 due to personal health issues.\n\n\n\nVlado Platenik\n\n\n\nHired on a trial basis in March 2025, the partnership lasted only 14 days.\n\n\n\nMark Petchey\n\n\n\nAndy Murray's former coach provided crucial tactical knowledge through Wimbledon where she went out to world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, despite an encouraging display.\n\n\n\nFrancisco Roig\n\n\n\nAppointed in August 2025, Rafael Nadal's former mentor offered elite tactical clarity, but after her Australian Open exit in January 2026, Raducanu announced their split.\n\n\n\nRobson: Raducanu has 'same ideas' as Petchey\n\nImage: Petchey coached Raducanu during the grass-court season\n\nFormer Junior Wimbledon champion Laura Robson sees Raducanu's happiness on court as the biggest advantage and argues working with Petchey can only bring out the best in her.\n\nShe said: \"I think we make such a big deal out of the coaching situation and as long as she is feeling happy on the court, as long as she's confident out there then that's half the job done, and that's what coaches try and bring out in you when you do have one.\n\n\"She obviously gets on really well with Petch. They've been on and off for a fair few years now and it's someone she knows. They have the same ideas. They agree on so much that she needs to bring out there, so why not?\n\n\"As long as you've got someone who's taking care of the boring stuff like the logistics of booking practice, finding someone to practice with, racket re-strings - all of that. As long as that's taken care of, then you can just focus on trying to play.\n\n\"They have the same identity of how both of them feel she should be as a player.\"\n\nRaducanu is hoping to hoping to revert to a more aggressive style in order to compete with the top players and Robson says she has shown in the past she is capable of playing against the elite on the WTA Tour.\n\n\"For sure. We've seen how close her matches against Sabalenka have been,\" said former British No 1 Robson.\n\n\"It feels like everyone is adding different elements to their game all the time, so at the moment it feels like she wants to add that aggression back into her game and once you've got that you can start thinking about adding more variety again so you've got more strings to your bow.\n\n\"But you want to have a clear identity as a player before you go out onto any match court - so long as that's defined in your mind then that's half the job done.\"\n\nOverend on Raducanu finding the right balance\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Jonathan Overend believes that if Raducanu can find the right balance with the correct coach, she will be set up for a great year of tennis\n\nSpeaking earlier this month, Sky Sports commentator Jonathan Overend said Raducanu will only be able to find the right balance in her setup once she answers a key question.\n\n\"I think she has spent a lot of her young career re-evaluating,\" he said. \"In one regard, it explains why she has been through so many coaches and why she has been criticised for it.\n\n\"It's typical of Raducanu that she wants to keep re-evaluating and finding out what is best for her on and around a tennis court.\n\n\"That challenge continues, and to some extent it is a struggle, because finding the right balance is so hard, but I think she is slowly getting [it], not in terms of her Grand Slam results but in terms of that re-evaluation process.\n\n\"What is it she really wants for herself on a tennis court and in tournaments?\"\n\nWatch the ATP and WTA Tours, live on Sky Sports or stream with NOW and the Sky Sports app, giving Sky Sports customers access to over 50 per cent more live sport this year at no extra cost.

Imagine if all six English sides made it? It’s not unfeasible. PSG have not hit the levels they scaled last season so Chelsea have a chance. Barcelona are good on their day but St James’s Park could be a real cauldron for Newcastle in that home leg, while Spurs are a different prospect entirely in Europe compared to the Premier League. I look forward to seeing lots of comments below the line agreeing with this very sensible take I have proffered … Share\n\n12m ago 03.46 EST Speaking of the Champions League, the draw for the last 16 was made yesterday so our man Jonathan Wilson has sifted through the ties and decided who is going to win each one.

It’s a game that could kill off the title race – if there ever was one – once and for all, given Bayern Munich lead Borussia Dortmund by eight points before kick-off. A home win at Signal Iduna Park, however, could spice things up, though whether Dortmund will be weather-beaten by their Champions League collapse against Atalanta remains to be seen. Niko Kovac’s side have only lost once in the Bundesliga this season, the 2-1 reverse at Bayern in October. But we’ve all seen this movie before and it usually ends with Harry Kane doing that jump and fist pump celebration thing. View image in fullscreen Kane and Kimmich to kill off Dortmund’s title hopes?

It means Ed Still has won two, drawn one and lost one of his four games in charge of the Hornets, who leapfrogged the Robins in the table, both teams sitting just outside the playoff spots. In League Two it finished 1-1 between Harrogate and Cheltenham, a result that keeps the Yorkshire side in the bottom two.

Dual Gomes goals ensure Wolves beat Aston Villa and unwanted points record Read more Share Updated at 03.26 EST\n\n43m ago 03.15 EST About last night: It was a tale of two Gomes’s in Wolverhampton last night as Aston Villa’s blip in form became a dip in form, suffering the ignominy of becoming just the second Premier League team to lose to Wolves this season. João Gomes and Rodrigo Gomes were on target in the second half to breeze Wolves past that infamous Derby County points total of 2008. Villa have now firmly been dragged into the battle for Champions League qualification with Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea. Unai Emery was in phlegmatic mood after the defeat, though. He said: “In September I was worried and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. In December I was so happy and excited to get the top-five position and achieve the Champions League. “One month ago I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League. Now we are in the average to be in the top five. “Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, they are trying to get to us, for them it is a priority to get into the Champions League.” Share Updated at 03.42 EST"

            "content": "There’s a good advert right now on the rolling TV sports news channels. It starts with a rush of beeps and plinks and flashing symbols, generating instantly the flat, glazed, hungry quality of the online casino. A well-groomed middle-aged woman is shown sitting in an armchair in a suburban living room. It’s a jarring tonal shift, but we’re still in that same space, betting graphics dancing around her head.\n\nThe middle-aged woman turns to the camera and says: “The games are all different … It never gets boring,” eyes gleaming strangely, hands gripping the struts of her chair. Here is a person who is not just pleased, but uncontrollably energised by the prospect of WowBet.com’s 10bn mildly divergent AI-generated gambling patterns. At this point the words “Sandra Frottwangle, funeral director” appear on the screen.\n\nBy now it’s just an overload of feelings. The first thought is about transgression. Sandra Frottwangle’s job is to curate death. She spends her days managing the nobility of human flesh. She stands at the far edge of existence creating ritual and comfort, a timeless figure, the eternal footman, the director of last things. But she also gets bored easily and prefers stuff with flashing lights.\n\nIs this OK? Would you want Sandra Frottwangle to direct your funeral? Death is repetitive. Mortality is tedious. What if she decides this is all really dull and needs more beeping noises, less weeping and organ music? The ferryman is at the door. He’s unsheathing his scythe. He’s also got 400 free online spins at GambleDick.com.\n\nThe second thought is a rush of tenderness. Yes, Sandra Frottwangle’s life is spent in that liminal space. She stares into the void. She sees the weakness of the flesh, fish-grey monkey-brown. But even here she is still hungry for life, still craving that wild human energy. Eyes gleaming like opals, casino chips circling her head, she looks like one of those renaissance friezes expressing the glory and brevity of human life, the globe, the skull, the bowl of rotting fruit.\n\nOnly now we’re strapped into a velour armchair, drooling down our necks, being force-fed endless brain-shredding content and just wanting to feel something. I … love her. I love Sandra Frottwangle (funeral director). And she’s right. All the games are the same. But we still want the games.\n\nEither all of that stuff, or the people who make daytime TV adverts are bored twentysomething creatives who just thought it would be funny to put the words “funeral director” over shots of an actor pretending to be really into gambling websites. Probably it’s one or the other.\n\nAnd yes, this is supposed to be about the Scottish Premiership title race, which enters its spring ignition phase this weekend, and which is now arguably the most interesting title race in Europe.\n\nEither way Sunday’s Old Firm derby at Ibrox is a genuinely rare thing. For once this is not a title decider. It could be a title eliminator. It could be a step towards neither of Celtic or Rangers winning the league for the first time in 41 years. A draw in Glasgow could leave Hearts six points clear at the top. But by now it is a startling transformation whatever the outcome.\n\nHearts finished 40 points behind Celtic last year. The great clanking hand of Tony Bloom and his big data hive-brain robots has been on site for only eight months. The word “disruption” is usually shorthand for tech bro types in $4,000 Japanese trainers working out new ways to fire people. This is actual, good disruption. A three-way title race isn’t just deeply un-Scotland, it’s deeply un-anywhere these days.\n\nIn the major European leagues only Greece, Denmark and Poland have something this close. The trend is towards stratification, dead air after Christmas, a single basking giant or a two-way chase energetically spun by the broadcasters. Money has made this happen. The Premier League in particular has harvested talent, turning previously robust leagues into clearing houses, exit lounges to the life-altering four-year deal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Hearts have sustained a title challenge and it has provided a welcome alternative to the traditional dominance of Celtic and Rangers. Photograph: Steve Welsh/PA\n\nThis is perhaps partly the case in Scotland. But there is also a sense of useful incompetence in play, accidental competitiveness. The Glasgow clubs have spent decades trying to sustain a place in the roided-up Euro elite, taking it in turns to fall over their feet. Now we have this, a perfect storm of super-smart newcomer and a pair of sleepwalking giants.\n\nThere are other places for proper chapter and verse on whether Hearts can sustain this. The key aspect at this stage is that this title race has taken on a sense of outside life. My own kids follow every Hearts game with a rare sense of urgency, despite being fully TikTok-brained, zombified by reel culture.\n\nIt is, of course, only one season. It could all fall away quite rapidly. But there is also a lesson here, perhaps even a control experiment. Because big football is often boring now. The direction of travel is fewer meaningful matches, a cartel of mega-clubs resting on the ropes, a Champions League group stage that feels like an autumn exhibition tour.\n\nThe idea is out there that younger people will be happy with this, will feast instead on clips, screengrabs, parasocial celebrity worship; that young people are essentially industrialised idiots who have for the first time in all human existence lost the craving for actual narrative.\n\nThe reality is this culture creates a yearning for something else. Marketing people will assume hate clicks, or boredom clicks, or any kind of clicks represent actual value and desire. But young people also like real things.\n\nFinding interest in a competitive football league is a bit like getting into vinyl, or books made from paper, or the revelation, usually via an American man on YouTube who looks as if he keeps a collection of children’s dolls in a shed, that food can actually be made from ingredients.\n\nPerhaps Scottish football has fallen into a less globalist version of how to thrive. Tend to the soil. Build it and they will come. The league has plenty that can be weaponised: deep history, heritage value, the same authenticity that made it so moreish back in the days when Old Firm games were basically catharsis, insanity, people at the edge of their own emotions colliding for 90 minutes.\n\nWhy do sporting leagues roll over so willingly? Why do they turn themselves inside out, shred the basis of their own value – English cricket: we see you – in order to chase those precarious streams of macro-money? What if you just stopped trying to expand outward in every direction? What if the guiding principle is: what will make the thing we have right here in front of us better? Why not go hyper-local?\n\nThere is an argument that Hearts winning would be better for Rangers and Celtic. It energises the league, supercharges the brand, speaks to the desire for sporting tension among those bored by the drift of big football.\n\nWe have replaced a great deal that was valuable with generalised digital noise. In a sense we are all strapped into our armchairs now, craving a place where the games are different, anything with heart and life to distract us from the grey, out there staring into the void with Sandra Frottwangle eyes."

            "content": "Arsenal had to expect the jibes from Tottenham and they were not disappointed. Just before kick-off in last Sunday’s north London derby, the Spurs support in the South Stand of their stadium spelled out a giant message in mosaic form. “North Ldn since 1882,” it read.\n\nA clear dig, then, at Arsenal’s south of the river history from the Woolwich days and, as mentioned, very much a part of a rivalry where goading and baiting go hand in hand with the loathing. Arsenal had been similarly provocative before the derby against Spurs at the Emirates Stadium last November, lighting the pre-match scene with a tifo featuring images of various club greats. The most prominent at the top of it? Sol Campbell, of course.\n\nWhat was more surprising – and certainly led to raised eyebrows at Arsenal – was Wolves’ now infamous TikTok post on the Thursday before last. The 80-second clip, uploaded after the 2-2 draw between the clubs the previous night, was a savage take on Arsenal’s “game management”. Or, to put it another way, and as Wolves surely intended, their dark arts and shithousery.\n\nThe social media team at Wolves showed how Gabriel Martinelli taunted the home crowd by flashing up the scoreline on his fingers as Arsenal led 2-1. They highlighted the delay in Arsenal taking a corner as they continued to lead. They mocked Gabriel Magalhães for going down after an apparent head clash before he got back up and carried on.\n\nThere was indignation from the in-house commentators when Leandro Trossard also went to ground after an aerial clash in the 90th minute. In the background, it was easy to make out the chant from the Wolves fans: “Same old Arsenal, always cheating.” There was laughter and the corresponding emojis on the clip when Wolves equalised at the bitter end.\n\nThere was more from elsewhere later in the day. At tea time, Manchester City’s X account piped up with a three-year-old clip of their team playing keep-ball by the corner flag in the dying minutes of a 2-0 home victory over Newcastle. “Seeing out the win,” read the text with a tick emoji above footage of Erling Haaland and Jack Grealish, well, managing the game to a successful conclusion. It was a mickey-take with an obvious target.\n\nThis is where Arsenal find themselves as they prepare for Sunday’s home game against Chelsea – the latest staging post in their draining push for the Premier League title. Their rivals, big and small, are lining up the pot shots, eager to have fun at their expense, to prey on their sensitivities. To drive a particular narrative and make Arsenal prisoners of it.\n\nThe Wolves TikTok clip overlooked a major detail when it came to Trossard. On as a 73rd-minute substitute, the winger was cleaned out by a shoulder barge from Santiago Bueno, who was on a yellow card. Trossard had eyes only for the high ball; the Wolves defender looked directly at him and left a calling card on his opponent’s jaw. A dazed Trossard was forced off after treatment, Arsenal relieved that he avoided injury, and how do you think the club’s doctors felt about essentially being accused of complicity in a plot to run down the clock?\n\nNobody thought about that. They were too busy enjoying the clip, which went viral for the reason that these things always do. It struck a chord. It fed a perception with which opposing fans are seemingly on board. Arsenal as the roughhouse guys – and not only when they are loading men into the six-yard box on corners. The ones that will do whatever it takes to win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Leandro Trossard’s injury at Wolves seemed to invoke opprobrium from the home side. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nArsenal were much better than Spurs. They deserved to beat them, which they did; to clear their heads after the trauma of Wolves. As an aside, it was only this Spurs team. Chelsea ought to be a tougher prospect. Yet Arsenal did get away with one in the 53rd minute as they led 2-1. Would it have been different if Randal Kolo Muani had not been penalised for the slightest of pushes into Gabriel’s back before he shot past David Raya? At the very least, Arsenal would have felt their anxiety levels rise.\n\nGabriel drew the contact to the referee’s attention in theatrical fashion, as he had done at Newcastle last September in a similar situation against Nick Woltemade. That day, the referee said no foul and Woltemade scored. This time, Gabriel got the decision.\n\nWhat did Gabriel do after the game? Did he a) keep his head down and quietly count his blessings? Or b) post a picture to social media of him holding a hand of cards with the four of hearts visible, signifying his team’s four goals? He went for the latter, even tagging the Spurs forward Richarlison. Cue a host of diving memes in the responses. Was goading really the right option given the climate around the club? On the other hand, you have to admire Gabriel’s chutzpah.\n\nMikel Arteta’s response to what we are obliged to call the “outside noise” has been to narrow the focus; to dial up the intensity while also talking up his players and their mindset. The manager has his eyes on the prize and there are a number of points that need to be made, beginning with the feeling towards him and his side in coaching circles.\n\nTowards the end of January, Pep Guardiola described Arsenal as the “best team in the world” and it did not sound like just mind games from the City manager. The Wolves head coach, Rob Edwards, messaged Arteta after last week’s game to say that Arsenal were the best side in the league and there have been others in their positions who have privately expressed the highest admiration for what Arteta is doing. Namely, how Arsenal press, massing men around the ball, cutting off the passing lanes, forcing turnovers. How they dominate in possession, playing on the front foot, creating overloads, moving it quickly. The watchwords are remorselessness and control.\n\nAccording to Opta, Arsenal have had seven yellow cards for time-wasting in the league this season – the same number as Chelsea and behind only Bournemouth and Fulham, who each have eight. They are the seventh-worst offenders for the average time of delays for restarts, taking in set pieces and goal-kicks. They sit behind Sunderland, Brentford, Crystal Palace, Newcastle, Leeds and Burnley on the list in that order.\n\nArteta and his players remain at the centre of a storm, buffeted by ill winds, Chelsea ready to bring the latest of them. If Arsenal hold their nerve, they will have done it the hard way."

            "content": "“I just want to have my name out there to the point where when someone hears it they know instantly who is being talked about,” says the Chelsea full-back Chloe Sarwie. “I want to be that player who can amaze people constantly and that is up there as one of the best.”\n\nYou could be forgiven for viewing this level of confidence as arrogant, but you would be wrong. The talented 17-year-old defender comes across as grounded, intelligent, hard-working and humble, but her edge is a steely belief in her football.\n\nSarwie is speaking to the Guardian shortly before signing her first professional contract, four months after her debut in the 1-1 draw with Twente in the Champions League and three months after her first call-up to the England Under-23s.\n\nSarwie is back with the under‑23s for next month’s games against France and the Netherlands, one of two 17-year-olds considered good enough to compete alongside those vying for a chance in the senior side (the other is Erica Meg Parkinson, who plays her club football in Portugal). Last summer, at 16, she was in the squad that competed at the Under-19 Euros in Poland. “I was taken aback and I didn’t really have any expectations so it was incredible,” she says.\n\n“It’s honestly a really intense environment and every training session everyone just wants to one-up each other. It gets really competitive and just being around that wanting-to-win group was incredible.”\n\nHer Chelsea debut in October, when still 16, came as a surprise. “As soon as I got the nod from Sonia [Bompastor] that I’d be coming on for Sandy [Baltimore] and making my debut, I was just down on the sideline, shocked but pumped and ready to get on the pitch,” says Sarwie, who entered the fray against Twente in the 73rd minute.\n\nShe impressed instantly, playing with an admirable fearlessness. “Honestly, when I stepped on that pitch, I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know how to play, but I was just trying to play my part for the team, fit in and see what I could do. Towards the end of the game, I was being myself a bit more and the more playing time I’m getting, the more I’m able to express myself, but my full self hasn’t come out yet.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Chloe Sarwie (right) made her Chelsea debut in the Champions League draw with Twente last October. Photograph: Chris Lee/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\nChelsea are well equipped at right-back, with two of the world’s best in Lucy Bronze and Ellie Carpenter at their disposal, but at left-back there is a hole. With Baltimore performing well in the position but naturally a more attacking player and Niamh Charles out with an ankle injury, there have been some opportunities for Sarwie, against Crystal Palace in the FA Cup and West Ham and Tottenham in the Women’s Super League.\n\nShould her development continue at its accelerated pace there is also the chance to stake a claim in the senior England squad that has had question marks at left‑back under Sarina Wiegman. London City Lionesses’ Poppy Pattinson is the latest to receive a call-up with an eye on finding a solution to the conundrum.\n\nSarwie was introduced to the Chelsea senior side in pre-season. It was “quite exciting but also quite nerve-racking”, though training and playing with the first team has been hugely beneficial. “It’s a great challenge and I love being challenged and going up against these players, seeing how their level compares to mine and how I can get to that level,” says Sarwie.\n\n“Obviously, Lucy’s at England as well and being able to have that connection is great, even though I’m in one of the lower age groups because, ultimately, I’m learning how I can then progress to that next step and be part of the senior squad. That’s where she can give me tips and show what it takes.”\n\nSarwie began playing football in the park on her own, light on her feet thanks to ballet from the ages of two until eight. “I used to turn up to ballet with muddy tights after playing football and rolling around in the mud for a good hour or two. But ballet had a big impact on my journey as a football player as my dribbling playing style kind of links back to it. Ballet made me light on my feet. I also had to adapt from a ballet mindset, from a solo stage, to a football mindset and a team performance stage.”\n\nIt was in the park where coaches would approach her and tell her she should be playing for a club and eventually she thought: “Why not?” After a season at Millwall, she had trials at Arsenal and Chelsea and had offers from both. “I had to pick Chelsea because it was closer,” she says. “I let my family down on that one because they’re all Arsenal supporters, but oh well.”\n\nShe juggles playing and training with studying for her BTec in engineering and her mum, Jean, who is a teacher at her school, is the force that has enabled her to pursue football. She takes her laptop everywhere, to catch up with coursework, with one day a week spent in the classroom.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie takes a selfie with fans after featuring in the FA Cup against Crystal Palace. Photograph: Sport Press Photo/Alamy\n\nSarwie is having to contend with an influx of information. “It’s mad trying to switch the brain from studying engineering to football and back,” she says. “I’m still taking in everything in relation to the first team. I have all that information coming at me and then I have to go home, switch off and then do my work and it’s all a bit chaotic.”\n\nOn the pitch, there is also a balance to be struck between what is being asked of her and instinct. “Sometimes on the pitch I can be quite hesitant because I’m trying to think about what I should do at that moment instead of what I want to do, because that’s sometimes two different things. The coach wants me to do something but I want to do something else in the moment and it’s about quickly processing which one I should do.\n\n“Every day I’m getting new information coming in and I’m just trying to soak that up but trying to show myself on the pitch and putting those words into actions on the pitch can be quite difficult and it’s going to be like that for a while because of my age.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie practised ballet until the age of eight. ‘It made me light on my feet,’ she says. Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\n“Once I’m on the pitch I just want to be my most relaxed self. Breathing techniques on the pitch really help me stay calm and I’ve been told I look arrogant doing this, but chewing gum on the pitch makes me relax as well.\n\n“I want to be that person that looks in place and calm with the rest of the team, that calms that team down. I don’t want to be nervous when I get the ball, or for them to be nervous when I get the ball, I want to get the ball and to express myself as much as possible with it.”"

            "content": "As Wolves applied the seal to only their second Premier League victory of the season, Rodrigo Gomes doubling their lead over Aston Villa deep into second-half stoppage time, Rob Edwards hared down the touchline, yelling into the stands as his players started a celebratory pile-on a few yards behind him. It was a moment of catharsis for Edwards, who beat his chest and wellied an advertising hoarding, but for Unai Emery it was a different kind of cue.\n\nAs those in old gold savoured a win over near neighbours that takes them to 13 points, ending any fears that they may not eclipse Derby’s record-low tally of 11 in 2007-08, Emery marched straight down the tunnel before the post-match handshakes.\n\nWolves’s other Premier League win came against West Ham at the start of last month and no wonder the supporters savoured every second. “The two games we’ve won in the league this year, both managers have disappeared from the touchline,” Edwards said with a smile. “I think everyone expects just to turn up and win, which is understandable given how this season has gone.”\n\nAt the end of the season, how costly might this untimely slip prove for Villa? Judging by the way Emery fumed, this defeat will hurt for a while yet and, significantly, it could have major implications for their hopes of returning to the Champions League. They are on a poor run of form having taken only one win in their past six matches in all competitions and 12 points from their past nine league games. Emery called for perspective.\n\n“Maybe you can say: ‘We are losing the chance to the win the Premier League,’” Emery said animatedly. “Some supporters maybe were dreaming. Now we are not with the possibility to fight for the Premier League, some can feel frustrated, even myself because I have my dreams. In September I was worried and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. One month ago I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League.”\n\nView image in fullscreen A sodden Unai Emery tries to spur on his Aston Villa team as they struggled against Wolves. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters\n\nVilla were unpicked by a team almost certainly heading for the Championship but, as they did when rousing to a draw against the leaders, Arsenal, Wolves showed they will go down fighting.\n\nJoão Gomes fired in his first goal in a year just after the hour, starting the move himself after nutmegging the Villa substitute Ross Barkley, and then Rodrigo Gomes put the game beyond doubt on the counterattack, after Yerson Mosquera and José Sá combined to deny Amadou Onana. Morgan Rogers’s attempt to recycle a corner ended with Wolves attacking three v two. Rogers had his face in the turf as Rodrigo Gomes swivelled near the penalty spot and buried the ball past Emiliano Martínez.\n\nIt was never going to be an evening for the purists and driving rain did little to enhance this soggy Midlands derby as a spectacle. It was a contest bogged down by misplaced passes, clunky touches and the ball slowing unpredictably on a saturated surface. Ezri Konsa can vouch for that, the Villa centre-back nudging the ball back to Martínez with his big toe, just as Adam Armstrong sought to prey on Douglas Luiz’s loose pass. It was a night for the poncho-clad Wolves supporters in the uncovered Graham Hughes stand in a corner of this stadium. Hugo Bueno looked battle-hardened, the reverse of the Wolves full-back’s old gold shirt caked in mud.\n\nEmery grew increasingly agitated as the game went on. He exploded as Jadon Sancho declined to take a shot first time at the back post and there was a restlessness within the home support too. Edwards gestured for calm as the locals aired their frustration at Jackson Tchatchoua looking inside for the perceived easy pass. Wolves struggled to hold on to the ball and when they did have it surrendered possession cheaply, João Gomes among those guilty. Sá, wearing the captain’s armband, shanked a goal-kick straight out of play to the disbelief of those in the stands.\n\nWolves, certainly not lacking in spirit, defended admirably. Tchatchoua did well to halt Ian Maatsen, one of those thrown on by Emery as Villa chased the game. Toti Gomes halted an advancing Leon Bailey, another second-half substitute. Bueno blocked off all avenues for Cash and turned to celebrate with the home fans. Then, at the final whistle, having doubled their lead, Wolves let loose."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says his Tottenham players are not fit enough and has questioned their desire to put in the hard yards without the ball.\n\nThe interim head coach has a clearer idea of the problems he faces after two weeks – and there are many of them, including low levels of confidence and the capacity of the younger players to handle the pressure of a relegation battle.\n\nTudor knows there are reasons for the physical issues with the squad stretched by an injury crisis amid a punishing schedule. Although Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso are in contention to return for Sunday’s trip to Fulham, Tottenham will be without eight injured players plus the suspended Cristian Romero.\n\nTudor believes there is only one way out of the situation – an on-the-hoof fitness reboot in training, particularly as the club had no midweek fixture last week or this. The Croat surprised the players by working them extremely hard throughout last week and not tapering off before last Sunday’s home game against Arsenal, which they lost 4-1. As Tudor made plain, it is not a time to pander to player sensibilities.\n\n“Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,” Tudor said. “They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and it made the physical condition of the team drop down. So we need to use this period where we don’t play the games to put some petrol in the engine so the engine starts to work better.\n\n“They are fatigued. To do the pressing high you need to be fit. But [it is] all of them because if someone is not in the right shape there is a problem because someone is coming late [to the press].\n\n“The second thing is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back. If you run up and don’t run back it’s a problem. For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it’s a big question what we can do and what we cannot do.”\n\nTudor was asked about his full-throttle approach from the first training session. “Yes, that’s the only way – running,” he said. “The pitch is 100 yards, it’s long. So you need to run.\n\n“Maybe you have habits to, I don’t know … work a bit less. I put some runs without the ball [into the sessions]. Never players like runs without the ball so we put some runs without balls. But it’s a moment when there is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn’t like. And the best thing is that they understand this. They gave me their availability to do these things.”\n\nTudor is under no illusions about the size of the challenge. It was put to him that the striker, Randal Kolo Muani, had played well against Arsenal. “That’s good, one good thing,” he replied.\n\nWhat Tudor wants to see at Fulham and beyond is players such as Kolo Muani stepping up, accepting the responsibility. “Some players are still young,” he said. “They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to resolve the problems.\n\nView image in fullscreen Randal Kolo Muani scores against Arsenal – Igor Tudor wants him to keep raising his game for Spurs. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\n“If you have too many of these players because of the amount of injuries, who are playing together in the squad, it does create some problems. But it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man. To say: ‘Come on, I’m the guy, give me the ball, I will score.’ Instead of just: ‘What can I do? I’m just here, you know.’\n\n“It’s always how you see the situation. It’s not: ‘I’m just here. We had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play.’ How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy and positive, there is opportunity.”\n\nTudor has not dwelt for long on the derby with Arsenal. “No, no, forget that,” he said. It was never likely to be a game that would define the club’s survival hopes. The same is not true of Fulham – or the home fixture against Crystal Palace next Thursday.\n\n“After the first game, I said if you play against the best team in the world at this moment, it’s not a realistic game to show [whether] we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,” Tudor said. “That’s the truth. They show they can be in some parts of the game. But for long periods we had problems, in defence especially. It’s not easy against them. Let’s see in the next games.”"

            "content": "Premier League clubs are unhappy with Uefa’s decision to reveal details of their financial results before some have been published and without warning.\n\nChelsea’s record pre-tax loss of £355m last season formed a key part of Uefa’s European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report, which was presented by its executive director, Andrea Traverso, at the Financial Times’s Business of Football Summit on Thursday, with the losses incurred by Tottenham and Aston Villa also featuring prominently.\n\nThe issue is understood to have been discussed by Premier League representatives at Friday’s Champions League draw in Nyon, where there was agreement that Uefa had failed to keep them informed.\n\nNone of the clubs were briefed about Uefa’s plans, leaving Chelsea in particular frustrated at being given no time to prepare for questions on their results. The club are not planning to publish their 2024-25 accounts until the end of March.\n\nChelsea, while not contesting the £355m loss, which is based on information they provided to Uefa, insist the headline figure does not reflect the economic reality.\n\nClub sources have disclosed that the record loss reflects non-cash accounting adjustments required by Uefa’s financial sustainability regulations, specifically one-off transactions related to player contract and asset write-offs, and that they are profitable on an operational basis.\n\nChelsea were fined £27m by Uefa last summer for breaching its spending restrictions and ordered to submit to a business plan, but are confident of avoiding another sanction. As part of that settlement agreement Chelsea were permitted to continue running at a substantial loss, as long as it remained in line with “the projected deficit submitted in the business plan”."

            "content": "1. Title run-in all about ‘little details’ Pep Guardiola has told his Manchester City players their pursuit of honours in the final three months of the season will depend on their “brains and minds”. City, who remain in contention for four trophies, meet title rivals Arsenal in the Carabao Cup final and Newcastle in the fifth-round of the FA Cup next month, as well as Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League. In the Premier League, they are five points behind Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal with a game in hand. City have had no midweek games for two weeks and – after the visit to Leeds on Saturday – Guardiola has given his players Sunday to Tuesday off as he believes the challenge in the defining part of the campaign is more mental than technical. Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more “There are still things that we should train and practise more, but I prioritised rest,” Guardiola said. “With three months left, there are many things that the team have improved in and still some things that the team has to improve, but now it is the little details. “Now it is how it is in your brains and your minds that will make the difference. Maybe for the new players it is new, but we have talked a lot in many meetings for many years that, when you arrive in the last three months, competing in all competitions, everything is here [points to his head].” Jamie Jackson\n\nEddie Howe has urged Anthony Gordon not to be distracted by reports linking him with a summer move to Arsenal amid speculation that the 25-year-old winger will be a target for the title-chasing Gunners. Howe, who is still dealing with the fallout from Alexander Isak’s defection to Liverpool last summer, could do without a repeat of that saga, but the Newcastle manager admits there is little he can do to prevent it. Newcastle face Gordon’s former cub Everton in the Premier League on Saturday and Howe said: “I’m not sure there’s a lot I can do about that. I’ve not seen the story, so it’s news to me. But we’re mid-season, we’re in the middle of some of the biggest games of his career and who knows what’s going to happen internationally with him in the summer as well? “He’s got no time to look left or right, he’s got to be fully focused on straight ahead and the next game and trying to be as good as he can be.” View image in fullscreen Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon is reported to be on Arsenal’s wishlist. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA Gordon, who earlier this month dismissed rumours he was on the way out of the club where he signed a new contract in October 2024, will hope to continue his good run of form to secure a place in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for this summer’s World Cup finals and Howe is hopeful he will not be unsettled by talk over his future. “It comes with the territory of being a top player and playing at this level, that there’s going to be speculation,” said Howe. “You’ve just got to put it out of your brain and you’ve got to focus on the football because as we know with our schedule, there’s so many games, there’s no time for distractions. We have to be fully focused on each match.” PA Media\n\n3. Moyes blames referees for corner ‘dark arts’ David Moyes has claimed corner-kick routines are turning into wrestling contests because referees have ignored “the dark arts” for too long. Moyes’s Everton team were criticised for crowding the Manchester United goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, at several corners during their 1-0 defeat at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Monday. Ahead of Saturday’s game at Newcastle, the Everton manager insisted that went against his gameplan but he, and other managers, would seek any advantage that the laws of the game offer. However, he also believes referees should take a harder line to try to eradicate jostling at set-pieces. “Truthfully, it wasn’t the plan for our corner kicks to end up like that. But I think there’s a bigger issue with it,” Moyes said. “It has been allowed to let go, whether it be blocking of goalkeepers or blocking of defenders, and you get the feeling now that referees really don’t want to get involved in any of it. It is nearly wrestling to an extent, which it shouldn’t be. It should never have got to this situation, but I think it’s been really poor that they’ve not tried to deal with it well enough and stop it. “You are now allowed lots of blocking, for example. In my day, if you blocked someone it would have been a free-kick. But blocking has become a big part of it. Let’s be fair, the best at it – but with style – would be Arsenal: good delivery, good style, but ultimately there’s a lot of dark arts in it such as blocking the goalkeeper from the back or the front, blocking defenders and making it difficult for them to be your key headers of the ball. “It is a big thing in football, but I do think the level of refereeing has let that part of the game drop. And managers, if we see somebody else doing it and not getting punished for it, then we are all on it.” View image in fullscreen More wrestling match than football as Manchester United and Everton players indulge in some dark arts from a corner. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images Ironically, Moyes felt Everton’s approach in the closing stages against United worked against his team. He wanted more variety from Everton’s corners but claimed: “It was very difficult to get the message on.” Moyes admitted: “The plan was not to deliver the corners in the fashion we did the other night. They shouldn’t have been delivered as close to the goalkeeper. They should have been delivered into different areas at different times according to what we had worked on. It became a bit of a wrestling match and I didn’t think it showed enough quality or enough thought.” Andy Hunter\n\n4. Glasner wary of United’s Carrick bounce Oliver Glasner credits Michael Carrick for imbuing Manchester United with a “great spirit” and “clear structure” since his appointment last month. No team has picked up more Premier League points in 2026 than United, with Carrick winning five of his six games in charge since replacing Ruben Amorim. Palace have been a thorn in United’s side in recent years, winning three of their five last encounters, but Glasner expects Carrick’s side to be in fine form on Sunday when the Eagles head to Old Trafford. View image in fullscreen The Crystal Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, steered his team into the last 16 of the Uefa Conference league on Thursday. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA “Of course, when Man United plays at home against Crystal Palace, everybody there is expecting now a win,” said Glasner. “They are a very good team now. They gave a very good balance between, it’s a very experienced team, with really, very experienced Premier League players, and very young players with huge talent. “It’s a good mix they have now, but I think the most important thing for them is they are consistently playing with their team and have a clear structure in the way they are playing. This is what I could see against Everton. They have a great spirit right now. It was really impressive seeing Matheus Cunha celebrating winning a duel in their own box. This, I think, is what Michael Carrick brought into this team.” PA Media"

It didn’t crash. It was a runway excursion,” he incredulously claimed.\n\nSeveral drivers were left injured as the aircraft performed an emergency braking manoeuvre.\n\nThe total number of casualties is still unknown and a probe has been launched into the cause of the crash.\n\nReports indicate that the stricken plane was transporting valuables from the Central Bank of Bolivia.\n\nHundreds of banknotes were scattered in the wreckage.\n\n\n\nA fire truck also sprayed the aircraft with the airport’s water tanks in case of a blaze, although the plane did not explode.\n\nThe injured have been rushed to a nearby hospital to receive specialist care.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 300 officers are still guarding the crash site as an estimated 15,000 hopefuls gather outside.\n\n\n\nSome have reportedly tried to knock down a metal fence in a bid to get to the money.\n\nIt comes as another 15 people including a congressman were killed in a horror crash in Colombia last month.\n\nJust 12 minutes after take-off, authorities lost all communication with Satena Airlines Flight HK4709, which had two crew and 13 passengers on board.\n\nTragically, there were no survivors, Colombia’s civil aviation authority said.\n\nThe government-owned airline did not say what caused the crash and said the plane’s emergency beacon had not been activated.\n\n\n\nDiógenes Quintero, a member of Colombia’s House of Representatives, and congressional candidate Carlos Salcedo Salaza were both on board the flight, according to a passenger list released by the airline.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe crash site was found near Colombia’s border with Venezuela in Curasica, Playa de Belén, Norte de Santander.\n\nPolitical party Union for the People claimed members of its officials’ teams were also on board the flight."

This was a large SUV type vehicle and was inevitably going to cause serious injury.\n\n“Had the car passed over someone’s head that person would have almost inevitably been killed.\n\n“The reality is that having lost your temper you were intent on causing mayhem and injury to those on the road.”\n\n\n\nProsecutor Daniel Oscroft said the car “reversed and circled back and round and drove at pedestrians knocking people over”.\n\nMr Calistus heard the “cracking” of his bones as the Mercedes rolled over him and later said he thought he was going to die.\n\nHe spent three weeks in hospital undergoing major surgery.\n\n\n\nIn a victim statement, the DJ said: “I was the victim of a serious incident which changed my life.\n\n“I am still undergoing treatment. I am left in constant pain, I have reduced mobility, have visible scars and psychological trauma.\n\n“It was not just my job it was my dream my purpose.”\n\nAfter the carnage, Suffi tried to dispose of the Mercedes and fled to Dubai before being brought to justice.\n\nHe was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent after a trial in December, having already admitted dangerous driving.\n\n\n\nSuffi, of Aston, Birmingham, was jailed for 11 years and six months and banned from driving for 10 years and seven months.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThree pals — Daanyal Hussain, 21, of Yardley; Mustafa Gohari, 21, of Acocks Green; and Armaan Abid, 23, of Handsworth — had earlier admitted affray.\n\nThey were each handed 11-month jail sentences, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to complete 180 hours of unpaid work."

During the Royal Variety Performance in 2014, Jack reflected on their shared schooling and revealed a somewhat \"inappropriate\" secret.\n\nAs he took to the stage amidst roaring applause, Jack acknowledged his link to Kate. \"I'm very excited to be here. I'm especially excited to be here performing in front of the Duchess of Cambridge,\" he told the audience.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Jack Whitehall is one of the Brit Award presenters this year (Image: NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images)\n\nHe went on: \"We were actually at school together. This is true. We were at the same school. I was a bit younger than you, but this is the first time I've seen you since school, so hello,\" reports the Mirror US.\n\nKate could be seen chuckling from her seat as Jack cheekily admitted: \"I don't know whether it's appropriate given the circumstances, but you were probably my first ever crush... Okay, definitely inappropriate. Your Highness is giving me a very sharp look,\" referring to Prince William.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJack later revealed William's response, telling Jonathan Ross: \"William came over and he was very funny, he was very nice but very passive aggressive [and said] 'Oh, so you were flirting with my missus? Oh no, that was very funny'.\"\n\nThis isn't the first occasion Jack has cracked jokes about Kate. Pondering why he might have been left off the guest list for King Charles's Coronation, Jack wondered if he'd overstepped the mark during a previous gig at Kensington Palace.\n\nThe comedian had been booked by the monarch to entertain at a staff Christmas bash at Kensington Palace. \"I went out, and they were sat, him and Camilla, in the front row in thrones, literally in thrones,\" he revealed to James Corden on The Late Late Show.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"And I had no microphone, so I was literally the court jester for half an hour. I did a load of jokes about Kate Middleton because she'd been at my school, and I was referring to her as 'the one that got away', which he didn't like at all.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I literally bombed so hard, and afterwards I had to meet him, and I had to bow, and he said, 'Yes, well, I think next year we might try a magician'.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share?

            "content": "EXCLUSIVE: 40 years ago a man died under a bush - his tragic end improved thousands of lives\n\nForty years ago, at the age of 75, \"Angel of Mercy\" Alison Kay started the People’s Kitchen, which today feeds 1,000 people a week, after a man died sleeping in freezing weather\n\nView 7 Images Trustee Maggie Pavlou says that friends today come from a variety of backgrounds, from people living on the street, sofa surfing or living in hostels (Image: Andy Commins)\n\nAilie Goddard remembers her last visit to Newcastle. “Last time I was at the People’s Kitchen, a man came up to me and said, ‘I come here to remember your mam and everything she did’,” she says. “I thought that was wonderful. To think he kept coming back, even after his own crisis had passed, because he had become part of a community.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAilie’s mum Alison Kay passed away in 2001, aged 91. But she remains a legend in her birth city. Her obituary in the Newcastle Chronicle called her the “Angel of Mercy”. Forty years ago, at the age of 75, Alison started the People’s Kitchen, which today feeds 1,000 people a week, after a man died sleeping in freezing weather in Leazes Park in the city centre.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBack in 1986, the North East was reeling from pit closures and the end of the miners’ strike, and while Margaret Thatcher’s Big Bang saw the City of London explode with wealth, families in Newcastle were suffering the effects of industrial decline and mass unemployment.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“It was the Thatcher era,” Ailie, 80, a retired secretary who worked for the Dutch consulate in Newcastle, says. “Jobs were changing, industry and heavy industry was going – ship- building, mining, heavy engineering. So, times were really hard for many. It started when Mum read in the newspaper that a homeless man had died alone under a bush in Newcastle. She couldn’t bear it.\n\nView 7 Images Alison Kay (Image: Andy Commins)\n\n\"She filled a Thermos full of coffee and wandered off into the city in the dead of night. She met one or two homeless people and they were very grateful for the coffee and she promised to do it every week. Then she ended up getting a trolley with coffee, soups and things like that and stood in the middle of Eldon Square.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAn outdoor soup kitchen on Dean Street followed. “People heard about it and joined her as volunteers,” Ailie says. “It very quickly expanded and that is why she needed to find premises. Eventually they found an old chapel on Bath Lane.” Today, the building is the “Alison Centre” from where The People’s Kitchen is run.\n\nAlison had lost her husband Arthur in 1971. When her beloved son Richard – Ailie’s brother – died aged just 50 in 1987, killed by a drunk-driver, she channelled her heartbreak into her work. In 1992, tragedy struck again when her other son David, 57, and wife Margaret, 59, died when their light aircraft crashed.\n\nView 7 Images Kitchen team leader Neil Bainbridge. (Image: Andy Commins)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nStill, Alison never lost the capacity to love and take care of people, long after she had become frail and registered blind. “I think of them as my children,” she said of the homeless and other struggling people fed at The People’s Kitchen. “Lots of them call me Mum and Gran. It’s love that keeps me going and I’ll continue until I die.”\n\nNow The People’s Kitchen still stands as a brown brick beacon of hope. The former Methodist Church, which stood on wasteland when it was bought by Alison with a £250k mortgage in 1997 – a debt cleared by an anonymous benefactor – is now dwarfed by shiny university buildings.\n\nInside, the need has only grown greater – but everyone that comes to seek help is still known as a “friend”. Trustee Maggie Pavlou says that friends today come from a variety of backgrounds, from people living on the street, sofa surfing or living in hostels – people who actually have accommodation but just can’t afford the electric to cook anything warm.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 7 Images The People's Kitchen has celebrated its 40th anniversary - a Newcastle-based charity born from a simple but powerful act of kindness (Image: Andy Commins)\n\n“More recently we have had people come to us with their work lanyard on because they simply can’t make ends meet,” Maggie says. “When I started volunteering here six years ago, we were doing on average 180 meals a night. Now we’re doing 300 every night. Hunger is an awful thing, and we pride ourselves on providing food and friendship. Our volunteers chat to our friends as sometimes that is the only conversation they’ve had all day.”\n\nToday 300 volunteers, all unpaid, staff a seven-day operation, which includes a canteen providing more than 1,000 meals a week. The service has grown and evolved – there are hairdryers, and places to shower, dry clothes, charge phones and get to know other people.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThere is a cosy reading nook as you enter, framed by bookshelves full of crime novels and comfy chairs. In a warren of back rooms there is a vast food and goods store, including donated goods from brands like long-term supporter and Newcastle-founded company, Greggs. There are “grab and go” toiletry kits for people who arrive in crisis, fleeing domestic violence or suddenly made homeless, and a store of sleeping bags, handwarmers, LED lights and mats for people sleeping rough – “we always have around 25 of these on standby,” Maggie explains.\n\nView 7 Images Trustee Jackie Boardman (Image: Andy Commins)\n\nThere is no limit to who can come, no form filling, and tonight everyone gets a piece of “chocolate crack” – a caramel biscuit slice topped with chocolate. Volunteer and retired librarian Marilyn Champion has been here since the start after meeting Alison on the street. Back then, she says, they gave out hot drinks and porridge to mainly homeless men.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“The idea is still the same,” Marilyn says. “We accept everybody, we accept the Friends for who they are.” But, today, the demographic has changed from mainly homeless men to families. This is backed up by research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation that shows almost one in four children in the city now live in poverty – up 10% since 2014. Meanwhile its growing housing crisis made national headlines just before Christmas when charity Crisis said it was buying housing stock in a once affordable city to meet a sharp rise in homelessness.\n\nA report this month by Professor Alice Wiseman, director of public health for Newcastle and Gateshead, found that 40,000 Newcastle residents are currently using foodbanks. Volunteer and stores manager, Kathy Devlin, 73, has been part of the team for nine years. “My son tried to take his own life,” she says. “He had us, his family, to support him but it made me realise a lot of people don’t have that. People are arriving at the door with no support, so I wanted to help. The people who come in uniforms can pay their bills and rent, but they don’t have anything left for food.”\n\n7 View 7 Images Ailie Goddard (Image: Supplied) 7 View 7 Images Volunteer Mac Bijald (Image: Andy Commins)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGhassan, 39, is originally from Palestine. He came here for support and food two years ago – now he volunteers in the kitchen three evenings a week. “This is good for me to practise English and meet new people,” he says. “This is a special place. Everyone can come here, and you will always be a friend.”\n\nAilie retired and moved to the Midlands, but still makes time to visit the centre named after her mum to hear the stories of people living better lives because of her legacy. “It’s hard to believe that 40 years later the need is still there,” Ailie says. “It’s busier than ever because things are quite bad at the moment. There are fewer jobs, a lot of people are struggling. All types of people need support now. People who 15 to 20 years ago would have been coping aren’t able to any more.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking that we’re still needed 40 years on. But it’s also a testament to the incredible volunteers and supporters who show up. It started with one person and a flask. Now it’s a lifeline for hundreds daily. Mum would have been very sad to see all these people needing help in 2026, but she’d be proud of the work being done too.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\n*If you would like to help out, visit: peopleskitchen.co.uk/donate"

The figures emerged as the Mirror campaigns for better access to NHS dentistry for everyone\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne ranked as one of hardest cities to find NHS dentist\n\nThe UK's chronic shortage of dentists is evidenced in a study that shows a staggering proportion of people have not had their teeth checked since turning 18.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe most desperate need is highlighted in Newcastle, where one in 10 people are affected. A poll of 2,000 adults found that 10 percent of those from the North East had not been treated as adults. The figures emerged as the Mirror campaigns for better access to NHS dentistry for everyone. Health Secretary Wes Streeting faces a mammoth task reforming dental care for millions of patients.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAcross the UK as a whole, six per cent of adults, the equivalent of 3.6 million people, have never been to a dentist. Healthcare firm Haleon found that women were slightly more likely to visit the dentist as adults.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Age-wise, those in middle age were the worst offenders, with 9% of those aged 45-54 admitting never going to get their teeth checked since turning 18. Those aged 18-24 were ‘best’, with just four percent saying they’d never been as an adult, compared to six percent aged 35-44.\n\nIn Newcastle, dental patients described the problems they faced getting NHS appointments in the city. Bobbie Buddin, 25, who works at 'Mac 'N' Cheese' in the Grainger Market, was in 'agony' from a wisdom tooth earlier this year.\n\nView 6 Images Market worker Bobbie Buddin had to go to Newcastle's Dental Hospital to see a student dentist\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDue to the high cost of treatment, she was forced to go to Newcastle Dental Hospital to be seen by a trainee dentist. \"It was pretty awful,\" she told the Mirror. \"I was having real problems because the pain kept me awake at night. It was pericoronitis, inflammation around the wisdom tooth.\n\n\"If I went to the dentist it was going to cost me £60-£70 and I just could not afford that. So I went to the dental hospital where a student dentist cleaned the tooth out. A fully qualified dentist then checks it. It was free.\"\n\nView 6 Images Dave Kay is no longer treated at his NHS dental practice because he missed an appointment during Covid.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nButcher Dave Kay, 63, of Chapel House, Newcastle, was removed from his dentist's patient list six years ago during lockdown. He has not seen a dentist since then. \"I missed the appointment and that was it,\" he said. \"I have the same problem with the GP because I am at work and can only get time off on a Monday or a Wednesday. I have not had any problems with my teeth, touch wood, but if I did, I would have to go private.\"\n\nColleague Jeremy Eden, 56, of Ponteland, Newcastle, has an 18-mile round trip to an NHS dentist in Crawcook, Gateshead. He said that his private appointments became too expensive. \"It is a 25-minute drive because I don't live anywhere near Crawcrook,\" he said. \"But it was the only dentist accepting NHS patients. I used to go to Birtley which was even further away. The private dentist near me was just too expensive.\"\n\nAccording to beauty shop owner Lisa Gray, 52, and greengrocer Barry Moore, the secret may be to find a dentist and stick with them. Lisa, who lives in Wardley, Gateshead but works in Newcastle, said: \"My daughter was kicked out by her dentist but she is the most forgetful person I know. She did not like to go. I am a patient at the same practice and have been going there for 25 years. They are so friendly and helpful, which counts for a lot. I have never missed an appointment so perhaps that is the secret.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 6 Images Lisa Gray has managed to obtain regular dental treatment\n\nBarry Moore, 63, of Denton Burn, Newcastle, who has worked in the Grainger market for 41 years, added: \"I am an NHS patient and I always turn up for appointments so I have never had any problem.\" But Jaime Cura, 49, of \"Geordie Bangers\" in the Grainger Market, was also removed from her NHS dentist's patient list during lockdown. She has not had a dental appointment for six years and is considering her parents' practice in Orwell, Cambs., a 480-mile round trip.\n\n\"I moved up here from Kent eight years ago,\" she said. \"I did see a dentist in 2020 but I did not receive a reminder for an appointment two years later. They removed me from the list. I have not been able to find another dentist since then.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"My parents live just outside Cambridge and it seems so much easier for them. My sister lives in Saffron Walden and she has to go to Braintree in Essex to see her dentist.\n\nView 6 Images Fruit and veg man Barry Moore is also happy with his teeth checking\n\n\"It may be easier for me to get an appointment in Cambridge when I go to see my parents.\" People from the South East of England were most likely to see a dentist, according to the latest research, with just three percent saying they’d never gone as an adult.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nReasons given for skipping visits include fear of the dentist (dentophobia). One in five people surveyed gave that as a reason, along with one in four who said it was ‘too costly’.\n\nEight percent hoped tooth problems would ‘go away,’ while 20 percent used social media for advice on teeth and gums. Analysis from Economist Impact, through its Health Inclusivity Index, also found that one-in-four Brits who are registered with a dentist say they cannot get an appointment.\n\nView 6 Images Jaime Cura who has struggled to find an NHS dentist since moving to Tyneside\n\nArticle continues below\n\nA total of 13 percent said they weren’t even able to register with a dentist near where they live. Stats show that tooth decay results in 32 million lost working hours each year, costing £605 million annually.\n\nThe regional league of shame showing the number of people least likely to go to the dentist:\n\n1 - North East - 10% 2 - South West - 9% 3 - Wales - 9% 4 - East of England - 7% 5 - Scotland - 6% 6 - Yorkshire & Humber - 6% 7 - North West - 5% 8 - East Midlands - 5% 9 - West Midlands - 4% 10 - South East - 3%"

It's a simple task, but many still get it wrong, and, of course, nobody is perfect, although householders should try to get it right to make the lives of refuse collectors' simpler.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOne refuse collector, Ashley, known as The No1 Binman, has amassed thousands of followers thanks to his handy tips and bin-related life hacks, along with his no-nonsense attitude towards people who complain about trash. His expert guidance is certainly worth listening to, as it'll save you a visit to the tip!\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAccording to Ashley, binmen can decline to collect your rubbish if particular items are found in the incorrect bins, and these include the following items...\n\n‌\n\n\n\n1. Pizza boxes\n\nView 3 Images Make sure that your pizza boxes aren't greasy (Stock Image) (Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe said: \"Pizza boxes should not be in the recycling bin. They should be in your general waste bin, whatever colour that will be. You are told to put all cardboard in the blue bin. I don't know what your blue bin is, I don't know.\n\n\"Let's just make this clear, pizza boxes - general waste bin, not recycling bin. That's all I needed to say. It doesn't matter what colour your bin is, it goes in your general waste.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhile some pizza boxes can be recycled, this should only be done if they're clean and dry. To handle this correctly, you must remove and dispose of any greasy food remnants or stained sections, particularly the base.\n\nIf the item is excessively soiled, it should go into the general waste bin or be used for composting. The clean cardboard lid, however, can go in the paper and card recycling bin.\n\nYou may not be aware that refuse collectors can reject a complete recycling bin if it contains non-recyclable, contaminated items, such as soiled or greasy pizza boxes. This occurs because food and grease stop the cardboard fibres from bonding during the pulping process, making the material unsuitable for recycling.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n2. Crisp packets\n\nThe No1 Binman shared: \"Crisp packets do not belong in your recycling bin. You're meant to take them to the supermarket and recycle them there, because it's a different type of plastic.\n\n\"Just like carrier bags, just like film, bubble wrap - all that stuff does not go in your recycling. Take it to the tip, they can sometimes dispose of it there differently, or take it to a supermarket.\n\n\"There's loads of stuff. Polystyrene is plastic, but it doesn't go in your recycling bin because it takes up too much room, and it costs too much money to recycle because there's barely any plastic in it. It's mainly air.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Please check before you put it in your bin. Normally, it's like tins and bottles. Easy things to put in the recycling. Please check before you do it because you don't want your bin to be contaminated. Don't be the person who gets their bin rejected when you want it to be emptied.\"\n\n3. Wrapping paper\n\nView 3 Images You should check whether your wrapping paper can be recycled (Stock Image) (Image: Getty)\n\nWhen it's someone's birthday or a special celebration and lot of gifts have been given, it's really important to check whether the paper gift-givers have opted for is actually recyclable. It can be confusing to know which elements you can recycle.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe said: \"It depends on the wrapping paper. So if you have actual wrapping paper paper, what you should be able to do with it is screw it into a ball – and if it stays in the ball, it's just paper, and that can go in your paper recycling bin.\n\n\"If it's got lots of Sellotape or labels all over it, then take them off and then just put it in the paper bin. Save some room in your general waste.\n\n\"But if you screw into a ball and it starts expanding back out again, that's got mainly plastic in it, and that should not go in your paper bin. It's not paper, it's mainly plastic, and it's got a film over it – that one would go in your general waste.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEven though local councils can have differing regulations, he uses the scrunch test as a general rule of thumb. Ashley added: \"If it expands, it's plastic – if it stays as it is, it's paper.\"\n\nIt only takes two seconds to scrunch the wrapping to see if it's suitable for recycling, so be sure to do it before chucking it away.\n\n4. Condoms\n\nAshley shared that condoms should always be placed in the general waste bin. Never even attempt to recycle them at any time.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThis is because they are made from materials like latex, polyurethane, or polyisoprene, which are not compatible with standard recycling processes. These materials do not break down in recycling facilities and can actually damage recycling equipment.\n\nAdditionally, condoms are considered single-use personal hygiene products, which means they may contain bodily fluids and are classified as medical waste.\n\nThis makes them unsuitable for recycling due to health and safety concerns. For these reasons, condoms should be disposed of in the regular trash rather than being placed in recycling bins.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death.

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

Being blunt about everything that everyone thought wasn't right,' he added.\n\n'If you're five or six weeks in and you think he's not delivering, okay, then you have a point. But to throw out such strong opinions based on his first half hour, I thought, was inappropriate.'\n\nAfter Sterling's cameo appearance last Sunday, one Instagram account called FootballPark, boasting almost 100k followers, wrote that the ex-England international looked like 'Bambi on Ice' and even suggested he should consider retiring.\n\nThe author, who was by no means the only social media account ripping into the footballer, posted: 'Raheem Sterling's debut for Feyenoord was not exactly a success story – in fact, it looked like a veritable disaster from the Dutch club's point of view.\n\n'The English winger looked like Bambi on ice. On a downward spiral since 2022, lacking motivation, and seemingly unable to play under anyone who isn't named Pep Guardiola, Sterling is well and truly into his twilight years. Is it time to hang the boots up once and for all?'\n\nSterling's former Manchester City team-mate Jack Grealish jumped in to defend the 31-year-old star online, taking issue with the post.\n\n\n\n'What a f*****g stupid Instagram post man what's wrong with you guys. Guy hasn't played or trained for so long. Ppl like u guys is what wrong with the world. Have some respect,' he wrote."

            "content": "If rugby’s authorities are serious about changing the sport for the better, then they should be incentivising the Prem’s new franchises to be placed in some of England’s untapped counties.\n\nTake Norfolk, for example. Ben Youngs, Freddie Steward and Jack van Poortvliet all grew up in East Anglia yet the area has no professional club representation.\n\nSeason ticket renewals for Norwich City are among the highest in England because it is a remote part of the country which has little other professional sport on offer.\n\nThe RFU and Prem Rugby should be banging down the door of Sir James Dyson, the British inventor who grew up in the area but currently pumps his millions into the jersey sponsorship of Bath.\n\nBirmingham, Yorkshire, Liverpool and the south coast are other areas that rugby should be trying to tap into as part of the long-term plan to grow the sport.\n\nScrapping promotion and relegation is a tough pill to swallow, although the gulf between the first and second division has become virtually unbridgeable.\n\nEnglish rugby's overhaul should be used as a springboard for expansion in untapped counties\n\nWorcester Warriors and London Irish are primed to apply for one of the 12 top-flight franchises and return to the PREM, having been expelled over financial difficulties in 2022 and 2023\n\n28 CLUBS HAVE PLAYED IN THE PREMIERSHIP - WHO'S NEXT? Team Seasons Bath 36 (7 titles) Gloucester 36 Leicester Tigers 36 (11 titles) Harlequins 35 (2 titles) Wasps 35 (6 titles) Northampton Saints 31 (2 titles) Saracens 31 (6 titles) Sale Sharks 30 (1 title) London Irish 28 Bristol Bears 25 Newcastle Red Bulls 24 (1 title) Worcester Warriors 16 Exeter Chiefs 13 (2 titles) Orrell 10 Leeds Tykes 8 Nottingham, West Hartlepool 5 Birmingham Moseley, Rosslyn Park 4 Bedford Blues 3 Liverpool St Helens, London Scottish, London Welsh, Richmond, Rotherham Titans, Rugby Lions, Waterloo 2 Coventry 1\n\nThe model is broken and ring-fencing with the option for expansion offers a happy medium. A pathway for ambitious clubs remains (at least in theory), while new investors can be confident they are not throwing money into a black hole.\n\nAfter the RFU council approved the changes yesterday, Exeter Chiefs owner Tony Rowe told Daily Mail Sport that investor confidence immediately spiked.\n\nNow 77, Rowe is speaking to new investors and negotiations can now advance with financiers in America. ‘We’re talking to a couple of investors and one of them wanted to wait to hear what happened this week,’ he said.\n\n‘English rugby is desperate for money but it’s difficult to find investment because of the worry of relegation. Red Bull didn’t just come along and say, “we don’t mind if we get relegated”. They were banking on this decision.\n\n‘I’m certain we’ll see more big names invest in English rugby now. Money dictates where sport goes and if somebody wants to pay handsomely to change the name of Exeter I have no doubt that might happen.\n\n‘We’re in the market for a partner investor. It’s going to cost you somewhere between £50m and £100millon to get a Prem side together with a stadium. I’m sure there are people out there interested in doing it.\n\n‘There are talks about rugby at the new stadium in Birmingham. Yorkshire has more rugby clubs than any other county but none of them perform at the top level so it would be nice to see another club there. Maybe someone in the North West. We want people to come into the Prem and first we want to get back to 12 clubs.’\n\nThe likes of Ollie Chessum, Freddie Steward and Fraser Dingwall have all played in the second division and the competition must not be set up to fail. It is key the chances of promotion remain genuine if teams meet the relevant criteria.\n\nSeason ticket renewals for Norwich City are among the highest in the country because it is a remote part of the country which has little other professional sport on offer\n\nYorkshire has not had a Premiership team since 2011, when Leeds Carnegie went down - a year later, they sold their P shares in the competition to Exeter Chiefs\n\nThe perfect scenario is more big hitters enter the market and rugby’s ecosystem grows. We could see more investment into playing squads, stronger academies and a trickle-down effect on the Champ.\n\nWe have seen London Irish, Wasps and Worcester fold under the financial pressures of professional sport but, after years of turmoil, there is an opportunity for new shoots to appear off the beaten path."

If you win a trophy here you'll go down in history - this fanbase deserves good times': KIERNAN DEWSBURY-HALL on being 'ready' for England, the 'mental block' his team have at new stadium and his guilty pleasure\n\nUnlock more of the best of our journalism with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight and the writers you love every day\n\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall always thought he would play for David Moyes, ever since the Everton manager tried to sign him for West Ham.\n\n‘It felt like I needed to work with him at some point,’ he says. But then close relationships with managers don’t always take you where you think they will.\n\nTwo summers ago, Dewsbury-Hall followed Enzo Maresca from Leicester to Chelsea only to find himself on the fringes. Two Premier League starts in a season was not what he thought Chelsea had paid £30million for.\n\n‘There were times when it felt very dark,’ Dewsbury-Hall admits. ‘If I am not playing, I can feel useless. I am very emotional.’\n\nNow, three-quarters of the way through a debut season at Everton, Dewsbury-Hall can talk about a career revived and some ambitions of winning a first cap for his country that have not been discouraged by England manager Thomas Tuchel.\n\n‘I've spoken to him once or twice,’ he tells Daily Mail Sport. ‘He was at Old Trafford when I scored. He was at Fulham when I scored. So I wouldn't mind him coming to more games! He's been complimentary and told me to stick at it. I feel like I am ready now. I feel like I am moving forwards again.’\n\nIn his debut season at Everton, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall can talk about a career revived and some ambitions of winning a first cap for his country\n\n'I feel like I am ready (to play for England) now. I feel like I am moving forwards again.’\n\nDuring a season of change – most of it positive – at Everton, Dewsbury-Hall stands out. Jack Grealish was the big-name signing but injury has ended his season. Young Tyler Dibling has struggled. Dewsbury-Hall, now 27, has assumed the role of senior player quite naturally.\n\n‘When I broke through at Leicester I just went on to the pitch trying to do the right thing,’ he says. ‘Now I've got a different mentality. I want to stand out.\n\n‘The manager and myself have history. He's known me for a while. He was interested when he was at West Ham. So it felt like the right time now to come to him. I just genuinely thought it would click here and it has. I know if I had the opportunity at Chelsea, it would have been the same.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall was a late developer and a thinker. It’s not always a great combination. As a teenager he interpreted his slow physical progress as a weakness. But now that he’s through all that, a clear intellect radiates and it’s to his benefit.\n\nFew footballers are as engaging or as curious. Two years into a degree in sports management, he has concerns about the direction football is taking on and off the field. He is also obsessed with West End musicals – 'my guilty pleasure' – and is convinced he will stand on a different kind of stage one day. Meanwhile he is an accomplished snooker and pool player.\n\n‘I do like to learn,’ the Nottingham-born midfielder says in his broad East Midlands accent. ‘I don't just like sitting on my backside doing nothing.’\n\nIn three weeks, fatherhood beckons. A little girl. That learning process is about to be accelerated and maybe it’s fitting, then, that Everton chose him to visit Much Woolton Primary School, 10 miles from Hill Dickinson Stadium, to read to a class of 25 children ahead of World Book Day next week.\n\nThe kids are blindfolded and have to guess the identity of their ‘secret reader’ as Dewsbury-Hall makes his way slowly through a page of a Harry Potter book he has chosen. When his identity is revealed, there is classroom bedlam. An enthusiastic signing session follows, as Dewsbury-Hall makes his way from table to table talking about books, reading and a fair bit of football.\n\nThe kids at Much Woolton Primary School are blindfolded and have to guess the identity of their ‘secret reader’ as Dewsbury-Hall reads a page of a Harry Potter book he has chosen\n\nWhen his identity is revealed, there is classroom bedlam. Dewsbury-Hall makes his way from table to table talking about books, reading and a fair bit of football\n\n‘You know, I was really nervous before going in there,’ he smiles as he sits down to talk in the headteacher’s office. ‘I haven't read out loud for a while. Football's not easy but I'm used to that, aren’t I? I thought, \"God, if I start making mistakes here, I'll make myself look like a right sausage\". But no, it was good in the end.’\n\nChildren can be blunt. At one stage, Dewsbury-Hall is asked by an eight-year-old why Everton can’t win at home. It’s a theme we return to. Ahead of today’s visit to Newcastle, Everton sit ninth despite having won only twice at their new Hill Dickinson Stadium in the Premier League since the start of November, and none of the last six.\n\n‘I do think there's maybe a little mental block there at the moment,’ he admits. ‘That does happen in football. I truly believe it. Something will happen in a game and it will just knock us for six or it will change the way we play. Whereas away, we know what we're doing.\n\n‘We do talk about it. I'm not gonna lie to you. We're humans. We ask ourselves why it goes wrong. We have tried training on the pitch and stuff and will probably do it again.’\n\nReflection is common in football and Dewsbury-Hall is prone to it. His home library comprises largely of autobiographies and motivational business books but not much of it prepared him for what happened at Chelsea.\n\nFollowing Maresca to Stamford Bridge in 2024 felt like the next step. Instead, Dewsbury-Hall found himself buried beneath a mountain of midfield bodies. He was the only player to feature in all 15 games of the club’s Conference League triumph and had some minutes at the Club World Cup. But every weekend brought Premier League disappointment.\n\n‘I had a lot of options but signed for Chelsea genuinely thinking I was gonna play,’ he says. ‘I believed I could. I know I could. And then football is football. Things happen.\n\n‘Obviously the competition was high. Rival midfielders were £100m players (Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez). It was a strange dynamic at times. It was quite fortunate for the club that the manager could field two very strong teams.\n\nHe was the only player to feature in all 15 games of the club’s Conference League triumph and had some minutes at the Club World Cup\n\nHis home library comprises largely of autobiographies and motivational business books but not much of it prepared him for being overlooked by Enzo Maresca at Chelsea\n\n‘But it was weird - it almost felt like no matter how well I played in midweek, I would not play at the weekend and that was the only thing that didn't sit well with me. In football it's important, if you're playing well, that you get the chance to play. I'm a very emotional guy. If I'm not playing, I feel useless, basically. I feel like I haven't got a purpose because that's my life.\n\n‘So yeah, there were dark times where I thought, “I don't care about money or anything else. I just wanna play football, so why aren’t I?”.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall’s relationship with Maresca meant there were regular conversations but not reassurances. ‘He was as honest as maybe he could be,’ the player adds. ‘He said some things that I wanted to hear and maybe some things that I didn't want to hear. He told me I had to be patient and said I wasn’t as big a fish in a pond as I was at Leicester.\n\n‘I am not gonna cry over it. I know if I did play more I would have been able to show people what I could do. In my head, that's a fact. But the strategy worked for the club, didn’t it? They won trophies and they got in the top four.\n\n‘I could easily have stayed at Chelsea for much longer but I wanted to go to a club with a project and be a main player. Everton felt perfect. Seamus Coleman has been here 17 years and tells me to imagine what winning a trophy would be like.\n\n‘If you can do that here, you'll go down in history books. This fanbase deserves good times and it gave me that extra motivation to come. Now I'm in such a better place. People look at me in a different light I hope.’\n\nRelationships with coaches and managers are always key to a player’s development. Dewsbury-Hall has had his bumps in the road and sometimes they have been impossible to see coming.\n\nAt Leicester, the club he joined aged eight, Brendan Rodgers gave him his senior debut at the age of 21 but he soon learned that managers have egos too.\n\nAt Leicester, the club he joined aged eight, Brendan Rodgers (right) gave him his senior debut at the age of 21 but he soon learned that managers have egos too\n\nScoring the winning goal at Old Trafford in November as David Moyes' side pulled off a famous win with 10 men\n\n‘He organised a pool tournament and everyone had to join in,’ recalls Dewsbury-Hall, a friend of four-time world snooker champion Mark Selby, the 'Jester from Leicester'. ‘I was playing for a pub team when I was 10 years old. I mean, I can play.\n\n‘I was young at the time – wasn’t a first-team player – but was drawn to play him (Rodgers) in the first round. I said to the lads: “Do I try my hardest?” Because he was having himself. He was going, “I'm really good at pool” and all the lads thought he fancied himself to win the whole thing.\n\n‘Quite a few people were watching and I beat him 3-0 and you could tell he was raging. I've just gone, “Yeah, sorry gaffer” and a week later got sent out on loan to Blackpool. So yeah, I mean, that was a fun week of my life.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall’s talents as a snooker player are not in doubt. As an actor, there is not yet any proof but he does yearn to find out. His love of the West End runs deep. He has watched endless shows in London and on New York's Broadway, and has contacts and friends in the business. A few years ago he was due to have a brief role through a BBC project in The Lion King but an injury got in the way.\n\nHe has tried and failed to encourage interest in various team-mates. ‘They just look at me like I am alien,’ he says. 'But one day I genuinely believe I'll do something in the West End.\n\n‘I resonate with what they do every night, giving their best to a completely new set of eyes. That's hard to do, so I respect them so much.’\n\nIn terms of the football, Dewsbury-Hall looks at where the game is going and, along with many others inside and outside of dressing rooms, has concerns about the influence of money, endless VAR checks, 100-minute matches and social media.\n\nAsked if the game is losing a bit of its innocence, he says: ‘Yeah, a little bit. And look, I'm old school. I'm an old head. That's why I hang around with people like Seamus.\n\nDewsbury-Hall looks at where football is going and has concerns about the influence of money, endless VAR checks, 100-minute matches and social media\n\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel was at Craven Cottage earlier this month to see Dewsbury-Hall score in the win over Fulham\n\n‘It's going away from that sort of old-school football isn’t it? It’s the way the world's going. Football’s more business now than it was. It will only increase. I just don't want it to lose its identity and lose why we fell in love with the game. I grew up watching Match of the Day and all I cared about was seeing people score goals. I don't want kids in 10 years watching it and going: “What is this?”\n\n‘It should be about the love. But look at the last week. The north London derby is taking 15 minutes to get restarted. Lloyd Kelly gets sent off for Juventus in the Champions League for the most ridiculous thing in the world. Rules are rules in football but sometimes you just need to smell a situation.\n\n‘The players, we're humans just like you. We grew up watching the sport. It's obviously just because we're inside it now, it's a bit more close to home. But we see the same things you see. We have the same concerns.’\n\n\n\nFor now, Dewsbury-Hall is probably too busy to save football. But Everton have a fine player and the rest of us have a genuine thinker in our midst. He is in Tuchel’s thoughts for a reason."

            "content": "Why Aston Villa can feel a Champions League place slipping through their fingers AGAIN: The three key players they look half a team without and where Unai Emery is going wrong after Wolves defeat: TOM COLLOMOSSE\n\nWhen Rodrigo Gomes sealed Wolves' victory with a handful of seconds remaining, Unai Emery had seen enough.\n\nThe Aston Villa boss marched straight down the tunnel and when Rob Edwards approached the away dugout at full-time to shake hands, Emery was nowhere to be seen. Soon after full-time his captain, Ezri Konsa, appeared to be restrained by a Villa staff member. There were suggestions Konsa had exchanged cross words with some away supporters.\n\n'In September I was worried about being in the relegation zone,' said Emery, referring to Villa's poor start. 'Then maybe a month ago I was dreaming of fighting with Manchester City and Arsenal for the title.\n\n'We are having a great season and I want to tell our fans now that we need them. We are grateful for them for being with us but at Villa Park we need their help. We need to be together – players, coaches, fans, everyone.\n\n'Our points total is similar to clubs who have finished in the top five before. We are competing against great teams and for them it is necessary to finish in the Champions League. We need to keep our position.'\n\nJoao Gomes' opener and Rodrigo's clincher means Wolves eclipse Derby's record low points total from 2007-08 and they deserved their win. 'I have not been especially focused on [the total] but it is important for the club and the fans,' acknowledged Edwards.\n\nAston Villa will have fears over their Champions League spot again after losing 2-0 at Wolves\n\nUnai Emery was left with his head in his hands as his third-place side stumbled at Molineux\n\nThe lasting image of the night, however, was Emery's touchline meltdown. Villa fans hope their toiling team do not follow suit as they fear a Champions League place will slip from their grasp for the second season in a row. Their next two fixtures are against fellow contenders Chelsea and Manchester United.\n\nAsked about the pressure on Villa, Morgan Rogers said: 'It does weigh on us but it shouldn't. We deserve to be here and we should not forget that. There is nothing to worry about.'\n\nEmery's early exit was no surprise. From the moment he gave Jadon Sancho an earful midway through the first half, the Spaniard looked ready to boil over. 'Only seven?!' he seemed to scream at the fourth official after the stoppage time board was raised, with his side chasing an equaliser. Earlier, Emery appeared to ignore Emi Buendia and Lucas Digne when they were substituted, his frustration growing when play was delayed due to an issue with referee Craig Pawson's earpiece.\n\nEmery is one of the finest managers in Villa's history but this was not his finest hour. From the moment the team sheet landed, his night started going wrong. Ollie Watkins and Lucas Digne ahead of the in-form Tammy Abraham and the adventurous Ian Maatsen. Really?\n\nThen there was his demeanour throughout the game. Emery is always full of nervous energy on the touchline and usually it is a positive force. Here, though, it could not possibly have been.\n\nVilla are still third in the table, six points ahead of Liverpool in sixth, and are favourites for the Europa League.\n\nVilla needed Emery to be calm. Instead he acted like a man who was watching everything go up in smoke, though he had cooled down by the time he faced the media.\n\nIn this form, Villa will struggle to succeed at home or in Europe. When Joao Gomes gave Wolves the lead just after the hour mark, only Ezri Konsa and Digne tried to encourage their team-mates. Konsa and Amadou Onana berated Buendia for dragging his heels as the Argentine walked to the bench after being substituted.\n\nWolves know they are down but there are still certain matches that can bring some light in the darkness. One is next week's FA Cup fifth-round tie against Liverpool. The other is the chance to knock over one of their local rivals.\n\nThe absence of key players is starting to take its toll on Villa. Shorn of Boubacar Kamara, as well as John McGinn and Youri Tielemans, they look half the team.\n\nJoao Gomes (above) struck midway through the second half to put Wolves in the ascendancy, before Rodrigo Gomes grabbed the hosts' second goal with virtually the last kick of the game\n\nVilla's dismal defeat marked just the second time Wolves have won in the league this season\n\nThe early signs were not promising. Buendia's clumsy challenge on Jean-Ricner Bellegarde gave Wolves a free-kick that Mateus Mane sent just wide from 22 yards. Many expected Abraham to be preferred to Watkins here and in the sixth minute Watkins wasted a great chance to repay that faith.\n\nSent clear by Morgan Rogers, Watkins hesitated just long enough for Yerson Mosquera to steal the ball before the forward could even shoot. Moments later, Pau Torres wasted a free header from Douglas Luiz's corner. Luiz then volleyed straight at Jose Sa and at the other end, Mateus Mane put a free-kick just wide and Toti Gomes miscued a volley.\n\n\n\nThe pattern did not change in the second half until, moments after Emery had made a double change, Jackson Tchatchoua crossed from the right, Adam Armstrong laid the ball off and Gomes crashed it in off the bar from 15 yards. Maatsen's arrival made a difference and his rising shot forced Sa into another sharp stop and Mosquera cleared off the line from Abraham before Rodrigo sealed it in front of the South Bank."

'We have earned the right to be in a strong position (with) what we've done in the group stage, and that's it.\n\n‘And now we need to start to analyse them and find ways to be better than them (Bayer Leverkusen), to try to go through the tie.’\n\n\n\nAsked if the route ahead gives him excitement, Arteta added: ‘Yeah, we are really excited.

            "content": "Igor Tudor forced to abandon his plan to save Tottenham from relegation with high-energy football as interim boss realises his players are too UNFIT\n\nIgor Tudor has shelved plans to impose his full-throttle brand of football at Tottenham after realising his players are not in good enough physical shape.\n\nTudor has forged a reputation for an intense, man-to-man, high-pressing tactical style during his 13-year coaching career.\n\nIt was part of his appeal for Spurs where fans demand adventure and ambition but just a fortnight and one game into his tenure, he admits this will not be possible with the tired and depleted squad he has inherited.\n\n'Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,' said Tudor. 'They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and the physical condition of the team has dropped down. So, we need to use this period where we don't play the games to put some petrol in the engine, so the engine starts to work better.\n\n'They are fatigued and to press high you need to be fit. But all of them. If someone is not in the right shape, there is a problem because someone is coming [pressing] late. And the second thing, is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back so if you run up and don't run back it's a problem.\n\n'For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it's a big question what we can do and what we cannot.'\n\nIgor Tudor has revealed that he was shocked by his players' fitness at this point in the season\n\nTudor has surprised some Spurs players with some gruelling running sessions in training overseen by the fitness coach he brought with him Riccardo Ragnacci.\n\n'That's the only way, running,' said the Spurs interim boss. 'The pitch is a hundred yards, it's long. You need to run. There are habits. Maybe you have habits to work a bit less. Players never like runs without the ball so we put in some runs without the ball.\n\n'There is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn't like. And the best thing is that they understand this.'\n\nTudor's initial assessment is not dissimilar to predecessors Ange Postecoglou and Thomas Frank, who both concluded that the squad was neither strong nor robust enough to cope when coupled with the expectation to play adventurous, exciting football and attack four competitions.\n\nBut the urgency of these circumstances, four points above the relegation zone without a win in nine Premier League games, together with the Croatian's imposing stature and taciturn delivery gave his message the ring of a chilling wake-up call for his players.\n\n'There is some pressure here in this club,' said Tudor. 'Some players are still young. They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to solve the problems.\n\n'If you have too many of these players because of injuries who are playing together it does create some problems, but it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man.\n\n'To grow fast and say, 'Come on, I'm the guy, give me the ball, I will score' instead of just, 'What can I do, I'm just here you know'. This is the challenge for each of them. Why not say, 'Come on, I will be the guy, give me the ball, I will not cry, I will take the ball, I will defend my box'.\n\n'It's always how you see the situation. You can always see it both ways. Or 'I'm not, I'm just here and we had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play'. How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy, positive there is opportunity.'\n\nWhen asked ahead of Sunday's trip to Fulham if he thought there were enough soldiers for the fight ahead, Tudor said that he hoped and believed there were and promised not to read too far into performances in his first game, a 4-1 defeat against Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\n\n\n'If you play against the best team in the world, at this moment, for us, I need to be honest, it's not a realistic game to show we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,' he said. 'That's the truth. For long periods in the game we had problems, in defence especially. It's not easy against them. Let's see in the next games.'"

Some already now and some in the future. The reality of this season is we sold for £300m, some starters like Trent (Alexander-Arnold) sold for only £10m.\n\n'We had to recoup the money with players. From that spend, then £250m of it (has not been used)… Alex has not been the Alex of Newcastle, maybe 20 minutes at Tottenham, I don't criticise him because we signed him for six years not six months.\n\nArne Slot has insisted Liverpool were right to splash out £450million in the summer because of the players they sold\n\n'Giorgi (Mamardashvili), we needed him because Caoimh (Kelleher) left but we hardly played with two goalkeepers.

            "content": "How Harry Maguire turned his Man United career around after Greece scandal, being booed by his OWN fans and losing the captaincy - and why the club want him to sign a new deal, writes CHRIS WHEELER\n\nTwo significant dates are marked in the calendar for Harry Maguire next week.\n\nOn Thursday, a celebration for the Manchester United and England defender’s 33rd birthday. Twenty-four hours earlier, a retrial over allegations he assaulted a police officer and of attempted bribery is scheduled to take place on the Greek island of Syros.\n\nSafe to say, he will only be turning up at one of them.\n\nIn the unlikely event that the shambolic Greek legal process functions on this occasion after no fewer than four previous postponements, Maguire isn’t even required to appear in person. He will instead be doing what he does best, anchoring United’s defence against Newcastle in the Premier League at St James’ Park.\n\nThe good times and the bad times have never been far apart during a rollercoaster career at Old Trafford that could feasibly come to an end in June, although there is growing optimism that contract talks will have a positive outcome before then.\n\nAside from the arrest in Mykonos on a family holiday in 2020, Maguire has been booed by his own fans playing for club and country, and been the target of a bomb threat. He has been dropped from the United team, stripped of the captaincy, and would have been sold in 2023 had he not rejected a £30million move to West Ham.\n\nHarry Maguire has fought his way back into a key role for Manchester United\n\nThe good times and the bad times have never been far apart during a rollercoaster career at Old Trafford that could feasibly come to an end in June\n\nThroughout it all, Maguire has kept his dignity and remained loyal to United when it didn’t always feel like the club were being loyal to him. Those who have worked with him describe the ultimate team player who puts his body on the line and faces adversity while worrying more about those around him.\n\nThere he was again at Everton on Monday, leading the defensive effort in the face of a late onslaught to earn a 1-0 win that put United back into the top four.\n\nRestoring Maguire to central defence in a 4-2-3-1 formation has been one of the key changes under Michael Carrick.\n\nAfter missing the final two months of Ruben Amorim’s tumultuous reign through injury, he returned on the bench for two games under Darren Fletcher, and has started all six of Carrick’s matches in charge.\n\nNo wonder United’s new head coach expressed hope on Friday that Maguire will stay beyond this summer, when his contract expires. United are known to be concerned about losing him at the same time as another experienced player in Casemiro.\n\n‘Harry's had a great career so far, and hopefully there's a lot more to come,’ said Carrick, who was first-team coach under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when Maguire arrived at United from Leicester in a £80m deal in 2019.\n\n‘He’s an impressive character. He has been here on the journey and the experiences that he's had, and with England as well, shows exactly what he is. I think we all know the player he is and what he's capable of doing.’\n\nWith all Maguire’s experience, is he in some of the best form of his career?\n\n‘There's a case,’ nodded Carrick. ‘I think as your career goes, when you're a young player everything's fresh and new, and you're fearless and there's not many scars there.\n\n‘You get to your peak years and you feel good, but obviously you've had a few ups and downs along the way. The experience that you've gained then makes you a better player; that sweet spot of being able to do it physically still, but using the experiences to know what's coming.\n\n‘Experience is massive, it's hard to put a price on how valuable that can be. Harry's gained an awful lot of it in different ways through this club.’\n\nIncluding interim managers and caretaker coaches, Maguire has played under seven different bosses at United. Some have valued him highly, others less so. Most of them had to rely on him at some point.\n\nLikewise the fans, although for the most part he has always had the backing of hardcore United supporters who appreciate his endeavour and a knack for late goals. His winners against Liverpool and Lyon were the stand-out moments under Amorim.\n\nMaybe not the Australian day-trippers who booed him at the Melbourne Cricket Ground when United played Crystal Palace – their opponents at Old Trafford on Sunday – on tour in 2022, and again in Perth a few days later.\n\nOr the idiot who had threatened to bomb Maguire’s home in March of that year, leading to the player moving his partner Fern and their two young daughters to a safe house while police carried out a sweep of the property and United brought in extra protection.\n\nThe so-called United boo-boys never bothered Maguire, but that wasn’t the case with his England critics.\n\nTargeted by Three Lions fans when England played Ivory Coast and Germany in 2022, he was hammered so relentlessly by Scotland supporters as he scored an own-goal at Hampden Park the following year that his mother Zoe took to social media to hit back at the ‘disgraceful’ behaviour. ‘That was a bad one for him,’ says an insider, referring to the lows of the 2022-23 season.\n\nThe so-called United boo-boys never bothered Maguire, but that wasn’t the case with his England critics\n\nNew United manager Erik ten Hag preferred Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane in central defence. The captain and mainstay under Solskjaer, Maguire only started eight Premier League games.\n\nThere was the awkwardness of coming off the bench in the Carabao Cup final against Newcastle at Wembley to then lift the trophy with Bruno Fernandes.\n\nMaguire had to publicly deny rumours of a leadership challenge from Cristiano Ronaldo before the Portugal star was pushed out of Old Trafford, but insiders say that he saw Ten Hag’s decision to hand the armband to Fernandes coming long before he was stripped of the captaincy that summer.\n\nNews broke just before a pre-season tour in which Maguire had the added indignity of being berated by goalkeeper Andre Onana on the pitch against Borussia Dortmund in Las Vegas and again booed by fans before a pre-season game against Athletic Bilbao in Dublin.\n\n‘He was very consistent in terms of his emotions,’ says one source. ‘When the younger players look at him, they must think “he’s been through so much, what have we got to complain about?”.’\n\nAll the while, the shadow of his trial in Greece continued to hang over the player and his family after he was arrested in August 2020 following a brawl. Maguire, who claimed to be defending his sister Daisy during the altercation in a bar, was handed a 21-month suspended sentence. However, the conviction was automatically quashed on appeal under Greek law and four retrials have been postponed.\n\nThe Maguire camp want to clear his name, and their legal team will be ready for court again on Wednesday, but no-one expects it to go ahead. There are doubts it will ever take place at all before the statute of limitations runs out in August 2028.\n\nMaguire is said to be very close to his family. His parents Zoe and Alan travel the world watching him. His brothers Laurence and Joe are both footballers, and Daisy works in the sports and entertainment industry.\n\nMaguire has played under seven different bosses at United. Some have valued him highly, others less so. Most of them had to rely on him at some point\n\n‘He was very consistent in terms of his emotions,’ says a source. ‘When younger players look at him, they must think “he’s been through so much, what have we got to complain about?”.’\n\nThat's one reason why Sheffield-born Maguire is said to be keen to stay in the North West and sign a new deal with United. The signs are promising.\n\nHe has been able to talk to foreign clubs since the beginning of the year, but turned down AC Milan and Brendan Rodgers’ new Saudi club Al Qadsiah in January.\n\nUnited are committed to driving down the wage bill and want to reduce his £180,000-a-week salary. But at least they are open to negotiation, which was not necessarily the case with Casemiro.\n\nAt this stage of his career, Maguire wants some security in terms of length of contract as he prepares to turn 33. ‘It’s an amazing club to play for and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could,’ he said last year.\n\nForm and fitness will be factors in United’s decision, and in that sense Maguire has a strong case.\n\nHe has outlasted his central defensive partners Varane, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans at Old Trafford. Martinez is out again after only recently returning from a long-term injury, and Matthijs De Ligt has not been available since the end of November. Youngsters Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven have had their teething troubles.\n\nThomas Tuchel has also taken note and says Maguire is in his thoughts for the World Cup. The player is desperate to go to North America after missing out on Euro 2024 through injury.\n\nHe has yet to play under Tuchel and won the last of his 64 caps in a Nations League win over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in 2024.\n\nHe has yet to play under Thomas Tuchel and won the last of his 64 caps in a Nations League win over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in 2024\n\nMaguire is still holding out hope of playing in a third World Cup for England\n\nSteve Bruce, who knows a thing or two about playing centre back at United and captaining the club, believes Maguire is worthy of a new contract and a World Cup spot.\n\n‘I believe Harry has been made the whipping boy for what was going on around him for too long,’ Bruce told Daily Mail Sport. ‘I don't think he's ever let Man United down. In fact, he's never let England down either.\n\n\n\n‘I wouldn't be surprised if he went to the World Cup and gets offered a new deal. Why wouldn't you? I think centre-halves get better with age. Over the last five or six weeks, he's given a reminder of just what he's about – if he ever needed to.’"

Farage and his cronies revel in whipping up sensationalist storms to portray newcomers as little more than outcasts. But Moldovan Ursu is flying his adopted flag in the face of that increasingly hostile rhetoric.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe moved to these shores on a whim and a prayer and was welcomed with open arms. And tonight the 25-year old will challenge for a British boxing title. \"I was born in Moldova but raised in England,\" said Ursu, who moved to Plymouth seven years ago. \"English people have built me into a man, they have given everything to me. I feel part of England now and I feel the same as English people feel.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR FIGHTING FB PAGE!

When I came from Moldova, everyone tried to help me and it felt weird. I thought, 'What do they want from me?' But they didn't want anything, they just wanted me to be successful in life. That was very strange and very weird for me in the beginning but now I understand. People from England want to help you for no reason.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nUrsu takes on Owen Cooper for the vacant British welterweight title in Derby tonight. He is in the process of applying for a UK passport having been convinced to move 3,000 miles west after the end of his amateur career. \"My last fight before I left Moldova was at the World Championship; I thought I won but they gave me a loss,\" he added. \"I didn't see the point of boxing anymore so I needed to think about what to do with my life.\n\n\"Then one of my friends who lived in Plymouth rang me and asked if I wanted to come to England to box. I said no but he kept ringing and asked me to come for a month. He knew my character and said there was nothing for me to do in Moldova. So I came over but for the first month I did nothing because I thought I would go back home. But I started to love Plymouth and my coach told me I could achieve big things.\n\n\"I had a good life in Moldova so I went from something to nothing in order to build a life for myself. I didn't need to stay in England but then one month became seven years. I'm happy and grateful for everything I have achieved and fighting for a British title means a lot to me. Nobody gave this to me, I've earned it.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Now 30 years since the Dallas Cowboys' last Super Bowl appearance, owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he has let the fans down with his team's championship drought.\n\n\"I really can't accept just the thought of winning one Super Bowl and then what?\" Jones said Friday night from the NFL scouting combine. \"I've got more time on my clock than that in my mind. And so I don't see it that way. I see a chance to put a team together and basically be knocking at the edge and get another one or get a chance at a another one.\n\n\"It runs that way in my view. ... Make no mistake about it now, if you told me I could, because I've done a lot of hitchhiking in my life. ... I'd start here with you right now and hitchhike back to Dallas to win a Super Bowl.\"\n\nAfter a 7-9-1 finish in 2025, Jones promised change. One change will be the team's approach to free agency.\n\nThe Cowboys have not relied heavily on free agency in years, choosing to pick their spots to shore up holes on the roster with cost-effective players.\n\n\"I would bet that we will spend more money in free agency than we have,\" Jones said.\n\nTo do so, the Cowboys will first have to create salary cap room. Well over the $301.2 million cap that was set Friday, they will restructure the contracts of quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and left guard Tyler Smith, which will create $66 million of room.\n\nJones said the Cowboys will rework the contracts of defensive tackles Kenny Clark, Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa, who are scheduled to count around $63 million against the cap. With Clark and Williams, the Cowboys can look to add voidable years to their contracts then restructure that way.\n\n\"I want you to know that the only way to push more [out] is for me to go borrow some of my future, OK?\" Jones said. \"Expect me to go borrow some of my future.\"\n\nTo Jones, it goes beyond his personal Super Bowl wishes.\n\n\"I look at where we are with Dak and I look at where he is in his career. And I look at some of the pluses that we have on our front and what we think we can do there. And what we can do with [George] Pickens and Lamb and what we can do with our running back that we just signed [Javonte Williams],\" Jones said. \"And so all of those things I want to do everything we possibly can to stop somebody and to basically win some third downs more than we did last year. And so I think that would be the area that you would see me bust the budget. Where you would see me do that is what we're doing defensively.\n\n\"And I would expect anybody that's a Cowboy fan or a critic of the Cowboys to say, 'Duh, that's not hard to see, Jerry, to do.' But I guess what I'm doing is saying, yes, I intend to do that if given the opportunity.\"\n\nThe Cowboys defense finished at or near the bottom of the league in yards and points allowed in 2025. Christian Parker has been hired as the new defensive coordinator, and Jones acknowledged the need for more than just one or two new players, while also saying players that were on the defense in 2025 will be better in 2026 \"because the situation has changed.\"\n\nWith two first-round picks, the Cowboys have an opportunity to add more talent to their defense. Jones would not rule out the possibility of making trades, like the additions of Williams from the New York Jets and Clark from the Green Bay Packers for Micah Parsons.\n\n\"I don't know that I'd expect it but we have the ammunition to be good at it,\" Jones said. \"And I wouldn't hesitate to be good at it if it will help our team and help the timeline that we're talking about.\"\n\nNow 83, Jones was introspective at times during the hourlong meeting with reporters. His resolve to win a championship is strong.\n\n\"It's every bit the prize of anything I have, with the exception of family and your love for family,\" Jones said. \"I guess what I would say is make no mistake about it, I don't have a higher priority than to go and win a Super Bowl.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- After Denver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic tumbled to the Paycom Center court early in the fourth quarter Friday night, he determined that he needed to react to what he considered a dirty tactic by Oklahoma City Thunder guard Luguentz Dort.\n\nA chippy game between rivals who faced off in a seven-game series in last season's Western Conference semifinals escalated into a heated confrontation at that point, resulting in Dort's ejection and double technical fouls on Jokic and Oklahoma City center Jaylin Williams.\n\nThe fracas began when Dort appeared to trip Jokic as he ran up the court with 8:03 remaining in the fourth quarter. Dort backed into Jokic and stuck out his right foot, knocking down the big man, who quickly pounced to his feet to angrily confront Dort.\n\n\"It's an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction,\" Jokic said after the Nuggets' 127-121 overtime loss to the defending champions. \"There is no such thing -- I think there's not supposed to be those things on a basketball floor. So, it was just an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction by me.\"\n\nAfter Jokic chest-bumped Dort, Williams rushed over to intervene. Jokic and Williams exchanged shoves and grabbed each other's jerseys as a scrum of players, coaches, officials and staffers formed around them and eventually separated them.\n\n\"Just competing,\" Williams told ESPN. \"Two teams competing, that's it. That's all I got.\"\n\nAfter a review, the foul called against Dort was upgraded to a flagrant foul 2, resulting in an automatic ejection. Crew chief James Williams told a pool reporter that the officials \"deemed [Dort's] contact on Jokic to be unnecessary and excessive with a high potential for injury.\" Williams also cited the contact leading to an \"altercation that did not dissolve\" as a reason for upgrading it to a flagrant foul 2.\n\n\"I will say this: If [Williams] is running up the floor and gets tripped, we expect a flagrant 2 from this point forward,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \"That's all. If that's the precedent, if that becomes a malicious play and flagrant 2 is the line in the sand on that, we would expect that if it's [Williams]. We would expect that if it's anybody. And if that's the case, we're good.\"\n\nAsked if he believed the play was ruled a flagrant 2 because the foul was committed against a three-time MVP, Daigneault said: \"No, I'm not going to answer the question like that. I said what I needed to say about it.\"\n\nNuggets star Nikola Jokic confronts Thunder guard Luguentz Dort, who was called for a flagrant foul 2 after an apparent trip in the fourth quarter. Jokic and OKC's Jaylin Williams received technical fouls. Photo by Joshua Gateley/Getty Images\n\nThe referees determined that the actions of Jokic and Jaylin Williams during the altercation did not rise to the level of an ejection, James Williams said in the pool report.\n\nThe fracas overshadowed the return of reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had 36 points on 12-of-29 shooting and dished out nine assists in 34 minutes. Gilgeous-Alexander sat out the overtime period because he had reached his minutes limit after missing the previous nine games because of an abdominal strain suffered Feb. 3.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was called for a technical foul in the first quarter when he responded to Jokic's post-whistle contact by throwing the ball at him. James Williams told the pool reporter that Jokic was not called for a technical on that play because the officials determined that his contact with his left forearm did not rise to the level of an unsportsmanlike act.\n\n\"They're obviously a high-level team, we're a high-level team, and we've seen each other a lot in the past couple of years, so we might be a little bit more into the game just because we know the opponent,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"It was fun. It was good out there. End-of-season basketball is like that. It's that chippy, that physical, so it was good to get one of those in the regular season.\"\n\nThe Nuggets fell to 4-7 since Jokic returned from a monthlong absence, including 1-6 in clutch games (within five points in the final five minutes) during that span. Jokic recorded his league-leading 22nd triple-double with 23 points, 17 rebounds and 14 assists against the Thunder, but his uncharacteristic recent shooting struggles continued, as he went 9-of-25 from the floor and 2-of-10 from 3-point range.\n\nJokic, who was 3-of-5 from the free throw line, animatedly protested no-calls after several of his shots. There were also multiple instances of Jokic bumping and shoving with Thunder players during the game.\n\n\"I think his frustration is sometimes because the game's officiated differently out on the floor than it is near the basket, and I think he was reacting to what was being done to him,\" Nuggets coach David Adelman said. \"And his reaction's not going to be to cower away. He's competitive. ... I know why he's frustrated. I can feel his frustration with all the contact out there. He shot five free throws.\n\n\"It's just part of the game. The closer you get to the basket, it seems like for a bigger guy, it seems like it's called a little bit different, but he has to react to that the right way. Concentrate and finish through contact. And obviously with Dort's play, I think that took it to a different level for him. He felt like it was malicious, also.\"\n\nThe Nuggets and Thunder meet again March 9 in Oklahoma City."

Including the playoffs, it was the club's third-highest percentage in a game in the shot clock era (since 1954-55), behind 67.9% in 1984 and 67.0% in 1990, according to ESPN Research.\n\nThe Celtics also shot 64.7% from the 3-point line Friday, which equated to an 80.8% effective field goal percentage -- the highest in the shot clock era. Effective field goal percentage measures shooting efficiency by adjusting for the fact that 3-pointers are worth more than two-point shots\n\nAll-Star Jaylen Brown led the way, finishing with 28 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. But he got plenty of support from his teammates, with trade deadline acquisition Nikola Vucevic adding 28 points and 11 rebounds for his third double-double as a member of the Celtics.\n\n\"I thought we just did a good job reading the game,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"I thought we made the right reads throughout most of the entire game. I thought tonight Vooch really looked comfortable in his offensive reads and his offensive screening. He unlocked a lot of stuff for us.\"\n\nAll 13 Celtics players scored, with Boston committing only three turnovers after halftime.\n\n\"We just try to read the game and take what's there,\" Brown said.\n\nBoston, winners of five of its six games since the All-Star break, will wait to see if Sunday night's home matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers will mark the return of Tatum.\n\nThe game, originally scheduled to be played earlier in the day, was moved by NBC into an 8 p.m. ET prime-time slot, creating speculation it could signal Tatum's plan to return.\n\nIt's been 41 weeks since Tatum ruptured his right Achilles tendon in May in the waning minutes of the Celtics' loss to the New York Knicks in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe Celtics are required by the NBA to release an initial injury report by 5 p.m. ET on Saturday ahead of Sunday's home game against the 76ers.\n\nAfter practicing with the Celtics' G League team two weeks ago, Tatum said he hadn't decided whether he would return.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that I'm coming back or I'm not, it's just following the plan. So it's just another step,\" Tatum said. \"I don't know percentage. I just know I feel a little bit better every day. I just try to focus on that.\"\n\nTatum said in the same interview that he is also mindful of not wanting to disrupt the progress of a Celtics team that at 39-20 sits in second place in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\n\"I'm just hyper aware of what's going on. I think it would just stem from that. Obviously, I know what I bring to the table and bring to the team. But I'm also aware that these guys have been playing extremely well,\" Tatum said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

(1:49)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nKALAMAZOO, Mich. -- Trey Perry scored on a driving layup with a second remaining, and No. 21 Miami of Ohio rallied to beat Western Michigan 69-67 on Friday night to extend its season-opening winning streak to 29 games.\n\nThe RedHawks (16-0 Mid-American Conference) remain the only undefeated team in Division I men's basketball. Miami extended the best start in program history and added to its school record for wins in a season. Miami also boasts the best start and longest win streak in MAC annals.\n\nMiami is also just the fourth Division I team in the past 20 years to enter March unbeaten, according to ESPN Research. The previous three (2013-14 Wichita State, 2014-15 Kentucky and 2020-21 Gonzaga) all remained unbeaten heading into the NCAA tournament.\n\nPeter Suder scored 18 points for the RedHawks before fouling out with just over seven minutes remaining. Almar Atlason added 16 points, Perry finished with 14 and Eian Elmer 10.\n\nJayden Brewer led Western Michigan (10-19, 4-12) with 19 points and 11 rebounds. Justice Williams and EJ Ryans each added 14 points.\n\nMiami is used to playing close games and won for the seventh time this season by fewer than six points.\n\n\"Our grouip is unflappabe,\" Miami coach Travis Steele said. \"It's calm, cool and collected. It's very, very even the entire time, even during tight moments.\"\n\nThe RedHawks trailed 30-26 at the half and fell behind by eight points twice early in the second half before tying the score at 49-49 with 11:02 remaining.\n\nWestern Michigan ran off eight straight points for a 57-49 advantage with 8:40 remaining and led 59-50 with 6:38 left before Miami chipped away and moved ahead 66-65 on a layup by Antwone Woolfolk with 14 seconds left.\n\nElmer's free throw with 37 seconds remaining gave the RedHawks a 67-65 edge, but Western Michigan tied it with 11 seconds left on a basket by Williams before Perry made the winner.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe Women's National Basketball Players Association submitted a new counterproposal to the WNBA on Friday evening with some concessions on revenue share and housing, a source familiar with the collective bargaining negotiations told ESPN.\n\nIn the new CBA proposal, the players' union is asking for players to receive 26% of gross revenue (defined as revenue before deducting expenses) over the lifetime of the agreement, with the salary cap in Year 1 of the deal (about $9.5 million) unchanged from its previous offer.\n\nThe revenue share split is down from 27.5% of gross revenue as proposed in the WNBPA's Feb. 17 proposal, a change that a source said amounts to nearly $100 million in reductions on revenue share.\n\nThe new proposal also contains tweaks to the union's housing offerings: Previously, the players asked that teams continue to provide housing to players in the first several years of the new deal, but that in later years, teams will no longer be obligated to provide it for players making at least 80% of the maximum salary, on multiyear deals and receiving full salary protection.\n\nIn the new proposal, the union struck the multiyear component and lowered the salary threshold to 75% at which players would no longer be obligated to receive team-provided housing.\n\nThe two sides are still negotiating the years of service limit for developmental players -- a new feature of this CBA with each team now expected to have two developmental player spots. The union is now proposing a years of service limit of six after originally asking for no experience limit for those players, a source said, whereas the league's latest proposal suggested a limit of four or five years of service based on minutes played.\n\nThe WNBPA's counterproposal comes one week after the league submitted one of its own. That Feb. 20 league proposal guaranteed housing for all players in 2026 before being phased out in subsequent years of the deal. Players on their applicable minimum salary and those with zero years of service would be provided a one-bedroom apartment in 2027 and 2028 only, and developmental players would be provided studio apartments for the entirety of the deal.\n\nBut the two sides are still far apart on the issue of revenue sharing, including proposing different revenue sharing systems: The WNBA has held firm in its proposals, with players being offered on average over 70% of net revenue (revenue after deducting expenses), which would amount to less than 15% of gross revenue. The 2026 salary cap would come in at $5.65 million (up from $1.5 million in 2025) and in subsequent years would grow in line with revenue growth.\n\nThe league's proposal features maximum salaries, including revenue sharing payouts, amounting to nearly $1.3 million in 2026 and projecting to approach $2 million in 2031. The supermax in 2025 came in at $249,000. The average player salary, including revenue sharing, would be projected to reach $540,000 in 2026 and $780,000 by 2031, up from $120,000 in 2025.\n\nThe WNBA publicly struck down the WNBPA's previous proposal as \"unrealistic\" and \"caus[ing] hundreds of millions of dollars of losses for our teams.\" A source familiar with the negotiations told ESPN the league projected that Feb. 17 plan would result in losses of $460 million over the lifetime of the agreement, though the union has maintained its revenue sharing model would still put the league in a \"profitable position,\" another source said.\n\nEarlier this week, the league gave its teams and the WNBPA a target date of March 10 to complete a term sheet, or else the schedule for the 2026 season might be impacted."

The announcement means that former champion Alex Pereira, who has shown interest in moving up to heavyweight, has vacated the belt.\n\nWhite did not comment on Pereira's title reign ending.

He challenged Pereira for the belt twice, in 2023 and 2024, losing both times via second-round knockout. Since his second loss to Pereira, Prochazka has recorded back-to-back finishes against Jamahal Hill and Khalil Rountree Jr.\n\nUlberg (13-1), who lives and trains out of New Zealand, has been steadily working up the light heavyweight ranks since he signed with the UFC in 2020.

            "content": "AUBURN, Calif. -- Former MLB pitcher Daniel Serafini was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 2021 shooting of his wife's parents during a burglary at their home by Lake Tahoe, authorities said.\n\nSerafini, 51, was convicted in July 2025 of first-degree murder of his father-in-law, Gary Spohr; attempted murder of his mother-in-law, Wendy Wood; and first-degree burglary. Spohr was killed, and Wood survived, though she died a year after the shooting.\n\nPlacer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said in a statement Friday that Spohr and Wood were loving grandparents and that Serafini's crimes greatly impacted family members and friends.\n\n\"The impact of this attack has extended far beyond the immediate victims, deeply affecting family members and the broader community, and highlighting the lasting harm caused by deliberate violence,\" Gire said.\n\nSerafini's attorney did not return requests for comment.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Serafini addressed the court and maintained his innocence, according to MyNews4. He said he was out partying with his wife the night of the shooting and described himself as a \"broken, imperfect man that makes mistakes.\"\n\nSerafini was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 1992. In a career spanning 11 years, the left-hander played for the Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies.\n\nProsecutors said Serafini hated his wife's wealthy parents and was heard saying he was willing to pay $20,000 to have them killed, according to the Sacramento Bee. Prosecutors showed jurors transcripts of angry emails and text messages between Serafini and his in-laws.\n\nDuring the six-week trial, Serafini's attorney, David Dratman, argued that there was no physical evidence linking his client to the crime scene. Dratman told the jury that although Serafini had a rocky relationship with his in-laws, he did not have a motive to kill them.\n\nAfter his conviction, Serafini filed multiple motions for a new trial, but those were denied.\n\nSerafini will serve his sentence at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the Placer County District Attorney's Office."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin says Ghanaian entrepreneurs are worse off under the current administration, citing what he describes as a lack of tax incentives and an increasingly aggressive revenue collection drive by the Ghana Revenue Authority.\n\nSpeaking on Newsfile on Saturday, a day after President John Dramani Mahama delivered his 2026 State of the Nation Address, Afenyo-Markin said government policies were putting undue pressure on the few businesses still operating in the country.\n\nThe Minority Leader, who is also a lawyer, revealed that his own law firm had recently been subjected to a tax audit, which he described as part of a wider pattern of pressure on private businesses.\n\n“I challenge anyone to mention a single incentive for the private sector since they came into office. Rather, GRA is always on their neck,” he said.\n\nHe argued that instead of creating a supportive environment for entrepreneurs, the government appeared focused on maximising revenue at the expense of business growth and sustainability.\n\nAfenyo-Markin’s comments come amid a significant expansion in tax collection efforts. According to the GRA’s Domestic Tax Revenue Division, it mobilised GH¢130.2 billion in 2025, representing a 20.3 per cent increase over 2024. The authority has set a target of GH¢162.59 billion for 2026, a further 21 per cent rise.\n\nAs part of its new strategy, the tax authority plans to decentralise audit operations and strengthen what it describes as “risk-based interventions” across different categories of taxpayers.\n\nWhile acknowledging that revenue mobilisation is necessary, Afenyo-Markin warned that the current approach could be counterproductive.\n\nHe said the government should prioritise policies that stimulate investment, expand production, and grow the tax base, rather than “chasing a shrinking pool of compliant businesses”.\n\n“The problem is not collecting taxes. The problem is how you do it, and whether you are helping businesses to grow so they can pay more in the long term,” he added.\n\nIn defence of its economic approach, the government has pointed to measures in the 2026 budget aimed at easing pressure on businesses. These include the abolition of the COVID-19 Health Recovery Levy and a reduction in the effective VAT rate to 20 per cent.\n\nOfficials say the measures are intended to lower operating costs and improve the business climate.\n\nHowever, Afenyo-Markin insists the reforms do not go far enough.\n\nHe argued that without clear, targeted incentives for entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized enterprises would continue to struggle, thereby limiting job creation and economic growth.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

In the 2026 budget, GH¢2.2 billion was allocated to the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, alongside GH¢1.7 billion for roads, processing zones and value chains.\n\nAdditional funding includes GH¢245 million for food security and agro-industrial programmes, GH¢828 million for agricultural enclave roads, and GH¢690 million for Farmer Service Centres.\n\nDespite these figures, the Minority Leader insisted that farmers and agribusinesses have yet to feel the impact of the spending on the ground.\n\nHe also renewed his criticism of the cancellation of the One District One Factory (1D1F) initiative, which was introduced to promote decentralised industrialisation and job creation.\n\nIn July 2025, Trade Minister Elizabeth Ofosu-Adjare told Parliament that the 1D1F programme had been scrapped, with the government shifting focus to agro-processing parks under the 24-hour economy policy.\n\nHowever, Afenyo-Markin argued that more than a year later, no clear alternative framework has been presented.\n\n“The Trade Minister is yet to outline a concrete replacement strategy,” he said, calling on the government to explain what incentives are being offered to attract private sector investment.\n\nHe noted that without a well-defined industrial policy, efforts to link agriculture to manufacturing and job creation could be undermined.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Dr Manaseh M. Mintah\n\nThe President’s State of the Nation Address was, in many respects, reassuring and forward-looking. It provided confidence at a moment when economic recovery requires both stability and optimism. The emphasis on infrastructure renewal, industrial growth, fiscal discipline, and national cohesion reflected an administration seeking to restore momentum while confronting structural challenges. That effort deserves commendation.\n\nLeadership must not only diagnose problems but also inspire collective belief in the possibility of progress. Yet patriotism demands more than applause. It demands reflection, particularly when ambition risks outrunning economic logic. It is within this spirit of constructive engagement that the proposal to build an airport in Bolgatanga must be examined.\n\nHistory offers both inspiration and caution. Kwame Nkrumah remains one of the most visionary architects of modern Ghana. His industrialisation agenda sought to liberate the country from colonial dependency and reposition it as a manufacturing hub within Africa.\n\nHowever, vision alone does not guarantee sustainability. Nkrumah made mistakes too. At times, ambition exceeded the limits imposed by economic fundamentals. The glass factory at Aboso and the meat processing factory at Bolgatanga were conceived on the assumption that raw materials would be readily available in sufficient and sustained quantities to support production, not merely to survive, but to compete globally. Industrialisation requires more than patriotic enthusiasm or anticipated demand. It requires dependable supply chains, logistical foresight, and long-term market integration.\n\nIn practice, those assumptions proved overly optimistic. While demand for finished products existed, many fledgling factories struggled to secure the abundance and reliability of inputs envisaged. Ambition outpaced economic fundamentals. The lesson is not to abandon bold thinking. Rather, it is to discipline ambition with realism. Ghana must therefore resist repeating historical patterns where large-scale projects are pursued for symbolism without sufficient regard for long term utilization.\n\nThe same caution applies directly to infrastructure planning today. Sound transportation policy must correspond to geography, demand, and productivity. Tamale and Bolgatanga are separated by roughly 150 kilometres. The total flight duration between them is approximately forty minutes, including takeoff and landing procedures. In practical terms, passengers would likely spend more time arriving early at terminals, checking in, clearing security, boarding aircraft, taxiing, and disembarking than they would actually spend in the air. When administrative processes exceed travel time, aviation ceases to be an efficiency solution and instead becomes an expensive redundancy.\n\nMoreover, airports are among the most capital-intensive public investments a developing economy can undertake. They require sophisticated air traffic control systems, specialised maintenance, security operations, trained aviation personnel, and often continuous operational subsidies. Without sustained passenger volumes or cargo demand, such facilities struggle to justify their recurring costs. Infrastructure that does not generate consistent economic activity gradually transforms from a national asset into a fiscal obligation.\n\nSignificantly, this debate is not unique to Bolgatanga. Similar calls have periodically emerged from sections of the Fante community advocating for an airport in Cape Coast. The emotional appeal is understandable. Every region desires visible symbols of development. However, policy must ultimately be guided by economic coherence rather than sentiment. Cape Coast lies approximately 145 kilometres from Accra and about 130 kilometres from Takoradi. By road, both cities are accessible within two to two and a half hours. A commercial flight across such a short corridor would be extremely brief, raising legitimate questions about patronage levels and operational sustainability.\n\nConsequently, a troubling dilemma emerges. If Ghana justifies an airport in Bolgatanga despite its proximity to Tamale, yet declines similar demands elsewhere because of proximity to existing airports, the development risks appear inconsistent. National planning cannot oscillate between economic logic and regional appeasement. Once infrastructure decisions begin to mirror ethnic expectations or political balancing rather than strategic necessity, scarce national resources become fragmented across multiple underutilised projects.\n\nIndeed, Ghana already possesses a recent and instructive example. The Ho Airport was commissioned amid optimism and national pride. Expectations were high. Yet commercial flights were eventually suspended because patronage could not sustain operations. The lesson is empirical rather than partisan. Infrastructure without sustained demand becomes a recurring financial burden, tying up resources that could have delivered broader economic multipliers elsewhere.\n\nTo be clear, aviation expansion itself is not inherently misguided. Where geography and demand justify it, airports can serve as powerful engines of growth. Tamale to Accra makes commercial sense because of the distance and passenger volume. Wa and Sunyani, given their geographic positioning and relative isolation, present more defensible aviation cases.\n\nHowever, Bolgatanga, much like Cape Coast, raises serious concerns about duplication and long-term utilisation within a geographically compact country. The deeper question, therefore, is strategic allocation. What kind of infrastructure truly transforms economies? Airports primarily serve passenger mobility and specialised cargo movement. Railways and high-quality road networks, by contrast, transform production systems. They reduce freight costs for farmers transporting cocoa, maize, vegetables, and livestock. They connect agrarian communities to urban markets. They support industrial clustering by lowering logistical expenses. Most importantly, they serve low and middle-income citizens whose livelihoods depend on moving goods rather than boarding aeroplanes.\n\nHistory again provides clarity. The American Midwest and western territories were not unlocked through short-distance aviation infrastructure. They were opened by rail. The Transcontinental Railroad did not merely move passengers across geography. It moved agricultural produce, machinery, migration, investment capital, and opportunity. Entire towns emerged along rail corridors. Markets expanded. Productivity multiplied.\n\nEncouragingly, the President has already demonstrated awareness of this strategic reality through the Ghana to Burkina Faso railway initiative. The proposed rail corridor linking Ghana’s ports to Burkina Faso is not merely a transportation project. It represents recognition that future competitiveness in West Africa will depend on logistics efficiency, trade integration, and the ability to move bulk goods across borders at reduced cost.\n\nHowever, this project must not remain an isolated flagship undertaking. It must become the foundation of a nationwide transportation philosophy. Rail infrastructure possesses a multiplier effect that airports simply cannot replicate within a geographically compact country such as Ghana. A single cross-border railway connecting Tema or Takoradi to Burkina Faso has the potential to transform northern Ghana into a logistical gateway for the Sahel. Agricultural produce, minerals, manufactured goods, and transit cargo would flow through Ghanaian ports, generating customs revenue, employment opportunities, and industrial clustering along the corridor.\n\nThe true strategic opportunity lies beyond a single northbound connection. The Burkina Faso railway must be aggressively expanded into a comprehensive cross-country network linking the northern agricultural belts to the middle belt manufacturing zones and ultimately to coastal ports. A railway spine connecting Tamale, Bolgatanga, Wa, Sunyani, Kumasi, Takoradi, Tema, and the Volta enclave would do far more to unlock national productivity than multiple short-distance domestic airports competing for limited passenger traffic.\n\nRailways democratize mobility. They serve farmers transporting produce to markets. They support traders moving goods between regions. They reduce haulage costs for cement, timber, cocoa, manganese, and bauxite. They lower food prices in urban centres while increasing income opportunities in rural communities. In short, they integrate economies rather than merely connecting terminals.\n\nFurthermore, cross-country rail expansion would reposition Ghana as the preferred maritime outlet for landlocked neighbours such as Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. In an era shaped by the African Continental Free Trade Area and shifting global supply chains, logistics dominance will determine economic leadership in West Africa.\n\nUltimately, the President’s address articulated an admirable desire to build and modernise. That aspiration deserves recognition. Strategic development demands courage. Sometimes that comes with an attempt not to satisfy everyone at all costs. The lessons of history, from Nkrumah’s industrial ambitions to contemporary infrastructure experiences, remind us that sustainability must guide ambition. This is my empathic viewpoint.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Not only was he my classmate, but he was actually my dorm mate,” Dr Tandoh revealed.\n\nThe duo belonged to Aggrey House, where they specifically shared Dorm 7, a period Dr Tandoh credits for developing \"great friendships\" that have sustained them into their professional adult lives.\n\nDr Tandoh has not only cleared the air on a piece of political trivia but has also underscored the enduring influence of Ghana's traditional secondary school brotherhoods in national life.\n\nThe ‘Amanfoo’ spirit: A house built on loyalty\n\nBeyond settling the Wontumi debate, Dr Tandoh used the platform to highlight the unique and intense loyalty shared by alumni of the school. He described an environment where seniority is respected regardless of age and where support for one another is unconditional.\n\nRecounting a remarkable personal experience, Dr Tandoh shared how a senior colleague he had never met before facilitated his relocation to Ghana from the diaspora.\n\n“When I was relocating to Ghana, my first home that I moved into, the entire one-year rent was paid for by a senior I didn’t know... He left Prempeh College some 15 years before I went there,” he shared.\n\nThe senior, identified as Senior Poku-Agyemang, not only secured a home for Dr Tandoh’s wife and children but also provided him with a car and fully paid insurance for a year.\n\nLessons beyond the classroom\n\nFor Dr Tandoh, the Prempeh College experience was defined by a philosophy of collective growth rather than individual success. He noted that the institution taught him to be \"focused on growing people around me and supporting things around me.\"\n\nThe bond between the Amanfuo, he suggests, is a powerful social network that transcends political and professional boundaries.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Violent scenes erupted at the Kasoa Old Market in the Awutu Senya East Municipality on Friday, February 27, as an aggrieved mob turned their frustrations on emergency responders during a devastating fire outbreak.\n\nWhile two container shops were being razed to the ground, a team from the Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS) was met with a hail of stones, resulting in significant damage to a fire tender and the disruption of life-saving operations.\n\nThe incident has once again brought the dire state of firefighting equipment in the municipality into sharp focus, with local stations reportedly unable to respond due to broken-down machinery.\n\nWhile no casualties were reported, the total loss of goods in the two shops has left traders in despair.\n\nThe fire, the cause of which remains under investigation, started in the heart of the market, quickly engulfing two metal container shops. As the flames intensified, residents were horrified to learn that neither the Kasoa nor the Budumburam fire stations could deploy their tenders.\n\nDO Addo Danso, the Weija Fire Station Administrator, confirmed the systemic failure that led to the delayed arrival of help. He explained that a crew had to be dispatched all the way from Weija to fill the vacuum left by the non-operational local units.\n\n“All the fire tenders stationed at both Kasoa and Budumburam were not operational at the time of the incident,” DO Addo Danso revealed, explaining the logistical nightmare that triggered the community's anger. Violence against the 'First Responders'\n\nUpon their arrival, the Weija crew were not greeted as saviours but as targets. Local youth, incensed by what they perceived as a lethargic response, allegedly attacked the firefighters. Stones were pelted at the moving vehicle, successfully shattering the windscreen and forcing the officers to navigate both the inferno and a hostile crowd.\n\nDespite the assault, the team managed to deploy their hoses and eventually brought the blaze under control, preventing a wider catastrophe in the densely packed market.\n\nCondemnation and police hunt\n\nThe Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) for Awutu Senya East, Seth Serwono Banini, visited the scene to assess the damage and expressed absolute disgust at the treatment of the officers. He has formally tasked the police to track down the individuals behind the assault.\n\n“I urge residents, especially the youth, to desist from the act of attacking security personnel on duty,” the MCE stated, reinforcing that such actions only endanger the lives of the entire community during emergencies.\n\nDO Addo Danso further confirmed that the GNFS is not taking the matter lightly and will seek criminal prosecution for the damage caused to state property.\n\n“We are going to make an official complaint to the police so that they can arrest some of the culprits,” he added.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

He noted that for too long, the focus had been on the “event” rather than the “process,” hence the need for early engagement and advance preparations towards the upcoming games.\n\n\n\n“This plan is our promise to the nation. We are moving beyond wishful thinking and laying a foundation for excellence that will endure,” Richard Akpokavie, GOC President, noted in presenting the document to the Minister.\n\n\n\nThe plan outlines a data-driven approach to athlete development, ensuring that training cycles are consistent and professionalised.\n\n\n\nThe Chef de Missions for the Glasgow Commonwealth Games and the Dakar Youth Olympics, Ernest Danso and Evans Yeboah, both briefed the Minister on preparations regarding Team Ghana, logistics, and fundraising initiatives.\n\n\n\nThe Minister for Sports and Recreation told the GOC leadership that Ghana must prioritise long-term investments in preparation rather than the typical last-minute rush for competition funding.\n\nAdams reiterated that sports must not be treated as merely a leisure activity, but as a major economic enabler for athletes, coaches, administrators, and others, while using major games to boost Ghana’s global brand—especially in the advent of AI, where people are losing jobs.\n\n\n\nTo ensure sustainable funding for sports, the Minister hinted that the recently introduced Ghana Sports Fund will alleviate the funding challenges.\n\n\n\n“We have engaged the National Lottery Authority leadership, and very soon, the sports fund will be boosted by a dedicated lottery system designed specifically to fund sports infrastructure and athlete welfare. This initiative is slated for implementation as soon as possible to reduce the burden on the national treasury,” he said.\n\n\n\nOn the upcoming games, the Minister promised the government’s unflinching support for Team Ghana but advised the GOC to ensure transparent collaboration with all major stakeholders. “The GOC must roll out a nationwide campaign to drum up public support and corporate sponsorship,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe Minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to ethical governance, ensuring every cedi raised for sports is directed toward athlete success and sports infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe meeting was attended by the Chief Director of the Ministry, Mrs Wilhelmina Asamoah; Ernest Danso and Evans Yeboah, both Chef de Missions for Team Ghana; and Charles Osei Asibey, Communications Director of the GOC."

            "content": "Aliko Dangote is Africa's richest man\n\nThe richest man in Africa works from a construction trailer in a dusty parking lot.\n\nThe billionaire, Aliko Dangote, said he once had multiple homes in several countries, a nightlife of fancy parties, a Rolls-Royce and a Ferrari. Then, roughly two decades ago, he got serious about industrialization, he said.\n\n\n\nDangote, now 68, said he sold the cars and the homes abroad and built sugar refineries. He bought a majority stake in a salt-refining company. He built cement factories, first across Nigeria, then in Senegal, Ethiopia, Tanzania and beyond. Then came fertilizer and polyurethane factories.\n\n\n\nThis work of proving the continent is capable of large-scale industrialization done by one of its own was much more important to him than the life of luxury.\n\n\n\n“Some of us need to rescue the country,” he said.\n\n\n\nNow, Dangote’s latest achievement is finally up and running: a sprawling new refinery in Nigeria, a nation that for decades has exported the vast majority of its crude oil.\n\n\n\nLong criticized as a monopolist in the industries he focuses on, the man whose grandfather made his fortune in peanut trading doesn’t want to stop with oil, or even with Nigeria. Dangote wants to break into the steel industry, to spread electricity to more people, to build more ports to industrialize all of Africa.\n\n\n\nHis role model for future expansion is the Indian multinational conglomerate Tata Group, which produces things like black tea and semiconductors.\n\n\n\nHis factories, he said, will also help curb joblessness amid Africa’s youth boom. In Nigeria, the most populous nation on the continent, 40 to 50 million people will need jobs by 2030, according to the World Bank.\n\nAlready, his refinery is producing 650,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Dangote says that output will be double in the next year.\n\n\n\nHe announced over the weekend plans to list shares in the refinery locally. But first, he needs to solve infrastructure problems and address corruption in the oil industry, both of which stand in the way of bringing enough of the nation’s ample supply to his refinery, he said.\n\n\n\nUntil then, his refinery, a labyrinthine behemoth on a campus about 45 miles from his company’s Lagos headquarters, has sometimes supplemented Nigerian crude with imports from the United States and other countries.\n\n\n\nOn a recent afternoon at his industrial campus, a fidgety Dangote was seated at a long table in a trailer, ushering in his next appointment before the previous one was finished. There’s not a minute to spare while trying to conquer Nigeria’s biggest problems.\n\n\n\nDangote dreams of a day when gasoline courses through his country’s veins so fluidly that no one has to endure the long lines that have plagued Nigeria, where gasoline deliveries are hobbled by bad roads and illicit sales.\n\n\n\nCurrent and former colleagues use the same word to describe Dangote: hard-working. Bucking traditional gender norms, he has given executive-level roles to his three children, all daughters.\n\n\n\nSome of Dangote’s indulgences come through in his work. He throws lavish company parties, where he gives away prizes like vehicles to top employees and top customers. Clips of him clapping and singing along to performers circulated online after the annual party for his cement business last month.\n\n\n\nDangote, who is divorced, likes to spend time with his eight grandchildren, and says his idea of a vacation is doing “normal person” things, like going for a jog or window shopping at a mall.\n\nFor years, he would unwind after the workday by inviting friends to his house, a mini-mansion on Victoria Island in Lagos, replete with mahogany-colored pillars, an aquarium in the dining room, a pool and giant terraces. (He also owns a home in Kano and rents a home in Abuja.) But recently he decided to pare back his social life to a tight, weekends-only schedule from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturdays and noon to 10 p.m. on Sundays, he said.\n\n\n\n“Work and fancy life, they don’t go together,” Dangote said. “So, we have to sacrifice to a point.”\n\n\n\nHis workday often continues at his home, where on a recent evening Dangote, in a gray caftan and pants with the Dangote Group logo on it, nestled in a brown leather couch pit in his living room. A box of Rice Krispies was on a dining room table, and the TV was tuned to CNN. He nibbled dates as he met with workers who oversee operations for his three corporate jets.\n\n\n\nMr. Dangote, whose fortune Forbes estimates at $26.2 billion, has built his empire on manufacturing the basics.\n\n\n\nUnlike other multinational chief executives who are thinking about remaking their entire industries to support future innovations, he said he is focused on the tasks before him, skeptical of some newfangled technology. He compared the hype around artificial intelligence to the cheerleading surrounding the release of the first Nokia phones, which are becoming obsolete.\n\n\n\n“This field is getting, you know, out of hand,” he said.\n\n\n\nNigerian anti-graft officials in 2023 accused Dangote’s firm, along with 51 other companies, of receiving preferential foreign exchange rates from a former Central Bank chief. Dangote himself was not implicated, and his company has denied wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nCritics complain Dangote has a near-monopoly on many of the staples of life. Almost any construction site in the country is scattered with bags of Dangote-branded cement; grocery shelves are stocked with Dangote-branded flour and sugar. His wealth, critics say, was built on government subsidies and tax breaks.\n\nDangote insists he merely took advantage of what government officials offered, because he is building up the country.\n\n\n\n“Nobody dared to do it, so we did it,” he said.\n\n\n\nHis chief example is his $20 billion refinery. The tax-subsidized zone where Mr. Dangote built the complex turned out to be swampland, something he did not know until construction started in 2016.\n\n\n\nHe pushed on, clearing the land and backfilling it with 65 million tons of sand. He imported 10,250 trucks from China after he couldn’t find a Nigerian firm with a big enough inventory, then built a jetty for ships to unload them, he said. He built a 23-mile, 10-lane expressway leading from the refinery to a port, using tax credits to finance the construction.\n\n\n\n“The luck that we had, both me and my executive team, is that we didn’t know what we were doing,” he said. “We said that, ‘No, we cannot fail, we must deliver.’”\n\n\n\nThe poor state of Nigeria’s roads is one challenge of getting crude to the refinery. A bigger challenge, Dangote said, is corruption. Middlemen reroute crude, with trucks sometimes disappearing across the border where thieves sell the fuel and pocket the cash.\n\n\n\nHe has launched a legal and public relations battle against what he calls the “mafia situation” in Nigeria’s oil business, suing the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, which regulates and licenses refining activities.\n\n\n\nHe said the regulator was favoring imports more than domestic production and implied that its chief executive, Farouk Ahmed, was illicitly skimming profits, which Ahmed has denied.\n\nThe public glimpsed a gloves-off side of Dangote in a December news conference, where he listed each private school that the children of Mr. Ahmed attended in Switzerland.\n\n\n\n“Four children in the most elite schools in the world,” Dangote said, still in disbelief. “I sent my own daughters to secondary school in Nigeria.”\n\n\n\nAhmed, in a December statement, said the tuition was paid for in part by scholarships and with money from his own father.\n\n\n\nAhmed said his personal and professional activities “will withstand any legitimate inquiry.”\n\n\n\nDangote’s oil ambitions hit a snag last year after some 800 workers were fired because of sabotage allegations, triggering union protests. The workers were eventually reinstated.\n\n\n\nThe refinery employs 30,000 people, about 80 percent of whom are Nigerian. Many managerial positions are held by international workers, which Dangote said would change in time as he trained more locals. His expansion plans will increase the work force to about 65,000 people, he said.\n\n\n\nIn December, Dangote’s foundation announced plans to offer 45,000 scholarships, 10,000 of which will be exclusively for female students in secondary school or college.\n\n\n\n“What’s our legacy?” he asked, posing a question to himself. “Our legacy is to provide what we need.”"

I don’t know why Ursula Owusu is walking about freely after wasting close to (sic). You know, we are still paying about $1.6 million per month on a project.\n\n\n\n“I don't know what is happening. I mean, there are so many people that question this today, as we speak,” he fumed.\n\n\n\nThe IMANI vice president made these remarks while criticising the implementation of the Operation Recover All Loot (ORAL) anti-corruption initiative of President John Dramani Mahama.\n\nHe indicated that the President overpromised, and his remarks at the State of the Nation Address point to this fact.\n\n\n\n“You could tell, maybe from the background which is delivered, that also means that there are some significant challenges with ORAL. The problem with ORAL is that it was overpromised. They had forgotten that the wheels of justice, as the President said, slow down significantly. But it doesn't mean it doesn't work.”\n\n\n\nCudjoe also said that the judiciary was not helping matters when it comes to the implementation of ORAL.\n\n\n\n“I'm amazed that some of the cases took about four months to be heard. I don't think it is fair. I think the judiciary is not helping us in that regard. And so, right from the time someone is charged to the time the case is called, it should not be an average of four months; it should be at most two weeks. I don't see the point. We should prioritise all those crimes that have been committed,” he said.\n\n\n\nSONA: What Mahama said about ORAL in 2025 vs what he is saying now\n\nBAI\n\n\n\nWatch NPP MPs in all-black as President Mahama delivers 2026 SONA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe didn't arrest the dollar, we strengthened the cedi to fight other currencies - Mahama"

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating threats from the Iranian regime,” he said on Saturday.\n\nTrump made a number of other claims and predictions without any concrete evidence, as Iran promised a “crushing” retaliation of its own. Iran is preparing to “take revenge” on Israel and deliver “strong response”, State TV reported.\n\n“We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground.”\n\n“We are going to annihilate their navy. We are going to ensure that the region’s ‘terrorist’ proxies can no longer destabilise the region or the world.”\n\n“We will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It is a very simple message.”\n\n“They will never have a nuclear weapon. This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces.”\n\nIran has repeatedly said it would never build a nuclear weapon and that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only. Neither US intelligence, nor the UN nuclear watchdog have found any evidence that Iran was pursuing an atomic weapon, a narrative Israel and some in the Trump administration have nevertheless pushed.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, said sources told him that “US involvement in this attack is aimed at “decapitating the Iranian regime”.\n\n\n\n“They say that from what they can understand, the attacks were concentrated on areas where Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may be sheltering, so the intention was to try and take out the head of the regime and then see what would happen afterwards,” he added.\n\nOne of the areas targeted in Iran’s capital was near the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, The Associated Press reported. Khamenei is not in Tehran and has been transferred to a secure location, according to an official quoted by Reuters.\n\n“There are countries that have been cautioning the US against this attack and wanted to know what the plan for the day after would be, simply because you can’t guarantee that by removing the supreme leader you would necessarily form a pro-US government,” Fisher said."

But Pakistan on Saturday said there would be “no dialogue”, repeating its long-running demand that Afghanistan stop harbouring “terrorism”, an allegation Kabul denies.\n\n“There won’t be any talks. There’s no dialogue. There’s no negotiation. Terrorism from Afghanistan has to end,” the Pakistani prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, Mosharraf Zaidi, told Pakistan TV, stressing that Pakistan’s responsibility was to protect its citizens and territory.\n\nMeanwhile, tit-for-tat attacks occurred near the fraught border. Afghan media reported that Taliban forces fired drone attacks on Pakistani military camps in the border areas of Miranshah and Spinwam.\n\nPakistan’s Dawn newspaper reported a drone attack hit a mosque in the city of Bannu further south, injuring at least five people. And Pakistan TV said Pakistani forces waged their own attack targeting several positions of the Afghan Taliban.\n\n\n\nThe latest violence erupted after Pakistani air strikes on Afghan territory last weekend triggered retaliatory Afghan attacks stretching across six Pakistani districts on Thursday. In response, Pakistan carried out widespread aerial attacks in the early hours of Friday on the Afghan capital and two other areas, Kandahar and Paktia. It was Pakistan’s first air strikes on the southern power base of the Taliban authorities since they returned to power in 2021.\n\nBoth sides reported heavy losses with conflicting tolls. Pakistan said 12 of its soldiers and 274 Taliban ⁠were killed, while the Taliban said 13 of its fighters and 55 Pakistani soldiers died. Neither side’s claims could be independently verified by Al Jazeera.\n\nThe United States, which considers Pakistan a major non-NATO ally, said it backs Pakistan’s right to “defend itself against Taliban attacks”.\n\nPakistan has witnessed a sharp rise in violence within the country in recent years, including suicide bombings and coordinated assaults targeting security forces. Pakistani authorities blame the Pakistan Taliban, or TTP, for many of the attacks, and accuse Afghanistan of sheltering the group inside Afghanistan.\n\nKabul rejects the allegations and says it does not allow anyone to use Afghan soil for attacks on any country, including Pakistan.\n\nPakistan is nuclear-armed and its military capabilities are vastly superior to Afghanistan’s. However, the Taliban is adept at warfare, hardened by decades of fighting with United States-led forces."

            "content": "is a deputy editor and Verge co-founder with a passion for human-centric cities, e-bikes, and life as a digital nomad. He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nGood electric bikes are expensive. So why not buy one and share it?\n\nThat’s the idea behind the Tenways CGO Compact e-bike I’ve been sharing with my wife and teenage daughter for the last two weeks. It adapts in seconds without any tools to comfortably fit riders of varying heights thanks to its low-entry frame, quick-release seat post, and height-adjustable handlebar.\n\nIt also takes up less space than an ordinary bike with its 20-inch wheels, folding pedals, and a handlebar that twists to create a slim, wall-hugging profile that goes flat inside a car or train.\n\nThe CGO Compact’s geometry puts riders into a comfortable upright body position. Combine that with wide tires and a heavy aluminum frame – heavier than many full-sized e-bikes – and it feels remarkably sturdy despite its size, with a rear carrier system strong enough to hold a child or a few days of groceries.\n\nThe shareable e-bike isn’t a new idea, but Tenways comes close to perfecting it with the €1,999 (about $2,365) CGO Compact.\n\n9 Verge Score Tenways CGO Compact e-bike $ 2365 $ 2365 The Good Saddle and handlebar adjust quickly\n\nTwists and folds to go flat\n\nRides big and sturdy\n\nGood hauling capacity for size\n\nNo service upsells\n\nLow battery alerts The Bad App is just fine\n\nQuick release seat easy to steal $2365 at Tenways How we rate and review products\n\nTenways, the Amsterdam-HQ’d e-bike company of Chinese origin, has been on a tear in Europe thanks to the post-pandemic chaos that took out much of its competition. The brand makes great looking e-bikes from off-the-shelf parts supported by a robust service network. Importantly, they sell below the €2,681 (about $3,160) e-bike average — expensive compared to the US, but far less likely to burst into flames.\n\nMy Tenways review e-bike arrived at my front door in a giant cardboard box. It seemed big enough to fit the CGO Compact fully assembled and with the handlebar twisted, yet I still had to attach the steering column and front wheel myself. The e-bike took about 20 minutes to unbox, but I’ve been assembling direct-to-consumer e-bikes about once a month for the last decade.\n\nQuickly adjusts to fit my wife who is 164cm (5ft 5in) tall. The handlebars and shock-absorbing seat can be raised in seconds to fit my 183cm (6ft) frame. Open the release to raise and lower the handlebars, lift that little pin to twist them out of the way. The folding pedals help create a wall-hugging profile that’s easy to walk past.\n\nThe first thing I did after assembly was play with the Byschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem. It’s magical. Open the lever to quickly raise and lower the handlebar, or to gain access to a pin release that lets the handlebar twist out of the way. It took a little practice for everyone to master but we soon got the hang of it.\n\nThe small LCD dashboard is bright and colorful even in the sun. You have to enter a four-digit PIN code at power-on, which can only be changed in the rudimentary app over Bluetooth. It’s the only theft-deterrence Tenways offers on the CGO Compact, which also means it won’t try to upsell you on subscriptions or software-locked features.\n\nDespite our height differences, ranging from 164cm to 183cm (5ft 5in to 6 feet), everyone found the CGO Compact to be very comfortable. Adjusting the handlebar and saddle takes less than 10 seconds, and the suspension seatpost did a good job of soaking up small bumps. But the seat’s quick release mechanism offers no additional security to prevent the post and saddle from being stolen. A no-no in the big European cities this bike targets.\n\nThe e-bike’s torque sensor made the ride exceptionally intuitive, ensuring that the power delivered by the 250W rear-hub motor was tuned to match the downward force exerted on the pedals. The motor was also very quiet, masked entirely by the sound of the wide, 2.4-inch tires riding over asphalt.\n\nThe Tenways motor is only capable of 45Nm of torque. And without additional gears, the CGO Compact is best for mostly flat environments. It still did better than I expected on hills, easily besting the 35Nm Raleigh One I recently reviewed. For example, I was able to cross a bridge with a 10 percent incline that stymied the Raleigh One, but only if I had a rolling start — otherwise, I had to get off and push. On downhill slopes, the large chainring allowed me to pedal comfortably at speeds approaching 30km/h without my legs frantically spinning out. The pedal-assist, however, quits helping at 25km/h (16mph) in Europe.\n\nI also didn’t experience any of the twitchiness you get from folding bikes with relatively short wheelbases, smaller 16-inch wheels, and narrow handlebars. In general I rode in pedal-assist levels 3 or 4 out of 5, with 3 feeling the most natural, and 4 for when I was in a hurry.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 25 The suspension seat post soaked up bumps on a variety of road surfaces.\n\nOn a full battery I managed to travel 65kms (over 40 miles) before needing a recharge. I received alerts on my iPhone and Apple Watch when the battery dropped to 10 percent, and power dropped noticeably when the estimated remaining range hit 4km. Charging the 494.36Wh battery took a relatively slow 4.5 hours from the bundled charger.\n\nThe CGO Compact was obviously designed by people that actually ride bikes in compact European cities. It comes standard with integrated lighting, mudguards, a loud bell, kickstand, and a partially covered transmission to protect trousers, skirts, and long coats from getting snagged. The little crossbar in the step-through frame even doubles as a handle to help hoist the bike up stairs.\n\nCity bikes need to haul things, which is why the CGO Compact comes fitted with the click-and-go MIK HD rear carrier system. It supports loads up to 27kg (almost 60 pounds) — enough to fit a compatible crate or child seat. The e-bike also has mounting points up front for a bottle cage or rack.\n\nIn general, the Android and iOS app is fine, but it’s rarely needed. It might eventually be useful for buying accessories and insurance, or starting a chat with support and finding the nearest service center. It also promises to show riding data collected by date, but this never worked for me, only showing zeroes.\n\nTenways’ CGO Compact is an excellent e-bike for €1,999 (about $2,365). The riding experience, everyone agrees, has been stellar. And when it eventually needs servicing, Tenways has a solid network of local bike shops in Europe to provide support, with a ready supply of the off-the-shelf parts from brands you know.\n\nThe CGO Compact is a highly adaptable e-bike that rides big and tucks away small, making it an ideal companion for European city life. It’s also exceedingly shareable — but nobody would blame you for keeping it all for yourself.\n\nCGO Compact Specs Tenways C9 Hub Motor (250W, 45Nm torque)\n\nSingle-speed Gates CDN Carbon belt drive\n\n494.36Wh removable battery\n\nSuspension seat post for Selle Royal saddle\n\nTektro hydraulic disc brakes\n\nByschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem\n\nBike weight: 24kg (almost 53 pounds) with all accessories\n\nMax load: 145kg (320 pounds)\n\nMIK HD Rear Carrier system with 27kg (almost 60 pounds) max load\n\nFits riders 160cm and 190cm (5ft 2in to 6ft 2in)\n\nAccessory mounting points on head tube\n\nIntegrated front and rear lighting with daytime running light\n\nLCD display\n\nBasic app for iOS and Android\n\nPhotography by Thomas Ricker / The Verge"

Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of “effective altruism,” they have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission - a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives.\n\nThe Terms of Service of Anthropic’s defective altruism will never outweigh the safety, the readiness, or the lives of American troops on the battlefield.\n\nTheir true objective is unmistakable: to seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military. That is unacceptable.\n\nAs President Trump stated on Truth Social, the Commander-in-Chief and the American people alone will determine the destiny of our armed forces, not unelected tech executives.\n\nAnthropic’s stance is fundamentally incompatible with American principles. Their relationship with the United States Armed Forces and the Federal Government has therefore been permanently altered.\n\nIn conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security. Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic. Anthropic will continue to provide the Department of War its services for a period of no more than six months to allow for a seamless transition to a better and more patriotic service.\n\nAmerica’s warfighters will never be held hostage by the ideological whims of Big Tech.

            "content": "Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.\n\nYet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, Kodak, and others.\n\nAll the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.\n\nIf you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that offers great image quality and lets you choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like Kodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.\n\nTake a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for most people\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 306 grams / Charging method: AA batteries / Companion app: None / Other features: Built-in selfie mirror, film counter\n\nIf all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well-suited for kids and those new to photography.\n\nFor an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most struggle to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash helps. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both bright and dark environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. Photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before, but selfies captured my features and skin tone more accurately, thanks in part to the small front-facing mirror. The updated lens design also lets you twist into Close-Up Mode to zoom slightly and activate the Parallax Correction features for a more aligned photo. It’s a fun, point-and-shoot-style feature, though aligning photos still takes some practice (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).\n\nFor an instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 produces vivid, relatively true-to-life photos. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nThe Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the small counter that shows your remaining shots, which is a useful tracking feature given that each print costs about $1. However, it doesn’t support Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it doesn’t feature filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for a solid instant camera that caters to all ages and experience levels, you’ll likely be satisfied with the Instax Mini 12.\n\nThe best premium instant camera\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 285 grams / Charging method: USB-C (on newer models) / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nOne of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo was a favorite of my former colleague Becca Farcase — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a handsome brown version, as well as a newer pink model.\n\nIt’s easy to balk at its price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.\n\nBeing able to adjust the brightness of the prints helped me capture night photos and a low-light immersive exhibit a little more clearly and realistically, which is a feature the Instax Mini 12 doesn’t offer. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Mini 12, the Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can disable the flash, leverage the 3-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder, and adjust the brightness of a print — a helpful feature, given Evo doesn’t capture dark environments well. The camera’s dials also let you apply various lens options and effects, from retro filters to monochrome shades, and you can even take app-based remote shots, allowing for better seflies and more photographic control.\n\nThe Evo isn’t perfect, though. The companion app isn’t as feature-rich as competing software, the menu system can be confusing to navigate, and the camera’s internal storage maxes out at 45 images. Still, these are relatively minor drawbacks for a stylish, portable camera that makes it easy to quickly capture and print quality shots.\n\nThe best instant camera for social occasions\n\nFilm type: Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / Film size: 3 x 3-inch square prints / Weight: 467 grams / Charging method: Micro USB / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nWhereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app lets you apply frames, stickers, filters, and a wide range of customization options to photos, making it great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature in the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making it a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.\n\nLike the Evo, the Shot 3 Retro features an LCD screen — albeit a much smaller one — that lets you decide whether to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp images from your phone. Unlike the Evo, however, the Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of film. It also uses cheaper film; you can often pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for under $20. The cheaper arguably encourages creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than those from both Fujifilm and Polaroid.\n\nPhotos taken with the Kodak Mini Shot 3 aren’t particularly sharp and can have an excessive pink tint. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nHowever, there are notable drawbacks to the Shot 3 Retro. The resulting prints aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone, for one, nor were they as clear or sharp as what you might get with the Evo or Mini 12 (some even have an excessive pink tint). The Shot 3 Retro doesn’t store images the way the Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish. Nonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.\n\nThe best instant camera for retro fans\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / Weight: 648 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: Yes / Other features: Flip-up lid, scene analysis feature\n\nIf you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the Polaroid Flip is the camera for you. It resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 more than any other camera on our list, thanks to its classic, retro-inspired design and flip-up lid. Its square I-Type film prints and iconic white frame give photos an authentically vintage look, while modern touches like Bluetooth, USB-C charging, and a beginner-friendly companion app add greater convenience and creative control.\n\nCompared to the third-gen Polaroid Now Plus, my former retro pick, the Flip delivers clearer shots with fewer wasted photos, making the extra $50 worthwhile given that eight I-Type sheets are a spendy $18.99. The increased clarity can be attributed to several factors, including the Flip’s sonar autofocus and a four-lens hyperfocal system — which result in sharper, more focused images — along with its excellent flash. It’s the most powerful of any Polaroid camera, and while it can sometimes overexpose images, you can adjust exposure directly from the camera or app. The Scene Analysis feature also helps by warning if a shot is likely to be over- or underexposed, or if you’re too close to your subject. In my experience, the warnings didn’t always prevent overexposure, but they did leave me with shots that looked less blown than those from the Now Plus.\n\nA few outdoor examples I captured with the Polaroid Flip. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nAll that being said, there are some notable drawbacks. The Flip is relatively heavy and awkwardly sized, so you can’t slip it into a purse or easily carry it around. Prints also take up to 15 minutes to develop — during which they must be shielded from light — which can be quite an inconvenience. Low-light performance remains a weak spot as well, and I struggled to capture indoor shots given the contrast and saturation are lower than with Instax film. Admittedly, this gave my pictures a more dreamy, vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust the saturation and exposure settings.\n\nTruth be told, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, the Flip is the perfect camera for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for portability\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / Weight: 239 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: No / Other features: Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter\n\nWhereas the Flip is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It weighs just over a pound and fits easily in the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it the most portable instant camera on our list. If its images were more true to life and didn’t require you to sheild them from the light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d call it the best instant camera for kids or travel.\n\nAt $89.99, the latest Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera available, with film that costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (a 16-sheet pack runs $21.99). The new Go sports a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including USB-C support, and Polaroid claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor. Photos are slightly brighter, though the original Go produced warmer images that felt more true to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low, but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Flip.\n\nThe second-gen Polaroid Go produces charming photos but with a cooler tone. Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Flip, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. There’s no Bluetooth or companion app for added effects; however, the camera does include a self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. The smaller prints may disappoint those who prefer traditional Polaroid sizes, though, and its modern design lacks the retro charm of older models. But classic Polaroid cameras didn’t come with an app, either, and the Go’s simplicity makes it an a easy-to-use option that delivers a traditional instant film experience at less than half the price of the Flip.\n\nOther instant cameras to consider\n\nFujifilm’s $116.99 Instax Mini 41 is the long-awaited follow-up to the Mini 40. The updated model retains the retro design found on the prior model but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups. It didn’t take long testing the Mini 41 for me to realize it’s simply the Mini 12 for adults. With its black-and-silver body and flatter, squarer edges, the Mini 41 looks sleeker and more stylish. The two cameras are nearly identical, aside from the design, with the same solid photo quality and feature set. Both battery-powered options turn on with a simple twist of the lens, and each comes equipped with a selfie mirror, a close-up mode, and a flash (which cannot be disabled).\n\nThere are a few subtle upgrades to the Mini 41, however. A textured grip in the front makes it easier to hold, and its shape makes shooting in landscape mode more comfortable. But those are small differences, and at their core, the cameras offer the same experience. Since the Instax Mini 12 retails for less, I ultimately believe it’s the better value; however, if a fashionable, mature look appeals to you, the Mini 41 is a great alternative, especially if you can find it on sale.\n\nIf you’re looking for an advanced analog instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At $234.95, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12 or the Mini 41, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click cameras given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket, an aluminum extension column, and a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur when capturing fast-moving subjects.\n\nThanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12, Mini 41, and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera, not a hybrid like the Evo, so you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The newer model is also less user-friendly than the Mini 12 and Mini 41, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters.\n\nThe Kodak Smile Plus is another hybrid instant camera that allows you to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $129.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with a physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers.\n\nHowever, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark.\n\nThat said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software isn’t as snappy or feature-rich, it still lets you add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it’s often available for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.\n\nFrom photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, Leica’s Sofort 2 is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.\n\nThe drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s challenging to recommend at $399, as most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The Leica user interface is easier to navigate, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also appreciate that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.\n\nWhile it didn’t make the cut, the Instax Square SQ1 is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and features a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $159.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100. That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Flip and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.\n\nFujifilm also sells the newer Instax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at $199.95. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.\n\nFujifilm’s Instax Wide Evo Hybrid is nearly identical to the Instax Mini Evo. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $409.95 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lenses and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.\n\nPlus, unlike the Wide 400, the Wide Evo Hybrid is a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful feature that can reduce wasted shots. However, at $409.95, it costs significantly more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken, which is something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects, such as a dog or hyperactive toddler.\n\nIf you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $409.95 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $175.95 Instax Wide 400 is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar stills to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.\n\nFujifilm’s new Instax Mini LiPlay Plus isn’t nearly as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo, but it’s worth considering if you take a lot of selfies. At $234.99, the hybrid camera costs the same as the Instax Mini Evo, but features a 3-inch LCD screen on the back, along with a second, rear-facing wide-angle lens designed specifically for self-portraits. That dedicated selfie camera, paired with the LCD, delivers some of the best — and most precise — selfies I’ve captured with an instant camera to date.\n\nThe LiPlay Plus also includes some fun extra features, such as a layered photo mode that combines images from both cameras into a single shot. It can also record short audio clips, which are saved as a QR code you can place in a corner of the printed photo. Both features are enjoyable to play with, though the layered photo mode can, admittedly, come off as gimmicky. You’re basically just dropping a selfie onto a background image with no way to reposition or resize it.\n\nWhat I’m looking for How we test instant cameras Collapse Typically, I try to spend at least a couple of weeks, if not months, testing each camera to get a sense of what it would be like to actually own one. I’ll use them to capture photos of loved ones while hanging out, as well as subjects and scenes I stumble across as I explore Los Angeles and its many beaches. I shoot indoors and outside, with and without the flash, allowing me to compare how each camera performs in both bright and low-light environments.I also ask friends and family — both young and old — for their input on image quality, and I have them take photos with the instant camera to get their thoughts on usability. If the camera comes with extra features, such as filters or support for a companion app, I’ll make sure to put them to the test in real-life situations. I note how easy it is to pull up and navigate the app, apply the effects, and, of course, how the results look. Photo quality Collapse Instant cameras aren’t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most struggle in low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life. Ease of use Collapse How easy is it to set the instant camera up and take photos with it? Ease of use is a big part of what makes instant cameras fun and accessible to people of all ages. You shouldn’t need a professional photography background just to enjoy an instant camera. Value Collapse Instant cameras come with different features at various price points. Generally, the more feature-rich cameras tend to be pricier, but do the extra capabilities justify the added cost? Some cameras, for example, pair with a companion app or feature a built-in selfie mirror, while others let you print images from your phone. None of these are essential, though the added niceties may be worth it for some people. Suitability Collapse Some instant cameras aren’t as well-suited for certain situations and / or people as others. For example, there are instant cameras that print old-fashioned Polaroid photos that aren’t very clear. They frustrate me, but retro lovers might find them charming. Other cameras come with advanced creative modes that let you edit photos and even print smartphone photos, but a young child might find them difficult to use. Film Collapse Each instant camera requires a different kind of film, which means that the sticker price of the camera isn’t the true price. This is something you should take into account before making a purchase, as the cost of film can quickly add up. Depending on the brand, you may have to pay anywhere between 50 cents and $2 a shot.It’s also important to take into account that some film is easier to find. The Instax Mini 12, for example, uses credit card-size Instax Mini film that’s sold at most major retailers. Other types of film, including the film needed for Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, are available on Amazon but aren’t sold by as many retailers.Finally, most instant camera brands sell films of varying quality in a range of styles. Some are decorated with colorful frames and patterns, while others are black and white. They also vary in shape and size, from small rectangular prints you can stick in your wallet to square-shaped ones. You can also buy wider prints, and some brands even sell film with an adhesive backing that allows you to use the resulting images as stickers.\n\nUpdate, February 27th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and shorten the copy for all of our main entries."

The Artemis III mission, scheduled for 2027, was originally going to attempt to land on the Moon but will now be a test flight instead. NASA also says it’s “increasing its cadence of missions,” including adding a second test flight in 2027 and aiming for “at least one surface landing every year thereafter,” including the Artemis IV landing.\n\nThe overhaul to the Artemis launch schedule follows a report from NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) earlier this month that highlighted serious safety risks with NASA’s previous plans for future launches. ASAP was particularly concerned about Artemis III, which its report said included too many “cumulative technical, operational, and schedule risks associated with multiple first-of-a-kind objectives planned for a single mission.”\n\nThe Artemis II mission, scheduled for this year, has faced a string of issues during testing over recent weeks, delaying its launch until no earlier than April. Artemis II is intended to orbit the Moon — if it’s successful, it will be the first time humans visit lunar orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance’s merger agreement is now official. On Friday, the two companies announced plans to merge into a massive media company that will fold WBD’s studio, linear channels, streaming service, and gaming segment into Paramount.\n\nThough WBD initially signed onto an $83 billion agreement to merge part of Warner Bros. with Netflix, Paramount persisted with a hostile takeover bid, followed by a series of offers. That persistence paid off, as WBD determined that Paramount’s “best and final” offer is “superior” to Netflix’s deal. On Thursday, Netflix declined to match Paramount’s bid, calling it “no longer financially attractive.”\n\nParamount and WBD say the board of directors of both companies has signed off on the deal. The companies expect it to close in the third quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Under the agreement, Paramount will acquire WBD in a deal valued at $110 billion. Paramount has also agreed to cover the $7 billion regulatory termination fee and the $2.8 billion breakup fee owed to Netflix, which it has already paid, according to Bloomberg.\n\n“Together, Paramount and WBD will deliver greater choice for consumers through its leading streaming platforms with an exceptional intellectual property portfolio that has produced popular franchises such as Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Top Gun, the DC Universe and SpongeBob SquarePants,” the companies say in the press release.\n\nLawmakers and regulators are skeptical about the Paramount-WBD merger. “A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a statement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta also warned that the agreement isn’t a “done deal,” and that the state’s Department of Justice will be “vigorous” in its review of the merger."

            "content": "Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts, and have stopped getting a response. This week, thanks to a reader tip, we think we’ve found the original phone the T1 is based on.\n\nA long time ago, back when the Trump phone was but a single, inaccurate render and a contradictory spec sheet, we tried to figure out what other phone it might be based on. Now, eight months, two spec overhauls, and one redesign later, I have a good guess: the HTC U24 Pro.\n\nI didn’t spot this by myself. A reader first tipped me off to the similarities between the U24 Pro and the Trump phone I revealed a few weeks ago, which are numerous: a similar angled body and curved display, a unique front sensor array, and broadly similar specs, including oddities like a headphone jack and microSD card support.\n\nLet’s get one thing out the way at the top: I’m pretty sure HTC isn’t secretly building the Trump phone. Sohaib Ahmed, the company’s global director of PR, told me as much: “HTC does not design or manufacture phones for third parties.” But that doesn’t rule out another company playing a part in designing or building both phones, and given just how similar they look, I suspect that’s exactly what happened.\n\nIt’s a little hard to make out in this screenshot, but the Trump phone shares the sharply angled edges of the HTC U24 Pro. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nThe U24 Pro is an odd phone in its own right. It launched in 2024 for €549 (around $600 at the time), and was heralded in some corners as a return from the dead for HTC, despite the fact that it followed the U23 Pro a year earlier, and a string of smaller releases that targeted the Asian market. HTC, once one of the major players in the Android phone industry, had been greatly diminished ever since selling a large part of its smartphone business to Google for $1.1 billion in 2017.\n\nBoth the T1 Phone and the U24 Pro share a slightly asymmetric angular frame, jutting out into a point along every edge, with a heavily curved screen on the front. I cannot think of, nor find, another phone that is quite the same shape — even small details like the positions of the antenna lines around the power and volume buttons line up. Even more telling is the set of sensors along each phone’s top. The U24 Pro splits up its speaker grill, notification LED, and proximity sensor into three, resulting in an unusual design with a long bar, a small dot for the LED, and then a second shorter bar, at the point where the display meets the phone’s top. What looks like the same sensor design can be clearly seen on the Trump phone I was shown, though I can’t confirm that the sensors themselves are the same, or that the T1 Phone will also have a notification LED.\n\nBoth phones have near-identical sets of speakers and sensors about the front selfie camera, with headphone jack and microphone visible behind them on the top edges. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nOther details are subtler. It’s hard to tell exactly from the glimpses I got of the Trump phone, but along the top frame it certainly looks to have both a headphone jack and a microphone in the exact same positions as on the HTC device. Even having a headphone jack in the first place is evidence of the phones’ connection, given how rare the feature is in modern devices. The same can be said for the fact that both phones include a microSD card slot, sharing support for up to 1TB cards on top of a base 512GB of storage.\n\nWhile the rear cameras look completely different, which seems to scupper my theory, look again: The U24 Pro’s cameras are split into a pair close together, with a third lens lower down. The new Trump phone sets all its cameras in one mount, but they’re unevenly spaced, with a larger gap between the second and third lenses. These cameras may look totally different on the surface, but I suspect that underneath you’ll find they’re similar. And what we know of the specs matches too: Trump Mobile told me that its phone will have 50-megapixel sensors for both the main and selfie cameras, and my glimpse of its camera UI showed an ultrawide and a 2x zoom option — all of which you’ll find on the U24 Pro.\n\nThe two phones’ cameras look different at first, but the unusual lens placement might just line up. Screenshot: Dominic Preston / The Verge and Image: HTC\n\nAssuming that the two phones are essentially the same, does the U24 Pro tell us any more about what to expect from the T1? It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, matching what I’d been told about a Snapdragon 7-series chip in the Trump phone. The U24 Pro has a 6.8-inch OLED display, 60W wired charging and even wireless charging support, and an IP67 rating for dust and water protection. There’s reason to be cautious reading too much into the spec sheet, though: The U24 Pro released with a 4,600mAh battery, smaller than the 5,000mAh capacity I’ve been told will be in the Trump phone. If that spec differs, then other elements of the internals could well too — the bigger battery in particular might replace the wireless charging coils of the HTC phone.\n\nThe U24 Pro launched to middling reviews, which may not inspire much confidence in Trump Mobile’s offering. Tech Advisor gave the phone two and a half stars out of five, calling it “hard to recommend over rivals,” while Notebookcheck declared it “modern and yet out of date.” Still, it fared surprisingly well in a JerryRigEverything teardown and durability test.\n\nHe noticed, however, that this didn’t appear to be the HTC of old, lacking the sapphire crystal HTC previously used on its displays and optical image stabilization on the front camera it once pioneered. The U24 Pro and other HTC phones released in the last few years share little consistent design language, and ship with near-stock Android software. Speculation has been rife that HTC isn’t in fact manufacturing the phones internally, but had commissioned an ODM — original design manufacturer — to produce the hardware. ODMs design and manufacture phones for other companies, usually to a set of specifications provided by the consumer-facing brands, and often retain ownership of the designs, allowing them to reuse and repurpose them for other clients. I asked HTC for clarification, but the company wouldn’t confirm whether the U24 Pro was made in-house or contracted out.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that Trump Mobile, or its manufacturing partner, is simply ripping off the design of a little-known HTC device. But I think the most likely answer here is a more mundane one: HTC probably worked with some unnamed ODM to design and manufacture the U24 Pro, and Trump Mobile just happened to work with the same company. That manufacturer may have either dug out its old designs for HTC when developing the T1 Phone, or perhaps gave new life to old, unused components from HTC’s production run. Without knowing the hypothetical ODM involved, it’s hard to say for sure. Trump Mobile has previously confirmed that it’s working with a partner or partners to manufacture its phones outside the US, before their “final assembly” in Miami, but executive Don Hendrickson wouldn’t tell me the name of its manufacturer or where it’s based. I reached out to the company again for comment on this story, and received no reply.\n\nSo no, I don’t think that HTC made the Trump phone. But it does look likely that it is based, more or less, on one of that company’s phones. It remains to be seen how the T1 Phone will differ in its details, but the fact that its origins seem so closely tied to an unpopular midranger from two years ago doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the T1 Phone’s flagship credentials.\n\nGot inside information on Trump Mobile or the Trump phone?

            "content": "Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.\n\nThe blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.\n\nThe Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.\n\nAccess to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.\n\nWe understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase. We acknowledge the difficulties this is causing for our users there. Supabase continues to follow up through all available channels to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nWe continue to advise affected customers… — Supabase (@supabase) February 27, 2026\n\nAn Indian founder, who asked not to be named to avoid potential repercussions, told TechCrunch they had stopped seeing new user sign-ups from India over the past two to three days. A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.\n\nWhile Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.\n\nAt the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.\n\nThe incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.\n\n“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.”\n\nIndia has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted access to developer platform GitHub, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also reported that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.\n\nFounded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has gained traction amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its valuation to $5 billion.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond."

The employee used confidential OpenAI information in connection with the trades made, the company alleges.\n\nOpenAI didn’t release the name of the employee. However, a spokesperson said that such actions violated a company policy that bans workers from using inside information for personal gain, including on prediction markets.\n\nPrediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi allow people to make wagers on the outcomes of real-world events. For instance, on Polymarket, there are wagers being made around the kind of products OpenAI will announce in 2026 and when the company will go public. They can cover any event, and some eye-popping money can be made. As we recently reported, an accountant won a $470,300 jackpot on Kalshi by betting against DOGE believers.\n\nPrediction markets insist they are not gambling sites, preferring to label themselves as financial platforms. Kalshi is a regulated exchange and, in fact, it fined and banned a MrBeast editor for similar alleged insider trading earlier this week. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment."

The president allowed for a six-month phase-out period for departments using the products, but emphasized that Anthropic was no longer welcome as a federal contractor.\n\n“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again,” the president wrote in the post.\n\nNotably, the president’s post did not mention any plans to designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk, as had been previously mentioned as a consequence. However, a subsequent tweet from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made good on the threat.\n\n“In conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security,” Secretary Hegseth wrote. “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\n\nThe Pentagon dispute centered on Anthropic’s refusal to allow its AI models to be used to power either mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, which Secretary Hegseth found unduly restrictive.\n\nCEO Dario Amodei reiterated his stance in a public post on Thursday, refusing to compromise on the two points.\n\n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters — with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei wrote at the time. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Per the BBC, CEO Sam Altman sent a memo to staff on Thursday saying he shared the same “red lines” and that any OpenAI-related defense contracts would also reject uses that were “unlawful or unsuited to cloud deployments, such as domestic surveillance and autonomous offensive weapons.”\n\nOpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who very publicly fell out with Altman in November 2023 and has since co-founded his own AI company, also waded into the conversation on Friday, writing on X: “It’s extremely good that Anthropic has not backed down, and it’s significant that OpenAI has taken a similar stance.”\n\nBut within hours of the Trump administration ordering federal agencies to cut ties with Anthropic, OpenAI moved to fill the void, announcing a deal with the Pentagon that Altman said preserved the same core principles Anthropic had fought for — prohibitions on domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, OpenAI and the government began meeting about a potential tie-up on Wednesday of this week.\n\nSurely, there will be more twists to come.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI and Google each received contract awards from the U.S. Defense Department last July. While some Google employees have come out in support of Anthropic, Google and its parent company have yet to comment.\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.\n\nSuno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\n\nStill, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more."

The deal is reportedly valued at around $150 million per season, a significant jump from the roughly $85 million ESPN reportedly paid. All races are available to Apple TV subscribers at no extra charge. The previous partnership with ESPN achieved an average viewership of 1.3 million in its final year.\n\nNotably, Netflix was previously reported to be eyeing U.S. media rights for Formula 1 back in 2022."

            "content": "US secretary of defense Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon to designate Anthropic a “supply-chain risk” on Friday, sending shock waves through Silicon Valley and leaving many companies scrambling to understand whether they can keep using one of the industry’s most popular AI models.\n\n“Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic,” Hegseth wrote in a social media post.\n\nThe designation comes after weeks of tense negotiations between the Pentagon and Anthropic over how the US military could use the startup’s AI models. In a blog post this week, Anthropic argued its contracts with the Pentagon should not allow for its technology to be used for mass domestic surveillance of Americans or fully autonomous weapons. The Pentagon asked that Anthropic agree to let the US military apply its AI to “all lawful uses” with no specific exceptions.\n\nA supply-chain-risk designation allows the Pentagon to restrict or exclude certain vendors from defense contracts if they’re deemed to pose security vulnerabilities, such as risks related to foreign ownership, control, or influence. It is intended to protect sensitive military systems and data from potential compromise.\n\nAnthropic responded in another blog post on Friday evening, saying it would “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court,” and that such a designation would “set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government.”\n\nAnthropic added that it hadn’t received any direct communication from the Department of Defense or the White House regarding negotiations over the use of its AI models."

            "content": "Other Wireless Chargers We Tested\n\nThere are a lot of wireless chargers. Here are a few more we like, but for one reason or another don't warrant a place above.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nKrafted Couch Wireless Charger for $52: I thought this wireless charger that’s designed to be draped over the arm of your couch was a great idea when I saw it, but the ridges failed to keep it in place on my velvety couch, so it kept slipping down the side. The silicone finish with the Krafted logo is also a bit ugly. It's just a silicone mat with a magnetic charger inside, though there is a fairly generous 6.6-foot (2-meter) cable, and it is Qi2 rated. If you’re always rooting around for a charger and one of the colors blends well with your furniture, it might be a good solution for you.\n\nEinova Eggtronic Charging Stone for $70: Made with 100 percent solid marble or stone—you can choose from a variety. Every single pick in this guide looks very much like a wireless charger, but I've had visiting friends ask if this one is a drink coaster. (I'm still figuring out whether that's a good or bad thing.) It has zero LEDs, perfect for bedrooms; just try to hide the cable to truly make it blend into your home. We recommend putting a case on your phone when using it with this charger, as there's a risk of scuffing up the back with these harder surfaces.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nBaseus Nomos 5-in-1 Charging Station for $100: If you liked the PicoGo W2 above but need more gadget-charging power, this 5-in-1 could be worth a look. It also has a tilting pad and retractable USB-C cable, but adds two more USB-C ports and one USB-A, along with a stats-filled display. It’s perfect for your desktop. I also tried and quite liked the Baseus Nomos 8-in-1 Magnetic Charging Station ($70), which combines a similar folding Qi2 pad with three US AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one USB-A.\n\nRapport London Formula Wireless Charging Tray for $475: Yes, this is an obscene price for a Qi wireless charger. You can probably make a version for a fraction of the cost. But Rapport's build quality is quite nice, with a lacquered grey box and a soft-touch fabric to keep your watches and phone scratch-free. It reliably recharged several Android phones without making them too warm, all while offering storage for a few watches. It's attractive, but you have to have cash to burn at this price.\n\niOttie iOS Wireless Duo for $50: This dual-charging system looks pretty—I like the fabric-wrapped stand—and you can charge another device on the rubberized charging pad next to it. The stand can be used in portrait or landscape, though in the latter orientation it'll block the pad. I use the pad to top up my wireless earbuds, but I wouldn't use this iOttie on a nightstand, because the LED on the front can be glaring. A cable and adapter are included, which makes it a good value. It can charge Pixel phones at up to 15 watts, iPhones at 7.5 watts, and other Android phones at 10 watts.\n\nJourney Alti Play Performance Desk Mat for $120: This is a desk mat that doubles as a wireless charging pad. On the left side is a plasticky rectangle with a Qi2 magnetic puck for your smartphone. Above it is a little area to charge wireless earbuds (5 watts). Naturally, there's RGB all over, and there are two buttons you can press to cycle through patterns and colors. It's a smart-looking system, though the quality of the actual mat leaves a bit to be desired. I didn't have issues gliding my mouse on it, and it stays put thanks to the rubber underside, but I just didn't like the look and feel of the Lycra surface. Journey has some other versions of this mat that use different materials, so take a look if you like the overall aesthetic.\n\nCourant Catch:2 Essentials for $75: Wireless chargers should look nice. You shouldn't settle for anything less! This Courant dual charger oozes luxury with its Belgian linen-wrapped surface (especially in the camel color). I've used it by my front door to recharge my partner's and my wireless earbuds for two years. The rubber feet prevent it from shifting around, but even if there are five coils in this pad, you should try to be precise when you put your device down to charge and make sure the LED lights up to double-check. It comes with a color-matching USB-C cable.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nZens Liberty Wireless Charger for $150: I tested the Glass Edition of this wireless charging pad, and it looks stunning with the 16 overlapping copper coils on display (the standard version has a woolen fabric top). It can charge two devices simultaneously at up to 15 watts apiece, and there’s an optional Apple Watch add-on ($19). As stylish as it is, the price is too high. Because you can see the coils, placement is never an issue, but it’s a bulky charger; the fan is audible at times, and while I had no problem charging my iPhone or AirPods, my Pixel 6 Pro got very warm on this pad.\n\nXiaomi Mi 80-W Wireless Charging Stand for $50: By far the fastest wireless charger we have tested, this stand is only worth considering for Xiaomi phones (it seems to charge most other phones at 10 watts or below). I tested with the Xiaomi 13 Ultra, which tops out at 50 watts (some Xiaomi models can go higher). The unusual sail shape combines a white triangular section with a clear acrylic base that has a subtle groove to hold your phone in place and a gap underneath for the exhaust grill from the noisy fan. The USB-C port and LED indicator are on the back.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

            "content": "The snow is melting, the days are getting longer, and I can almost smell the springtime ahead. Soon, we'll be cruising around town on ebikes and electric scooters instead of burning fossil fuels. For now, the weather hasn't quite caught up, which is great for markdowns. Many of the best electric scooters are still seeing significant discounts. If you've been thinking about buying one, now's the best time: prices are low, and sunny commuting days are just ahead.\n\nGear editor Julian Chokkattu has spent five years testing more than 45 electric scooters. These are his top picks that are also on sale right now.\n\nApollo Go for $849 ($450 Off)\n\nThis is Gear editor Julian Chokkattu's favorite scooter. The riding experience is powerful and smooth, thanks to its dual 350-watt motors and solid front and rear suspensions. The speed maxes out at 28 miles per hour (mph), which doesn't make it the fastest scooter on the market, but it has a good range. (Chokkattu is a very tall man and was able to travel 15 miles on a single charge at 15 mph.) Other Apollo features he appreciates: turn signals, a dot display, a bell, along with a headlight and an LED strip for extra visibility.\n\nApollo Phantom 2.0 for $2099 ($900 Off)\n\nThe Apollo Phantom 2.0 maxes out at 44 mph, with plenty of power from its dual 1,750-watt motors. It's a gorgeous scooter, designed with 11-inch self-healing tubeless tires and a dual-spring suspension system for a smooth riding experience. But with great power comes great weight. At 102 pounds, the Phantom 2.0 is the heaviest electric scooter Chokkattu has tested, so I would only recommend this purchase if you don't live in a walkup and/or have a garage.\n\nMore Discounted Electric Scooters"

            "content": "US President Donald Trump announced Friday that he was instructing every federal agency to “immediately cease” use of Anthropic’s AI tools. The move comes after Anthropic and top officials clashed for weeks over military applications of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump said that there would be a “six month phase out period” for agencies using Anthropic, which could allow time for further negotiations between the government and the AI startup.\n\nThe Pentagon and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nShortly after the President’s announcement, defense secretary Pete Hegseth said that Anthropic would also be designated a “supply chain risk,” a move normally reserved for foreign businesses considered a danger to American national security. The designation will bar the US military and its contractors and suppliers from working with the AI company.\n\nHegseth also lashed out at Anthropic and its CEO, Dario Amodei, over the company's refusal to agree to its demands. “Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of ‘effective altruism,' they have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission—a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives,” Hegseth wrote on X.\n\nThe Department of Defense has sought to change the terms of a deal struck with Anthropic and other companies last July to eliminate restrictions on how AI can be deployed and instead permit “all lawful use” of the technology. Anthropic objected to the change, claiming that it could allow AI to be used to fully control lethal autonomous weapons or to conduct mass surveillance on US citizens."

            "content": "Looking for an upgraded Roku that's a great match for your new 4K TV? Right now, both Amazon and Best Buy have the 2024 Roku Ultra discounted to $80, a $20 break from the usual price. It sports dual-band Wi-Fi and Ethernet for a more consistent connection, support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and the remote has a headphone port.\n\nWhile there are a ton of great Roku streaming devices to choose from, the Ultra stands out for a few reasons. Streaming in 4K requires a huge amount of bandwidth, and some wireless networks just aren't up to the task, particularly if your TV isn't near your router. A true dual-band Wi-Fi setup in the Roku Ultra helps ensure a stutter-free experience on all of your favorite streaming services. If you really hate buffering and dropped connections, there's an Ethernet port around back for a wired hookup, something most other streaming devices can't claim.\n\nAnother nice upgrade you get with your Roku Ultra kit is the remote, which includes a built-in 3.5-mm headphone jack. That's perfect if you like to sneak in a few episodes of your favorite show after everyone's gone to bed, or want to catch a movie without waking a sleeping baby. The Roku Ultra even includes a pair of earbuds you can use right out of the box, which are surprisingly good for what they are, and they include extra ear tips for getting the fit right.\n\nLike some of the other premium Roku streaming devices, the hands-free voice controls make it super easy to find what you're looking for. Rather than dig through all of your apps and services looking for a movie, you can just say the title into the remote and let Roku go and find it for you.\n\nIf you're ready to take your 4K streaming to the next level, both Best Buy and Amazon have the Roku Ultra marked down to $80. We also have a great guide that breaks down the differences between all of the available Roku streamers, and a roundup of our favorite media streamers, in case you're wondering what the Roku alternatives look like."

            "content": "A few months ago, a family came into Pasadena Cyclery in Pasadena, California, for a repair on what they thought was their teenager’s ebike. “I can’t fix that here,’ Daniel Purnell, a store manager and technician, remembers telling them. “That’s a motorcycle.” The mother got upset. She didn’t realize that what she thought was an ebike could go much faster, perhaps up to 55 miles per hour.\n\n“There’s definitely an education problem,” Purnell says. In California, bike advocates are pushing a new bill designed to clear up that confusion around what counts as an electric bicycle—and what doesn’t.\n\nIt’s a tricky balance. On one hand, backers want to allow riders access to new, faster, and more affordable non-car transportation options, ones that don’t require licenses and are emission-free. On the other hand, people, and especially kids, seem to be getting hurt. Ebike-related injuries jumped more than 1,020 percent nationwide between 2020 and 2024, according to hospital data, though it’s not clear if the stats-keepers can routinely distinguish between ebikes and their faster, “e-moto” cousins. (Moped and powered-assisted cycle injuries jumped 67 percent in that same period.)\n\n“We’re overdue to have better ebike regulation,” says California state senator Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat who sponsored the bill and represents parts of North County in San Diego. “This has been an ongoing and growing issue for years.”\n\nSenate Bill 1167 would make it illegal for retailers to label higher-powered, electric-powered vehicles as ebikes. It would clarify that ebikes have fully operative pedals and electric motors that don’t exceed 750 watts, enough to hit top speeds between 20 and 28 mph.\n\n“We’re not against these devices,” says Kendra Ramsey, the executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition, which represents riders and is promoting the legislation. “People think they’re ebikes and they're not really ebikes.”\n\nBill backers say they hope the fix, if it passes, makes a difference, especially for teenagers, who love the freedom that electric motors give them but can get into trouble if something goes wrong at higher speeds. Kids 17 and younger accounted for 20 percent of US ebike injuries from 2020 to 2024, about in line with the share of the total population. But headlines—and the laws that follow them—have focused on teen injuries and even deaths.\n\nThere are no national laws governing ebike riding. But bike backers spent years moving between states to pass laws that put ebikes into three classes: Class 1, which have pedal-assist that only works when they’re actually pedaled, and goes up to 20 mph; Class 2, which have throttles that work without pedaling but still only reach 20 mph; and Class 3, which use pedal-assist to move up to 28 mph. Plenty of states and cities restrict the most powerful Class 3 bikes to people older than 16. (In a complicated twist, some ebikes have different “modes,” allowing riders to toggle between Class 2 and Class 3.)\n\nLast year, researchers visited 19 San Francisco Bay Area middle and high schools and found that 88 percent of the electric two-wheeled devices parked there were so high-powered and high-speed that they didn’t comply with the three-class system at all.\n\nEbikes have clearly struck a chord with state policymakers: at least 10 bills introduced this year deal with ebikes, according to Ramsey.\n\nSome bike advocates believe injuries have less to do with ebikes than “e-motos,” a category that’s less likely to appear in retail stores or the sort of social media ads attracting teens to the tech. These have more powerful motors and can travel in excess of 30 mph. Vehicles, like the Surron Ultra Bee, which can hit top speeds of 55 mph, or Tuttio ICT, which can hit 50, are often marketed by retailers as \"electric bikes.” Because so many sales happen online, it can be hard for people, and especially parents, to know what they’re getting into."

            "content": "OpenAI has fired an employee following an investigation into their activity on prediction market platforms including Polymarket, WIRED has learned.\n\nOpenAI CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, disclosed the termination in an internal message to employees earlier this year. The employee, she said, “used confidential OpenAI information in connection with external prediction markets (e.g. Polymarket).”\n\n“Our policies prohibit employees from using confidential OpenAI information for personal gain, including in prediction markets,” says spokesperson Kayla Wood. OpenAI has not revealed the name of the employee or the specifics of their trades.\n\nEvidence suggests that this was not an isolated event. Polymarket runs on the Polygon blockchain network, so its trading ledger is pseudonymous but traceable. According to an analysis by the financial data platform Unusual Whales, there have been clusters of activities, which the service flagged as suspicious, around OpenAI-themed events since March 2023.\n\nUnusual Whales flagged 77 positions in 60 wallet addresses as suspected insider trades, looking at the age of the account, trading history, and significance of investment, among other factors. Suspicious trades hinged on the release dates of products like Sora, GPT-5, and the ChatGPT Browser, as well as CEO Sam Altman’s employment status. In November 2023, two days after Altman was dramatically ousted from the company, a new wallet placed a significant bet that he would return, netting over $16,000 in profits. The account never placed another bet.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former tech worker who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at kateknibbs.09.\n\nThe behavior fits into patterns typical of insider trades. “The tell is the clustering. In the 40 hours before OpenAI launched its browser, 13 brand-new wallets with zero trading history appeared on the site for the first time to collectively bet $309,486 on the right outcome,” says Unusual Whales CEO Matt Saincome. “When you see that many fresh wallets making the same bet at the same time, it raises a real question about whether the secret is getting out.”"

            "content": "Less than a year ago, Skydance Media closed its $8 billion merger with Paramount, making the Trump-friendly Ellison family—billionaire Oracle founder Larry and his son David, CEO of Paramount Skydance—among the most powerful media moguls in the country. A looming Paramount Skydance merger with Warner Bros. Discovery would expand their empire even further.\n\nNow that Netflix has backed out of its bid to acquire WBD, the Ellisons stand to gain an entirely new trove of significant intellectual property, from DC Comics to Harry Potter. According to Reuters, Warner Bros. agreed to be acquired by Paramount Skydance in a $110 billion deal signed Friday, with Paramount Skydance agreeing to pay a $7 billion termination fee if federal regulators don’t approve the merger.\n\nParamount’s merger with Skydance has already brought about mass layoffs, including at CBS News, where Free Press founder Bari Weiss is leading a cultural overhaul as editor in chief. In January, Oracle became a partial owner of TikTok, giving the Ellisons even more cultural currency.\n\nHere’s everything the family would control if the WBD deal goes through.\n\nCBS and CBS News\n\nBesides its news division, which includes 60 Minutes, CBS is also home to hits like Tracker and Matlock, along with reality stalwarts Survivor and Big Brother.\n\nHBO and HBO Max\n\nAmong the most Emmy-winningest networks to exist, HBO’s library includes classics like Game of Thrones, The Wire, and Veep, as well as newer hits like The Pitt, The Gilded Age, and Thrones spin-off A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. (Outside of Canada, HBO Max is also a key distributor of the hockey smut drama Heated Rivalry.)\n\nCNN\n\nWhile CNN’s ratings dipped last year, it remains a news juggernaut and a top 5 cable network, featuring household names like John King, Kaitlan Collins, and Anderson Cooper (who recently announced he will be leaving 60 Minutes at the end of the current season).\n\nDC Comics\n\nThe merger would put Paramount Skydance in control of storied comic book franchises like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nThe wizarding world of Harry Potter, including all eight fantasy films and the upcoming HBO television series slated to premiere in 2027 would also be under the Ellisons’ purview.\n\nTikTok\n\nAs of a deal finalized in January, Oracle now holds a 15 percent stake in TikTok’s US operations.\n\nStar Trek\n\nAll 13 Star Trek movies and television shows are owned by Paramount Skydance. At a press event last year, Dana Goldberg, cochair of Paramount Pictures and chair of Paramount Television, said the franchise would be a “priority across the company.”\n\nWarner Bros. Studios\n\nHome to blockbusters like Barbie, The Dark Knight, and more recently, One Battle After Another and Sinners.\n\nComedy Central\n\nSouth Park announced a five-year, $1.5 billion deal with Paramount last July, just prior to the merger with Skydance. The show has since skewered Donald Trump and those in his administration regularly.\n\nAvatar Studios\n\nIn December, Paramount+ announced it would be the exclusive streamer of Avatar Studios content, including animated film The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender and series Avatar: Seven Havens.\n\nA Bunch of Cable Channels and Networks\n\nThe Food Network, HGTV, Discovery, TLC, OWN, Adult Swim, Showtime, TNT, and TBS are all part of WBD.\n\nOther Key Franchises\n\nOther notable titles that are or would be controlled by the Ellisons, pending the WBD takeover, include: The Lord of the Rings franchise, the Mission Impossible franchise, and the distribution rights to Dune: Part Three.\n\n2/27/26, 2:34 PM EDT: WIRED updated details about Paramount Skydance's deal with Warner Bros. Discovery."

            "content": "Sick of your smart ring's battery not holding up? Ultrahuman's new $479 Ring Pro smart ring, unveiled on Friday, offers up to 15 days of battery life on a single charge. The Ring Pro joins the company's $349 Ring Air, which boosts health tracking, thanks to longer battery life, increased data storage, improved speed and accuracy and a new heart-rate sensing architecture. The ring works in conjunction with the latest Pro charging case.\n\nUltrahuman also launched its Jade AI, which can act as an agent based on analysis of current and historical health data. Jade can synthesize data from across the company's products and is compatible with its Rings.\n\n\"With industry-leading hardware paired with Jade biointelligence AI, users can now take real-time actionable interventions towards their health than ever before,\" said Mohit Kumar, CEO of Ultrahuman.\n\nNo US sales\n\nThat hardware isn't available in the US, though, thanks to the ongoing ban on Ultrahuman's Rings sales here, stemming from a patent dispute with its competitor, Oura Ring. It's available for preorder now everywhere else and is slated to ship in March. Jade's available globally.\n\nUltrahuman says the Ring Pro boosts battery life to about 15 days in Chill mode -- up to 12 days in Turbo -- compared to a maximum of six days for the Air. The Pro charger's battery stores enough for another 45 days, which you top off with Qi-compatible wireless charging. In addition, the case incorporates locator technology via the app and a speaker, as well as usability features such as haptic notifications and a power LED.\n\nThe ring can also retain up to 250 days of data versus less than a week for the cheaper model. Ultrahuman redesigned the heart-rate sensor for better signal quality. An upgraded processor improves the accuracy of the local machine learning and overall speed.\n\nIt's offered in gold, silver, black and titanium finishes, with available sizes ranging from 5 to 14.\n\nJade's Deep Research Mode is the cross-ecosystem analysis feature, which aggregates data from Ring and Blood Vision and the company's subscription services, Home and M1 CGM, to provide historical trends, offer current recommendations and flag potential issues, as well as trigger activities such as A-fib detection. Ultrahuman plans to expand its capabilities to include health-adjacent activities, such as ordering food.\n\nSome new apps are also available for the company's PowerPlug add-on platform, including capabilities such as tracking GLP-1 effects, snoring and respiratory analysis and migraine management tools."

            "content": "Strength\n\nReading glasses typically range from +0.25 to +2.50 diopters (the unit of measurement for eye prescriptions), though the average starting strength is usually around +0.75. In rare cases, reading glass strength can go up to +4.00.\n\n“Tips for buying reading glasses online are similar to buying ready-made reading glasses at the drugstore: It’s a convenient option but it’s not a good idea for everyone,” says Dr. Ravi Goel, clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. “If you have different prescription needs in each eye, astigmatism, high-power or more complex prescription needs, you should see an eye care professional for updated prescription eyewear.”\n\nReed seconds this, adding, “The wrong prescription can lead to headaches, eye strain or even nausea. If you do choose to buy online, we recommend selecting a lower power when deciding between two strengths, as this is generally a safer choice, and overly strong lenses tend to cause more discomfort than those that are slightly weaker.”\n\nGoel notes that everyone older than 40 should see an ophthalmologist for a medical eye exam because that is the age when presbyopia and potentially blinding eye diseases usually begin developing. Plus, not all eye diseases begin with noticeable symptoms.\n\nType of reading glasses\n\n“There are four main types of reading glasses: single vision, bifocal, trifocal and progressive,” says Goel, defining them as:\n\nSingle-vision reading lenses are typically designed to correct just for near vision.\n\nare typically designed to correct just for near vision. Bifocal lenses have a correction for reading on the bottom half of the lens and another for distance on the top.\n\nhave a correction for reading on the bottom half of the lens and another for distance on the top. Trifocal lenses have three sections: distance, intermediate and near vision. Reed says these can be particularly helpful for people over 50 experiencing reduced depth of focus.\n\nhave three sections: distance, intermediate and near vision. Reed says these can be particularly helpful for people over 50 experiencing reduced depth of focus. Progressive lenses have a smooth transition between distance and near focal areas without visible dividing lines. “They deliver a more natural look and a smoother transition between different viewing distances,” adds Reed.\n\n“When generic OTC readers are no longer enough, prescription reading glasses -- also called single-vision readers -- are a great next step. These are custom-made by an eye doctor to correct for astigmatism, unequal prescriptions or other specific vision needs,” says Reed. “For those who need multiple levels of vision correction, there are multifocal lenses.”\n\nThe best lens material\n\n“This depends on lifestyle,” Goel says. “For example, if you spend a lot of time outdoors, you might prefer polycarbonate, which is lightweight and doesn’t break easily. There are also various lens coatings available for convenience (i.e., anti-reflective coatings) but are not required.”\n\nGoel notes that the American Academy of Ophthalmology doesn't recommend blue light-blocking coatings or lenses because “there is no scientific evidence to suggest blue light-blocking glasses help reduce eye strain.” Instead, take breaks from near-work activity and use eye drops if necessary. If you continue to experience symptoms, see an ophthalmologist.\n\nAccording to Reed, most people choose among the following three lens materials for reading glasses:\n\nCR-39 plastic lenses: Affordable, lightweight and provide good optical clarity, making them a popular choice for basic reading glasses.\n\nAffordable, lightweight and provide good optical clarity, making them a popular choice for basic reading glasses. Polycarbonate lenses : Lighter and significantly more impact-resistant than CR-39 plastic, making them a safer option for people who tend to drop their glasses or want something more durable.\n\n: Lighter and significantly more impact-resistant than CR-39 plastic, making them a safer option for people who tend to drop their glasses or want something more durable. High-index plastic lenses: Thinner and lighter than other materials and are a good choice for people who need a stronger prescription but want to avoid thick, heavy lenses.\n\n“For most reading glasses, especially for occasional or indoor use, CR-39 plastic works well,” says Reed. “If you need extra durability or prefer thinner, lighter lenses, polycarbonate or high-index materials may be a better fit. Your doctor of optometry can help recommend the best lens material based on your specific needs.”\n\nReed adds that not all lens materials and coatings are created equal. That’s why it’s important to check with your eye doctor to ensure the reading glasses you choose are the right fit for you.\n\nStyle\n\nOne of the most fun parts of buying glasses is finding a frame that speaks to your personal style and fits with your face shape. When shopping for glasses online, pay attention to the material, color and width.\n\nPrice\n\nReading glasses can range from affordable to expensive. For instance, if you want a designer pair of reading glasses, be prepared to spend over $100. If you tend to lose your reading glasses, you may want to buy more inexpensive pairs to keep multiple on hand.\n\n“Price of eyeglasses is not necessarily reflective of quality; the real question is if someone finds the ready-made reading glasses helpful or if they need custom reading glasses to meet their vision needs,” explains Goel.\n\n“In general, spending more on frames doesn’t mean you’ll end up with better-quality eyeglasses. You don’t need designer frames to have a good set of glasses. For prescription lenses, such as bifocal, trifocal or progressive lenses, an optician will help you select good lenses that best meet your vision needs. A personalized evaluation of vision needs is a value-add that is often missed by online sellers.”\n\nAdditional coatings\n\nYou can get reading glasses with lenses treated with blue light, anti-glare and polarization coatings. But note that you'll likely have to pay extra for these.\n\nShipping and returns\n\nIf you buy your reading glasses online, you likely won’t get to try them on before you buy. As a result, ensure the company has a return and exchange policy you can work with. As for shipping, if you need your reading glasses ASAP, you’re better off going with a company that offers express or overnight shipping."

            "content": "Two of the largest internet providers in the US are set to merge, as the FCC announced its approval of Charter’s $34.5 billion acquisition of Cox Communications Friday afternoon.\n\nCharter, which sells phone, internet and TV services under the Spectrum brand, agreed to buy Cox in May 2025. The deal will create the largest internet provider in the country, with Cox’s 6.5 million customers joining Charter’s 31 million.\n\nWhile internet monopolies are a major problem in the US -- over a third of Americans only have access to one or no internet provider -- this acquisition won’t necessarily make that problem worse. That’s because Charter and Cox have very little overlap in the areas where they operate.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\n“No consumer is going to lose a competitive offering they currently have,” Blair Levin, a former FCC chief of staff and a telecom industry analyst at New Street Research, told CNET. “There's no reduction of competition in any relevant geographical product market.”\n\nThe FCC’s announcement doesn’t specify when Cox customers will transfer to Spectrum, but it could be a welcome change for many. Cox received a score of 68/100 in the most recent American Customer Satisfaction Index survey, while Spectrum earned a 71/100.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nHowever, a CNET analysis of internet plans found Spectrum’s price hikes to be steeper, with Spectrum increasing prices by an average of $37 monthly after one or two years, depending on the location. Cox’s plans increased by $28 per month, but only after two years.\n\nSome critics argued that the FCC should have done more to help consumers before granting Charter approval.\n\n“The FCC approved the largest cable merger in nearly a decade and did not require Charter to do anything it wasn’t already planning to do,” John Bergmayer, legal director at the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said in a statement. “Consumers, as always, will bear the costs of reduced competition.”\n\nAs part of the approval process, Charter agreed to move all of Cox’s offshore jobs to America within 18 months. According to a post on its website, Charter says it has a 100% US-based workforce as of Dec. 31, 2025."

As revealed on Thursday by the company's chief digital officer in an interview with The Verge, the fast-food chain is adding Patty, an AI chatbot, to the headsets some of its employees wear as part of a 500-location pilot later this year.\n\nThe Patty chatbot will assist with work tasks but will also monitor manners, ensuring employees use phrases such as \"please\" and \"thank you\" in customer interactions.\n\n\"This is meant to be a coaching tool,\" Burger King's Thibault Roux told The Verge.\n\nPatty, not to be mistaken for the Krabby Patty burger from SpongeBob SquarePants, will also perform tasks such as alerting the inventory management system when an item is out of stock. Patty is part of a larger AI-driven system called BK Assistant that will be in all Burger King restaurants by the end of the year.\n\nWhile Burger King will be using AI in headsets, Roux said it's not quite ready to use the technology for taking orders yet, although other fast-food chains have tried. While AI seems to be taking over entire industries, businesses such as Taco Bell have found that rolling out AI to hungry customers is a lot harder than it sounds. A pilot for AI ordering from McDonald's ended in 2024, unsuccessfully.\n\n\"Not every guest is ready for this,\" Roux said.\n\nLabor's view on AI-enabled burger crafting\n\nNot everyone is a fan, either.\n\nThe new executive director of the AFL-CIO's Technology Institute, Lauren McFerran, said that what Burger King is planning is part of a larger trend in the workplace toward using AI for employee surveillance.\n\n\"Workers across the economy are being subjected to invasive and dehumanizing monitoring that underscores the need for strict and enforceable guardrails,\" McFerran said. \"AI should be used to make jobs better and safer, not as an invasive tool to harm working people.\""

Testing five smartwatches for accuracy looked to me more like a few leisurely jogs, rocking what looked like the entire smartwatch section of Best Buy stacked on my wrists. I've tested dozens of smartwatches over the years, but never five at once, and never under the level of scrutiny this test demanded. Mile after mile, I pushed my heart rate (and my body) well beyond my comfort zone with the finish line in focus.\n\nFitness trackers have come a long way since the early Fitbit days of step counting, and in today's wearable landscape, a reliable step counter isn't enough. Smartwatches, rings, fitness bands and even earbuds compete for real estate on your body to monitor everything from heart rate to temperature. To edge out the competition, they must be accurate enough to catch subtle changes in your vitals and turn that data into results.\n\nI tested five models (one at a time), ranging from $80 to $550, to determine which was most accurate for steps, distance and heart rate. Heart rate, in particular, is the most critical (and the hardest to get right) since so many other metrics depend on it.\n\nFrom left to right: Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, Google Pixel Watch 4, Amazfit Bip 6, Garmin Venu 4 and Apple Watch Series 11, alongside the Polar H10 chest strap and tally counter used in our accuracy tests. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nIt's not like I was starting from scratch. I'd already reviewed the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, Google Pixel Watch 4, Garmin Venu 4, Apple Watch Series 11 and Amazfit Bip 6, and each had proven itself in its category. There's a reason they landed on our best lists. But glancing at a workout summary and dissecting raw data are entirely different beasts.\n\nAfter two months and more than 30 miles of testing, I'm finally ready to share the results (and give my legs a rest). The biggest takeaway: All five watches performed well in real-world testing. None deviated by more than a few percentage points from the control when measuring steps and distance.\n\nHeart rate accuracy proved to be the biggest differentiator. On the surface, the watches looked similar: average and maximum heart rates were often only a few beats apart. But the gaps became clear in the second-by-second data. While most stayed within 8% of our control, the Apple Watch Series 11 remained within 1% of the Polar H10 chest strap, which served as our control, earning it the CNET Labs Award for most accurate heart rate tracking.\n\nThe Garmin Venu 4 came in second, recording heart rate every second compared to every 5 seconds on the Apple Watch. For most people, that level of granularity is overkill, but for serious athletes who depend on second-by-second feedback, it could be the deciding factor.\n\nHeart rate: electrodes vs. optical sensors\n\nHeart rate is one of the most important vitals your smartwatch tracks because it feeds into so many other metrics, like calories burned, intensity, heart rate variability (a measure of the variation in time between heartbeats), and VO2 max (the maximum amount of oxygen your body uses during exercise). As a casual fitness enthusiast, I regularly use live heart rate data from my watch to make runs and strength training workouts more intense.\n\nMost smartwatches, including the five we tested, take background heart rate readings at intervals throughout the day. However, they increase sampling frequency during exercise. Even a short workout can generate hundreds more data points than passive tracking alone.\n\nWe used the Polar H10 chest strap as our control during the heart rate tests. Giselle Castro-Sloboda/CNET\n\nCNET's heart rate test\n\nTo capture a broad range of heart rate data, I tested each watch individually across three separate 1-mile runs on a flat track. I held a moderate intensity for the first half of the run (roughly Zones 3 to 4), then went all out for the second half, pushing myself as close to my peak (Zone 5) as possible.\n\nI cleaned the sensors and secured each watch snugly (about one to two fingers below the wrist bone) before each run. Each watch was tested one at a time alongside a Polar H10 chest strap, CNET's top-rated consumer heart rate monitor. Unlike wrist-based optical sensors, which detect changes in blood flow using light, chest straps like Polar's use electrodes to directly measure the heart's electrical signals. Because of this method and proximity to the heart, chest straps are widely considered more precise than wrist-based devices. Matching that level of precision isn't realistic for a watch, but they're coming close.\n\nDuring testing, I noticed a consistent pattern: most watches lagged behind the chest strap during the first minute of a run, when heart rate rose rapidly from rest. Once I reached cruising altitude (Zones 3 and 4), the readings aligned more closely. But when I pushed into Zone 5, differences reappeared, with some watches struggling to keep up during spikes above 160 beats per minute. The Bip 6, for example, never registered my peak heart rate. That lag helps explain why workout summaries often look similar. Average and peak heart rate were just a few beats away from the chest strap, while the second-by-second analysis revealed significantly wider gaps.\n\nBecause raw, second-by-second heart rate data isn't easily accessible in most apps and can include thousands of data points, I teamed up with CNET Senior Lab Engineer Gianmarco Chumbe to interpret and map the results. The graph above shows just how close the Apple Watch Series 11 was to the Polar chest strap, with an error rate of less than 1% (an average of 1.4 bpm for the three tests). In our results, it tracked almost side-by-side throughout the run, even at the outer edges of the graph where the other watches struggled. This consistency earned it our Labs Award for most accurate heart rate tracking. There is, however, an important nuance.\n\nThe Apple Watch data we extracted (via the HealthFit app pulling from Apple Health) sampled heart rate roughly every five seconds. By comparison, the Polar chest strap and Garmin Venu 4 recorded data nearly every second. Of the data points we could compare, the Apple Watch was closest to the chest strap, but it had fewer data points. The Venu 4 matched the chest strap's sampling frequency, but with a slightly higher error rate of 3.89% (5.5 bpm). Those extra seconds of data could help guide training decisions and, over time, mean the difference between finishing strong and setting a new personal record.\n\nAll of the watches posted heart rate error rates below 8%, which is impressive -- especially at higher-intensity levels. It's worth noting these were short workouts (8-9 minutes per run). Because the Google Pixel Watch (5.6% error rate) and Samsung Galaxy Watch (6.6%) tended to catch up to the chest strap over time, longer runs would likely narrow some of those gaps. The Amazfit posted a similar overall error rate (7%), but struggled to capture the highest heart rate spikes. That limitation makes it less ideal for prioritizing heart rate precision for intense workouts.\n\nAfter over 30 miles of testing, I'm more convinced than ever that heart rate accuracy really does impact training. Over six weeks, my VO2 max climbed from 41.3 to 45.8, according to Apple Health. I haven't reached that level since before my third pregnancy three years ago. Without the watches and chest strap as a guide, I might not have recognized what \"pushing myself\" actually felt like in the moment.\n\nCNET distance test\n\nMeasuring distance proved significantly easier, both physically and technically. Distance accuracy matters because it also feeds into other metrics, such as pace, calories burned and training load (the duration and intensity of exercise over a specific period of time).\n\nThe most reliable way to test distance was on a route with precise measurements and minimal elevation change. (Credit goes to Gianmarco for suggesting a track test.) Most high school and college tracks are built to official specifications: 400 meters per lap. I found an old college track near my house that had been paved over, but remained within regulation length. I even broke out a measuring wheel to be sure. I ran every single test on this track, reliving high school mile day 30 times over, but with more knee pain.\n\nThis is the track as shown in the Polar H10 chest strap app (summary view, not raw data). Vanessa Hand Orellana/Polar/CNET\n\nWhile GPS is a major factor in outdoor tracking, distance is also calculated using accelerometer and motion sensor data. To control for variables, I put the watch's paired phone on airplane mode before each run to prevent it from using GPS. I photographed each watch display after every lap (400m increments) to capture a data point, repeating the process four times (1,600m is a little more than 1 mile).\n\nAll five watches were within a tenth of the actual distance, which is an impressively tight spread. The Apple Watch again led the pack, measuring my runs at 0.99 miles for all three tests. The runner-up was the Garmin Venu 4, which averaged 0.96 miles per test (only 0.03 miles behind the Apple Watch).\n\nAccurate distance tracking isn't reserved for premium price tags. The $80 Amazfit Bip 6 averaged 0.95 miles per test, proving it is more than capable for casual walkers or joggers looking to log miles.\n\nCNET's step test\n\nOnce considered the holy grail of fitness tracking, step count has slid down the metric hierarchy as more advanced health markers have taken center stage. And while the 10,000-step goal is somewhat arbitrary, it set a target and got people moving.\n\nToday, we know it's less important to hit a specific step count and more about walking and your progress over time. Steps remain an accessible starting point for many people, and accuracy is important. \"Extra credit\" from a faulty tracker can lull people into a false sense of accomplishment. And if a device can't nail the basics, it raises questions about the rest of its metrics.\n\nWhile pedometers were once considered the gold standard in this category, a $10 model today is likely less precise than the smartwatches on this list. Traditional pedometers use a simple mechanical switch triggered by hip movement, while most modern smartwatches use accelerometers and motion sensors to detect and measure movement in multiple directions.\n\nThis (photos) is how I'd keep tabs of the steps out in the field: smartwatch on the left and clicker (tally counter) in my right hand. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nTo test accuracy, I went old-school and counted every single step myself with a manual tally counter (like what you use for baseball). I also used StepsApp, a pedometer app on my phone, as a backup. I started with 1,000 steps for each watch on a flat path. I didn't use the track, but didn't follow the exact same route for every test, which may introduce minor variance.\n\nThe results were impressively tight; all within about 10 steps of the clicker. The Galaxy Watch 8's results (18 steps off) were the exception, but I suspected it might be a fluke. So I re-tested and raised the stakes; this time, walking 2,500 steps with each watch. The results were nearly identical. None deviated by more than 11 steps, or less than half of a percentage point.\n\nThe differences were negligible, so all of the watches were winners in this category, proving that you don't have to splurge for accuracy. That Amazfit Bip 6 is looking pretty fantastic right now.\n\nTwists, turns and variables to consider when tracking workouts\n\nEven with the best intentions, 30 miles of testing and a data scientist in my corner, there is no way to eliminate every variable in real-world conditions. These results aren't gospel. They're rigorous, repeated and carefully averaged, but they're still human, and your mileage may vary (pun intended).\n\nIt took more than 30 miles of testing before I felt comfortable putting results down on paper because I kept encountering variables, especially for heart rate.\n\nThe testing order was significant. The first watch in any session was always at a disadvantage because my heart rate started lower and spiked more dramatically. By the second and third runs -- even with deliberate rest periods to bring my heart rate back down -- the jump wasn't as sharp. Your body doesn't fully reset that quickly.\n\nTo mitigate this, I rotated the starting watch for each session. I limited each outing to three runs (three miles total), making sure that every device had a chance to be tested first, middle and last. Our Labs data and results (on the charts in the story) are averages of the error rates across these three tests.\n\nFit and sensor interference were other issues. My jacket sleeve occasionally moved the watch; warmer days meant more sweat by mile three, which can interfere with optical readings, and then there was the time I almost cut off my circulation from wearing the Galaxy Watch too tightly.\n\nThe data extraction nightmare\n\nThis is just a snapshot of the layers of folders and raw data we had to comb through to compare heart rate. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nThen came the data. Polar's raw heart rate data can be downloaded as a .CSV file (spreadsheet) ready for analysis.\n\nGarmin's is almost as easy, as long as you have a data analyst and Reddit thread on hand. It can export workout-specific heart rate data as a .TCX file, which was foreign to me. Gianmarco wrote custom code, based on info he found on Reddit, to extract and convert the data into a format that matched Polar's output. Amazfit required a similar conversion process.\n\nApple, Google and Samsung made us work for it. All three require exporting your entire health archive (and I mean everything, not just workouts or heart rate). For me, this meant downloading more than a decade of health data. Once extracted, the compressed file opens into a maze of nested folders with cryptic labels. The best strategy is to sort by date and hope that one of the files mentions heart rate.\n\nFor Google, I got lucky and found the right file after what felt like hours of searching. For Apple, several third-party apps are available that can do the sorting for you. I downloaded the $6 HealthFit app, which filters and extracts data directly from the Health app. However, the sampling frequency wasn't as dense as the Polar strap, leaving fewer data points for comparison. It's hard to say whether it would've been any different if I'd been able to extract it directly from the Health app.\n\nWith Samsung, the only workable option was to use the Strava app as a middleman. I started workouts in the Strava watch app and exporting the data to the desktop version. All of this took two people many hours across multiple days to figure out. Accessing your own health data shouldn't be this hard.\n\nThe paved college track at sunset where I completed all distance and heart rate testing. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nSmartwatch accuracy bottom line\n\nIf heart rate accuracy is your top priority, the $400 Apple Watch Series 11 is what to buy. It was the all-around winner, consistently strong across every category and the most precise for heart rate, staying within 1% of the chest strap during runs.\n\nBut the bigger takeaway after 30 miles of testing is that you can't go wrong with any of these watches; it just depends on what you value most.\n\nThe $550 Garmin Venu 4 may be better suited for data nerds and serious athletes. It's Gianmarco's pick: \"The combination of high fidelity and clean export access makes it especially appealing for users like me, who want full visibility into their training data.\"\n\nIt's also the best option for Android phone owners wanting elite-level heart rate tracking.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 8 (both $350) are reliable for steps, distance and overall heart rate trends. You may not get the same second-by-second precision during intervals, but for everyday workouts, they're more than capable. And the Amazfit Bip 6 is the reminder that accurate distance tracking doesn't have to be expensive. For beginners looking to build a baseline without a major investment, it's better than its $80 price suggests."
