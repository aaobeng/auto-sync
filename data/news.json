In fact, in recent years the EFL has demanded even greater ‘redistribution’ — cash to you and me — from the Premier League.\n\nTo justify their stance, the EFL says it creates only a fraction of the wealth of the Premier League and therefore urgently needs a financial leg-up.\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nBut when it comes to doling out their own funds to the National League, the same principle somehow does not apply.\n\n\n\nEven though the EFL just got nearly £1BILLION of TV revenue from selling their broadcast rights, they still won’t pass a single penny down to the league below them.\n\nWhy? Beats me.\n\nA relatively modest amount handed over to the National League would underline the EFL’s solidarity with their lower neighbours, as well as show a degree of consistency which is currently missing.\n\nAnother EFL justification is they claim to be financially fragile, and as such, every penny clubs receive is fully merited.\n\nThe Premier League could actually make the same argument, as there is close to £4BILLION worth of debt in Prem clubs.\n\n\n\nBut we don’t make that argument, we just continue to push funds downwards, including the fact that the Prem is the sole funder of all football, including being the ONLY funder of the National League and Women’s Super League.\n\nThe National League is almost completely professional and therefore subject to exactly the same financial pressures. They are just as much a part of their communities, yet they do not enjoy the same safety net as EFL clubs.\n\nI would agree that relegation is a financial catastrophe for League Two teams but surely you could say the same about relegation for any club, from any league.\n\nSee the Spanish Grand Prix for just £569 WE’VE got an amazing price on a trip to the Spanish GP in June – but you’ll have to be quick.

Don’t miss Spanish GP trip for just £569\n\nThere is nothing extra special about going from the EFL to the National League.\n\nThe football pyramid is supposed to function as a connected system with the biggest boys handing over to the big boys, who then hand over to the smaller boys, who then pass it on to the smallest.\n\n\n\nYet this sense of pyramid responsibility only goes so far, as National League clubs are left out of the equation by the EFL.\n\nFootball must be a meritocracy and it strikes me that the EFL is very keen to protect their own, less enthused about helping others.\n\nAs for the National League’s demand for three promotion and relegation places, the EFL will discuss this in March and I hope they see common sense.\n\nWhat’s good for the goose is also good for the gander.\n\nFor fans of Rochdale and York, who are both well clear of the pack, this will be a nervous time as the financial rewards of a leap into the EFL are immense.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nBut whoever misses out on automatic promotion — and it is likely to be one of them — can blame a flawed system.\n\nThe EFL should do the decent thing. Firstly, fall in line with their own promotion and relegation rules and secondly, as the saying goes, ‘show them the money’."

Alvarez, 26, has emerged as a target for the Gunners, who've explored the conditions of a potential deal.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe ex-Manchester City star only joined Atletico 18 months ago but could be Arsenal's marquee signing this summer. Alvarez won't come cheap, though, as the La Liga side paid City £81.5million for his services and would want to make a decent chunk of profit.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt's been speculated that Barcelona want the Argentine to succeed Robert Lewandowski, whose contract expires in June. Barca witnessed the Argentine's quality when he scored in their 4-0 defeat to Atletico in the Copa del Rey earlier this month.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNow, it's been claimed by a member of Barcelona's hierarchy that the club are indeed looking for a new striker. Ferran Olive - Barca's treasurer under president Joan Laporta, who's up for re-election this month - was asked if they were in a position to sign a top striker.\n\nFOLLOW OUR ARSENAL FB PAGE!

Gianluca Prestianni is under investigation for alleged racial abuse towards Real Madrid's Vinicius Junior in a Champions League match last week.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhat he said to Vinicius is disputed, with Prestianni vehemently denying using racist language. The Argentinian's mouth was covered when he appeared to say something to Vinicius.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFIFA is understood to be keen to explore ways to tackle the issue, and is understood to have raised the idea of introducing a deterrent to such behaviour at a technical meeting on Friday ahead of the International Football Association Board (IFAB) annual general meeting in Wales on Saturday.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOne insider referred to it as 'Vinicius' Law' and the British associations - who make up the IFAB alongside FIFA - were understood to be receptive to the idea, although as it is so early in discussions the practicalities of enforcing it would need careful consideration.\n\nFOLLOW OUR REAL MADRID FB PAGE!

FIFA is also believed to have raised increasing the penalty for players walking off the pitch from a yellow to a red card in the wake of the chaos at the end of the Africa Cup of Nations final between Senegal and Morocco.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFIFA has been approached for comment. Vinicius was allegedly abused during Real Madrid's win over Benfica in Lisbon on February 17.\n\nThe 25-year-old left the field after reporting a member of the Benfica team - whom the Spanish side later claimed to have been Prestianni - to referee Francois Letexier. The match was paused in line with UEFA regulations, resulting in a stoppage in play lasting 10 minutes, with Vinicius going on to play the full game in Real’s 1-0 win.\n\nBACK THE MIRROR!

After celebrating in front of the home fans, the 25-year-old became visibly upset about something said to him and immediately informed Letexier.\n\nAfter the game, Vinicius posted in Portuguese on his Instagram story: “Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts in their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe started for Real in Wednesday's return and had the final word as the Spanish giants reached the last 16, with a cool 80th-minute finish securing a 2-1 win on the night and 3-1 aggregate success.\n\nUEFA had imposed a provisional sanction on Prestianni on Monday, ruling him out of the tie, although the winger had travelled to Madrid as part of the Benfica squad. The Portuguese club had appealed against the decision to ban Prestianni, but UEFA dismissed the case on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

What's he cost €20m (£18.2m)? I think that tells you everything about him at this point.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It tells me he's [Lammens] not a top goalkeeper. As soon as that man [Donnarumma] became available, drive to Paris, go and get him, give him whatever he wants.\"\n\nHowever, Lammens has well and truly made Scholes eat his words. The Belgian custodian has emerged as one of the most impressive goalkeepers in the Premier League this season.\n\nLammens has let in just 26 goals across 21 top-flight fixtures in 2025/26 and delivered arguably his finest display yet during the 1-0 triumph at Everton on Monday. He pulled off four saves, four punches, two high claims and remained authoritative throughout as he earned the Premier League Player of the Match for his contribution.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Senne Lammens won the Player of the Match during Manchester United's win at Everton\n\nSpeaking after the Everton clash, Lammens drew comparisons to former United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, who was covering the match for Sky Sports. \"[I] just try to stay calm, play my own game,\" Lammens said.\n\n\"I know I have the qualities, I wouldn't be here otherwise. So, [I] just believe in myself, the players around me and my teammates support me really much.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Now I just keep on building, keep getting that confidence. Like today, getting those wins, feeling important, is really important. And yeah, like you said, if I'm in a comparison with Edwin van der Sar, it's always nice to hear.\"\n\nThroughout Lammens' 21 Premier League outings, United have suffered defeat on only two occasions. One came in the 1-0 reverse against Everton in November, whilst the other was a 2-1 setback at Aston Villa.\n\nAdditionally, Lammens' stops have prevented 5.5 more goals than the average goalkeeper based on the quality of accurate shots he has denied, according to OPTA's expected goals on target (xGOT) conceded model. No Premier League keeper can rival that record since the Belgian's United debut on October 4.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHis impact has been astronomical, with some claiming that Lammens is - and could be - United's best and most influential signing in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Lammens has made the No.1 spot his own and it's clear that he is far above Onana, who is on loan at Trabzonspor, and Bayindir in the pecking order.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Sterling, 31, looked rusty after coming on as a second-half substitute in Feyenoord's 2-1 win against Telstar last Sunday.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt was understandable given that the former Manchester City star's previous competitive appearance was in May 2025, his final game on loan at Arsenal. Sterling had been exiled at Chelsea, who finally agreed to terminate his contract after six months training away from the first-team squad.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHis performance was panned by Dutch media and Van Persie has described some criticism as 'inappropriate'. \"If you have a little sense of context, where he comes from, what he's achieved in the past, and that he hasn't had any team training for months,\" the Feyenoord manager began.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I understand that there are expectations of an absolute top player, but to criticise him like that after half an hour - his first half hour after over six months - then you really don't understand anything at all.\"\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

Last year, Molde finished 10th in the 16-team Eliteserien.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe winger, who celebrates his 20th birthday in June, joined Liverpool in the summer of 2022 from Derry City and progressed through the Academy ranks, playing for the Under-18s and Under-21s whilst also regularly featuring in the UEFA Youth League, FA Youth Cup and EFL Trophy.\n\nView 2 Images Trent Doherty-Kone in action for Liverpool (Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe Republic of Ireland Under-21s international was on the bench for the Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven in January 2025 before making his senior Reds debut as a substitute in the FA Cup fourth round loss at Plymouth Argyle the following month.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nKone-Doherty also made a late appearance in the 3-0 League Cup defeat to Crystal Palace at Anfield in October.\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE!

The former England boss has ruled himself out of contention, as he has 'no passion' to work in the Premier League at this time.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSouthgate hasn't coached a team since quitting as England manager in July 2024, shortly after the losing the European Championship final. The 55-year-old has focussed on business ventures and he's set to host a TV show.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn a new interview, Southgate reiterated that he isn't planning on a return to the dugout any time soon. \"I've got no passion to just go and manage in the Premier League,\" he told The Football Boardroom podcast.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I did that at 35, I finished 11th, 12th. Who is in those positions now, probably Bournemouth, Brighton? I've had one of the biggest jobs in world football so I've been spoiled. Huge nights, working with outstanding players.

Michael Carrick has been given the job until the end of this season and United have hired Steve Holland, Southgate's right-hand man for England, as one of Carrick's assistants.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, he and Holland won't be reuniting at Old Trafford. Southgate also acknowledged the backlash he'd receive if a club such as United appointed him, having been perceived by some as a failure with England.\n\n\"The bit that, externally, people are saying is, 'well, he didn't win'. So how do you prove that you can win? You've got to go to one of those big clubs,\" he explained.\n\n\"Now we know those big clubs… do I think I could have done the job that some people who have been in those clubs recently have done?

And there's a reality around (that), I can understand what that noise is. There's that bit which makes me potentially a complicated appointment for a club.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSouthgate went on to confirm: \"I don't want to go and manage a different national team. Club? It's honestly not what I'm looking to do.\n\n\"Now, two years after leaving England, I'm not actively looking for a role in coaching. If that European final was the bit (in coaching) I wouldn't worry about that.\n\n\"Because there is another 15-20 years of my life ahead of me and I’m excited about a different video, a different movie, a different part of my life.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

            "content": "Tim Henman feels Emma Raducanu is better off without a coach despite the British No 1 reuniting with Mark Petchey on an informal basis ahead of Indian Wells - live on Sky Sports Tennis.\n\nRaducanu parted company with Francisco Roig in the wake of her second-round defeat at the Australian Open.\n\nShe enjoyed a strong run of form while working with Andy Murray's former coach Petchey early in 2025 in a temporary arrangement, but hired Roig in August as she sought a new permanent fixture.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights of the Transylvania Open final as Raducanu struggled in defeat against Sorana Cirstea\n\nFollowing a six-month spell in which she has endured disappointing results, Roig, who formerly coached Rafael Nadal, became the ninth coach to depart since Raducanu's 2021 US Open win, with the pair gelling well on a personal level but not aligning on style of play.\n\nHer next tournament in Romania saw her reach her first final since her victory in New York in 2021, and since the split from Roig, Raducanu insisted she is happy working only with hitting partner Alexis Canter, a 27-year-old British former player who reached a career-high ranking of 779 last year.\n\nThe 23-year-old, coming off a first-round defeat to Antonia Ruzic at the Dubai Tennis Championships, is set to retain Canter as part of her setup as well as working with Petchey in the lead-up to Indian Wells next week.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Marion Bartoli believes Raducanu will learn more from playing the top players after she exited the US Open\n\nSky Sports analyst Henman thinks British No 1 Raducanu doesn't need a coach and should concentrate on working on her physicality to match the likes of fellow Grand Slam champions Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Elena Rybakina and Coco Gauff.\n\n\"I just wonder whether she's better off without a coach and that's nothing against Petch,\" said the four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist. \"He's someone I've known for a long time and he's a very, very good coach but we know it's not going to be a full-time appointment because Petch has his broadcast commitments.\n\n\"Emma has talked about her identity, her game style and she wants to own it. She's been around long enough on the tour so I wonder whether that might be a good option for her but it's her prerogative.\n\n\"I worked with three coaches in 15 years. I like the consistency and continuity and we know that coaches don't last long working with Emma.\n\n\"An aggressive game style is how you have to play. You have got to be aggressive because if you don't your opponent will be and for me. I want to see her build her physicality: to get stronger, more resilient, to hit the ball harder.\n\n\"And I think if she does that, that'll mean that she has less interruptions and less little setbacks physically. She'll be able to compete at a high level for longer periods, so if I could add one element it would be the physical side.\n\n\"Raducanu does work on her physical side. I think her tennis game is outstanding but when you think of the physicality of Sabalenka, Swiatek, Rybakina, Gauff, she's not in the same league.\n\n\"The physicality is the biggest challenge.\"\n\nPetchey helped inspire the most productive period of Raducanu's season as she reached the quarter-finals at Queen's before running Sabalenka close in the third round of Wimbledon.\n\nEmma Raducanu's NINE coaches\n\nNigel Sears\n\n\n\nBest known for coaching former top five players Amanda Coetzer, Daniela Hantuchova, Anett Kontaveit and Ana Ivanovic, Sears joined her team in April 2021 and oversaw her incredible breakthrough run to the Wimbledon fourth round.\n\n\n\nAndrew Richardson\n\n\n\nGuided Raducanu to her historic Grand Slam title at the US Open as a qualifier. Raducanu opted not to extend his trial contract immediately after the victory.\n\n\n\nTorben Beltz\n\n\n\nAngelique Kerber's former coach lasted only five months. They split in April 2022 with Raducanu transitioning towards a new training model involving LTA coaching support.\n\n\n\nDmitry Tursunov\n\n\n\nRaducanu took on the former pro on a trial basis during the summer of 2022 but Tursunov decided not to continue, later citing red flags in her camp that he felt could not be ignored for a long-term commitment.\n\n\n\nSebastian Sachs\n\n\n\nThe German joined in late 2022 but the partnership was cut short when Raducanu required multiple surgeries, leading to a mutual split.\n\n\n\nNick Cavaday\n\n\n\nThe 14-month stint was her longest professional partnership, helping her return to the top 60 before he stepped down in early 2025 due to personal health issues.\n\n\n\nVlado Platenik\n\n\n\nHired on a trial basis in March 2025, the partnership lasted only 14 days.\n\n\n\nMark Petchey\n\n\n\nAndy Murray's former coach provided crucial tactical knowledge through Wimbledon where she went out to world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, despite an encouraging display.\n\n\n\nFrancisco Roig\n\n\n\nAppointed in August 2025, Rafael Nadal's former mentor offered elite tactical clarity, but after her Australian Open exit in January 2026, Raducanu announced their split.\n\n\n\nRobson: Raducanu has 'same ideas' as Petchey\n\nImage: Petchey coached Raducanu during the grass-court season\n\nFormer Junior Wimbledon champion Laura Robson sees Raducanu's happiness on court as the biggest advantage and argues working with Petchey can only bring out the best in her.\n\nShe said: \"I think we make such a big deal out of the coaching situation and as long as she is feeling happy on the court, as long as she's confident out there then that's half the job done, and that's what coaches try and bring out in you when you do have one.\n\n\"She obviously gets on really well with Petch. They've been on and off for a fair few years now and it's someone she knows. They have the same ideas. They agree on so much that she needs to bring out there, so why not?\n\n\"As long as you've got someone who's taking care of the boring stuff like the logistics of booking practice, finding someone to practice with, racket re-strings - all of that. As long as that's taken care of, then you can just focus on trying to play.\n\n\"They have the same identity of how both of them feel she should be as a player.\"\n\nRaducanu is hoping to hoping to revert to a more aggressive style in order to compete with the top players and Robson says she has shown in the past she is capable of playing against the elite on the WTA Tour.\n\n\"For sure. We've seen how close her matches against Sabalenka have been,\" said former British No 1 Robson.\n\n\"It feels like everyone is adding different elements to their game all the time, so at the moment it feels like she wants to add that aggression back into her game and once you've got that you can start thinking about adding more variety again so you've got more strings to your bow.\n\n\"But you want to have a clear identity as a player before you go out onto any match court - so long as that's defined in your mind then that's half the job done.\"\n\nOverend on Raducanu finding the right balance\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Jonathan Overend believes that if Raducanu can find the right balance with the correct coach, she will be set up for a great year of tennis\n\nSpeaking earlier this month, Sky Sports commentator Jonathan Overend said Raducanu will only be able to find the right balance in her setup once she answers a key question.\n\n\"I think she has spent a lot of her young career re-evaluating,\" he said. \"In one regard, it explains why she has been through so many coaches and why she has been criticised for it.\n\n\"It's typical of Raducanu that she wants to keep re-evaluating and finding out what is best for her on and around a tennis court.\n\n\"That challenge continues, and to some extent it is a struggle, because finding the right balance is so hard, but I think she is slowly getting [it], not in terms of her Grand Slam results but in terms of that re-evaluation process.\n\n\"What is it she really wants for herself on a tennis court and in tournaments?\"\n\nWatch the ATP and WTA Tours, live on Sky Sports or stream with NOW and the Sky Sports app, giving Sky Sports customers access to over 50 per cent more live sport this year at no extra cost.

That is expected to change if the franchise invest a high NFL Draft pick in a quarterback.\n\nWhile Brady was not present in Indianapolis, 22-year-old Mendoza said they had spoken on the phone briefly, and was asked what he would think of working with the NFL legend.\n\nImage: Tom Brady is a minority owner for the Las Vegas Raiders and would be expected to help develop a young quarterback\n\nHe said: \"Yeah, I mean, who hasn't admired Tom Brady? I mean, more Super Bowl rings than anybody ... anybody!\n\n\"So, that opportunity would be fantastic.\n\n\"Brady, I believe, is the greatest quarterback of all time - by a wide margin - and to be able to have the opportunity to be mentored by him would mean so much.\n\n\"Especially to learn, and I'm all about learning. So from day one, I've got to learn a lot.\n\n\"It's going to be a long journey, and to potentially have a mentor like that, it would be pretty impressive and pretty meaningful.\"\n\nImage: Mendoza was a winner in college but will likely begin his NFL career on one of the worst teams in the league\n\nMendoza revealed that he had a \"great\" meeting with the Raiders, who appointed Super Bowl-winning Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak as their head coach earlier this month as they look to rebuild after a fourth straight losing season.\n\nAlthough he admitted there's no guarantee he will end up in Las Vegas after April's event in Pittsburgh, Mendoza was enthused about his meeting with the team.\n\n\"It was a fantastic interview,\" he said.\n\n\"The coaching staff were in there. We went over some of my previous plays and drew some plays on the board.\n\n\"I thought it was a great meeting, and I know they have the prospective No 1 pick, but anything can happen in the draft. I'm just excited for the opportunity.\n\n\"Whatever team drafts me, I'm just going to give everything I have to them.\""

            "content": "Arsenal’s journey under Mikel Arteta has long been a reference point for Chelsea’s owners. It is part of the club’s shift towards youth and potential after the Roman Abramovich era. Chelsea have built with a long-term view and, seeing how Arteta has reversed Arsenal’s decline since his appointment as manager in December 2019, have been keen to find a young coach capable of becoming a similarly galvanising force at Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt is not an easy task. Chelsea briefly thought they had their rising star when they hired Graham Potter in September 2022, only for his reign to end after seven months. Now there is hope that Liam Rosenior can become Chelsea’s answer to Arteta. Rosenior is young, confident, talented and a little unconventional in the way he presents himself. It is early days but the 41-year-old has made an encouraging start, winning eight of his first 12 games, and has transmitted enough authority to keep jibes about his inexperience at bay so far.\n\nDoes he have it in him to match Arteta though? More pertinently, will he be given the time to succeed? Just over six years on from turning to Arteta after firing Unai Emery, Arsenal stand five points clear at the top of the Premier League before hosting Chelsea on Sunday. They have benefited from a stable environment. Rosenior, by contrast, is the fifth permanent head coach under the ownership of Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly. Chelsea have had nine managers, including interims, during the Arteta era. It is impossible to ignore the upheaval when it comes to working out why Chelsea have not mustered a title challenge since winning the league in 2017.\n\nThey remain a strong cup team, capable of raising their level in one-off games, but the consistency required to keep up with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City in the league has been lacking. Rosenior has already felt it. Chelsea have been at their careless worst in their past two league games, home draws with Burnley and Leeds the consequence of a repeated inability to stay focused and defend a lead in mature fashion.\n\nDropping 19 points from winning positions this season says a lot about the squad’s mentality. Rosenior has to tackle the listlessness. Behind closed doors he should make clear that he did not like Malo Gusto wasting a promising attack with a pointless no-look pass against Burnley. Chelsea cannot afford to be cocky. They have to be honest about where they are short. They have to acknowledge that they have a discipline problem. They have had eight red cards this season and were pegged back by Burnley – whose stoppage-time equaliser arrived when one of Rosenior’s players dozed off at a corner – after losing Wesley Fofana to a needless second yellow card.\n\nView image in fullscreen Liam Rosenior is young and confident, and has transmitted enough authority to keep jibes about his inexperience at bay so far. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThe frustration is that there are times when Chelsea look like a serious team. They have beaten the champions of England, Italy, Spain and France in the past 12 months. They face Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League and it would not be a surprise if they went through. Chelsea are different in the big games. They have a daunting run-in but are not fearful of top opposition. The problem is more that they switch off when expected to win.\n\nRosenior has to lift standards. He has the youngest squad in the Premier League and needs time to instil good habits. Whether Rosenior lasts, though, will partly come down to whether Chelsea are capable of leaving the chaos behind. Can they hold their nerve when results dip? It is one thing to find your Arteta but another to stand by him when the pressure rises and fans are baying for blood.\n\nIt is worth remembering that it has not always been plain sailing for Arteta. The Spaniard was 37 when he replaced Emery and earned his first managerial role. He arrived with Arsenal struggling to move on from how the Arsène Wenger era fizzled out. There was a lot of damage to repair. The squad were a mess and although Arteta ended his first season on a high, winning the FA Cup thanks to surprise victories over City and Chelsea, it was not long before he was in danger of losing his job.\n\nArsenal were 15th and winless in seven league games before beating Frank Lampard’s Chelsea on Boxing Day in 2020. Arteta was in trouble. He needed Arsenal’s trust. Even then it was not until the second half of the 2021-22 season that Arteta’s vision truly became clear. Arsenal have had to fight their way to the top. They have also stuck with Arteta through three consecutive second-placed finishes. They have had to be resolute in their belief that he is the man to win their first title since 2004.\n\nArteta has driven the process. He is the manager, not the head coach, the individual knitting everything together. Arsenal have a sporting director but Arteta is the face of the club. There is no doubt about his power. Arsenal have thrown everything into winning now. They have targeted experienced, established players in an attempt to get over the line. They have filled holes that needed filling. Signing Martín Zubimendi, Noni Madueke, Viktor Gyökeres and Eberechi Eze last summer gave them depth and quality in every position, while exposing a key point of difference with Chelsea’s model of centring recruitment around young talents who will need time to adapt to English football.\n\nIt remains an issue for Chelsea that, for every hit, there is a signing struggling to meet expectations. João Pedro has shone since signing from Brighton last summer but Liam Delap has been disappointing and Alejandro Garnacho is still the winger who blew hot and cold at Manchester United. There has been too much volatility. Erratic performances are not a surprise. Chelsea are still to prove that their project will work. Their bet is that hoovering up some of the best young talent in the world will give them a team to fear. They are convinced that their collaborative structure, with a head coaching working in tandem with five sporting directors, breeds stability.\n\nYet it will take more than handing Rosenior a six-and-a-half-year deal to show that Chelsea understand why Arteta has flourished at Arsenal. There will come a time when the heat rises. Chelsea’s faith in Rosenior will be tested. How will they react?"

            "content": "At the end of the season, how costly might this untimely slip prove for Aston Villa? Judging by the way Unai Emery fumed on the touchline, this defeat by their near neighbours Wolves will hurt for a while yet and, significantly, it could have major implications on their hopes of returning to the Champions League.\n\nWolves understandably savoured every moment of only their second Premier League win of the season, every outfield player joining the celebrations as João Gomes fired in his first goal in a year just after the hour, and then again joyously when Rodrigo Gomes made it 2-0 in the 98th minute. The win meant Wolves at least can say they have beaten Derby’s record Premier League low points tally of 11 from 2007-08.\n\nBut Emery’s wait to taste victory at Molineux goes on, the Spaniard winless in all five visits here as a manager. For him and for Villa, Wednesday’s date with Chelsea at Villa Park just got a little bit meatier.\n\nUntil João Gomes started and superbly finished that Wolves move, the excitement in the stands was largely contained to the half-time break, a stimulating small-sided kids’ game between these local rivals. For the record, Wolves won that one, too, the goalscorer celebrating by sitting on the turf and mimicking a meditating Erling Haaland. It triggered a wave of positivity from the hardy souls in the stands and it was almost omnipresent when the ball crashed into Emiliano Martínez’s net in front of the South Bank.\n\nIt was never going to be an evening for the purists and driving rain did little to enhance this soggy Midlands derby as a spectacle. It was a contest bogged down by misplaced passes, clunky touches and the ball slowing unpredictably on a saturated surface. Ezri Konsa can vouch for that, the Villa centre-back nudging the ball back to his goalkeeper Emi Martínez with his big toe, just as Adam Armstrong sought to prey on Douglas Luiz’s loose pass. It was a night for the poncho-clad Wolves supporters in the uncovered Graham Hughes stand in a corner of this stadium. Hugo Bueno looked battle-hardened, the reverse of the Wolves full-back’s old gold shirt caked in mud.\n\nView image in fullscreen Ollie Watkins wastes Aston Villa’s best chance in the first half, delaying his shot long enough for Yerson Mosquera to get back and block it. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThe actual football, and particularly anything resembling Premier League quality, was limited. Ollie Watkins passed up Villa’s first and best first-half opening, electing to take Morgan Rogers’s clever pass on his right foot rather than his left, Watkins’s hesitancy inadvertently offering Yerson Mosquera time to intervene. From the subsequent corner the Villa defender Pau Torres glanced a header wide, the ball bobbling out for another corner via a Wolves shirt. Douglas Luiz sent a volley on target from a Matty Cash cross but it was too close to the Wolves goalkeeper José Sá.\n\nOn the sidelines Emery grew increasingly agitated. He exploded as Jadon Sancho declined to take a shot first time after the ball dropped kindly at the back post and there was also a restlessness within the home support. Rob Edwards, the Wolves head coach, gestured for calm as the locals aired their frustration at Jackson Tchatchoua looking inside for the perceived easy pass. Wolves struggled to hold on to the ball and when they did have it they surrendered possession cheaply, João Gomes among those guilty. Sá, wearing the captain’s armband, shanked a goal-kick straight out of play to the disbelief of those in the stands.\n\nThe second half took on a similar theme and, approaching the hour, Emery had seen enough and turned to his bench, introducing Leon Bailey and Ross Barkley. Emery’s patient wait for Villa to find a killer moment that eluded them could only last so long. At the other end Cash had to throw himself at an inviting Tchatchoua cross after the Wolves wing-back zipped past Lucas Digne.\n\nView image in fullscreen A sodden Unai Emery tries to spur on his Aston Villa team as they struggled against Wolves. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters\n\nTchatchoua has been derided for much of the season, a symbol of the club’s struggles, but it was another of his crosses that prompted Wolves’s unlikely opener. Armstrong, whether by luck or design, laid the ball off perfectly for João Gomes, who sent a first-time shot in off the underside of the crossbar. It was just the tonic the Wolves support needed and they maintained their humour. “One-nil to the Championship,” came the chant from the South Bank.\n\nWolves, certainly not lacking in spirit, defended admirably. Tchatchoua did well to halt Ian Maatsen, one of those thrown on by Emery as Villa chased the game. Toti Gomes halted Leon Bailey, another second-half substitute, advancing. Bueno blocked off all avenues for Cash and turned to celebrate with the home fans. Then, at the final whistle after Mosquera had cleared off his own line, Wolves could celebrate."

            "content": "1. Title run-in all about ‘little details’ Pep Guardiola has told his Manchester City players their pursuit of honours in the final three months of the season will depend on their “brains and minds”. City, who remain in contention for four trophies, meet title rivals Arsenal in the Carabao Cup final and Newcastle in the fifth-round of the FA Cup next month, as well as Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League. In the Premier League, they are five points behind Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal with a game in hand. City have had no midweek games for two weeks and – after the visit to Leeds on Saturday – Guardiola has given his players Sunday to Tuesday off as he believes the challenge in the defining part of the campaign is more mental than technical. Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more “There are still things that we should train and practise more, but I prioritised rest,” Guardiola said. “With three months left, there are many things that the team have improved in and still some things that the team has to improve, but now it is the little details. “Now it is how it is in your brains and your minds that will make the difference. Maybe for the new players it is new, but we have talked a lot in many meetings for many years that, when you arrive in the last three months, competing in all competitions, everything is here [points to his head].” Jamie Jackson\n\nEddie Howe has urged Anthony Gordon not to be distracted by reports linking him with a summer move to Arsenal amid speculation that the 25-year-old winger will be a target for the title-chasing Gunners. Howe, who is still dealing with the fallout from Alexander Isak’s defection to Liverpool last summer, could do without a repeat of that saga, but the Newcastle manager admits there is little he can do to prevent it. Newcastle face Gordon’s former cub Everton in the Premier League on Saturday and Howe said: “I’m not sure there’s a lot I can do about that. I’ve not seen the story, so it’s news to me. But we’re mid-season, we’re in the middle of some of the biggest games of his career and who knows what’s going to happen internationally with him in the summer as well? “He’s got no time to look left or right, he’s got to be fully focused on straight ahead and the next game and trying to be as good as he can be.” View image in fullscreen Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon is reported to be on Arsenal’s wishlist. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA Gordon, who earlier this month dismissed rumours he was on the way out of the club where he signed a new contract in October 2024, will hope to continue his good run of form to secure a place in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for this summer’s World Cup finals and Howe is hopeful he will not be unsettled by talk over his future. “It comes with the territory of being a top player and playing at this level, that there’s going to be speculation,” said Howe. “You’ve just got to put it out of your brain and you’ve got to focus on the football because as we know with our schedule, there’s so many games, there’s no time for distractions. We have to be fully focused on each match.” PA Media\n\n3. Moyes blames referees for corner ‘dark arts’ David Moyes has claimed corner-kick routines are turning into wrestling contests because referees have ignored “the dark arts” for too long. Moyes’s Everton team were criticised for crowding the Manchester United goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, at several corners during their 1-0 defeat at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Monday. Ahead of Saturday’s game at Newcastle, the Everton manager insisted that went against his gameplan but he, and other managers, would seek any advantage that the laws of the game offer. However, he also believes referees should take a harder line to try to eradicate jostling at set-pieces. “Truthfully, it wasn’t the plan for our corner kicks to end up like that. But I think there’s a bigger issue with it,” Moyes said. “It has been allowed to let go, whether it be blocking of goalkeepers or blocking of defenders, and you get the feeling now that referees really don’t want to get involved in any of it. It is nearly wrestling to an extent, which it shouldn’t be. It should never have got to this situation, but I think it’s been really poor that they’ve not tried to deal with it well enough and stop it. “You are now allowed lots of blocking, for example. In my day, if you blocked someone it would have been a free-kick. But blocking has become a big part of it. Let’s be fair, the best at it – but with style – would be Arsenal: good delivery, good style, but ultimately there’s a lot of dark arts in it such as blocking the goalkeeper from the back or the front, blocking defenders and making it difficult for them to be your key headers of the ball. “It is a big thing in football, but I do think the level of refereeing has let that part of the game drop. And managers, if we see somebody else doing it and not getting punished for it, then we are all on it.” View image in fullscreen More wrestling match than football as Manchester United and Everton players indulge in some dark arts from a corner. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images Ironically, Moyes felt Everton’s approach in the closing stages against United worked against his team. He wanted more variety from Everton’s corners but claimed: “It was very difficult to get the message on.” Moyes admitted: “The plan was not to deliver the corners in the fashion we did the other night. They shouldn’t have been delivered as close to the goalkeeper. They should have been delivered into different areas at different times according to what we had worked on. It became a bit of a wrestling match and I didn’t think it showed enough quality or enough thought.” Andy Hunter\n\n4. Glasner wary of United’s Carrick bounce Oliver Glasner credits Michael Carrick for imbuing Manchester United with a “great spirit” and “clear structure” since his appointment last month. No team has picked up more Premier League points in 2026 than United, with Carrick winning five of his six games in charge since replacing Ruben Amorim. Palace have been a thorn in United’s side in recent years, winning three of their five last encounters, but Glasner expects Carrick’s side to be in fine form on Sunday when the Eagles head to Old Trafford. View image in fullscreen The Crystal Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, steered his team into the last 16 of the Uefa Conference league on Thursday. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA “Of course, when Man United plays at home against Crystal Palace, everybody there is expecting now a win,” said Glasner. “They are a very good team now. They gave a very good balance between, it’s a very experienced team, with really, very experienced Premier League players, and very young players with huge talent. “It’s a good mix they have now, but I think the most important thing for them is they are consistently playing with their team and have a clear structure in the way they are playing. This is what I could see against Everton. They have a great spirit right now. It was really impressive seeing Matheus Cunha celebrating winning a duel in their own box. This, I think, is what Michael Carrick brought into this team.” PA Media"

            "content": "Igor Tudor says his Tottenham players are not fit enough and has questioned their desire to put in the hard yards without the ball.\n\nThe interim head coach has a clearer idea of the problems he faces after two weeks – and there are many of them, including low levels of confidence and the capacity of the younger players to handle the pressure of a relegation battle.\n\nTudor knows there are reasons for the physical issues with the squad stretched by an injury crisis amid a punishing schedule. Although Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso are in contention to return for Sunday’s trip to Fulham, Tottenham will be without eight injured players plus the suspended Cristian Romero.\n\nTudor believes there is only one way out of the situation – an on-the-hoof fitness reboot in training, particularly as the club had no midweek fixture last week or this. The Croat surprised the players by working them extremely hard throughout last week and not tapering off before last Sunday’s home game against Arsenal, which they lost 4-1. As Tudor made plain, it is not a time to pander to player sensibilities.\n\n“Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,” Tudor said. “They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and it made the physical condition of the team drop down. So we need to use this period where we don’t play the games to put some petrol in the engine so the engine starts to work better.\n\n“They are fatigued. To do the pressing high you need to be fit. But [it is] all of them because if someone is not in the right shape there is a problem because someone is coming late [to the press].\n\n“The second thing is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back. If you run up and don’t run back it’s a problem. For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it’s a big question what we can do and what we cannot do.”\n\nTudor was asked about his full-throttle approach from the first training session. “Yes, that’s the only way – running,” he said. “The pitch is 100 yards, it’s long. So you need to run.\n\n“Maybe you have habits to, I don’t know … work a bit less. I put some runs without the ball [into the sessions]. Never players like runs without the ball so we put some runs without balls. But it’s a moment when there is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn’t like. And the best thing is that they understand this. They gave me their availability to do these things.”\n\nTudor is under no illusions about the size of the challenge. It was put to him that the striker, Randal Kolo Muani, had played well against Arsenal. “That’s good, one good thing,” he replied.\n\nWhat Tudor wants to see at Fulham and beyond is players such as Kolo Muani stepping up, accepting the responsibility. “Some players are still young,” he said. “They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to resolve the problems.\n\nView image in fullscreen Randal Kolo Muani scores against Arsenal – Igor Tudor wants him to keep raising his game for Spurs. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\n“If you have too many of these players because of the amount of injuries, who are playing together in the squad, it does create some problems. But it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man. To say: ‘Come on, I’m the guy, give me the ball, I will score.’ Instead of just: ‘What can I do? I’m just here, you know.’\n\n“It’s always how you see the situation. It’s not: ‘I’m just here. We had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play.’ How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy and positive, there is opportunity.”\n\nTudor has not dwelt for long on the derby with Arsenal. “No, no, forget that,” he said. It was never likely to be a game that would define the club’s survival hopes. The same is not true of Fulham – or the home fixture against Crystal Palace next Thursday.\n\n“After the first game, I said if you play against the best team in the world at this moment, it’s not a realistic game to show [whether] we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,” Tudor said. “That’s the truth. They show they can be in some parts of the game. But for long periods we had problems, in defence especially. It’s not easy against them. Let’s see in the next games.”"

            "content": "Paris Saint-German v Chelsea\n\nThe Club World Cup final victory over Paris Saint-Germain last summer was probably Enzo Maresca’s finest hour as Chelsea manager. He devised a gameplan, pinging balls over Nuno Mendes for Cole Palmer to chase, backed up by Malo Gusto, that tore the European champions apart in the first half. Liam Rosenior may try to exploit the same vulnerability, but this is a Chelsea that look weary, their exertions in the US perhaps having left them fatigued.\n\nPSG’s recent form has been indifferent, as proved by the fact they were forced into the playoff round by a defeat by Sporting and a draw against Newcastle in their final two league-phase games, before limping to a 5-4 aggregate win over Monaco. But then they looked unimpressive until this stage last season as well.\n\nVerdict Narrow PSG win.\n\nGalatasaray v Liverpool\n\nLiverpool have won only one of five previous meetings with Galatasaray, their league-phase defeat in Istanbul in September part of their miserable autumn. But four of those games were more than 20 years ago and Liverpool, while still nowhere near the level of last season, are a more solid team now than they were five months ago, while Florian Wirtz had begun to find his feet before his injury.\n\nGalatasaray showed both sides of their character against Juventus in the playoff round. They were exceptional in the second half of the first leg at home and Victor Osimhen may have a physical edge over the heart of Liverpool’s defence. But in the second leg, even against 10 men, they wobbled badly, losing discipline and self-belief.\n\nVerdict Comfortable Liverpool win.\n\nReal Madrid v Manchester City\n\nThe players change, the managers change, the format changes, and somehow Manchester City always end up playing Real Madrid. The sides had never met in a competitive game until 2012; these two legs will bring their meetings since to 17, including in the league phase in December, when City withstood early pressure to win 2-1 at the Bernabéu.\n\nThis will be the fifth straight season in which City and Madrid have met in the knockouts, with Madrid having prevailed on three occasions. Although City are beginning to click into form, having won seven of their last eight in all competitions, they are not the all-conquering side of old, but Madrid, having sacked Xabi Alonso, are also flawed, a gaggle of great individuals having not quite coalesced into a coherent whole.\n\nVerdict Narrow City win.\n\nAtalanta v Bayern Munich\n\nBayern Munich are perhaps the side most likely to prevent a Premier League success. They have lost just once all season in the Bundesliga and are averaging more than 3.5 goals per game in a system that gets the best out of Harry Kane. He has scored 43 goals in all competitions this season and his habit of dropping deep is complemented by Michael Olise, Serge Gnabry and Luis Díaz running beyond him.\n\nBayern finished the league phase second behind Arsenal, their only dropped points coming at the Emirates Stadium, where they were outclassed and lost 3-1. Atalanta’s comeback to overhaul a 2-0 first-leg deficit against Borussia Dortmund in the playoff round was stirring but they are not the side they were when they won the Europa League in 2024 and lie seventh in Serie A.\n\nVerdict Comfortable Bayern win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Harry Kane has scored 43 goals in all competitions for Bayern Munich this season and is key to their hopes of a first Champions League title since 2020. Photograph: Maryam Majd/Reuters\n\nNewcastle v Barcelona\n\nFor Newcastle fans, any mention of Barcelona will always conjure images of Faustino Asprilla’s hat-trick in their 3-2 win in the Champions League in 1997. They’ve lost all four meetings since, though, including in the league phase in September. That 2-1 defeat at St James’ Park, though, should give Newcastle hope: they were far from outclassed and showed a clear physical edge.\n\nA combination of set plays and pace in behind Barcelona’s remarkably high line could be a path to the quarter-final. That high line places huge stress on Barça’s press; any slip-up and Hansi Flick’s side are wide open, which in the end was what cost them in last season’s semi-final. They are top of La Liga, though, and only Arsenal scored more goals in the league phase.\n\nVerdict Narrow Barcelona win.\n\nAtlético Madrid v Tottenham\n\nTottenham have met Atlético Madrid only once, but it was one of the most famous nights in the history of the club as Bill Nicholson’s side romped to a 5-1 win in the 1963 Cup Winners’ Cup final in Rotterdam, making them the first British club to lift a European trophy. For Spurs this season, the priority has to be avoiding relegation, and it remains to be seen what impact Igor Tudor will have.\n\nUnder Thomas Frank, Europe brought a sense of relief. Only Arsenal let in fewer goals, and five of the seven they did concede came in their only defeat, at PSG. Atlético have had a mixed season and lie a frustrating fourth in La Liga. They lost to Liverpool and Arsenal in the league phase.\n\nVerdict Narrow Atlético win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Xavi Simons celebrates scoring for Tottenham in the Champions League.

Momentum and their artificial pitch north of the Arctic Circle give them a chance.\n\nVerdict Narrow Sporting win.\n\nBayer Leverkusen v Arsenal\n\nArsenal won every game in the league phase. They scored the most goals and they conceded the fewest. Last season, Liverpool gained no advantage from finishing top, but Arsenal have. It’s not just that they face Leverkusen, sixth in the Bundesliga, in the last 16, it’s that if they win they will face Bodø/Glimt or Sporting in the quarter-final.\n\nThe clubs have met only once, in 2002, when Arsenal drew 1-1 away and won 4-1 at home in the second group stage, and there’s every chance of something similar here. Although Leverkusen did beat Manchester City at the Etihad in the league phase, that was one of only three victories, and in their only other game against Premier League opposition they needed a late equaliser to force a home draw with Newcastle.\n\nVerdict Comfortable Arsenal win."

            "content": "Premier League clubs are unhappy with Uefa’s decision to reveal details of their financial results before some have been published and without warning.\n\nChelsea’s record pre-tax loss of £355m last season formed a key part of Uefa’s European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report, which was presented by its executive director, Andrea Traverso, at the Financial Times’s Business of Football Summit on Thursday, with the losses incurred by Tottenham and Aston Villa also featuring prominently.\n\nThe issue is understood to have been discussed by Premier League representatives at Friday’s Champions League draw in Nyon, where there was agreement that Uefa had failed to keep them informed.\n\nNone of the clubs were briefed about Uefa’s plans, leaving Chelsea in particular frustrated at being given no time to prepare for questions on their results. The club are not planning to publish their 2024-25 accounts until the end of March.\n\nChelsea, while not contesting the £355m loss, which is based on information they provided to Uefa, insist the headline figure does not reflect the economic reality.\n\nClub sources have disclosed that the record loss reflects non-cash accounting adjustments required by Uefa’s financial sustainability regulations, specifically one-off transactions related to player contract and asset write-offs, and that they are profitable on an operational basis.\n\nChelsea were fined £27m by Uefa last summer for breaching its spending restrictions and ordered to submit to a business plan, but are confident of avoiding another sanction. As part of that settlement agreement Chelsea were permitted to continue running at a substantial loss, as long as it remained in line with “the projected deficit submitted in the business plan”."

            "content": "Being teetotal, always asking questions and taking up yoga in his early 30s after a recommendation from Gareth Barry have played their part. But if one thing inspired James Milner to break the Premier League’s appearance mark then it is a trait honed during his formative years in Yorkshire: sheer bloody-mindedness.\n\n“Some things don’t change,” Milner says with a chuckle when asked whether his desire to prove people wrong was as strong as ever after his 40th birthday last month. “There’s people who are always going to doubt you but that’s always something that’s been at my forefront: to prove them wrong.”\n\nMilner credits his father for instilling the fighting spirit that has carried him through a remarkable 24 seasons in English football’s top flight. He started as a 16-year-old with Leeds under the watchful eye of Terry Venables, and has had spells at Newcastle, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Liverpool and now Brighton.\n\n“He knew what I was like and he used to say: ‘You don’t work hard enough, you’re not going to make it,’” he says of his father. “He’d never say it in a horrible way or anything like that. But he’d be like: ‘You got no chance of scoring the goal from there.’ And then [I would] take free-kicks and two shots later it’s in the top corner. He knew how to get the best of me.”\n\nThe same desire provided motivation after it seemed Milner’s career was finished in 2024 when he was unable to walk following knee surgery. He spent nine months on the sidelines before returning at the end of last season.\n\n“I think most people – the surgeon, the physio, people who knew what I had, probably every single person – thought I was finished; at my age being a footballer and what I had,” he says. “So it was probably that same thing that meant I’m still playing now: not to finish your career in a way that wasn’t really in your control. That was the drive really. I wanted to try to prove that I could get back from that because I don’t think many people could.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner salutes the fans after the final whistle in Leeds’ victory over Chelsea in December 2002, a month after his Premier League debut as a 16-year-old. Photograph: Gareth Copley/PA\n\nIt has been particularly satisfying for Milner that, having come off the bench more than 200 times in the Premier League, he started on his 654th appearance to break his former Villa teammate Barry’s record when Brighton overcame Brentford last week. “My body doesn’t agree to sitting still, so that’s why I don’t like being on the bench so much,” he says.\n\nHe relishes his role as the elder statesman of the Brighton squad and reveals that the teenage striker Charalampos Kostoulas has been joining him for yoga sessions. “I probably started maybe eight or nine years ago now, which I think Gareth put me on to actually,” he says. “We’re passing it down, so I’ve passed it on to Babis [Kostoulas] at this moment. He’s only 18, so he’s starting young.”\n\nMilner, whose rippling muscles bulge as he holds court at Brighton’s training ground in Lancing, recognises he has been fortunate that his career coincided with the rapid growth of sports science. He uses strengthening techniques created by the celebrated German athletics coach Frans Bosch to counteract injuries that have included a fractured ankle at Newcastle and 12 hamstring problems, meticulously tracks his sleep patterns and takes magnesium to boost a natural shortfall in his body. Milner believes the decision to never drink alcohol, made during his schooldays in Horsforth, outside Leeds, is another of the secrets to his longevity.\n\n“I’ve never had a problem with people drinking at all – I think it’s healthy,” he says. “Like if that’s the right time to do it and if that’s your thing to get away from football and go have a blast, then I’ve no problems with it all. But it’s just a decision I made that if it would help me, I wouldn’t do it.\n\n“When I first started playing you had maybe one or two physios, maybe a part-time masseur, one fitness coach. Now you’ve got five or six fitness coaches, you’ve got seven or eight in the medical team. So that’s been to my advantage that I’ve managed to learn from that to ask questions early.\n\n“I always ask questions: ‘Why are we doing this?’ Or: ‘Explain it to me so I understand and then I decide if it is the right thing to do. I’m not just going to do it because you say. Give me the information why. Give me the science behind it.’ It was interesting, a few of the messages I had over the weekend were: ‘You were a nightmare to work with,’ or ‘challenging to work with’. But I take that as a compliment that I push them to be better and ask questions and challenge them. The best people always come out and give you the exact reason why you’re doing it.”\n\nThings have changed from his youth, when Milner recalls “teacups flying and walls being punched” at half-time by irate managers. “You don’t see much of that now,” he says. “I just feel fortunate. I played through two eras; one when I was emerging and now another.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner, with then teammate Jordan Henderson, holds the FA Cup after Liverpool’s win in 2022. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nMilner was presented this week with three Guinness world records: one for the appearances, another for most consecutive Premier League seasons (23) and the third for the longest gap between his first and last Premier League goals (22 years and 248 days). The next milestone on the horizon is surpassing Teddy Sheringham’s record as the Premier League’s oldest outfield player at 40 years 272 days, though Milner has never been inspired by chasing records.\n\nHe is yet to open discussions with Brighton about extending his stay beyond this season – a prospect recently welcomed by his 33-year‑old head coach, Fabian Hürzeler – but is keen to stay and he denies fearing what retirement may bring.\n\n“When we have some days off I look forward to that: go and play golf, spend time with the family. So I feel whenever I finish, I’ll probably have a break and a rest because I’ve been so 100% for so long.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner with his three Guinness World Records certificates. Photograph: Paul Hazlewood\n\nHaving worked under Venables, Sir Bobby Robson, Roberto Mancini, Jürgen Klopp and many other of the game’s finest managers, Milner is well placed to judge what makes a good one. He rates his two seasons as a central midfielder at Martin O’Neill’s Villa as his best from an individual perspective, and has especially fond memories of winning City’s and Liverpool’s first league titles for a generation. There are doubts about his prospects of making the transition to the dugout when he hangs up his boots.\n\n“It’s such a hard gig, innit? You see managers getting a new contract and getting sacked in two months. People don’t get the time they deserve now. But the competitive guy in you thinks: ‘Yeah, I wouldn’t mind giving that a go.’\n\n“I’ve got a great array of different managers from different countries and different personalities to lean back on, so in one way I think it’d be a big shame to lose all that knowledge and experience I’ve built up, to not be able to use that.”"

            "content": "A European occasion that appeared ominous for Celtic instead provided evidence that it is never wise to write off Martin O’Neill. His side exited the Europa League in Stuttgart but the scale of spirit and togetherness visible during their 1-0, playoff second-leg victory emphasised that tales of their demise may be overstated.\n\nCeltic’s key attribute during a critical week, which begins at Ibrox on Sunday, is course and distance specialism. The shortcomings within, and patched-up nature of, O’Neill’s squad are blindingly obvious. This is, however, a club that has become accustomed to dominating Scottish football over more than a decade. Much earlier, O’Neill had demonstrated he could emerge successful from title scraps. Contrary to giddy analysis, there is nothing miraculous or remarkable about O’Neill’s work during his second short-term stint of the season. It is, though, immediately striking how a 73-year-old can achieve such buy-in from players. Faith in O’Neill within Celtic is absolute.\n\nThis Celtic season, typified by managerial upheaval and protesting supporters, retains a pulse. Stuttgart felt significant because Celtic, in makeshift form, displayed character. The easier option would have been to limp out of the Europa League. Instead, there was an unwillingness to concede an equaliser that reflects positively on O’Neill and his squad.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill (left) is in his second interim stint of the season at Celtic and has galvanised the players after a rocky period. Photograph: DPA/PA\n\nOn Sunday they face a Rangers team who are under considerable pressure to prove they will not deliver another campaign typified by false dawns. Rangers’ home form is strong but Danny Röhl’s team are yet to remove the sense of a soft underbelly, demonstrated by draws at Hibernian, Motherwell and Livingston. The most recent of those, last Sunday, was a horrendous result; Livingston had not won in 25 league matches. The stakes are huge for Rangers, who should be embarrassed if a net spend of about £30m is not sufficient to prise the title from Celtic – at one point managed by Wilfried Nancy – and a Hearts side assembled for buttons in comparison. Celtic’s seven Premiership losses to date match their combined tally from the previous two seasons.\n\nA Rangers win would place Celtic in tricky territory, five points behind their oldest foes. Celtic’s game in hand will be played in Aberdeen on Wednesday, before a return to Ibrox on Scottish Cup business. Hearts hope to extend their lead at the top to seven points on Saturday when Aberdeen visit Edinburgh. An Old Firm draw would suit Hearts perfectly.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rangers’ Danny Röhl speaks to the media on Friday – his side are four points behind Hearts and two above Celtic. Photograph: Luke Nickerson/Rangers FC/Shutterstock\n\nStuttgart gave O’Neill plenty food for thought. Luke McCowan’s terrific performance in midfield should afford him a start at Ibrox. O’Neill’s public backing of Kasper Schmeichel suggests he will restore the veteran goalkeeper despite almost weekly errors. Schmeichel’s deputy, Viljami Sinisalo, repelled Stuttgart. Auston Trusty’s suspension leaves Celtic weak in central defence. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was not in Celtic’s European squad, was surely signed to play in fixtures such as the derby.\n\nO’Neill is aware of a bigger picture, despite that hardly being his concern given he is due to leave in the summer. “European football is what big clubs in Scotland should be aiming for,” he said. “Not for the coefficient points to be dropping out of sight. It’s ridiculous. This is what it’s all about.”\n\nHis regular reference to the country’s coefficient, which is indeed dipping to a worrying level, is intriguing. There is a theory Celtic’s reluctance to spend heavily on players is linked at least in part to knowledge that their potential lack of access to European revenue in upcoming years could swallow up cash reserves. In a worst-case but feasible situation, Celtic could be staring at Conference League football. This does not, however, explain the horrendous lack of preparation for this season’s Champions League playoff tie. Sensible investment would have been sufficient to topple Kairat Almaty, who instead left Celtic with red faces.\n\nThe shadow boxing has started. McCowan has asserted no team in the league can touch Celtic when at their best. In truth, it would be more of a story had McCowan stipulated Celtic are also-rans. Röhl cast aspersions on Celtic’s approach in Stuttgart; this was amusing, given Rangers finished 32nd out of 36 in the Europa League table.\n\nAll Old Firm jousts are fascinating. This one carries more meaning than most. Events in Germany suggested Celtic are formed of the kind of substance that Rangers must be wary of."

            "content": "DONALD Trump today teased a “friendly takeover” of Cuba, suggesting that Washington’s long-time nemesis is on the brink of collapse.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the White House lawn, the president revealed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is locked in “very high level” talks with Cuba’s top brass.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s comments come after Cuban border guards killed four US-based exiles as they charging towards the coast on a speedboat.\n\n“The government is talking with us,” he said.\n\n“They have no money. They have no anything right now.\n\n\n\n“We could very well end up having a friendly takeover.”\n\nTrump did not elaborate on his comments, but he has repeatedly mocked the communist state’s rapidly deteriorating financial position.\n\nCuba has been on the president’s mind since the US military’s daring capture of Venezuelan tyrant Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe ousting of one of Havana’s closest allies delivered a bitter blow to the island’s economy.\n\n\n\nTrump even suggested that initiating military action against Cuba might not be necessary as the absence of Venezuelan oil shipments had already brought the country to its knees.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of years dealing with Cuba,” he told reporters today.\n\n“I’ve been hearing about Cuba since I was a little boy. But they’re in big trouble.”\n\nTrump also alluded to the Cuban exile community living in the US, saying: “There could be something coming that I think [is] very positive for the people that were expelled, or worse.”\n\nThe US has maintained a strict trade embargo on Cuba since 1962, the year after a failed, CIA-sponsored Bay of Pigs invasion left the White House with egg on its face.\n\n\n\nHavana confirmed it was speaking to US officials following the shooting of the American boat carrying Cuban exiles.\n\nCuban authorities accused its ten occupants of plotting a terrorist attack, saying that they found a sizeable stash of guns and Molotov cocktails on board.\n\nRubio has vowed the US will “find out exactly what happened” and “respond accordingly.”\n\n\n\n“We’re not gonna base our conclusions on what they told us,” he said.\n\nIn January, Trump signed an executive order punishing countries that supplied oil to Cuba with tariffs.\n\nThe move has sent an already reeling economy into a tailspin and deepened an energy crisis that has already caused mass blackouts across the country.\n\nCarlos Fernndez de Cosso, Cuba’s deputy foreign minister, said today that the US’ fuel embargo remains in full force.\n\n“Nothing announced in recent days changes that reality,” he wrote on X.\n\n\n\n“The possibilities of conditional sales to the private sector already existed and do not alleviate the impact on the population.”\n\nMeanwhile, over 40 US civil society organisations sent a letter to Congress today warning that cutting oil shipments to the Caribbean island would spark a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThey implored Senators and Representatives to press the Trump administration into rowing back on its aggressive policy towards the country.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIt reads: “Policies that deliberately impose hunger and mass hardship on millions of civilians constitute a form of collective punishment, and as such are a grave violation of international humanitarian law.”\n\nSignees included the Alliance of Baptists, ActionAid USA and the Presbyterian Church."

            "content": "SHELLING OUT How brazen thief pulled off highest-value snatch of all time when he nicked bag containing £2MILLION Faberge Egg\n\nBAG snatcher Enzo Conticello hit the jackpot when he targeted company director Rosie Dawson – she was carrying a £2million Faberge jewelled egg and watch.\n\nBut even though it is thought to be the world’s highest-value handbag nab, the petty thief was more interested in having a smoke — and used Rosie’s bank card to buy cigarettes at a nearby Co-op.\n\n\n\n\n\nConticello, 29, targeted luxury drinks firm director Rosie outside the Dog And Duck pub in Bateman Street in London’s Soho.\n\nThe egg and watch were being sold by her firm, but after attending a trade show which finished late, she volunteered to take the items home, rather than to a night vault.\n\nThe Sun can today reveal that Algerian Conticello, whose real name is thought to be Hakim Boudjenoune, struck as she put the Givenchy bag down on the pavement to hug a friend outside the pub.\n\nAs well as the egg and watch, it contained a laptop, bank cards, keys and driving licence.\n\nA source said: “The thief probably recognised it was a Givenchy bag and was likely to have goodies inside.\n\n“But he clearly had no idea exactly how precious those goodies were, because he remained in Soho afterwards and used Rosie’s bank card rather than leaving the area immediately.”\n\nConticello removed the bag’s contents and dumped it, then took a Victoria Line Tube to Walthamstow in North East London, where he used Rosie’s card again to buy alcohol at a Nisa store.\n\n\n\nThe trail then went cold until Conticello was arrested by detectives from the Met’s Central West CID in Belfast on January 26.\n\nHe was brought to London and the next day appeared at Uxbridge magistrates’ court in West London.\n\nOn Tuesday Conticello pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court to theft and three counts of fraud by misrepresentation in relation to the credit card offences.\n\nHe did not enter a plea to concealing criminal property — the Faberge egg and watch — and a sentencing hearing has been set for March 6.\n\nThe court heard that the egg and watch have not been recovered and their precise valuation is currently being established for the hearing.\n\n\n\nBut The Sun can reveal police have arrested a man on suspicion of handling the precious items.\n\nIt is understood the suspect drew suspicion by emailing the Faberge company to ask about the value of the egg and watch.\n\nJudge Martin Griffith told Conticello: “It must have been rather a surprise to you when you saw that egg.”\n\nRosie, in her late 20s, is said to have been “devastated”.\n\nThe source said: “She left her bag alone for a split second — but that’s all it took.”"

            "content": "REFORM is still on course for a General Election win despite a disappointing by-election defeat to the Greens, a top pollster says.\n\nNigel Farage‘s party came second place in the Gorton and Denton vote on Thursday, with Labour coming in third.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut top pollster James Johnson says the Left-wing vote splitting like that again could actually boost Reform’s path to power.\n\nJohnson has written in The Sun: “The Greens are coming for Keir Starmer and his voters.\n\n“Their win in Gorton and Denton shows they can win the votes of younger progressives and Muslims concerned about foreign policy.\n\n“Reform UK may be disappointed by second. But the Left vote being split gives it a clearer path to a majority.\n\n“Don’t be surprised to hear Reform make what will be a compelling argument in the UK’s 600-plus other seats: The Greens and what they represent are a threat, and Reform are the only way to beat them.”\n\nJohnson adds that voters who historically backed Labour, now have an alternative option.\n\nOne that is positioned further to the Left than the Liberal Democrats and seen as more organised and credible than Jeremy Corbyn’s Your Party.\n\n\n\nThe pollster said that one in five Labour voters would switch to the Greens.\n\nHe also stressed that the constituency is unusual, with a population that is more likely than the UK average to be unemployed or Muslim.\n\nOnly 27 constituencies, out of 600 across the country, have the same or a bigger proportion of Muslim voters, underlining the seats unique demographic.\n\nThe Gorton and Denton by-election saw Labour’s heartlands rocked as voters turned to the Greens in protest over issues including foreign policy.\n\nIt marked the first time the Greens have won a by-election in what they called a “seismic” moment for the party.\n\n\n\nThe outcome has sparked panic in Labour ranks over their crumbling support among younger and Muslim voters.\n\nIn Gorton and Denton, Reform surged past Labour into a strong second place, cementing its status as the main challenger in swathes of England.\n\nTop Pollster Says... James Johnson writes in The Sun... “The Greens are coming for Keir Starmer and his voters. “Their win in Gorton and Denton shows they can win the votes of younger progressives and Muslims concerned about foreign policy. “Both groups traditionally voted Labour but now have a new party to consider — more radical than the Lib Dems, more functional than Jeremy Corbyn’s Your Party. “The threat is real. Of voters who still say they would vote Labour, one in five will consider a switch to Green. “Reform UK may be disappointed by second. But the Left vote being split gives it a clearer path to a majority. “The seat is also unique. Its voters, more likely to be unemployed or Muslim than the national average, traditionally vote for the Left. “Only 27 other seats have similar or higher levels of Muslim voters. “Don’t be surprised to hear Reform make what will be a compelling argument in the UK’s 600-plus other seats: The Greens and what they represent are a threat, and Reform are the only way to beat them.”\n\nFollowing defeat, Farage raised concerns about sectarian voting and “cheating” straight after Hannah Spencer won the by-election.\n\nHe has now reported cases in the Gorton and Denton by-election to both the police and the Electoral Commission.\n\nHis intervention came after election observer group Democracy Volunteers witnessed “concerningly high levels” of family voting.\n\n\n\nThis involves the illegal practice where two voters use just a single voting booth and possibly direct each other on how to vote.\n\nThe by-election result has reignited questions about whether Sir Keir can hold together Labour’s fragile coalition of voters.\n\nWith more than 600 constituencies up for grabs at a General Election, even small shifts in vote share could deliver big consequences.\n\nAnd as Johnson warns, the battle lines are shifting fast.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe Greens may have drawn first blood in Gorton and Denton — but Reform believes the real fightback is only just beginning."

The former Duke of York was arrested last Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He was released under investigation 11 hours after he was detained, on his 66th birthday.\n\nDisgraced Boris Johnson weighed in on the scandal surrounding the former-prince and surprisingly shared why he thought it was the \"best thing to have happened to the Royal Family for years\".

Johnson claimed he was \"bit grumpy\" when told he was summoned to meet Andrew but went as it was during the time the ex-Duke served as a trade envoy.\n\nJohnson, in his column in the Daily Mail, said Andrew had come forward to him with a \"series of ideas\" to make London more attractive to billionaires, which the ex-PM said \"perhaps gleaned from some of his international contacts\".\n\nHe claimed Andrew ripped into Battersea Power Station, which had not been re-developed at that point, and said \"Why don’t we just knock it down?\". Johnson then claimed Andrew was unconvinced about plans at the time to keep the Grade 1 listed building and transform it, with Andrew allegedly saying \"It'll never happen\".\n\nView 5 Images Johnson rambled on about two times he met the then-Duke (Image: US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE/AFP via)\n\nJohnson also claimed the disgraced ex-prince said lots of his pals and \"potentially very significant investors\" were complaining about a lack of VIP areas and treatment at Heathrow Airport. The ex-PM even alleged that Andrew had a bizarre solution to an idea about a new airport in the Thames estuary.\n\nJohnson said: \"He knew that one of the objections was the presence in the waters of a sunken World War II munitions boat called the SS Richard Montgomery. He had a brilliant solution. Why not make a huge steel net and wrap it round the wreck so that if it exploded the shock waves would not damage the airport?\"\n\nView 5 Images Andrew laying on the laps of five women as Ghislaine Maxwell watches (Image: PA)\n\nThe ex-PM claimed Andrew also managed to complain about the headache London traffic was causing to his billionaire pals, adding that it was \"damaging London’s reputation\".\n\nJohnson also noted another time he met Andrew, when he was Prime Minster, but this time after the ex-Duke's disastarous Newsnight interview in 2019. Johnson claimed he told the late-Queen's son to open a pub with Sarah Ferguson and call it the \"Duke of York\".\n\nDespite this, Johnson said he \"felt sorry\" for Andrew, he wrote: \"But in a way I felt a bit sorry for him. He was the second son in a system that insisted on male ­primogeniture. The result was that he didn’t have a role. But now, he does.\" He oddly added that the Andrew scandal and fallout could be seen as a good thing for the Royal Family.\n\nView 5 Images Andrew was arrested last Thursday and released under investigation (Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe ex-Mayor said: \"We look up from reading about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein and Mandelson, and all the horrific things that seem to have happened on that Caribbean island, and we have such a creepy sense of a conspiracy involving money and power and sexual dissolution that we feel we have been fire-hosed with slurry.\n\n\"And then we look at the other members of the Royal Family, and think how relatively decent and public-spirited they seem.\" Johnson added: \"It's precisely because he makes us shudder, and think of the alternative, that Andrew has done the monarchy a favour.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"He has made them more intelligible to us, too, because every family has a black sheep or two.

And that signals it's also almost time for British clocks to go forward, aligning us with British Summer Time (BST).\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThis annual event is scheduled for 1am on the last Sunday in March, which falls on March 29 in 2026. While this means you could lose an hour's sleep, there will be lighter evenings, slightly darker mornings for a few weeks.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nExperts at Royal Museums Greenwich explain: \"About 70 countries have some form of daylight saving time, but it varies from region to region. Much of Europe and North America, as well as parts of South America and Australasia, change their clocks. However, many countries in Africa and Asia situated around the equator do not change the time.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Internet-enabled devices, such as computers and mobile phones, should automatically adjust to the upcoming clock change (Image: Getty Images)\n\nToday, advocates for clock changing often argue that this adjustment helps reduce energy use, promotes outdoor activities and even decreases road accidents, according to the experts.\n\nHowever, some argue that this is no longer necessary, since many of us spend most of our time in well-lit homes, shops and offices, where natural daylight has little impact on our daily lives. The experts add: \"It’s an ongoing debate that strongly depends on people’s geographical location, occupation and lifestyle.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nInternet-connected devices, such as computers and mobile phones, should automatically adjust to the upcoming clock change. However, if you want to mark it in your diary, the Government provides a comprehensive list of future clock changes on its website.\n\nView 3 Images The clocks will eventually return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) at 2am on October 25, 2026 (Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\nThe UK Government also adds: \"In the UK the clocks go forward 1 hour at 1am on the last Sunday in March, and back 1 hour at 2am on the last Sunday in October.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"The period when the clocks are 1 hour ahead is called British Summer Time (BST). There’s more daylight in the evenings and less in the mornings (sometimes called Daylight Saving Time). When the clocks go back, the UK is on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).\"\n\nThe clocks will eventually return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) at 2am on October 25, 2026. Then, in 2027, the clocks will go forward again on March 28 at 1am.\n\nFor additional information, visit GOV.UK here.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nExact dates of clock changes\n\nClocks going forward\n\nMarch 29, 2026\n\nMarch 28, 2027\n\nMarch 26, 2028\n\nClocks going back\n\nOctober 25, 2026\n\nOctober 31, 2027\n\nOctober 29, 2028\n\nArticle continues below\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

I don't know if it was rival gangs or what but it's not what you expect in broad daylight at the local supermarket.\n\nA spokesperson for Police Scotland said: “Two males aged 17 and 18 have been arrested and charged in connection with assault to endangerment of life, breach of the peace and weapons offences following a disturbance in The Jewel area of Edinburgh.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n“Around 4.20pm on Wednesday, February 25, officers were called to a report of males with weapons causing a disturbance.

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980. The bout was competitive, but Arguello scored the 11th-round knockout to retain his WBC super featherweight title.\n\nCastillo would lose his next bout, too, dropping a unanimous decision to Mexican legend Salvador Sanchez after leading the first six rounds.\n\nCastillo later lost to Julio Cesar Chavez in 1985 as the iconic boxer scored a sixth-round knockout at the Forum in Los Angeles.\n\nRuben Castillo (L) throws a punch against Julio Cesar Chavez during the fight at the LA Forum\n\nBoxer Ruben 'the Conquistador' Castillo has passed away at 68, according to the World Boxing Council.

'Definitely world championship material in a different era. R.I.P.'\n\nCastillo ultimately served as an announcer alongside legendary play-by-play man, Chick Hearn.\n\n'Ruben and Chick Hearn were gold on Fights From The Fabulous Forum broadcasts,' one fan wrote online. 'Great stuff.'\n\nHe also had a reputation as a positive influence on many young fighters and fans.\n\n'A great man,' his nephew wrote on Facebook. 'Both him and his family were a great part of my childhood. He always gave great advice, would be there when ya needed him. Going to parties at his place, doing golf charity events. He def was the neighborhood Uncle for alot of us.\n\nCastillo later served as an announcer on many WBC fights from the Forum in Los Angeles\n\n'A Family man, Boxer, Charity planner, we lost. Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God. May his wife Cindy, family and friends find comfort with the support of the so many who loved Ruben. Rest in eternal peace.'"

It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "Why Aston Villa can feel a Champions League place slipping through their fingers AGAIN: The three key players they look half a team without and where Unai Emery is going wrong after Wolves defeat: TOM COLLOMOSSE\n\nWhen Rodrigo Gomes sealed Wolves' victory with a handful of seconds remaining, Unai Emery had seen enough.\n\nThe Aston Villa boss marched straight down the tunnel and when Rob Edwards approached the away dugout at full-time to shake hands, Emery was nowhere to be seen. Soon after full-time his captain, Ezri Konsa, appeared to be restrained by a Villa staff member. There were suggestions Konsa had exchanged cross words with some away supporters.\n\n'In September I was worried about being in the relegation zone,' said Emery, referring to Villa's poor start. 'Then maybe a month ago I was dreaming of fighting with Manchester City and Arsenal for the title.\n\n'We are having a great season and I want to tell our fans now that we need them. We are grateful for them for being with us but at Villa Park we need their help. We need to be together – players, coaches, fans, everyone.\n\n'Our points total is similar to clubs who have finished in the top five before. We are competing against great teams and for them it is necessary to finish in the Champions League. We need to keep our position.'\n\nJoao Gomes' opener and Rodrigo's clincher means Wolves eclipse Derby's record low points total from 2007-08 and they deserved their win. 'I have not been especially focused on [the total] but it is important for the club and the fans,' acknowledged Edwards.\n\nAston Villa will have fears over their Champions League spot again after losing 2-0 at Wolves\n\nUnai Emery was left with his head in his hands as his third-place side stumbled at Molineux\n\nThe lasting image of the night, however, was Emery's touchline meltdown. Villa fans hope their toiling team do not follow suit as they fear a Champions League place will slip from their grasp for the second season in a row. Their next two fixtures are against fellow contenders Chelsea and Manchester United.\n\nAsked about the pressure on Villa, Morgan Rogers said: 'It does weigh on us but it shouldn't. We deserve to be here and we should not forget that. There is nothing to worry about.'\n\nEmery's early exit was no surprise. From the moment he gave Jadon Sancho an earful midway through the first half, the Spaniard looked ready to boil over. 'Only seven?!' he seemed to scream at the fourth official after the stoppage time board was raised, with his side chasing an equaliser. Earlier, Emery appeared to ignore Emi Buendia and Lucas Digne when they were substituted, his frustration growing when play was delayed due to an issue with referee Craig Pawson's earpiece.\n\nEmery is one of the finest managers in Villa's history but this was not his finest hour. From the moment the team sheet landed, his night started going wrong. Ollie Watkins and Lucas Digne ahead of the in-form Tammy Abraham and the adventurous Ian Maatsen. Really?\n\nThen there was his demeanour throughout the game. Emery is always full of nervous energy on the touchline and usually it is a positive force. Here, though, it could not possibly have been.\n\nVilla are still third in the table, six points ahead of Liverpool in sixth, and are favourites for the Europa League.\n\nVilla needed Emery to be calm. Instead he acted like a man who was watching everything go up in smoke, though he had cooled down by the time he faced the media.\n\nIn this form, Villa will struggle to succeed at home or in Europe. When Joao Gomes gave Wolves the lead just after the hour mark, only Ezri Konsa and Digne tried to encourage their team-mates. Konsa and Amadou Onana berated Buendia for dragging his heels as the Argentine walked to the bench after being substituted.\n\nWolves know they are down but there are still certain matches that can bring some light in the darkness. One is next week's FA Cup fifth-round tie against Liverpool. The other is the chance to knock over one of their local rivals.\n\nThe absence of key players is starting to take its toll on Villa. Shorn of Boubacar Kamara, as well as John McGinn and Youri Tielemans, they look half the team.\n\nJoao Gomes (above) struck midway through the second half to put Wolves in the ascendancy, before Rodrigo Gomes grabbed the hosts' second goal with virtually the last kick of the game\n\nVilla's dismal defeat marked just the second time Wolves have won in the league this season\n\nThe early signs were not promising. Buendia's clumsy challenge on Jean-Ricner Bellegarde gave Wolves a free-kick that Mateus Mane sent just wide from 22 yards. Many expected Abraham to be preferred to Watkins here and in the sixth minute Watkins wasted a great chance to repay that faith.\n\nSent clear by Morgan Rogers, Watkins hesitated just long enough for Yerson Mosquera to steal the ball before the forward could even shoot. Moments later, Pau Torres wasted a free header from Douglas Luiz's corner. Luiz then volleyed straight at Jose Sa and at the other end, Mateus Mane put a free-kick just wide and Toti Gomes miscued a volley.\n\n\n\nThe pattern did not change in the second half until, moments after Emery had made a double change, Jackson Tchatchoua crossed from the right, Adam Armstrong laid the ball off and Gomes crashed it in off the bar from 15 yards. Maatsen's arrival made a difference and his rising shot forced Sa into another sharp stop and Mosquera cleared off the line from Abraham before Rodrigo sealed it in front of the South Bank."

'We have earned the right to be in a strong position (with) what we've done in the group stage, and that's it.\n\n‘And now we need to start to analyse them and find ways to be better than them (Bayer Leverkusen), to try to go through the tie.’\n\nAsked if the route ahead gives him excitement, Arteta added: ‘Yeah, we are really excited. Obviously, being in the forefront and the way the team is consistently performing gives you a lot of hope and positive thoughts about what is coming.'"

            "content": "Igor Tudor forced to abandon his plan to save Tottenham from relegation with high-energy football as interim boss realises his players are too UNFIT\n\nIgor Tudor has shelved plans to impose his full-throttle brand of football at Tottenham after realising his players are not in good enough physical shape.\n\nTudor has forged a reputation for an intense, man-to-man, high-pressing tactical style during his 13-year coaching career.\n\nIt was part of his appeal for Spurs where fans demand adventure and ambition but just a fortnight and one game into his tenure, he admits this will not be possible with the tired and depleted squad he has inherited.\n\n'Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,' said Tudor. 'They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and the physical condition of the team has dropped down. So, we need to use this period where we don't play the games to put some petrol in the engine, so the engine starts to work better.\n\n'They are fatigued and to press high you need to be fit. But all of them. If someone is not in the right shape, there is a problem because someone is coming [pressing] late. And the second thing, is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back so if you run up and don't run back it's a problem.\n\n'For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it's a big question what we can do and what we cannot.'\n\nIgor Tudor has revealed that he was shocked by his players' fitness at this point in the season\n\nTudor has surprised some Spurs players with some gruelling running sessions in training overseen by the fitness coach he brought with him Riccardo Ragnacci.\n\n'That's the only way, running,' said the Spurs interim boss. 'The pitch is a hundred yards, it's long. You need to run. There are habits. Maybe you have habits to work a bit less. Players never like runs without the ball so we put in some runs without the ball.\n\n'There is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn't like. And the best thing is that they understand this.'\n\nTudor's initial assessment is not dissimilar to predecessors Ange Postecoglou and Thomas Frank, who both concluded that the squad was neither strong nor robust enough to cope when coupled with the expectation to play adventurous, exciting football and attack four competitions.\n\nBut the urgency of these circumstances, four points above the relegation zone without a win in nine Premier League games, together with the Croatian's imposing stature and taciturn delivery gave his message the ring of a chilling wake-up call for his players.\n\n'There is some pressure here in this club,' said Tudor. 'Some players are still young. They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to solve the problems.\n\n'If you have too many of these players because of injuries who are playing together it does create some problems, but it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man.\n\n'To grow fast and say, 'Come on, I'm the guy, give me the ball, I will score' instead of just, 'What can I do, I'm just here you know'. This is the challenge for each of them. Why not say, 'Come on, I will be the guy, give me the ball, I will not cry, I will take the ball, I will defend my box'.\n\n'It's always how you see the situation. You can always see it both ways. Or 'I'm not, I'm just here and we had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play'. How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy, positive there is opportunity.'\n\nWhen asked ahead of Sunday's trip to Fulham if he thought there were enough soldiers for the fight ahead, Tudor said that he hoped and believed there were and promised not to read too far into performances in his first game, a 4-1 defeat against Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\n\n\n'If you play against the best team in the world, at this moment, for us, I need to be honest, it's not a realistic game to show we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,' he said. 'That's the truth. For long periods in the game we had problems, in defence especially. It's not easy against them. Let's see in the next games.'"

And no one looks at the circumstances, which are that the 450 is very well spent… very, very, VERY well spent, one more time: very well spent.\n\n'They are great football players which will be a big, big, big success for this club. Some already now and some in the future. The reality of this season is we sold for £300m, some starters like Trent (Alexander-Arnold) sold for only £10m.\n\n'We had to recoup the money with players. From that spend, then £250m of it (has not been used)… Alex has not been the Alex of Newcastle, maybe 20 minutes at Tottenham, I don't criticise him because we signed him for six years not six months.\n\nArne Slot has insisted Liverpool were right to splash out £450million in the summer because of the players they sold\n\n'Giorgi (Mamardashvili), we needed him because Caoimh (Kelleher) left but we hardly played with two goalkeepers. Jeremie (Frimpong) has been injured, Giovanni (Leoni) out for the season.\n\n'Tomorrow, I miss out on Florian (Wirtz, who is injured).'\n\nMeanwhile, Slot has also urged for patience with 17-year-old winger Rio Ngumoha, who has been subject to much clamour from fans and media this week after his promising cameo off the bench at Nottingham Forest last week.\n\nIt comes at the same time fellow wingers, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo, have been out of form in front of goal.\n\nSlot said: 'Let's be clear, he is a special player that will have more playing time and already has more playing time recently.\n\n'But for a player that is playing for the Under 19 team of England, if everyone thinks he is so good, then he should be in (in a higher international team).'\n\n\n\nThe Reds will be without Wirtz for the visit of West Ham but Frimpong is back in the squad after missing the last month with a groin problem."

            "content": "How Harry Maguire turned his Man United career around after Greece scandal, being booed by his OWN fans and losing the captaincy - and why the club want him to sign a new deal, writes CHRIS WHEELER\n\nTwo significant dates are marked in the calendar for Harry Maguire next week.\n\nOn Thursday, a celebration for the Manchester United and England defender’s 33rd birthday. Twenty-four hours earlier, a retrial over allegations he assaulted a police officer and of attempted bribery is scheduled to take place on the Greek island of Syros.\n\nSafe to say, he will only be turning up at one of them.\n\nIn the unlikely event that the shambolic Greek legal process functions on this occasion after no fewer than four previous postponements, Maguire isn’t even required to appear in person. He will instead be doing what he does best, anchoring United’s defence against Newcastle in the Premier League at St James’ Park.\n\nThe good times and the bad times have never been far apart during a rollercoaster career at Old Trafford that could feasibly come to an end in June, although there is growing optimism that contract talks will have a positive outcome before then.\n\nAside from the arrest in Mykonos on a family holiday in 2020, Maguire has been booed by his own fans playing for club and country, and been the target of a bomb threat. He has been dropped from the United team, stripped of the captaincy, and would have been sold in 2023 had he not rejected a £30million move to West Ham.\n\nHarry Maguire has fought his way back into a key role for Manchester United\n\nThe good times and the bad times have never been far apart during a rollercoaster career at Old Trafford that could feasibly come to an end in June\n\nThroughout it all, Maguire has kept his dignity and remained loyal to United when it didn’t always feel like the club were being loyal to him. Those who have worked with him describe the ultimate team player who puts his body on the line and faces adversity while worrying more about those around him.\n\nThere he was again at Everton on Monday, leading the defensive effort in the face of a late onslaught to earn a 1-0 win that put United back into the top four.\n\nRestoring Maguire to central defence in a 4-2-3-1 formation has been one of the key changes under Michael Carrick.\n\nAfter missing the final two months of Ruben Amorim’s tumultuous reign through injury, he returned on the bench for two games under Darren Fletcher, and has started all six of Carrick’s matches in charge.\n\nNo wonder United’s new head coach expressed hope on Friday that Maguire will stay beyond this summer, when his contract expires. United are known to be concerned about losing him at the same time as another experienced player in Casemiro.\n\n‘Harry's had a great career so far, and hopefully there's a lot more to come,’ said Carrick, who was first-team coach under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when Maguire arrived at United from Leicester in a £80m deal in 2019.\n\n‘He’s an impressive character. He has been here on the journey and the experiences that he's had, and with England as well, shows exactly what he is. I think we all know the player he is and what he's capable of doing.’\n\nWith all Maguire’s experience, is he in some of the best form of his career?\n\n‘There's a case,’ nodded Carrick. ‘I think as your career goes, when you're a young player everything's fresh and new, and you're fearless and there's not many scars there.\n\n‘You get to your peak years and you feel good, but obviously you've had a few ups and downs along the way. The experience that you've gained then makes you a better player; that sweet spot of being able to do it physically still, but using the experiences to know what's coming.\n\n‘Experience is massive, it's hard to put a price on how valuable that can be. Harry's gained an awful lot of it in different ways through this club.’\n\nIncluding interim managers and caretaker coaches, Maguire has played under seven different bosses at United. Some have valued him highly, others less so. Most of them had to rely on him at some point.\n\nLikewise the fans, although for the most part he has always had the backing of hardcore United supporters who appreciate his endeavour and a knack for late goals. His winners against Liverpool and Lyon were the stand-out moments under Amorim.\n\nMaybe not the Australian day-trippers who booed him at the Melbourne Cricket Ground when United played Crystal Palace – their opponents at Old Trafford on Sunday – on tour in 2022, and again in Perth a few days later.\n\nOr the idiot who had threatened to bomb Maguire’s home in March of that year, leading to the player moving his partner Fern and their two young daughters to a safe house while police carried out a sweep of the property and United brought in extra protection.\n\nThe so-called United boo-boys never bothered Maguire, but that wasn’t the case with his England critics.\n\nTargeted by Three Lions fans when England played Ivory Coast and Germany in 2022, he was hammered so relentlessly by Scotland supporters as he scored an own-goal at Hampden Park the following year that his mother Zoe took to social media to hit back at the ‘disgraceful’ behaviour. ‘That was a bad one for him,’ says an insider, referring to the lows of the 2022-23 season.\n\nThe so-called United boo-boys never bothered Maguire, but that wasn’t the case with his England critics\n\nNew United manager Erik ten Hag preferred Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane in central defence. The captain and mainstay under Solskjaer, Maguire only started eight Premier League games.\n\nThere was the awkwardness of coming off the bench in the Carabao Cup final against Newcastle at Wembley to then lift the trophy with Bruno Fernandes.\n\nMaguire had to publicly deny rumours of a leadership challenge from Cristiano Ronaldo before the Portugal star was pushed out of Old Trafford, but insiders say that he saw Ten Hag’s decision to hand the armband to Fernandes coming long before he was stripped of the captaincy that summer.\n\nNews broke just before a pre-season tour in which Maguire had the added indignity of being berated by goalkeeper Andre Onana on the pitch against Borussia Dortmund in Las Vegas and again booed by fans before a pre-season game against Athletic Bilbao in Dublin.\n\n‘He was very consistent in terms of his emotions,’ says one source. ‘When the younger players look at him, they must think “he’s been through so much, what have we got to complain about?”.’\n\nAll the while, the shadow of his trial in Greece continued to hang over the player and his family after he was arrested in August 2020 following a brawl. Maguire, who claimed to be defending his sister Daisy during the altercation in a bar, was handed a 21-month suspended sentence. However, the conviction was automatically quashed on appeal under Greek law and four retrials have been postponed.\n\nThe Maguire camp want to clear his name, and their legal team will be ready for court again on Wednesday, but no-one expects it to go ahead. There are doubts it will ever take place at all before the statute of limitations runs out in August 2028.\n\nMaguire is said to be very close to his family. His parents Zoe and Alan travel the world watching him. His brothers Laurence and Joe are both footballers, and Daisy works in the sports and entertainment industry.\n\nMaguire has played under seven different bosses at United. Some have valued him highly, others less so. Most of them had to rely on him at some point\n\n‘He was very consistent in terms of his emotions,’ says a source. ‘When younger players look at him, they must think “he’s been through so much, what have we got to complain about?”.’\n\nThat's one reason why Sheffield-born Maguire is said to be keen to stay in the North West and sign a new deal with United. The signs are promising.\n\nHe has been able to talk to foreign clubs since the beginning of the year, but turned down AC Milan and Brendan Rodgers’ new Saudi club Al Qadsiah in January.\n\nUnited are committed to driving down the wage bill and want to reduce his £180,000-a-week salary. But at least they are open to negotiation, which was not necessarily the case with Casemiro.\n\nAt this stage of his career, Maguire wants some security in terms of length of contract as he prepares to turn 33. ‘It’s an amazing club to play for and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could,’ he said last year.\n\nForm and fitness will be factors in United’s decision, and in that sense Maguire has a strong case.\n\nHe has outlasted his central defensive partners Varane, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans at Old Trafford. Martinez is out again after only recently returning from a long-term injury, and Matthijs De Ligt has not been available since the end of November. Youngsters Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven have had their teething troubles.\n\nThomas Tuchel has also taken note and says Maguire is in his thoughts for the World Cup. The player is desperate to go to North America after missing out on Euro 2024 through injury.\n\nHe has yet to play under Tuchel and won the last of his 64 caps in a Nations League win over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in 2024.\n\nHe has yet to play under Thomas Tuchel and won the last of his 64 caps in a Nations League win over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in 2024\n\nMaguire is still holding out hope of playing in a third World Cup for England\n\nSteve Bruce, who knows a thing or two about playing centre back at United and captaining the club, believes Maguire is worthy of a new contract and a World Cup spot.\n\n‘I believe Harry has been made the whipping boy for what was going on around him for too long,’ Bruce told Daily Mail Sport. ‘I don't think he's ever let Man United down. In fact, he's never let England down either.\n\n\n\n‘I wouldn't be surprised if he went to the World Cup and gets offered a new deal. Why wouldn't you? I think centre-halves get better with age. Over the last five or six weeks, he's given a reminder of just what he's about – if he ever needed to.’"

            "content": "England have spent this entire Twenty20 World Cup talking about playing the perfect game, yet remain firmly in the hunt to become the first country to win the tournament three times because they have learned to deal with their imperfections.\n\nThis astonishing late heist against New Zealand kept up their 100 per cent record in the Super Eight stage, meaning Harry Brook's team will, barring some extraordinary results this weekend, be heading for the second semi-final in Mumbai on ­Thursday — where the prospect of a frenzied atmosphere against co-hosts India or a replay of their group-stage meeting with West Indies, their only defeat here, awaits.\n\nMore top-order failure meant that for much of a chase of 160, it looked like they would be destined for Kolkata instead, until a seventh-wicket union between Will Jacks and the recalled Rehan Ahmed worth 44 off just 16 deliveries catapulted them to victory.\n\nIt speaks of the dysfunctional aspects of this team that Jacks, their No7 batsman and sixth bowler, has won four man-of-the-match awards in 20 days. On the balance of probabilities, their luck must run out eventually.\n\n'Yeah, you're right, because ideally I would do nothing, and I'm kind of at some stage the extra bowler and the extra batter. If I didn't bowl and didn't bat, we'd have had that perfect game that we keep speaking about,' Jacks said, following two for 23 with an unbeaten 32.\n\n'We've won six out of seven games and qualified for a semi-­final. We obviously want to play well but we're not gutted we ­haven't been perfect. What we've done well is in the key moments, we've kept a calm and clear head and managed to get those rewards.'\n\nWill Jacks starred with both bat and ball as England beat New Zealand at the T20 World Cup\n\nEngland required 42 off 17 when Ahmed, preferred to Jamie Overton because the match was contested on a used pitch, got off the mark by launching a 103-yard six off spinner Glenn Phillips, who had been reintroduced to the attack for his ability to dart the ball in from around the wicket, cramping his opponents for room.\n\nIt was almost fantasy cricket: as he left the dugout at 117 for six, all-rounder Ahmed received a walkie-talkie message from coach Brendon McCullum to bat like India great Virender Sehwag.\n\nTwo balls later, Jacks sent a skyscraper of a hit over the midwicket boundary to truly seize the momentum and with New Zealand reeling, he powerfully pierced the field for back-to-back fours.\n\nWhen Ahmed danced down the track to hit a second six from the final ball of the penultimate over, sent down by the usually parsimonious Mitchell Santner, they were on the verge of a victory set to an all too familiar template: Nepal, Scotland and Italy discomforting them until late in proceedings in the group stage.\n\nHowever, after New Zealand followed the way of Sri Lanka and Pakistan, captain Santner said of England: 'If you can get yourselves out of a tricky position to end up winning it does a lot for the team, and a lot for the confidence.\n\n'There's no better team at finding a way to win from anywhere. There's different guys stepping up at different times, which is what you want. I wouldn't want to face them, if we're in the semi-finals.'\n\nThe Kiwis face a nervous wait as defeat has presented the outside possibility of Pakistan pipping them for the last four. To do so, Pakistan must defeat Sri Lanka by a minimum of 64 runs or chase down their target in 13.1 overs in Pallekele today.\n\nIn England's favour is an extraordinary belief that they can win from anywhere, and an enviable team spirit. 'This is the era of Harry Brook as white-ball captain,' said Jacks, as if to emphasise the captain's popularity within a youthful squad.\n\nRehan Ahmed put on a more-than-useful partnership wirth Jacks to steer his side to their sixth win from seven games\n\nBut members of the old guard are an issue: the opening partnership of Jos Buttler and Phil Salt averages just 12 in the tournament, and Buttler has just 62 from seven visits to the crease.\n\nEngland have been effective at the start of bowling innings, taking 18 powerplay wickets in the tournament, before this fruitless return against Tim Seifert and Finn Allen.\n\nJofra Archer's form bodes well whichever opponents await. Here, he started with a maiden featuring a successful Seifert review for caught behind, but did not bowl out, as Brook opted to send down a record 16 overs of spin.\n\nThings will get tougher but despite being outhit by opponents, England's engine room has fired.\n\nIn addition to Jacks, who has figures in the Sri Lankan leg of 10-0-72-5, Sam Curran followed closing out the last-ball thriller versus Nepal with handy runs, and combined in a 42-run stand with Tom Banton that kept the prospect of another dramatic England win alive."

            "content": "The Last Dance: Why the penny has FINALLY dropped for Andy Farrell, how he can now BREAK Ireland's 40-year World Cup hoodoo and what the future holds for our GREATEST EVER coach post-Australia 2027...\n\nIRELAND head coach Andy Farrell is entitled to feel a degree of bemusement around the punditry and coverage of this Six Nations campaign.\n\nDespite the considerable credit he had built up over the years, there was a fair whack of criticism flung his way following the opening night hammering in France, including justifiable question marks over his long-term planning and loyalty to the old guard.\n\nBut Farrell got little credit when he then ripped up the script with his team selection to face Italy, leaving out established frontliners and rolling the dice on promising newcomers. The result was a surge of energy through the Ireland squad.\n\nA SENSE OF JEOPARDY\n\nAll of a sudden, there was a genuine sense of jeopardy, a brutal realisation that, no matter how big your reputation or how storied your career, if you do not perform to the standards expected, you are out.\n\nIcon: Andy Farrell is adored by Irish rugby supporters but the Ireland head coach was on the receiving end of heavy criticism after two games of this Six Nations Championship\n\nThis had not been the case previously on Farrell’s watch, with the general policy revolving around running the same established names almost regardless of form, an approach that persevered even after the 2023 World Cup failure.\n\nIt was a defiant change of direction, an era-altering policy shift, yet it was largely dismissed as ‘rotation’ for the perceived lesser challenge of facing the Italians at home.\n\nFor some, this correspondent included, the subsequent victory over Italy was hugely positive.\n\nYes, there were lots of errors and areas to improve in a win that could be more readily described as ‘nervy’ than ‘convincing’, but Italy are a decent side now and Ireland digging themselves out of a hole with a bunch of new faces catching the eye was a major plus.\n\nOn the front foot: Farrell did not get enough recognition for his bold selection calls against Italy\n\nOr so we thought…\n\nIt quickly became apparent that this was a minority opinion as the widespread reaction across was doom and gloom – with little recognition of what Farrell was, belatedly, trying to do in terms of widening options.\n\n‘TERMINAL DECLINE’\n\nPhrases like ‘terminal decline’ and ‘irreversible recession’ abounded after the Italy game and the general consensus was that Ireland’s efforts to extricate themselves from the deep trough they now found themselves in ‘could take years’.\n\nIt took Farrell a week.\n\nWhen he reinstated a clutch of his tried-and-trusted for the (on paper) daunting trip to Twickenham, they returned to a side re-energised by the Italy reshuffle and ruthlessly determined to prove their worth, driven by the unsettling knowledge that their places were no longer guaranteed.\n\nThe result was a performance of ferocious intensity that proved far too much for a brittle England side, still assailed with doubt after their shock Murrayfield humiliation.\n\nToo much: Ireland played with far greater intensity than England in their Twickenham win\n\nIt was a euphoric occasion for Irish rugby and, suddenly, the same heads who had been talking about the dark days being here to stay, did a 180 with frothy talk of ‘rebirth’ and ‘rejuvenation’.\n\nThere is a tendency in modern media – driven by the internet’s insatiable demand for clip-worthy reaction, and over-reaction – to get mired in the immediate.\n\nThere is also a lemming-like, ‘we are all individuals’ aspect to rugby analysis where nearly everyone dives frantically for the consensus and starts parrotting the same phrase du jour along the way.\n\nThis month it was ‘intent’ after Farrell questioned the lack of it from his players following their Paris pummelling.\n\nAs soon as he said it, the word ‘intent’ was being sprinkled excitedly across Irish rugby analysis, as though pundits had been gifted a secret sauce to use at will.\n\nEuphoria: Caelan Doris and Tadhg Beirne celebrate at the final whistle in Twickenham\n\nFarrell must be shaking his head at it all.\n\nNow, post Twickenham, the analysis has shifted to the head coach’s next career move, with stories linking Farrell to a return to his old haunt of Saracens in English rugby on a whopping €1.2million contract.\n\nThis has led to a cacophony of calls for Farrell to be handed an extended Ireland contract to keep at the helm for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnother knee-jerk, instant reaction to breaking events when it would be better to step back and assess the overall picture.\n\nTHE PENNY FINALLY DROPS\n\nFarrell’s time with Ireland has been a remarkable story of progression and success – with the obvious exception of the World Cup.\n\nAnd now, finally, it appears as though the penny has dropped and he is viewing everything through the prism of next year’s World Cup – because the rhetoric from Farrell, and his assistants, is radically different to what we have heard before.\n\nAfter the 2023 disappointment, it was ‘as we were’ with the message that the ‘journey continues’ and, while Farrell oversaw a thumping win over France in Marseille and landed a Six Nations, it all seemed a little ‘after the Lord Mayor’s show’.\n\nThis Six Nations feels a whole lot different, the right attitude seems to have been adopted (namely that this tournament is a means to a World Cup end) as Ireland continue to assess options for down the road.\n\nEven in the euphoria of the win over England last weekend, Farrell impressed hugely with his calm, bigger picture observations.\n\nMindset shift: Farrell has realised the need to look down the road and broaden his options\n\n‘I didn’t care whether we won or lost today, just whether we grew as a group because we know where we want to go,’ he said afterwards.\n\nIrish rugby has been waiting to hear those words from a head coach for 15 years.\n\nThe message, and mind shift, appears to have been embraced by everyone in camp, based on Johnny Sexton’s observations when asked about the contest for his old No 10 jersey between Jack Crowley, Sam Prendergast, Harry Byrne and Ciaran Frawley.\n\n‘All the criticism from previous World Cup cycles is that we did not develop guys and we have relied too heavily on one player in some positions,’ said Sexton, referencing the over-dependence on his own role at the 2015, 2019 and 2023 World Cups.\n\n‘So, we are doing it a different way now.’\n\nAmen to that.\n\nTHE LAST DANCE\n\nWhatever way you look at it, Farrell has been a phenomenally good coach for Ireland since coming on board as Joe Schmidt’s defensive coordinator in 2016.\n\nBy the time of the World Cup in Australia next year, the Englishman will have been 11 years working for the IRFU and living in this country, where he and his family are known to be very happily settled.\n\nHowever, every coach, no matter how talented, popular or successful they are, has a shelf life, and when his contract expires next year, it feels like a natural conclusion to this Irish rugby chapter.\n\nThe concern is that, if the IRFU were to make that decision and announce it later this year, there is the danger of Farrell becoming a ‘lame duck’ coach.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that this is what happened to Joe Schmidt in 2019 after Farrell was announced as the Kiwi’s successor a year out.\n\nThe New Zealander, who had been the most influential and transformative head coach in Irish rugby history up to that point, had difficulties selling his message in his final year as players began to gravitate towards his successor.\n\nHowever, there is less chance of that happening this time around.\n\nFor Farrell and the core of the squad he has been loyal to over the past five years, it’s ‘Last Dance’ time – the final chance to crack the World Cup code.\n\nThat incentive would be hugely motivating and more than enough to keep Farrell and the likes of Tadhg Furlong, Andrew Porter, Tadhg Beirne, Josh van der Flier, Jamison Gibson-Park and Garry Ringrose right on message through to the conclusion of Australia 2027.\n\nDown and out: Eddie O'Sullivan was given a new deal prior to the 2007 World Cup only for a highly-rated Ireland side to crash out at the pool stages with the coach gone not long after\n\nThe alternative approach, and one that has widespread support, is to hand Farrell another deal to keep him on board for yet another World Cup cycle – but Ireland have been burned this way before, most famously in 2007.\n\nThat summer, prior to the World Cup in France, the IRFU extended Eddie O’Sullivan’s contract and when the announcement was made to the squad, the story goes that, rather than the standing ovation which had been possibly expected, there was an awkward shuffling of feet and half-hearted murmurings of congratulations.\n\nIt was reflective of a bubbling desire for change, amid fringe frustration at O’Sullivan’s loyalty-driven selection policy, and when Ireland crashed horribly at that tournament, there was an enormous backlash against the contract extension and the head coach was gone within a matter of months.\n\nThere are obvious differences between the O’Sullivan landscape then and Farrell’s now – not least the English man’s focus on keeping a happy camp.\n\nBut, when you look at how a Farrell contract extension plays out, it does not make much sense.\n\nIf Ireland did manage to finally have a successful World Cup and reach a first semi-final or go further, it would be a tough mental challenge to start from scratch again on yet another four-year cycle, especially with the complication of the Lions tour to New Zealand in 2029 which Farrell is known to be keen to lead.\n\nAlternatively, if Ireland bombed out yet again at the quarter-final stage, or earlier, there would be a massive outcry for change and Farrell’s position would surely be untenable, regardless of past achievements.\n\nSuccession plan: Ronan O'Gara would be the ideal man to take over from Farrell next year\n\nFar better to take the ‘Last Dance’ approach, confirm Farrell’s departure after the World Cup, announce his replacement – ideally Ronan O’Gara – and pour everything into going out on a high.\n\nPERFECT ENDING\n\nAs for Farrell’s next move, he is not short of options. Saracens have hotly denied any approach or €1.2m contract offer but those words can be taken with a large dollop of salt – this is Sarries we are talking about, after all.\n\nEngland would also appear a highly plausible option; the RFU blazers watching Farrell’s team dismantle Steve Borthwick’s side in Twickenham last weekend would surely have been thinking how to break the bank to get the proud Englishman back on board – and few here could quibble if they did.\n\nWhatever happens, the good news for Ireland is that Farrell appears to have got his focus back in a big way following the drift post-2023.\n\nThat bodes extremely well for next year and what better way for Ireland’s greatest coach to step off the stage than by ending this 40-year World Cup hoodoo?\n\n\n\nThe perfect ending."

            "content": "Robin van Persie has hit out at the 'inappropriate' criticism of Raheem Sterling after the former Chelsea star struggled to hit the ground running on his Feyenoord debut.\n\nSterling, who joined the Dutch club earlier this month after mutually agreeing to terminate his £325,000-a-week deal at Chelsea in January, came off the bench to mark his first appearance for the team during a 2-1 win against Telstar last Sunday.\n\nHaving spent nine months in exile at Stamford Bridge without making a single appearance for Chelsea this season, Sterling was understandably rusty on his debut and faced a wave of backlash on social media.\n\nFeyenoord boss Van Persie leapt to Sterling's defence on Friday ahead of his team's clash with FC Twente on Sunday, hitting out at his critics.\n\n'If you have a little sense of context, where he comes from, what he's achieved in the past, and that he hasn't had any team training for months,' Van Persie said.\n\n'I understand that there are expectations of an absolute top player, but to criticise him like that after half an hour - his first half hour after over six months - then you really don't understand anything at all.'\n\nDespite accepting that criticism is part of being a footballer in the Netherlands, the former Manchester United forward went on to label the backlash 'inappropriate'.\n\nRobin van Persie has hit out at 'inappropriate' criticism aimed at his player Raheem Sterling\n\nThe ex-Chelsea star (right) was ruthlessly criticised after his debut for Feyenoord last Sunday\n\n'A large part was positive, but some of it was also quite Dutch. Being blunt about everything that everyone thought wasn't right,' he added.\n\n'If you're five or six weeks in and you think he's not delivering, okay, then you have a point. But to throw out such strong opinions based on his first half hour, I thought, was inappropriate.'\n\nAfter Sterling's cameo appearance last Sunday, one Instagram account called FootballPark, boasting almost 100k followers, wrote that the ex-England international looked like 'Bambi on Ice' and even suggested he should consider retiring.\n\nThe author, who was by no means the only social media account ripping into the footballer, posted: 'Raheem Sterling's debut for Feyenoord was not exactly a success story – in fact, it looked like a veritable disaster from the Dutch club's point of view.\n\n'The English winger looked like Bambi on ice. On a downward spiral since 2022, lacking motivation, and seemingly unable to play under anyone who isn't named Pep Guardiola, Sterling is well and truly into his twilight years. Is it time to hang the boots up once and for all?'\n\nSterling's former Manchester City team-mate Jack Grealish jumped in to defend the 31-year-old star online, taking issue with the post.\n\n'What a f*****g stupid Instagram post man what's wrong with you guys. Guy hasn't played or trained for so long. Ppl like u guys is what wrong with the world. Have some respect,' he wrote."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nMuch attention has been paid to the top of the NBA's Western Conference this season, and deservedly so.\n\nThe defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder started 24-1, have the league's reigning Most Valuable Player in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (he's a favorite for his second award) and are hoping to become the NBA's first repeat champion since the Golden State Warriors in 2018.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs, one of the surprise teams, are on Oklahoma City's heels in the standings. Led by third-year phenom Victor Wembanyama and second-year breakout star Stephon Castle, they have defeated the Thunder four times in five meetings this season. The Denver Nuggets, led by three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic and first-time All-Star Jamal Murray, have a championship résumé that gives them a legitimate chance at another deep playoff run.\n\nAll this has overshadowed what's going on in the Eastern Conference, where things are wide open in a way we rarely see in the NBA.\n\n\"I think there's probably six to seven of us who believe all we need is good health at the right time and we can go on a run,\" one Eastern Conference general manager, whose team is currently in the playoff picture, told ESPN. \"All of the teams in the playoffs are going to be flawed and all of them are going to have upside.\"\n\nThat much parity leads to lots of opportunity and lots of questions. The reality is when you speak with coaches, scouts and executives, there isn't a clear favorite. This may frustrate the Detroit Pistons, who have firmly held the No. 1 seed since November, but that's the prevailing sentiment.\n\nIt also means that there isn't an obvious excuse for teams with expectations if they are unable to make a deep postseason run. And when that is the case, it means change could be coming.\n\n\"There's two to three teams that are going to have some real fallout if they don't make the conference finals,\" a team president said. \"That's the case every year, I know, but there's not a lot of honeymoons going on in the East.\"\n\nWith roughly 25% of the season remaining, the four teams atop the East -- the Pistons, Boston Celtics, New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers -- and one potential spoiler, could all make noise come playoff time if things break the right way.\n\nJump to intel on:\n\nPistons | Celtics | Knicks\n\nCavaliers | The wild card\n\nIt's been a second straight remarkable season for Detroit. Two seasons ago, the Pistons lost 28 consecutive games en route to a 14-win season. Last year, they added 30 wins to that total. Now, Friday's showdown at Little Caesars Arena against the Cavaliers (7 p.m. ET, ESPN) will give the Pistons a chance to match last year's 44-win total before February ends.\n\nCade Cunningham has become a full-fledged MVP candidate. Jalen Duren bet on himself in extension negotiations in the fall and deservedly became an All-Star. J.B. Bickerstaff is firmly in the Coach of the Year conversation for a second consecutive season. And the Pistons are one of two East teams, along with Boston, that reside inside the top 10 in offensive and defensive rating, one of the typical markers to determine true championship contenders.\n\n\"I think they're really good,\" a West executive said of the Pistons. \"I think they're ahead of schedule and trying to react to that.\"\n\nWith that sort of résumé, it doesn't sound like the East is wide open. The Pistons check several boxes that come with being a true threat. So why aren't they seen that way? There are a few reasons, beginning with their lack of playoff experience and success. The franchise hasn't won a playoff series since 2008, and teams typically don't go from zero to 100 in the playoffs without experiencing setbacks along the way.\n\n'The Hoop Collective' \"The Hoop Collective\" podcast, hosted by Brian Windhorst, releases new shows every Monday, Wednesday and Friday during the NBA season.\n\n• Watch/listen to the latest episodes\n\n\"Some teams are a certain team in the regular season and then have another gear in the playoffs,\" the executive said. \"I don't know if they have another gear to get to. When everyone plays hard in the playoffs, does that get mitigated some?\n\n\"I think they're the favorites, but the gap is close.\"\n\nMonday's game against the Spurs highlighted issues that could keep Detroit from going deep into the postseason. Cunningham had arguably his worst game of the season, going 5-for-26, and Detroit's offense ground to a halt against smothering defense from Wembanyama and his teammates.\n\nThe games against San Antonio and Oklahoma City this week also highlighted another challenge, which is 3-point shooting. The Spurs and Thunder combined for 20 more 3s than Detroit in those two games. Losing the 3-point differential is a concern; the Pistons are 28th in the league in 3s per game.\n\n\"I don't trust them at all,\" a West assistant coach said. \"They have no one besides Cade to attack. You can make any of their other guys try to beat you, and they will have a hard time.\"\n\nFrom the start of training camp, Boston and coach Joe Mazzulla rejected the idea that this would be a gap year. Despite lowered expectations after losing Jayson Tatum to a torn Achilles, trading Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday and losing Al Horford in free agency, the Celtics are 38-20 and join the Thunder as the only teams inside the top seven in offensive and defensive rating (second and seventh, respectively).\n\n\"They play hard every minute of every game,\" a West scout said. \"Because if they don't play hard every minute, Joe [Mazzulla] calls time out and tells them about it. But playing hard will only get you so far. They have a talent disadvantage compared to the other top teams, at least until Tatum returns. The more talented teams usually win in the playoffs.\"\n\nplay 1:26 Stephen A.'s advice for Tatum: You're 27, what's the rush to return? Stephen A. Smith says Jayson Tatum should protect his long-term future by not rushing his return for the Boston Celtics.\n\nTatum's potential return dominates every conversation about the Celtics, but the fact that Boston has had this sort of season without their superstar forward has earned universal praise. Jaylen Brown is averaging career highs in points (29.1), rebounds (7.1) and assists (4.8) and is being endorsed for MVP by LeBron James. Mazzulla has coaxed developmental success stories throughout the roster, from starting center Neemias Queta to wings Baylor Scheierman, Jordan Walsh and rookie guard Hugo Gonzalez.\n\n\"They know exactly who they are,\" the assistant coach said. \"They have great mental toughness. They are decisive and there's no second-guessing.\"\n\nBut do they have enough to go far in the postseason, potentially returning to the Finals for the third time in six seasons without Tatum? That question is why every conversation about the Celtics eventually circles back to what they can be and how much Tatum will be a part of it.\n\n\"They're already awesome without Jayson,\" the assistant coach said, \"and you add him for 20 minutes a game, or more? They're the clear pick to me.\"\n\nLofty expectations were set last spring, when the Knicks fired coach Tom Thibodeau after reaching the conference finals for the first time in 25 years. They were then doubled down upon by owner James Dolan last month, when he stated his expectations in a rare interview with WFAN radio.\n\n\"I'd say we want to get to the Finals and we should win the Finals,\" Dolan said. \"This is sports; anything can happen. Getting to the Finals, we absolutely have to do. Winning the Finals, we should do.\"\n\nThe Knicks entered the season as co-favorites to win the East with Cleveland for a reason. This is a roster with plenty of talent, with All-Stars Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns, versatile wings OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges and Josh Hart, the league's best offensive rebounder in Mitchell Robinson and solid depth off the bench.\n\n\"The Knicks have the best team,\" a rival East head coach said. \"I don't know if they'll play their best when it matters, but they have the best roster in my opinion.\"\n\nThe Knicks are on pace to win at least 50 games for a third straight season, something that hasn't happened since Pat Riley coached New York in the 1990s. However, things have never felt settled around the Knicks all season. Towns has been openly frustrated with his offensive role since training camp. They've been plagued by inconsistency. And for criticisms of Thibodeau's intransigence, they have looked like a team lacking a clear identity for stretches in its first campaign under Mike Brown.\n\n\"The situation with Towns has got to be driving them crazy,\" an advance scout said. \"But I'll tell you what, everyone bears some blame. It's on KAT, it's on Mike [Brown], it's on Brunson. And they all need to work together to get more consistency because that's a huge key for them.\"\n\nThings completely changed a few weeks ago when the Cavaliers made the stunning decision to break up their \"Core Four,\" trading Darius Garland to the LA Clippers for James Harden, a 36-year-old former MVP and future first ballot Hall of Famer.\n\nThat move, coupled with sending De'Andre Hunter to the Sacramento Kings for Dennis Schroder and Keon Ellis a few days earlier, has given Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson more depth and versatility to work with on the roster and has suddenly turned Cleveland into the threat it was expected to be before the season. Now the team that was 17-16 and in eighth in the East in late December is two games back of Boston for second.\n\n\"Adjusting to James Harden midyear is a tough thing to ask your team to do, especially when their offense has been pretty good the last few years,\" an East executive said. \"The way Harden plays can benefit everyone on the floor, but it's an adjustment for everyone on the floor. They seem really bought in and that's a big part of the challenge.\"\n\nHarden quickly identified center Jarrett Allen and guard Sam Merrill as two players who can play off him effectively. Harden started throwing lobs to Allen almost instantly, and Merrill, who is used to working off the ball to generate space, has benefited from the gravity Harden creates, including scoring a career-high 32 points in Harden's home debut earlier this month.\n\nplay 0:43 Shams: Harden avoids surgery, plans to play through thumb fracture Shams Charania joins \"NBA Today\" to report on James Harden's right thumb fracture.\n\nHarden has also connected with forward Dean Wade, praising his ability to guard every position at 6-foot-9. Wade has had success this season guarding smaller players, including several good performances against Brunson. Atkinson has moved Wade in and out of the starting lineup all season but is leaning toward making him work in a big starting lineup as at small forward. Atkinson is also considering lineups when Wade plays center with Allen and Evan Mobley on the bench.\n\nAnd for all the changes the Cavaliers have made, they still must decide whether they'll get enough stops with Harden, Donovan Mitchell and their current crop of wings against the best competition in the playoffs.\n\n\"I'm more encouraged by this version of the Cavs than a month ago,\" the West executive said, \"but they still have a glaring weakness on the perimeter defensively. If you're banking on Max Strus and Dean Wade to be your defenders, you're still dealing with the same problem: two guards, two bigs and defensive issues. But Harden is a big upgrade for this stretch run.\"\n\nThe long shot: Philadelphia 76ers\n\nIf any team is capable of crashing the party at the top of the conference, many league insiders pointed to the 76ers, who are currently clinging to the sixth spot in the East, a half-game ahead of the Orlando Magic.\n\nBetween the combination of All-NBA guard Tyrese Maxey and former MVP center Joel Embiid, the 76ers have the top-end talent to be a significant threat in a playoff series. However, that relies heavily on their health, and there is no bigger if in the NBA than Embiid. Meanwhile, with Paul George suspended until late March, the 76ers' roster is generally lacking in size outside of Embiid's presence.\n\n\"They are the wild card to me,\" the assistant coach said. \"They could easily lose 4-0 in Round 1, but if they are healthy, Embiid and Maxey are hard matchups for any of these teams.\"\n\nThe 76ers have beaten the Celtics and Knicks twice this season but are a combined 0-5 against the Cavaliers and Pistons.\n\n\"With the firepower they have, they deserve a mention,\" the West executive said. \"Maxey is awesome and I could see in a series he gets hot and Embiid has it going and it presents a big time mismatch. That's a different element than anyone else has, and while they are a distant fifth, it's why I also can't totally rule them out.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nISAIAH STEWART HAD seen enough.\n\nFrom nearly 100 feet away and with his knees and ankles wrapped in ice, Stewart had watched from the visiting bench as Detroit Pistons teammate Jalen Duren and Charlotte Hornets big man Moussa Diabate went nose-to-nose following a hard foul under the basket.\n\nAfter a scrum developed, players and coaches from both teams seemed to ease tensions -- only for Hornets forward Miles Bridges to break away and rush toward Duren near half court. That's when Beef Stew intervened.\n\n\"JD and Stew consider themselves brothers,\" Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said that night. \"Human instinct tells him to protect his little brother. I hate it for Stew because of the things that are going to follow.\"\n\nThe scene from that Feb. 9 game inside Charlotte's Spectrum Center -- the ice melting off Stewart's frame as he raced toward the scorer's table to confront Bridges -- has become another indelible image for Detroit's 24-year-old enforcer, rim protector and the heart and soul of a surprise No. 1 seed that perhaps shouldn't be considered one any longer.\n\n\"I always knew once the wins came,\" Stewart told ESPN, \"that people were going to see I play a big part in it.\"\n\nIntimidation, blocked dunks and, yes, even altercations such as the one in Charlotte that resulted in a seven-game suspension -- he'll serve his sixth game Friday against the Cleveland Cavaliers (7 p.m. ET, ESPN) -- are all part of the Isaiah Stewart package.\n\nBut since he entered the league in 2020, the 6-foot-8 big man has become one of the NBA's most feared defenders and, as the longest-tenured Piston, a symbol of the franchise's painful road back to contention. And his game bears resemblance to a Pistons legend who once patrolled the paint in similar fashion.\n\nPistons legend Ben Wallace, left, sees plenty of similarities between his game and Isaiah Stewart's. Said one source close to Wallace: \"Ben looks at Stewart like a proud father.\" Matt Krohn-Imagn Images; Bill Baptist/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nTHE PICTURES ADORN the walls inside Detroit's Little Caesars Arena and the nearby Pistons Performance Center, not far from downtown.\n\nAnd whether it's holding one of his Defensive Player of the Year awards or cradling the Larry O'Brien trophy he helped the franchise capture in 2004, Ben Wallace's image has become part of Detroit lore.\n\nThe Hall of Famer's 17-year career can be aptly defined by his nine seasons in Detroit, where he dominated as one of the top defenders in the early 2000s. His four-time DPOY status can be matched only by fellow Hall of Famer Dikembe Mutombo and Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert.\n\nThe comparisons between Wallace and Stewart are natural, irresistible even. \"I definitely see it,\" Wallace told ESPN.\n\nBoth are underestimated, undersized big men who played well above their listed heights. Both carry a clear edge in every aspect of their games. And both happen to play large roles in turnarounds for a city uniquely equipped to appreciate them.\n\n\"He paved the way for us undersized guys,\" Stewart said. \"I'm trying to live up to that and put my name somewhere positive in this organization.\"\n\nFrom 2000-01 to 2005-06, Wallace led the NBA in rebounding twice and blocks once, averaging 12.9 rebounds, 2.8 blocks and 1.6 steals. He would routinely compare his hands to those of a boxer, saying they're \"top 10 in the world.\" Even now, he can boast his plus-minus stats.\n\nStewart knows his defensive stats and tracks how well other players around the league are doing in similar categories. Not necessarily for his ego, but to ensure he's doing everything to keep the Pistons' identity as the league's No. 2 unit intact. \"I'm the best defensive player in the league,\" Stewart said.\n\nThe numbers seem to back him. Among players with at least 150 attempts defended, Stewart leads the league with a 42.7% field goal percentage allowed at the rim. He's eighth in the league with 1.7 blocks, and he contests 9.3 shots per game, second in the league among players 6-10 or shorter, behind Anthony Davis, who has played only 20 games.\n\nAnd although you wouldn't call Stewart a floor spacer, he is one of six players with at least 75 blocks and 30 3-pointers this season. He shoots a respectable 34% from 3-point range, a must in today's league, but it's a far different paradigm than Wallace, who seldom ventured beyond the arc when he played.\n\nAfter being acquired by the Pistons in 2020, Isaiah Stewart quickly developed a reputation as a fierce defender. AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith\n\nToday, Wallace tries to stay away from the game, although he keeps a close watch. He doesn't like the basketball discourse in which previous generations routinely criticize modern stars. \"You gotta take some time away from the game and allow the game to evolve,\" he said.\n\nBut Wallace loves to watch Stewart carrying on the gritty big man tradition in Detroit. And Stewart, for his part, cherishes the example Wallace set in the early 2000s.\n\nThe big men's bond is unspoken but telling. Stewart, coming to the free throw line in the second quarter of a Jan. 15 game against the Phoenix Suns, spotted the 6-9 Wallace sitting courtside. The two made eye contact, and between deep breaths, Stewart pounded his chest twice. Wallace nodded in receipt.\n\nSeeing the respectful exchange, a source who knows Wallace well summed it up:\n\n\"Ben looks at Stewart like a proud father.\"\n\nYEARS OF FUTILITY chasing the eighth seed gave way to a full rebuild in the summer of 2020, with Detroit's then-general manager Troy Weaver selecting three first-round picks in a draft he hoped would establish a real culture. Second of those picks: Stewart at No. 16.\n\nThe beginnings were humble, and Stewart had to endure the brunt of a rebuild six years in the making. As a rookie, Stewart was slotted behind veterans Blake Griffin and Jerami Grant, and as the fourth-youngest rookie in the league, opportunities were few and far between. Stewart didn't see the court during Detroit's first two games. Wallace was a throw-in from the Grant Hill trade in 2000 after showing signs in four seasons with the Washington Wizards and Orlando Magic.\n\nBefore any real estate could be won on the floor for either, it had to be established in physical, fierce practices.\n\nBen Wallace, Hall of Famer and four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, is a Detroit basketball legend. Wallace and the Pistons upset Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal and the Lakers to win the 2004 Finals. Chris Schwegler/NBAE via Getty Images\n\n\"I didn't treat you like my teammate in practice. I treated you and looked at you like you were competition,\" Stewart said. \"If you want to duke it up, we can duke it up.\n\n\"It was nasty. Pushing guys, making guys uncomfortable, doing anything I can so I can stand out to the coaching staff so they could say, 'Man, we need to get this guy on the floor.'\"\n\nStewart and Griffin were especially competitive, with then-coach Dwane Casey calling them \"brahman bulls.\"\n\n\"I remember one day they locked up and I'm going, 'Lord have mercy, who's going to break these two up?' Going against a great player like that every day really helped develop his game, how to be physical,\" said Casey, Stewart's coach his first three seasons who is now in the Pistons' front office.\n\n\"He earned every minute he got.\"\n\nIt extended to the floor, where a reputation formed. By early that next season, it was solidified, when, after taking an inadvertent elbow to the face from Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, an enraged and bloody Stewart went after the face of the NBA. After multiple attempts, security, teammates and coaches eventually got Stewart into the locker room.\n\n\"Any grown man would've reacted, initially, the way Stew did,\" Casey said. \"The problem Stew had -- and he knows this -- was going back the second and third time.\"\n\nSome of the conversations that followed used coded language. Almost all of them felt uncomfortable. James claimed days later that it was an inadvertent hit, plus he had years of equity with the public. Stewart, then 21, had to hear the noise.\n\n\"My second year in the league, seeing how people look at me differently, calling me certain [names] and labeling me. ... That was a lot to get through at a young age,\" Stewart said. \"But I was able to weather that storm. A lot of people thought I'd be out of the league.\"\n\nplay 2:49 LeBron, Stewart ejected after LeBron swipes Stewart in the face After LeBron James elbows Isaiah Stewart in the face, both teams have to be separated multiple times. Upon review, James and Stewart are ejected.\n\nStewart was suspended two games for the incident with James, and in February 2024 he was suspended three games for punching center Drew Eubanks in the parking lot of Phoenix's Footprint Center ahead of a Pistons-Suns game. Stewart was arrested, and misdemeanor assault charges were dropped days later. (Last season, he received a two-game ban for his role in a skirmish between the Pistons and Timberwolves. In all, Stewart has been suspended five times.)\n\n\"I wouldn't say there's any regrets because I learned from every situation,\" Stewart said. \"It helped shape me. You can't be scared to go through those hard times. It may not be the [best] press.\"\n\nOn the court, his game grew as the team made marginal progress in the wake of a league-record 28-game losing streak to begin the 2023-24 season. He found silver linings in the analytics that pegged him as one of the best defensive bigs in the league.\n\n\"I'm up there with the other guys on winning teams. But I know if we don't get the win, I don't get the love, Stewart said. \"I remember how we were treated when we were down, what our peers said about us. It's a different kind of pride [now]. The tables turn every time I take the floor.\"\n\nWALLACE'S FINAL GAME was eight years before Stewart was drafted. But while the two big men come from different eras of the NBA, Wallace's simple advice for the now six-season veteran transcends generations: \"Be yourself.\"\n\n\"Since nobody around the organization or within the organization is putting that pressure on him to go out and be the next Ben Wallace, now he can go out and just relax and play basketball,\" Wallace said. \"[But] you can see the signs of why people might say that he could be the next Ben Wallace.\"\n\nOne major sign: Stewart's knack for meeting opponents at the rim.\n\nWhere players see an open lane with one body standing between himself and a highlight, Stewart sees an opportunity. For momentum. For a soul-crushing block that sparks a fast break. For a play that sends the home crowd into delirium and the road crowd into disbelief.\n\nStewart, the NBA's Defensive Player of the Month in December, has built a greatest hits compilation of blocks. He chased down Milwaukee Bucks guard Kevin Porter Jr. on a fast break on Dec. 6. He took pleasure in swatting Dallas Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg's floater in the final minute during a two-point overtime loss in Dallas on Dec. 18. He added Kawhi Leonard to the graveyard of those who've tried to flush on him, the only thing that didn't go well during Leonard's 55-point outburst on Dec. 28.\n\nHis favorite, though, came on Dec. 5, when he caught Portland Trail Blazers high-flyer Shaedon Sharpe in midair on a play that was initially called a foul but overturned by review.\n\n\"I believe in my timing and putting myself in the right position,\" Stewart said. \"What's going on in my head is slowing everything down. You gotta be able to take one, two [steps] then get ready to blast off.\"\n\nThose blocks often turn into momentum plays for the East-leading Pistons, who should no longer be catching any opponents by surprise, even if Stewart still does on the defensive end.\n\n\"When I do it, I feel it. I feel dudes' hearts being crushed,\" he said. \"I know I can get dunked on, but I don't care. Most people would try to find a way to get out of trouble...\n\n\"But I wait there. I put myself in harm's way.\"\n\nStewart knows that making such plays comes with risk. Still, it's clear how much he relishes his role -- as protector, as intimidator, as torch-carrying member of tradition, continuing on a proud past while adding his own twist. One that Detroit's legendary big man can surely appreciate.\n\n\"The physical nature, going out there and [saying], 'I'm going to protect my teammates, protect this paint,\" Wallace said.\n\n\"And if you got a problem with it, that's just on you.\""

            "content": "The Atlanta Falcons dismissed LaTroy Lewis from his role as assistant defensive line coach Friday after sexual assault allegations surfaced against him, the team announced.\n\nThe Ann Arbor Police Department confirmed Friday to ESPN that it is currently investigating allegations of sexual assault against Lewis. Spokesperson Chris Page said the Ann Arbor PD was \"just recently made aware\" of the woman's allegations, which stem from a Dec. 5, 2024, incident while Lewis was on the Michigan football staff.\n\nLewis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Paul Corliss, a spokesperson for Michigan, called the allegations \"deeply concerning.\"\n\nKaren Truszkowski, the woman's attorney, told ESPN that her client filed an incident report with the Ann Arbor PD and applied for a protective order against Lewis earlier this week.\n\nTruszkowski said her client and Lewis met on a dating app and started communicating in July 2024, while Lewis was an assistant defensive line coach at Michigan. Lewis' behavior \"became increasingly aggressive\" over text and phone calls, Truszkowski said.\n\nThe two met in person for the first time at Weber's Hotel in Ann Arbor in December 2024, where Truszkowski said Lewis was supposed to give back goods her client had given him. According to the attorney, Lewis raped and battered her client at the hotel.\n\nThe woman informed then-Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore, whom she knew personally, about the incident, according to her attorney. But Moore did not report Lewis and \"weaponized\" the incident against the woman, Truszkowski said, including sending her lewd and sexually charged text messages.\n\nMoore's attorney, Ellen Michaels, denied the allegations in a statement to ESPN.\n\n\"Sherrone Moore did not fail to report misconduct, did not reward wrongdoing and did not harass anyone,\" she said. \"These claims are false.\"\n\nIn January 2025, officers from the Milford Police Department, north of Ann Arbor, responded to a call to the woman's home after neighbors heard raised voices, according to the incident report obtained by ESPN. Both Lewis and the woman told officers at the time that they had gotten into a verbal argument that was not physical, according to the report.\n\nThe woman told police that Lewis was a coach at Michigan and \"stated that she didn't want to talk about it,\" according to the incident report. No charges were filed.\n\nTruszkowski said that Lewis physically abused her client during that incident but that she was too afraid to tell police at the time.\n\nThe allegations against Lewis were first reported Thursday night by Darko State Media. The Falcons hired Lewis on Feb. 10 after coaching stints at Michigan, Toledo and UConn. He played defensive line at Tennessee and spent three seasons in the NFL.\n\nMichigan fired Moore on Dec. 10, 2025, for an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. He was then arrested on charges related to stalking and illegally entering the staff member's home, and he is awaiting trial.\n\nIn his statement, Corliss referred to Michigan's ongoing review of Moore's conduct and the culture of its athletic department and encouraged anyone with information to come forward.\n\nThe allegations against Lewis emerged less than three weeks after Falcons player James Pearce Jr. was arrested in Florida. The linebacker is facing five felony charges stemming from an alleged incident on Feb. 7 where he crashed his vehicle into a car driven by his ex-girlfriend, WNBA player Rickea Jackson, and struck a police officer with his vehicle, setting off a chase."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe NFL Players Association executive committee has narrowed its search for a permanent executive director to a group of finalists, including interim executive director David White and former union chief strategy officer JC Tretter, according to four sources briefed on the process.\n\nAlso among the finalists is American Conference commissioner Tim Pernetti, the sources said. The union's 32 player representatives will vote on the finalists at the annual NFLPA meeting in San Diego next month.\n\nIn a statement to ESPN, NFLPA president Jalen Reeves-Maybin said the executive committee is \"conducting a comprehensive search that includes a strong pool of highly qualified candidates. Out of respect for the integrity of the process and those involved, we will not comment on or disclose individual names.\"\n\nWhite, Tretter and Pernetti did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nThe NFLPA has been searching for a permanent leader since July, when then-executive director Lloyd Howell resigned following ESPN reporting that he had charged a pair of strip club visits to the union. ESPN also reported that he worked part time for the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that is seeking minority ownership in NFL franchises, and that the union and league had struck a confidentiality agreement to keep an arbitrator's rulings about possible collusion by NFL owners from players.\n\nIn August, the union elected White as its interim executive director. White is the former CEO of 3CG Ventures, an executive coaching and strategic firm, and a former board chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. He has extensive labor experience, having served as the leader of the SAG-AFTRA union, with 160,000 members who work in the entertainment industry, from 2009 to 2021. White was also a finalist when Howell was elected in 2023.\n\nWhile serving in the interim role, White has said union membership has \"no appetite\" for an 18th regular-season game, which NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has publicly contemplated.\n\nTretter, who served as the NFLPA's chief strategy officer under Howell, also resigned from his position in the wake of ESPN's reporting last year. Tretter is a retired Cleveland Browns offensive lineman who served as the player president from 2020 to 2024. He was reportedly a candidate to serve as interim executive director after Howell's resignation, but pulled his name from consideration when he stepped down.\n\nTretter led the 16-month search process that resulted in Howell's election in 2023 and presided over a vote that changed the NFLPA's constitution to make the search and election process more confidential. Last year, he told ESPN he made confidentiality a priority because candidates' names had leaked to the media in past elections.\n\nThe names of the finalists for this election are known to the executive committee and the finalists themselves, and confidentiality again has been a priority, other sources familiar with the process have told ESPN. Two player reps who spoke to ESPN this week said the executive committee hadn't yet told them who the finalists are.\n\nWhen he resigned, Tretter told CBS Sports that he denied having access to the collusion grievance or having any involvement in the confidentiality agreement that Howell struck with the league.\n\nPernetti has been the American Conference commissioner since June 2024. He was previously the president of Florida's IMG Academy, an athletic powerhouse high school that produces some of the top football recruits in the country. He has also held leadership roles at sports and entertainment company Endeavor and with Major League Soccer.\n\nOther candidates for the executive director role included Domonique Foxworth, a former player and an ESPN commentator who was the NFLPA president from 2012 to 2014; Matt Schaub, a former player rep who was a candidate in 2023; and Jeff Saturday, also a former player and an ESPN commentator, according to three other sources familiar with the process.\n\nSchaub did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Saturday confirmed to ESPN that he interviewed for the role with the firm the union hired to run the search but not with the executive committee. Foxworth also said he was interviewed by the firm but not by the executive committee.\n\n\"I'm extremely disappointed,\" Foxworth said. \"I hope they get it right this time.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Quarterback Diego Pavia wasn't fazed by criticism at Vanderbilt, and it doesn't appear that's going to change now that he's on the NFL's doorstep.\n\nThe NFL draft prospect hasn't toned things down during the NFL combine, where he said he'll throw for scouts on Saturday.\n\n\"One thing about me is I don't care what people think about me,\" said Pavia, who led the Commodores to a 10-3 record, the first 10-win season in school history.\n\nCriticism of him, he said, is the product of the media generating what he described as \"clickbait.\"\n\nBut Pavia certainly became a polarizing figure in 2025, in part because of his exuberance and in part because of his reaction to the Heisman Trophy balloting. The Heisman runner-up had to issue an apology after posting a message that included \"F-All THE VOTERS\" on social media.\n\nBut Pavia said his demeanor and approach are what made him a good leader at Vanderbilt. And his confidence, he said, comes from being constantly counted out in life, including when he started his career in junior college.\n\nThat has turned out to be a credit to him in his quest to make it in the NFL, he said.\n\n\"I feel like a lot of teams love the tenacity, the fight,\" he said. \"The life of an underdog, that's for sure. And, so, they ask questions. But you go back, you look at my record, ain't nothing on my record.\"\n\nHe added, \"I just want everyone to know what's true about me is I'm humble and I get my confidence from my process. And if you saw how much I put into this, you would see where I get my confidence.\"\n\nAnother thing NFL teams will need to weigh is Pavia's lack of size. He measures under 5-foot-10, a big detriment at the position in the NFL. But playing at that size against elite competition is nothing new, he said.\n\n\"I would just say turn on the tape,\" Pavia said. \"It's not like we're not playing these guys that are going first-round, second-round [picks] on Saturdays in the SEC. So, the SEC and the Big Ten probably have the most guys getting drafted in the first, second round. So, we're playing those guys and ain't nothing going to change.\""

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

Government remains committed to supporting private enterprises to grow and create sustainable jobs.\"\n\nHe stressed that waste management companies play an important role in safeguarding public health while simultaneously providing large-scale employment opportunities.\n\nHighlighting the government's proposed 24-hour economy policy, the Minister indicated that companies capable of sustaining continuous operations would receive strategic attention and support.\n\n\"The government is committed to creating value and supporting private businesses, especially under the 24-hour economy framework.\n\n\"Zoomlion is a strong example of the type of organisation we are looking to support, and this visit helps us better appreciate the scale of their work,\" he noted.\n\nAccording to him, initiatives that prioritise worker safety, environmental sustainability, and employment generation align directly with the government's economic transformation agenda.\n\n\"We are not pushing people to rush into waste management, but we will provide incentives for those willing to invest in the sector. Zoomlion is doing remarkable work and has enormous potential,\" he added.\n\nThe Minister further disclosed that the company's nationwide presence through numerous subsidiaries and operational facilities has contributed significantly to youth employment, noting that approximately 200,000 Ghanaians have benefited from opportunities created across the sanitation value chain.\n\nHe emphasised that facilities such as ACARP could benefit substantially from policies aimed at boosting productivity through round-the-clock operations.\n\n\"We are pursuing a reset agenda while supporting the 24-hour economy to function effectively. Organisations such as Zoomlion represent areas where government support can have a significant national impact,\" he said.\n\nThe Chief Operating Officer of the Environment and Sanitation Cluster of the Jospong Group of Companies, Mrs Florence Larbi, highlighted the company's transformation over the past two decades.\n\nShe explained that Zoomlion has evolved from basic waste collection into a comprehensive waste value-chain operator covering collection, storage, transfer, recycling, and treatment services.\n\nWith 36 waste treatment facilities across Ghana, including medical, liquid, and solid waste processing plants, the company now provides sanitation services to households and institutions nationwide.\n\n\"We have come a long way, and today we are proud to serve almost every household in Ghana,\" she said.\n\nShe added that the company remains well-positioned to support large-scale national sanitation initiatives, including youth employment programmes.\n\nThe Managing Director of Zoomlion Ghana Limited, Mrs. Doris Kweikwor Adjei, expressed appreciation to the Minister and his delegation, describing the visit as a strong affirmation of collaboration between government and the private sector.\n\n\"Your visit reinforces that labour is not only about policy discussions but about people, dignity, and the employment opportunities created for Ghanaians,\" she said.\n\nShe assured the delegation of the company's continued commitment to building a disciplined and motivated workforce capable of contributing meaningfully to Ghana's economic growth.\n\n\"We will not only clean Ghana but also continue to develop a workforce that supports national productivity and development,\" she added.\n\nOther management members of the Jospong Group present included Executive Director of the Environment and Sanitation Cluster, Mrs. Gloria Opoku Anti; Chief Corporate Communications Officer, Ms. Sophia Kudjordji; General Manager of ACARP, Mr. Paddy Tuwor; Director of Communications and Corporate Affairs, Ms. Emma Adwoa Appiah Osei-Duah; and Public Relations Manager, Mr. Ernest Morgan Acquah, among others.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Chief Executive of the Ghana Tourism Authority, Maame Efua Houadjeto, has held high-level talks with Edmond Moukala, Head of Office and UNESCO Representative to Ghana, aimed at strengthening collaboration on culture, education and Artificial Intelligence to advance the country’s tourism sector.\n\nThe strategic meeting, held at the UNESCO Office in Accra, focused on enhancing institutional cooperation in promoting culture and education, while exploring how Artificial Intelligence can be harnessed to boost Ghana’s tourism development and global competitiveness.\n\nDiscussions centred on practical measures to deepen cooperation between the GTA and UNESCO in safeguarding Ghana’s cultural heritage and positioning it as a viable economic asset. Both institutions acknowledged culture as one of Ghana’s most potent soft power tools and a strategic pillar for inclusive growth.\n\nSpeaking during the engagement, the CEO of the GTA, Maame Efua Houadjeto, underscored the importance of synergy:\n\n“Tourism and culture are inseparable.\n\nGhana’s heritage is not just a memory of the past; it is a powerful economic engine for the future.\n\nStrengthening our collaboration with UNESCO allows us to harness culture, education, and innovation—particularly AI—to drive sustainable tourism growth.”\n\nShe said integrating AI into destination marketing, visitor experience management, data analytics and digital storytelling would position Ghana strongly in an increasingly competitive global tourism landscape.\n\nIn his remarks, Edmond Moukala highlighted UNESCO’s commitment to supporting member states in advancing education, science, culture and communication for sustainable development.\n\nEstablished in 1945, UNESCO works globally to safeguard cultural and natural heritage, promote quality education, foster scientific cooperation and encourage intercultural dialogue. Through initiatives such as the World Heritage Programme and Education for Sustainable Development frameworks, the organisation supports countries in translating heritage preservation into socio-economic gains.\n\nMr Moukala noted:\n\n“Ghana has immense cultural capital. The opportunity lies in connecting heritage, education, and emerging technologies to create sustainable value. UNESCO stands ready to support Ghana in protecting its heritage while embracing innovation to enhance tourism management and knowledge sharing.”\n\nThe discussions also covered youth engagement, digital documentation of heritage assets, curriculum integration to build tourism awareness and sustainable site management approaches aligned with global standards.\n\nAt the close of the engagement, Mr Moukala presented a copy of the book titled World Heritage for Sustainable Development in Africa to the GTA CEO as a symbolic gesture reflecting a shared commitment to ensuring Africa’s heritage becomes a foundation for sustainable economic transformation.\n\nThe CEO was accompanied by the Deputy CEO in charge of General Services, Ben Anane Nsiah; the Deputy CEO in charge of Operations, Ekow Sampson; and the Director of Corporate Affairs, Bright Asempa Tsadidey.\n\nTheir presence underscored the strategic importance the Authority attaches to partnerships that elevate Ghana’s cultural and tourism agenda on the global stage.\n\nThe engagement reaffirmed the Ghana Tourism Authority’s commitment to building strong international collaborations that leverage culture, education and innovation as drivers of national development. As Ghana strengthens its position as a leading tourism destination in Africa, partnerships with institutions such as UNESCO remain crucial in converting heritage into measurable economic and social impact.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) in the Ashanti Region has announced the restoration of full power capacity and improved voltage levels following the resolution of a major technical setback caused by infrastructure theft.\n\nAt least eight high-tension towers collapsed after being tampered with by unidentified criminals who removed bolts, nuts, and bases from the galvanised steel structures, forcing the pylons, vital lines connecting the Anwomaso Bulk Supply Point (BSP) to the Akyawkrom Substation, to topple.\n\nECG had to channel multiple feeders through a single source, characterised by chronic low voltage for thousands of customers, frequent power outages due to system overloads, and reduced operational flexibility for the technical team.\n\nSeveral communities in the Ashanti region on March 18, 2024, experienced several hours of power outages.\n\nThe development forced the Electricity Company of Ghana to launch immediate investigations.\n\nAt least eight towers, stretching several kilometres, had fallen onto the ground after some miscreants removed bolts, nuts, and the base.\n\nThe high-tension towers were transmitting power from Anwomaso Bulk Supply Point to the Akyawkrom Substation near Ejisu.\n\nBekwai, Anwiankwanta, Kumawu, Antoakrom, Manso Nkwanta, Jacobu, and Samfo-Aduam were some of the affected areas.\n\nOthers included Kumawu, Ejisu, Nsuta, Effiduase, and their environs.\n\nEngineers of ECG busily working to complete the construction of the 8 high-tension towers\n\nThe completion of the construction works on Wednesday, February 25, 2026 also coincided with a planned maintenance by ECG, which saw all customers on the broken towers restored to their normal positions.\n\nThis means residents and businesses in several districts within the Ashanti Region can now heave a sigh of relief.\n\nDaniel Mensah-Asare is the General Manager of the Ashanti East Region of Electricity Company of Ghana. He is elated ECG has restored the towers.\n\n“We have worked very tirelessly to resolve the problem. The problem occurred around the 18th of March 2024, exactly. So, as a result of the problem, it has created a situation where we have to manage to feed a lot of feeders through one source.\n\nAnd today as I speak, I am happy and on behalf of the entire ECG Ashanti Region, we want to say that we have resolved that problem and we have restored the stolen pylons and has restored power supply.”\n\nAccording to him, the construction of the eight-high tension towers mean a lot to ECG.\n\n“What has happened today is going to enable us to improve the voltage that we supply to our customers. It's going to minimise outage and as well give us what we call the flexibility in our operations.”\n\nIng. Mensah-Asare has been explaining to JoyNews what the restoration means to ECG and its customers.\n\n“From today, we can see that customers around this area and its environs and all those places who were experiencing some form of low voltage as a result of the incident that occurred on the 18th of March 2024. Today we have solved their problem and their voltages are going to improve.\n\n\"When we say low voltage, that's when you are not getting enough of power; the voltage that you require for a fridge or light or anything to work effectively. Comparing it to water, voltage is like the pressure that makes the water to flow. So the voltage was low.\n\n\"So most of our customers often say it is low current. So most of our customers who do not often see it low current, so the fridges are going to work better the air conditions are going to work better, the fans are going to turn better and every electrical gadget they are going to use in those areas is going to function or perform better.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ing. Mensah-Asare has commended residents in the Ashanti region for their patience as ECG worked on this capital-intensive project.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Assurances in Parliament that reforms and digital coordination will end emergency care refusals stand in sharp contrast to persistent reports of patients dying in corridors or being redirected across facilities.\n\nIs this a resource crisis, a coordination breakdown, or a question of professional conduct? And beyond promises, what measurable change is underway to guarantee that emergency care is truly non-negotiable?\n\nIn the power sector, public trust is under pressure as households report rapid depletion of prepaid electricity credits.\n\nThe regulator has ordered urgent explanations from the Electricity Company of Ghana, while investigations seek to determine whether the problem stems from tariff adjustments, technical faults, or deeper systemic lapses.\n\nConsumers want clarity, and potentially compensation. Will the probe deliver answers within days, and could the outcome reshape billing transparency and regulatory enforcement?\n\nAt the heart of the rural economy, tensions deepen over cocoa sector governance and pricing stress. As financial pressures mount and farmers raise alarms about hardship, calls are growing for accountability reviews involving the Office of the Special Prosecutor and the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice.\n\nAre these petitions grounded in evidence of conflict of interest, or are they political theatre in a moment of sector vulnerability? And what does this dispute mean for confidence in agricultural leadership during crisis?\n\nSecurity and social order also come under scrutiny amid rising concerns about school-related indiscipline and broader enforcement gaps affecting communities and local commerce. As incidents fuel anxiety about safety and governance capacity, the question becomes unavoidable: how does the state restore deterrence, discipline and public confidence without undermining rights and trust?\n\nAnd overarching all these concerns lies one defining question: Does the State of the Nation Address meaningfully confront these lived realities, or are citizens still waiting for policy to meet practice?\n\nJoin Samson Lardy Anyenini this Saturday at 9 a.m. on the JoyNews channels, on digital satellite channels 421 on DSTV and 144 on GoTV, and streams on JoyNews’ Facebook or YouTube channels on Saturdays from 8 am to noon and MyJoyOnline for a rigorous, solutions-focused national conversation.\n\nViewers can also follow the discussion by tuning in to Joy 99.7 FM or Luv 99.5 FM on the radio or stream the discussion live on either Google or Apple Podcasts.\n\nNewsfile is your most authoritative news analysis programme.\n\nIf it’s Saturday… it’s Newsfile.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Prof Hamidatu Saaka Darimani, revealed that for the first time in the institution's history, the university has admitted 17 differently-abled students into various academic programs.\n\nIn a major step toward inclusive higher education, the educational expenses for all 17 students will be fully absorbed under the free tertiary and persons with disabilities policy.\n\nThe university experienced a massive influx of interest this academic year, receiving a total of 2,575 applications. Out of that applicant pool, 1,967 candidates were offered admission.\n\nBreakdown the admissions data, the university admitted:\n\n768 students into Higher National Diploma (HND) programs.\n\n665 students into BTech/MSc programs.\n\n487 students into BTech/BSc programs.\n\n35 students into postgraduate programs.\n\nAddressing the economic hurdles of tertiary education, the Vice-Chancellor noted that 906 of the newly admitted Level 100 students have already successfully enrolled under the government's \"no fees stress policy,\" with others still undergoing documentation scrutiny.\n\nTo accommodate this 17% surge in the student population and ease the burden of off-campus housing, the university has commenced the construction of a 400-bed hostel facility aimed at providing a safe, conducive on-campus residential environment.\n\nOther major campus upgrades are currently underway to support the growing student body.\n\nThe vice chancellor highlighted the ongoing construction of the main entrance and access roads, the installation of solar street lights to boost campus security, and the outfitting of state-of-the-art laboratories to strengthen practical, industry-relevant training.\n\nIn a major demonstration of this commitment to practical skills, the matriculation ceremony was followed by the official commissioning of a state-of-the-art Cosmetology Laboratory.\n\nThe facility stands as the first of its kind in the entire region, specifically established to create direct employment pathways and equip students with high-level cosmetic science and practical skills.\n\nThe cosmetology department, currently operating with three staff members, is designed to offer specialised BTech and certificate courses. University management indicated that intensive recruitment efforts are underway to secure additional cosmetology faculty, allowing for the full enrollment of students into the program by the start of the next academic year.\n\nBeyond student training, the laboratory has been outfitted to offer premium, first-class cosmetology services to the general public, serving as both an educational hub and a revenue-generating enterprise for the university.\n\nClosing the ceremony, university management issued a stern warning regarding campus discipline and the student code of conduct.\n\nStressing that \"ignorance of these regulations would not be accepted as an excuse,” Prof Hamidatu urged matriculants to familiarise themselves with the rules and prioritise moral character alongside their studies.\n\n\"Remember that character and competence must go hand in hand,\" the Vice-Chancellor stated, reminding the students that \"academic excellence without integrity is incomplete\"\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

He is a good guy. It affects you in ways that shouldn't exist.

We have spoken about it as a group to make sure we get around him and support him as well.\"\n\n\n\nSunderland's English winger Mundle, 22, was also targeted following his substitute appearance in Sunday's 3-1 home defeat by Fulham.\n\n\n\n\"What happened to Romaine is unacceptable - we stand with him,\" said Le Bris.\n\n\n\n\"There is no room for racism or abuse in football or anywhere else.

            "content": "Business News of Friday, 27 February 2026\n\nSource: bbc.com\n\nNetflix has backed away from its proposal to buy Warner Bros Discovery, clearing the way for Paramount Skydance to win a months-long battle for one of Hollywood's most storied studios in a deal worth around $111bn (£82.2bn).\n\n\n\nWarner Bros, which put itself up for sale last year, on Thursday said Paramount's latest bid was \"superior\" to the one from Netflix, which in turn refused to raise its offer.\n\n\n\nNetflix executives say they have declined to match Paramount's bid as \"the deal is no longer financially attractive\" at that price.\n\n\n\nThe buyer would gain control of the iconic studio along with its films and media networks - a takeover that could significantly reshape the media landscape.\n\n\n\nLast December, Warner Bros agreed to a takeover offer from Netflix for some of its assets, in a deal worth roughly $82bn (£61bn) including debt.\n\n\n\nParamount then made a rival proposal, which was rebuffed by Warner Bros, but an increased offer was made earlier this week, boosted by $1 per share.\n\n\n\n\"The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,\" Netflix co-chief executives Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement. \"However, we've always been disciplined.\"\n\n\n\n\"This transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price,\" the Netflix executives added.\n\n\n\nThe announcement came just hours after Sarandos had visited the White House on Thursday.\n\n\n\nIt caps off a dramatic months-long saga that - if approved by regulators - is likely to reshape Hollywood.\n\n\n\nBut California Attorney General Rob Bonta said later on Thursday that the potential merger \"is not a done deal\".\n\n\n\n\"These two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny - the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review,\" he wrote in a social media post.\n\n\n\nBonta had said earlier this month that his office would review any deal involving Warner Bros as the entertainment industry represents a \"critical sector\" for California's economy.\n\n\n\nParamount would also need approval from the US Department of Justice as well as European regulators.\n\n\n\nA deal between Paramount and Warner Bros could hold serious ramifications for the future of one of the US's biggest news brands - CNN. Warner Bros is the network's parent company.\n\n\n\nParamount, which is looking to transform itself into a Hollywood heavyweight, is backed by tech billionaire Larry Ellison and led by his son David.\n\n\n\nThe funding of Paramount's offer has drawn scrutiny, in part over the close ties between US President Donald Trump and Larry Ellison, a major Republican donor.\n\n\n\nTrump has frequently attacked the news network over its reporting of his policies. He said in December that he believed CNN should be sold as part of any Warner Bros deal. He called the people running CNN \"corrupt or incompetent\" and said they should not be entrusted to run the network.\n\n\n\nCNN head Mark Thompson sent an email to employees as news spread of the all-but-assured Paramount deal, telling workers to not \"jump to conclusions about the future until we know more\", US media reported.\n\n\n\nThe BBC has contacted CNN for comment.\n\n\n\nParamount's initial hostile bid was also supported by Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner through his investment firm, raising concerns about the president's influence over the deal.\n\n\n\nKushner's firm, Affinity Partners, backed away in December amid scrutiny over the deal.\n\n\n\nParamount's 2025 merger with Skydance also led to scrutiny amid negotiations with the Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission, which had to sign off on the deal.\n\n\n\nAmong the concessions made was Paramount's $16m settlement on behalf of CBS News. Trump had sued the network over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former vice president Kamala Harris, claiming that the network had engaged in election interference in the way the program was edited.\n\n\n\nThe two studios' merger later resulted in leadership shakeups and layoffs at CBS News.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, chief executive David Ellison welcomed the Warner Bros board's decision in favour of Paramount's sweetened offer. The proposal, he said in a statement, offers Warner Bros shareholders \"superior value, certainty and speed to closing\".\n\n\n\nIf Paramount's deal is approved by regulators, the company would fold Warner Bros' HBO Max streaming customers into its portfolio. It would also take ownership of CNN, the Food Network and a range of sports offerings.\n\n\n\nParamount's traditional networks already include brands such as Nickelodeon, CBS and Comedy Central.\n\n\n\nMany in Hollywood have viewed the bidding war between Netflix and Paramount as a battle with no good winner.\n\n\n\nCritics of a deal with Netflix voiced concern that the storied movie studio would be lost to the Silicon Valley streaming titan, paving the way for the depletion of cinema. But a merger with Paramount, which has touted itself among the last standing movie studios in Hollywood, also left critics unnerved over the company's perceived political connections to the Trump administration - a concern that has also riled the media landscape over the future of CNN.\n\n\n\nAcross the board, the selling of Warner Bros will have massive ramifications across Tinsel town, with all but assured cuts to staff in a city that has been marred by continued production cuts.\n\n\n\nIn December, Warner Bros said it had agreed to sell its film and streaming divisions, including HBO, to Netflix in a deal worth $27.75 per share or roughly $82bn (£61bn), including debt.\n\n\n\nWarner Bros said it would spin off the remainder of its business, including traditional television networks and the news channel CNN, as an independent company.\n\n\n\nBut in a last-ditch push, Paramount this week agreed to pay more for a Warner Bros takeover. The company offered $31 per share in cash, up from $30 per share, to take over the entire company.\n\n\n\nIt also agreed to pay $7bn should the deal fall through and cover the $2.8bn fee Warner Bros had agreed to pay Netflix in the event of a break-up of the merger plan."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "The Taliban said their leaders are willing to negotiate with Pakistan as both sides claim to inflict heavy losses on their opponents in fighting.\n\nAfghanistan’s Taliban leaders said they were willing to negotiate after Pakistan bombed a number of major cities, with Islamabad’s defence minister declaring the neighbours in “open war”, following months of tensions and tit-for-tat clashes.\n\nPakistan struck the Afghan capital Kabul and the city of Kandahar, where Taliban leaders are based, as well as other towns, on Friday, with fighting also continuing along the border. Both sides have reported heavy losses.\n\nPakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif declared an “all-out confrontation” with the Taliban government, posting on X: “Now it is open war between us and you.”\n\nAfghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the Taliban’s leaders were ready to negotiate with Pakistan in order to bring an end to the violence.\n\n“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has always tried to resolve issues through dialogue, and now also we want to resolve this matter through dialogue,” said Mujahid.\n\nThe latest violence erupted after Pakistan’s air strikes on Afghan territory last weekend triggered Afghan retaliatory attacks along the border on Thursday, escalating long‑simmering tensions over Pakistan’s claim that Afghanistan shelters Pakistan Taliban fighters. Afghanistan denies this.\n\nMujahid said Pakistani strikes hit parts of Kabul, Kandahar and Paktia on Thursday night, and on Paktia, Paktika, Khost and Laghman on Friday.\n\nThat followed Afghan drone strikes that began late on Thursday on Pakistani military positions and installations in northwest Pakistan along their shared border.\n\n\n\nPakistan’s army spokesperson, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said Pakistani air and ground operations had killed at least 274 members of the Afghan forces and affiliated fighters, and wounded more than 400 others, while 12 Pakistani soldiers were killed and 27 others were wounded. One Pakistani soldier was missing in action.\n\nMujahid rejected the claims of a high number of Afghan casualties as “false”. He said that 55 Pakistani soldiers were killed, with the bodies of 23 of them taken to Afghanistan. He also said “many” Pakistani soldiers were captured. Thirteen Afghan soldiers had been killed, he said, and another 22 wounded, while 13 civilians were also wounded.\n\nLater on Friday, the Afghan government said that 19 civilians were killed and 26 others injured when Pakistan struck the provinces of Khost and Paktika in southeastern Afghanistan.\n\nCasualty claims from both sides have not been independently verified by Al Jazeera.\n\nRelations plunged\n\nThe operation was Pakistan’s most widespread bombardment of the Afghan capital and its first air strikes on the southern power base of the Taliban authorities since they returned to power in 2021.\n\nAbdul Sayed, a Sweden-based analyst on conflict in Afghanistan and Pakistan, says domestic factors in Pakistan constitute a significant constraint on its ability to initiate a full-scale war against Afghanistan.\n\n“This limitation stems from the deep ties between the populations of both countries, particularly the tribes residing on either side of the Durand Line,” a 2,575-kilometre (1,600-mile) frontier that is internationally recognised as Pakistan’s border but which Afghanistan does not recognise as legitimate.\n\n“Consequently, despite its substantial military capabilities, Pakistan cannot sustain the large-scale bloodshed that an armed conflict with Afghanistan would entail,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nRelations between the neighbours have plunged in recent months, with land border crossings largely shut since deadly fighting in October that killed more than 70 people on both sides.\n\nSeveral rounds of negotiations between Islamabad and Kabul followed an initial ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkiye, but the efforts have failed to produce a lasting agreement.\n\nAfter repeated breaches of the initial truce, Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply concerned by the escalation of violence” between Afghanistan and Pakistan and the impact that is having on civilian populations, his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told a news briefing. Russia, Iran and Iraq are among the countries that have called for an immediate end to the fighting."

It also accused authorities of entering a private storage site without notice and ignoring requests to safeguard sensitive corporate data.\n\nPanama Ports Company has been under increased scrutiny following US President Donald Trump’s claims that China was asserting too much influence over the arterial trade canal, which connects the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic.\n\nPanama’s government has robustly denied Chinese control of the waterway.\n\nBut last month, the country’s Supreme Court annulled deals that gave the Panama Ports Company control over two canal ports. The court ruled that the concessions provided to the company were unconstitutional.\n\nChina has alleged that the court case was a reaction to “hegemonic” pressure.\n\nIt condemned Panama’s seizure of the ports as well as its decision to temporarily tap the Danish Maersk company and Switzerland-based MSC to run the ports until a new agreement is reached.\n\nPanama’s President Jose Raul Mulino, meanwhile, warned China to “be careful” in its manoeuvring.\n\n\n\n“They need us more than we need them,” he said.\n\nThe two ports in question, the Balboa Port on the Pacific Ocean side and the Cristobal Port at the Atlantic end, handle about 39 percent of all of Panama’s container traffic.\n\nThe ports are located at the entrances of the Panama Canal, but they do not fall under the supervision of the autonomous Panama Canal Authority that operates the waterway.\n\nPrior to taking office, Trump repeatedly said he wanted to take control of the Panama Canal, claiming that the US was being “ripped off” by its toll prices.\n\nThe canal had previously been controlled by the US, but it was handed over to Panama in 1999 under a 1977 treaty signed by then-President Jimmy Carter.\n\nPrior to Friday’s raid, CK Hutchison had agreed to a $23bn sale of dozens of ports worldwide, including the Panamanian terminals, to a consortium led by the US multinational BlackRock and the Mediterranean Shipping Company.\n\nThe deal, which has faced repeated delays, has been criticised by Beijing but welcomed by Trump."

            "content": "The Republican president, who has sought to expand US influence across Latin America, said of Cuba: ‘They want our help.’\n\nPresident Donald Trump has suggested the United States could take over Cuba, but on amicable terms.\n\nThe statement on Friday came as Trump was preparing to board his presidential helicopter, Marine One, on the White House lawn en route to Texas.\n\nApproaching the media scrum, Trump took questions about the tense relations the US has with countries like Iran and Cuba, two countries where he has suggested he would like to see new governments.\n\nIn Cuba’s case, Trump suggested a transition that would be “very positive for the people who were expelled or worse”.\n\n“The Cuban government is talking with us, and they’re in a big deal of trouble, as you know. They have no money. They have no anything right now, but they’re talking with us,” Trump told reporters.\n\n“And maybe we’ll have a friendly takeover of Cuba. We could very well end up having a friendly takeover of Cuba.”\n\nTrump has been pushing for regime change on the communist-led Caribbean island over the last two months, using economic and diplomatic pressure.\n\nIn Friday’s remarks, Trump reiterated his stance that Cuba is “a failing nation” teetering on collapse.\n\n“Since I’m a little boy, I’ve been hearing about Cuba, and everybody wanted to change, and I can see that happening,” Trump said.\n\nHe added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Cuban American known for his hawkish stance, is leading the initiative.\n\n“Marco Rubio is dealing on it and at a very high level, and you know, they have no money. They have no oil, they have no food, and it’s really right now a nation in deep trouble. And they want our help.”\n\n\n\nIncreasing pressure on Cuba\n\nThe US has long had strained relations with Cuba, an island just 145 kilometres, or 90 miles, from its shores. Since the 1960s, the US has imposed a full trade embargo on the island, weakening its economy.\n\nBut tensions have accelerated since January 3, when Trump authorised a military operation to abduct and imprison Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close ally of Cuba.\n\nAn estimated 32 Cuban soldiers were killed in the attack, alongside Venezuelan military personnel.\n\nIn the aftermath, Trump ratcheted up pressure against the island, publicly speculating that its government is “ready to fall”.\n\nOn January 11, he announced that no more Venezuelan oil or money would flow to Cuba. Then, on January 29, he issued an executive order threatening tariffs on any country that supplies oil directly or indirectly to the island.\n\nCuba’s energy grid largely relies on fossil fuels to generate electricity, and the United Nations has warned of the potential for an imminent humanitarian “collapse” on the island if supplies are not restored.\n\nA panel of UN human rights experts also cast doubt this month on Trump’s stated rationale that Cuba constitutes an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to US national security, due to its relations with China, Russia and other US rivals.\n\nThe fuel blockade, they explained, served primarily as “an extreme form of unilateral economic coercion” that violated international law.\n\n“There is no right under international law to impose economic penalties on third States for engaging in lawful trade with another sovereign country,” they wrote in a statement.\n\nTrump’s vision for a ‘growing nation’\n\nThe Trump administration, however, has made little secret of its desire to spread US influence, particularly in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nIn his inaugural speech in 2025, Trump pledged that the US “will once again consider itself a growing nation”, including through the expansion of its territory.\n\nSince delivering that address, Trump has proposed to “own” Gaza and “run” Venezuela, while pressuring countries like Greenland, Canada and Panama to cede sovereignty over their lands.\n\nHe has repeatedly referenced 19th-century expansionist policies like manifest destiny and the Monroe Doctrine to justify some of these efforts. He even married his personal brand to the latter, calling his plans for the Western Hemisphere the “Donroe Doctrine”.\n\nDuring his State of the Union address this week, he touted his military action in Venezuela as a success and announced that more than 80 million barrels of Venezuelan oil had been transferred into the US government’s possession.\n\n\n\n“We’re also restoring American security and dominance in the Western Hemisphere,” Trump told the crowd.\n\nThe Cuban government, however, has repeatedly denounced Trump’s campaign against the island as evidence of US imperialism.\n\nOn January 30, for instance, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel accused Trump of attempting “to strangle the Cuban economy” with the fuel blockade.\n\n“This new measure reveals the fascist, criminal, and genocidal nature of a cabal that has hijacked the interests of the American people for purely personal gain,” he wrote on social media.\n\nJust this week, Diaz-Canel’s government announced there had been a deadly shootout with a Florida-tagged speedboat close to its shores.\n\nThe US government has denied responsibility. But Cuba has described the boat as part of an “infiltration for terrorist purposes”.\n\nLoosening restrictions?\n\nAlready, there have been signs that the US might seek to ease some of the pressure on Cuba, while maintaining its stiff opposition to the island’s communist government.\n\nEarlier in February, the Trump administration announced $6m in humanitarian aid to the island, to be distributed through proxies like the Catholic Church, not the local government.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, the US Department of the Treasury revealed it would “implement a favorable licensing policy” for the resale of Venezuelan oil to Cuba, barring any transaction with the Cuban government or its military and intelligence services.\n\nCritics have argued that a humanitarian crisis in Cuba could trigger consequences for Trump, who has campaigned on cracking down on immigration and slashing government spending.\n\nCuba has seen multiple waves of migration to the US, the most recent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when nearly 2 million people fled the island due to economic instability and political repression.\n\nDiaz-Canel, meanwhile, repeated on Friday that his government would defend itself from any outside threat.\n\n“Cuba will defend itself with determination and firmness against any terrorist or mercenary aggression that seeks to undermine its sovereignty and national stability,” he said."

            "content": "Ukraine marked the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion with territorial gains in the south and improved air defences that kept the lights on in Kyiv, despite two barrages of drones and missiles during the past week.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday told the AFP that Ukrainian forces had regained 300 square kilometres (115 square miles) of territory in southern Ukraine, without specifying the time period.\n\nHis commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskii, two days later, said those southern gains were 400sq km (155 square miles), and had come since the end of January.\n\n“You can’t say that we’re losing the war … The question is whether we will win,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, attributed Kyiv’s successes to the fact that Ukraine persuaded Starlink to disconnect illegal Russian terminals in the theatre, and the fact that the Kremlin itself partly disabled the Telegram messaging service.\n\nRussian troops used both services for essential military communications, it said.\n\nAlthough limited in scale, Ukrainian counterattacks may have done enough to throw Russian preparations for a spring offensive off balance, said the ISW.\n\nOpen source intelligence suggests that Russia’s campaign has been flagging for a long time.\n\nEuropean leaders have publicly noted that over the past three years, it has seized 1.5 percent of Ukraine or less at a cost of hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\nThe battle for Pokrovsk, for example, a city in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, appears to have ended in victory for Russia in recent weeks,\n\n\n\nbut the campaign took two years for a town with a pre-war population of 60,000.\n\n“Pokrovsk was operationally significant given its use as an important logistics hub, but Russian strikes denied Ukrainian forces the ability to fully leverage the town for logistics as early as July 2025,” said the ISW. “Pokrovsk had long ceased to be an operationally significant town by the time Russian forces intensified their push to capture the town in Winter 2025.”\n\nPutin’s air campaign\n\nOn Tuesday, the fourth anniversary of Russia’s war, Zelenskyy noted that “[Russian President Vladimir] Putin understands he is not capable of defeating Ukraine on the battlefield, and the ‘second army in the world’ is fighting against apartment buildings and power plants.”\n\nHe was referring to Russia’s aerial campaign against the four-fifths of Ukraine that remain free, where he noted that “the Air Force has started performing better.”\n\nRussia attacked Ukraine during the week with just more than 1,500 drones and at least 90 missiles, but the two biggest attacks came two days before and two days after the anniversary.\n\nOn Sunday, Russia launched 197 drones and 50 missiles. Ukraine downed all but 26 drones and 31 missiles.\n\nThen, on Thursday, Russia launched 420 drones and 39 missiles. Ukraine neutralised 90 percent of the drones and 30 missiles. “We indeed managed to protect very important facilities,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nTo achieve even this success rate, Russia appears to be using all of its production capacity.\n\n“All the ballistics that come to us are made at the end of 2025 – the beginning of 2026. That is, we are actually being attacked with missiles from the factory,” said defence ministry adviser Serhiy Beskrestnov.\n\nUkraine’s Air Force said it had destroyed 3,855 long-range missiles used to target rear areas since the beginning of the war, as well as 67,000 long-range drones.\n\nUkraine strikes back\n\nUkraine has launched a strategic campaign to damage the Russian weapons and fuel supply chains. During the past week, that campaign saw significant successes.\n\nOn February 21, Ukrainian-made FP-5 “Flamingo” missiles struck the Votkinsk missile factory in Russia’s Udmurtia – about 1,200km (745 miles) from the Ukrainian border.\n\nMissile expert Fabian Hoffman said it was “the first time that Ukraine has successfully struck a core target of Russia’s missile industry directly using a heavy missile capability”.\n\n\n\nUkraine’s General Staff said the facility makes a series of ballistic missiles, including Russia’s “unstoppable” Oreshnik intermediate ballistic missile, which it has now stationed in Belarus and with which it has repeatedly threatened Europe.\n\nAt least one machine-building plant was struck, as satellite imagery later showed, though the extent of the interior damage was uncertain.\n\nThe Flamingo entered production in the second half of last year as part of an effort to increase the lethality of Ukraine’s long-range drones. It carries Ukraine’s largest warhead to date – 1,150kg (2,535 pounds) – but has been plagued by problems of accuracy.\n\n“The strike on the Votkinsk plant marks the first confirmed successful use of the Flamingo against a high-value target,” said Hoffman.\n\nOn the same day, Ukrainian drones struck the Neftogorsk Gas Processing Plant in Samara, damaging two gas condensate stabilisation plants.\n\nOn Monday, Ukraine struck the Kaleykino Oil Pumping Station in Tatarstan, described as a key facility for filling the Druzhba oil pipeline to Hungary and Slovakia.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ukraine struck a chemicals plant in Smolensk, causing explosions and fires.\n\nRussia did not mark the war’s fourth anniversary with any grand pronouncements, but Ukraine celebrated its survival.\n\n“Ukraine has come a long way – from the point when we were being given body armour to the point when we ourselves produce more than three million [first-person view] drones a year,” said Zelenskyy.\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa stood beside him.\n\nThe EU has become Ukraine’s biggest donor and supporter, sending 195 billion euros ($230bn) to date, and voting to send another 90 billion euros ($106bn) over the next two years.\n\n“Europe has stood with us throughout these difficult, really difficult years, and our people trust Europe,” said Zelenskyy."

            "content": "IAEA says Iran has stored most of its highly enriched uranium at an underground tunnel complex at its Isfahan facility.\n\nThe United Nations nuclear watchdog has said in a report that Iran has stored most of its highly enriched uranium at an underground tunnel complex at its Isfahan facility, urging Tehran to allow inspections as it faces growing pressure from the United States over its nuclear programme.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report, which was circulated to members Friday, confirmed earlier findings that the country was enriching uranium up to 60 percent, which is a short step away weapons-grade purity, raising concerns over the IAEA’s lack of access to the Isfahan site, one of three facilities that the US claimed to have “obliterated” in last year’s 12-day war.\n\nThe IAEA report also stated that its inspectors do not know the precise location of a fourth uranium enrichment facility that Iran said it was setting up in Isfahan prior to the 12-day war, adding that they were not aware of its operational status or whether it currently contains nuclear material.\n\nThe IAEA said it had observed in satellite imagery “regular vehicular activity around the entrance to the tunnel complex at Isfahan in which (uranium) enriched up to 20% and 60% U-235 … was stored”, stressing the importance of being able to carry out inspections in Iran without further delay.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Iran.\n\nThe report comes a day after US and Iranian negotiators held a third round of indirect talks mediated by Oman in Geneva that yielded no breakthrough.\n\nIt will be discussed at a quarterly meeting of the IAEA’s 35-country board commencing on Monday next week in Vienna, coinciding with further Oman-mediated meetings between technical teams in the same city.\n\n\n\nThere is uncertainty over the fate of Iran’s stockpile of more than 400kg (882 pounds) of 60 percent enriched uranium that was last seen by nuclear watchdog inspectors last June 10.\n\nIsrael launched strikes on Iran later that month, beginning a 12-day war that the US briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nTehran suspended some cooperation with the IAEA and restricted the watchdog’s inspectors from accessing sites bombed by Israel and the United States, accusing the UN body of bias and of failing to condemn the strikes.\n\nAl Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem said the technical points up for discussion in the Oman-mediated talks on Monday would, he said, be “related” to extracting the 440.9kg (972 pounds) of uranium enriched to up to 60 percent that the IAEA had reported prior to the 12-day war, in case there was “any tendency to go towards weaponisation of the programme”.\n\nHowever, Hashem added, the IAEA is aware that “even the Iranians aren’t able to get into those facilities.” “So there’s been a lot of work around the facilities, at least this is what was shown in satellite imagery, but it doesn’t seem that the Iranians were able to get in,” he said.\n\nReporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi said the stockpile of enriched uranium and the inspections were the main “sticking point” in US-Iran discussions.\n\nAfter yesterday’s talks, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the US should stop its “excessive demands”. He did not specify what those demands were, but the US has said it wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure entirely, limit its arsenal of ballistic missiles and stop supporting regional allies."

The Artemis III mission, scheduled for 2027, was originally going to attempt to land on the Moon but will now be a test flight instead. NASA also says it’s “increasing its cadence of missions,” including adding a second test flight in 2027 and aiming for “at least one surface landing every year thereafter,” including the Artemis IV landing.\n\nThe overhaul to the Artemis launch schedule follows a report from NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) earlier this month that highlighted serious safety risks with NASA’s previous plans for future launches. ASAP was particularly concerned about Artemis III, which its report said included too many “cumulative technical, operational, and schedule risks associated with multiple first-of-a-kind objectives planned for a single mission.”\n\nThe Artemis II mission, scheduled for this year, has faced a string of issues during testing over recent weeks, delaying its launch until no earlier than April. Artemis II is intended to orbit the Moon — if it’s successful, it will be the first time humans visit lunar orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance’s merger agreement is now official. On Friday, the two companies announced plans to merge into a massive media company that will fold WBD’s studio, linear channels, streaming service, and gaming segment into Paramount.\n\nThough WBD initially signed onto an $83 billion agreement to merge part of Warner Bros. with Netflix, Paramount persisted with a hostile takeover bid, followed by a series of offers. That persistence paid off, as WBD determined that Paramount’s “best and final” offer is “superior” to Netflix’s deal. On Thursday, Netflix declined to match Paramount’s bid, calling it “no longer financially attractive.”\n\nParamount and WBD say the board of directors of both companies has signed off on the deal. The companies expect it to close in the third quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Under the agreement, Paramount will acquire WBD in a deal valued at $110 billion. Paramount has also agreed to cover the $7 billion regulatory termination fee and the $2.8 billion breakup fee owed to Netflix, which it has already paid, according to Bloomberg.\n\n“Together, Paramount and WBD will deliver greater choice for consumers through its leading streaming platforms with an exceptional intellectual property portfolio that has produced popular franchises such as Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Top Gun, the DC Universe and SpongeBob SquarePants,” the companies say in the press release.\n\nLawmakers and regulators are skeptical about the Paramount-WBD merger. “A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a statement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta also warned that the agreement isn’t a “done deal,” and that the state’s Department of Justice will be “vigorous” in its review of the merger."

There will be a Six Month phase out period for Agencies like the Department of War who are using Anthropic’s products, at various levels. Anthropic better get their act together, and be helpful during this phase out period, or I will use the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow.\n\nWE will decide the fate of our Country — NOT some out-of-control, Radical Left AI company run by people who have no idea what the real World is all about. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

            "content": "Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts, and have stopped getting a response. This week, thanks to a reader tip, we think we’ve found the original phone the T1 is based on.\n\nA long time ago, back when the Trump phone was but a single, inaccurate render and a contradictory spec sheet, we tried to figure out what other phone it might be based on. Now, eight months, two spec overhauls, and one redesign later, I have a good guess: the HTC U24 Pro.\n\nI didn’t spot this by myself. A reader first tipped me off to the similarities between the U24 Pro and the Trump phone I revealed a few weeks ago, which are numerous: a similar angled body and curved display, a unique front sensor array, and broadly similar specs, including oddities like a headphone jack and microSD card support.\n\nLet’s get one thing out the way at the top: I’m pretty sure HTC isn’t secretly building the Trump phone. Sohaib Ahmed, the company’s global director of PR, told me as much: “HTC does not design or manufacture phones for third parties.” But that doesn’t rule out another company playing a part in designing or building both phones, and given just how similar they look, I suspect that’s exactly what happened.\n\nIt’s a little hard to make out in this screenshot, but the Trump phone shares the sharply angled edges of the HTC U24 Pro. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nThe U24 Pro is an odd phone in its own right. It launched in 2024 for €549 (around $600 at the time), and was heralded in some corners as a return from the dead for HTC, despite the fact that it followed the U23 Pro a year earlier, and a string of smaller releases that targeted the Asian market. HTC, once one of the major players in the Android phone industry, had been greatly diminished ever since selling a large part of its smartphone business to Google for $1.1 billion in 2017.\n\nBoth the T1 Phone and the U24 Pro share a slightly asymmetric angular frame, jutting out into a point along every edge, with a heavily curved screen on the front. I cannot think of, nor find, another phone that is quite the same shape — even small details like the positions of the antenna lines around the power and volume buttons line up. Even more telling is the set of sensors along each phone’s top. The U24 Pro splits up its speaker grill, notification LED, and proximity sensor into three, resulting in an unusual design with a long bar, a small dot for the LED, and then a second shorter bar, at the point where the display meets the phone’s top. What looks like the same sensor design can be clearly seen on the Trump phone I was shown, though I can’t confirm that the sensors themselves are the same, or that the T1 Phone will also have a notification LED.\n\nBoth phones have near-identical sets of speakers and sensors about the front selfie camera, with headphone jack and microphone visible behind them on the top edges. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nOther details are subtler. It’s hard to tell exactly from the glimpses I got of the Trump phone, but along the top frame it certainly looks to have both a headphone jack and a microphone in the exact same positions as on the HTC device. Even having a headphone jack in the first place is evidence of the phones’ connection, given how rare the feature is in modern devices. The same can be said for the fact that both phones include a microSD card slot, sharing support for up to 1TB cards on top of a base 512GB of storage.\n\nWhile the rear cameras look completely different, which seems to scupper my theory, look again: The U24 Pro’s cameras are split into a pair close together, with a third lens lower down. The new Trump phone sets all its cameras in one mount, but they’re unevenly spaced, with a larger gap between the second and third lenses. These cameras may look totally different on the surface, but I suspect that underneath you’ll find they’re similar. And what we know of the specs matches too: Trump Mobile told me that its phone will have 50-megapixel sensors for both the main and selfie cameras, and my glimpse of its camera UI showed an ultrawide and a 2x zoom option — all of which you’ll find on the U24 Pro.\n\nThe two phones’ cameras look different at first, but the unusual lens placement might just line up. Screenshot: Dominic Preston / The Verge and Image: HTC\n\nAssuming that the two phones are essentially the same, does the U24 Pro tell us any more about what to expect from the T1? It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, matching what I’d been told about a Snapdragon 7-series chip in the Trump phone. The U24 Pro has a 6.8-inch OLED display, 60W wired charging and even wireless charging support, and an IP67 rating for dust and water protection. There’s reason to be cautious reading too much into the spec sheet, though: The U24 Pro released with a 4,600mAh battery, smaller than the 5,000mAh capacity I’ve been told will be in the Trump phone. If that spec differs, then other elements of the internals could well too — the bigger battery in particular might replace the wireless charging coils of the HTC phone.\n\nThe U24 Pro launched to middling reviews, which may not inspire much confidence in Trump Mobile’s offering. Tech Advisor gave the phone two and a half stars out of five, calling it “hard to recommend over rivals,” while Notebookcheck declared it “modern and yet out of date.” Still, it fared surprisingly well in a JerryRigEverything teardown and durability test.\n\nHe noticed, however, that this didn’t appear to be the HTC of old, lacking the sapphire crystal HTC previously used on its displays and optical image stabilization on the front camera it once pioneered. The U24 Pro and other HTC phones released in the last few years share little consistent design language, and ship with near-stock Android software. Speculation has been rife that HTC isn’t in fact manufacturing the phones internally, but had commissioned an ODM — original design manufacturer — to produce the hardware. ODMs design and manufacture phones for other companies, usually to a set of specifications provided by the consumer-facing brands, and often retain ownership of the designs, allowing them to reuse and repurpose them for other clients. I asked HTC for clarification, but the company wouldn’t confirm whether the U24 Pro was made in-house or contracted out.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that Trump Mobile, or its manufacturing partner, is simply ripping off the design of a little-known HTC device. But I think the most likely answer here is a more mundane one: HTC probably worked with some unnamed ODM to design and manufacture the U24 Pro, and Trump Mobile just happened to work with the same company. That manufacturer may have either dug out its old designs for HTC when developing the T1 Phone, or perhaps gave new life to old, unused components from HTC’s production run. Without knowing the hypothetical ODM involved, it’s hard to say for sure. Trump Mobile has previously confirmed that it’s working with a partner or partners to manufacture its phones outside the US, before their “final assembly” in Miami, but executive Don Hendrickson wouldn’t tell me the name of its manufacturer or where it’s based. I reached out to the company again for comment on this story, and received no reply.\n\nSo no, I don’t think that HTC made the Trump phone. But it does look likely that it is based, more or less, on one of that company’s phones. It remains to be seen how the T1 Phone will differ in its details, but the fact that its origins seem so closely tied to an unpopular midranger from two years ago doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the T1 Phone’s flagship credentials.\n\nGot inside information on Trump Mobile or the Trump phone?

            "content": "is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nOn Thursday morning, I attended a Q&A panel with four top Samsung smartphone executives. Until 2025, Samsung was the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer, and by association, the world’s largest maker of cameras. It’s still the second largest after Apple.\n\nSamsung handed me the microphone first. I asked:\n\nWe see a divide in society between people who want AI to do impressive things with their photos and videos, and those who don’t want AI to do anything with photos and videos because it’s eroding our ability to believe that what we have seen is real, destroying the concept of photographic evidence. Metadata tools like C2PA have utterly failed to stem the tide. Does Samsung have any new and different ideas on how to prevent AI images from taking over the world?\n\nSamsung’s four executives did not have any new and different ideas to share.\n\nI will credit Won-Joon Choi, the mobile division’s COO and R&D chief, for not dodging the question. He told the room that the erosion of reality is a problem and he wants to fix it.\n\nBut he, and other Samsung executives, suggested that the company needs to balance the desire for photographic reality with letting smartphone buyers be “more creative.” They passed the buck by suggesting it’s an industry-wide problem, one that requires a broader conversation, and suggested that Samsung has already partially solved it simply by adding a watermark to AI-generated images. A watermark that can easily be removed.\n\nGiven an opening later, an exec suggested our feelings toward AI-generated content might become more favorable in the future.\n\nHere are some of those answers.\n\n“We recognize the issue, because a lot of content is generated by AI,” Choi began. “On the one hand, people want to be more creative, so we believe we have to provide a solution so people can be more creative,” he said. “On the other hand, it’s really hard nowadays to distinguish the real photos and videos from the fake ones. I think this is a problem, we recognize that, and I think it’s a problem we have to solve at an industry level.”\n\n“The C2PA, you may view it as a failure, but it’s still enough to provide a mechanism if people want to validate that those pictures and videos are made by AI. I think we have to provide a mechanism so people can use it. I think it’s an ongoing effort throughout the industry to solve this problem,” he added.\n\n“I think if we make joint efforts to solve this problem, I believe that we should be able to do it,” he concluded.\n\nAs my colleague Jess Weatherbed wrote earlier this week, we’re starting to worry that this sort of “the industry will solve this together” rhetoric, and the C2PA itself, are substitutes for actual meaningful action.\n\nPerhaps responding to our Samsung AI slop watch reporting, Samsung America exec Dave Das also chimed in to say that the company’s still learning about how much AI is acceptable when creating its own ads. He admitted that the company has “just started utilizing some AI content in our creative, and the feedback has been pretty clear.”\n\n“We’re trying to discern what is the right place to use it, and absolutely how to be very clear about when we are using AI generated content vs naturally generated content,” Das said.\n\nBut Das still frames it as a balancing act between business priorities, not a social responsibility. “It really boils down to giving the creator choice,” he said, suggesting that Samsung’s job is to find “the right balance.”\n\nLater in the morning, KTLA-TV tech reporter Rich DeMuro felt out Samsung’s stance with a very different question. He asked whether Samsung might want to make it easier for customers to remove its AI watermark from AI-generated photos.\n\nThree screenshots taken from AI-generated Samsung ads on YouTube. More on Samsung slop watch here. Image: Samsung / The Verge\n\n“If I’m making a Christmas card with all your fun tools, do I really want that to say ‘AI-generated content?’” asked DeMuro.\n\nDrew Blackard, Samsung America’s SVP of mobile product management, took that one. He concluded by saying that “If we feel like consumers really want that ability to remove watermarks, and there are other ways to address the first point around authenticity at the same time, we’ll do both things and deliver the best of what people are wanting out of the experiences.”\n\n“At least right now, there’s enough concern from consumers around authenticity that that’s the primary thing we’ve solved for, in terms of the watermarking both in the metadata and on the photo itself. Not all services do that,” he said.\n\nBlackard also suggested we might look back one day and realize that AI-generated content isn’t such a big deal, that our perceptions might change over time, the same way perceptions changed toward user-generated content to begin with. People were concerned then with “the amount of content now flowing into the system” and how it wasn’t the professional video product they were used to, he said.\n\nI wonder if Samsung and fellow smartphone makers have considered the opposite: that perceptions of AI-generated imagery might become even less favorable after people lose their jobs in favor of cheap-to-produce AI slop, and after it becomes far easier to lie and cheat and steal in the absence of reliable recorded evidence.\n\nI wonder if they’ve considered solving this problem ”at an industry level” before they break the dam, and whether perception might turn against Samsung for helping create the flood that comes after."

Though FedEx covers the cost of duties and tariffs on a customer’s behalf when packages arrive in the US, it bills customers for the fees later on.\n\n“Our intent is straightforward: if refunds are issued to FedEx, we will issue refunds to the shippers and consumers who originally bore those charges,” FedEx says. “When that will happen and the exact process for requesting and issuing refunds will depend in part on future guidance from the government and the court.”\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court determined that the levies implemented by Trump under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) exceeded the president’s powers. Trump used this law to impose sweeping fees on imported products from China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as put “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of other countries. Days after the ruling, Trump imposed a new 10 percent tariff under the Trade Act of 1974.\n\nAlong with FedEx, over 1,000 companies, including Costco, Revlon, Bausch + Lomb, Dyson, and L’Oréal, have filed lawsuits in the US Court of International Trade in an attempt to recoup the funds that went toward Trump’s tariffs, according to NBC News and CBS."

The president allowed for a six-month phase-out period for departments using the products, but emphasized that Anthropic was no longer welcome as a federal contractor.\n\n“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again,” the president wrote in the post.\n\nNotably, the President’s post does not mention any plans to designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk, as had been previously mentioned as a consequence. However, a subsequent tweet from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made good on the threat.\n\n“In conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security,” Secretary Hegseth wrote. “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\n\nThe Pentagon dispute centered on Anthropic’s refusal to allow its AI models to be used to power either mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, which Secretary Hegseth found unduly restrictive.\n\nCEO Dario Amodei reiterated his stance in a public post on Thursday, refusing to compromise on the two points.\n\n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters — with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei wrote at the time. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”"

            "content": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.\n\nSuno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\n\nStill, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more."

            "content": "Starting this week, Perplexity subscribers will have a new agentic tool at their disposal.\n\nPerplexity Computer, in the company’s words, “unifies every current AI capability into a single system.” More specifically, Perplexity says it is a computer user agent that can execute complex workflows independently using 19 different AI models, even creating subagents to handle specific problems.\n\nThe tool is available now, only on the company’s highest subscription tier, the $200/month Perplexity Max. It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.\n\nTechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in example workflows on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial, or legal data; creating analysis; and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations.\n\nPerplexity invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company canceled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.\n\nThis tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.\n\nThe company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base — in the tens of millions of users — pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nNow, Perplexity executives say they are aiming for a more boutique set of users, with products that serve people making “GDP-moving decisions.” Executives in the briefing, who asked not to be identified by name, described prioritizing enterprise subscriptions, particularly for deep research.\n\n“You don’t hear us talk about MAUs ever, because we’re not actually on a mission to get as many users as possible,” one executive said.\n\nPerplexity recently released a new benchmark for complex research tasks, called Draco, where (no surprise) its own deep research offering beats out competitors like Gemini.\n\nPerplexity says it is no longer reliant on other companies’ APIs for its web index and now has its own AI-optimized search API. But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.\n\n“Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done in Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.\n\nA visualization of model usage by Perplexity users over time. Image Credits:Perplexity\n\nIf one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.\n\nThe company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear.\n\nStill, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on user fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.\n\nAnd there is more on the horizon: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.\n\nOne executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.\n\nHowever, the execs at the briefing dismiss such complaints: “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” one said."

            "content": "US President Donald Trump announced Friday that he was instructing every federal agency to “immediately cease” use of Anthropic’s AI tools. The move comes after Anthropic and top officials clashed for weeks over military applications of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump said that there would be a “six month phase out period” for agencies using Anthropic, which could allow time for further negotiations between the government and the AI startup.\n\nThe Pentagon and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nShortly after the President’s announcement, defense secretary Pete Hegseth said that Anthropic would also be designated a “supply chain risk,” a move normally reserved for foreign businesses considered a danger to American national security. The designation will bar the US military and its contractors and suppliers from working with the AI company.\n\nHegseth also lashed out at Anthropic and its CEO, Dario Amodei, over the company's refusal to agree to its demands. “Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of ‘effective altruism,' they have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission—a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives,” Hegseth wrote on X.\n\nThe Department of Defense has sought to change the terms of a deal struck with Anthropic and other companies last July to eliminate restrictions on how AI can be deployed and instead permit “all lawful use” of the technology. Anthropic objected to the change, claiming that it could allow AI to be used to fully control lethal autonomous weapons or to conduct mass surveillance on US citizens.\n\nThe Pentagon does not currently use AI in these ways, and has said it has no plans to do so. However, top Trump administration officials have voiced opposition to the idea of a civilian tech company dictating military use of such an important technology.\n\nAnthropic was the first major AI lab to work with the US military, through a $200 million deal signed with the Pentagon last year. It created several custom models known as Claude Gov that have fewer restrictions than its regular ones. Google, OpenAI, and xAI signed similar deals around the same time, but Anthropic is the only AI company currently working with classified systems.\n\nAnthropic’s model is available through platforms provided by Palantir and Amazon’s cloud platform for classified military work. Claude Gov is currently largely used for run-of-the-mill tasks, like writing reports and summarizing documents, but it is also used for intelligence analysis and military planning, according to one source familiar with the situation who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nIn recent years, Silicon Valley has gone from largely avoiding defense work to increasingly embracing it and eventually becoming full-blown military contractors. The fight between Anthropic and the Pentagon is now testing the limits of that shift. This week, several hundred workers from OpenAI and Google signed an open letter supporting Anthropic and criticizing their own companies’ decisions to remove restrictions on military use of AI.\n\nIn a memo sent to OpenAI staff today, CEO Sam Altman said that the company agreed with Anthropic and also viewed mass surveillance and fully autonomous weapons as a “red line.” Altman added that the company would try to agree to a deal with the Pentagon that would let it continue working with the military, The Wall Street Journal reported."

            "content": "Looking for an upgraded Roku that's a great match for your new 4K TV? Right now, both Amazon and Best Buy have the 2024 Roku Ultra discounted to $80, a $20 break from the usual price. It sports dual-band Wi-Fi and Ethernet for a more consistent connection, support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and the remote has a headphone port.\n\nWhile there are a ton of great Roku streaming devices to choose from, the Ultra stands out for a few reasons. Streaming in 4K requires a huge amount of bandwidth, and some wireless networks just aren't up to the task, particularly if your TV isn't near your router. A true dual-band Wi-Fi setup in the Roku Ultra helps ensure a stutter-free experience on all of your favorite streaming services. If you really hate buffering and dropped connections, there's an Ethernet port around back for a wired hookup, something most other streaming devices can't claim.\n\nAnother nice upgrade you get with your Roku Ultra kit is the remote, which includes a built-in 3.5-mm headphone jack. That's perfect if you like to sneak in a few episodes of your favorite show after everyone's gone to bed, or want to catch a movie without waking a sleeping baby. The Roku Ultra even includes a pair of earbuds you can use right out of the box, which are surprisingly good for what they are, and they include extra ear tips for getting the fit right.\n\nLike some of the other premium Roku streaming devices, the hands-free voice controls make it super easy to find what you're looking for. Rather than dig through all of your apps and services looking for a movie, you can just say the title into the remote and let Roku go and find it for you.\n\nIf you're ready to take your 4K streaming to the next level, both Best Buy and Amazon have the Roku Ultra marked down to $80. We also have a great guide that breaks down the differences between all of the available Roku streamers, and a roundup of our favorite media streamers, in case you're wondering what the Roku alternatives look like."

            "content": "A few months ago, a family came into Pasadena Cyclery in Pasadena, California, for a repair on what they thought was their teenager’s ebike. “I can’t fix that here,’ Daniel Purnell, a store manager and technician, remembers telling them. “That’s a motorcycle.” The mother got upset. She didn’t realize that what she thought was an ebike could go much faster, perhaps up to 55 miles per hour.\n\n“There’s definitely an education problem,” Purnell says. In California, bike advocates are pushing a new bill designed to clear up that confusion around what counts as an electric bicycle—and what doesn’t.\n\nIt’s a tricky balance. On one hand, backers want to allow riders access to new, faster, and more affordable non-car transportation options, ones that don’t require licenses and are emission-free. On the other hand, people, and especially kids, seem to be getting hurt. Ebike-related injuries jumped more than 1,020 percent nationwide between 2020 and 2024, according to hospital data, though it’s not clear if the stats-keepers can routinely distinguish between ebikes and their faster, “e-moto” cousins. (Moped and powered-assisted cycle injuries jumped 67 percent in that same period.)\n\n“We’re overdue to have better ebike regulation,” says California state senator Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat who sponsored the bill and represents parts of North County in San Diego. “This has been an ongoing and growing issue for years.”\n\nSenate Bill 1167 would make it illegal for retailers to label higher-powered, electric-powered vehicles as ebikes. It would clarify that ebikes have fully operative pedals and electric motors that don’t exceed 750 watts, enough to hit top speeds between 20 and 28 mph.\n\n“We’re not against these devices,” says Kendra Ramsey, the executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition, which represents riders and is promoting the legislation. “People think they’re ebikes and they're not really ebikes.”\n\nBill backers say they hope the fix, if it passes, makes a difference, especially for teenagers, who love the freedom that electric motors give them but can get into trouble if something goes wrong at higher speeds. Kids 17 and younger accounted for 20 percent of US ebike injuries from 2020 to 2024, about in line with the share of the total population. But headlines—and the laws that follow them—have focused on teen injuries and even deaths.\n\nThere are no national laws governing ebike riding. But bike backers spent years moving between states to pass laws that put ebikes into three classes: Class 1, which have pedal-assist that only works when they’re actually pedaled, and goes up to 20 mph; Class 2, which have throttles that work without pedaling but still only reach 20 mph; and Class 3, which use pedal-assist to move up to 28 mph. Plenty of states and cities restrict the most powerful Class 3 bikes to people older than 16. (In a complicated twist, some ebikes have different “modes,” allowing riders to toggle between Class 2 and Class 3.)\n\nLast year, researchers visited 19 San Francisco Bay Area middle and high schools and found that 88 percent of the electric two-wheeled devices parked there were so high-powered and high-speed that they didn’t comply with the three-class system at all.\n\nEbikes have clearly struck a chord with state policymakers: at least 10 bills introduced this year deal with ebikes, according to Ramsey.\n\nSome bike advocates believe injuries have less to do with ebikes than “e-motos,” a category that’s less likely to appear in retail stores or the sort of social media ads attracting teens to the tech. These have more powerful motors and can travel in excess of 30 mph. Vehicles, like the Surron Ultra Bee, which can hit top speeds of 55 mph, or Tuttio ICT, which can hit 50, are often marketed by retailers as \"electric bikes.” Because so many sales happen online, it can be hard for people, and especially parents, to know what they’re getting into."

            "content": "OpenAI has fired an employee following an investigation into their activity on prediction market platforms including Polymarket, WIRED has learned.\n\nOpenAI CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, disclosed the termination in an internal message to employees earlier this year. The employee, she said, “used confidential OpenAI information in connection with external prediction markets (e.g. Polymarket).”\n\n“Our policies prohibit employees from using confidential OpenAI information for personal gain, including in prediction markets,” says spokesperson Kayla Wood. OpenAI has not revealed the name of the employee or the specifics of their trades.\n\nEvidence suggests that this was not an isolated event. Polymarket runs on the Polygon blockchain network, so its trading ledger is pseudonymous but traceable. According to an analysis by the financial data platform Unusual Whales, there have been clusters of activities, which the service flagged as suspicious, around OpenAI-themed events since March 2023.\n\nUnusual Whales flagged 77 positions in 60 wallet addresses as suspected insider trades, looking at the age of the account, trading history, and significance of investment, among other factors. Suspicious trades hinged on the release dates of products like Sora, GPT-5, and the ChatGPT Browser, as well as CEO Sam Altman’s employment status. In November 2023, two days after Altman was dramatically ousted from the company, a new wallet placed a significant bet that he would return, netting over $16,000 in profits. The account never placed another bet.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former tech worker who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at kateknibbs.09.\n\nThe behavior fits into patterns typical of insider trades. “The tell is the clustering. In the 40 hours before OpenAI launched its browser, 13 brand-new wallets with zero trading history appeared on the site for the first time to collectively bet $309,486 on the right outcome,” says Unusual Whales CEO Matt Saincome. “When you see that many fresh wallets making the same bet at the same time, it raises a real question about whether the secret is getting out.”"

A looming Paramount Skydance merger with Warner Bros. Discovery would expand their empire even further.\n\nNow that Netflix has backed out of its bid to acquire WBD, the Ellisons stand to gain an entirely new trove of significant intellectual property, from DC Comics to Harry Potter. According to Reuters, Warner Bros. agreed to be acquired by Paramount Skydance in a $110 billion deal signed Friday, with Paramount Skydance agreeing to pay a $7 billion termination fee if federal regulators don’t approve the merger.\n\nParamount’s merger with Skydance has already brought about mass layoffs, including at CBS News, where Free Press founder Bari Weiss is leading a cultural overhaul as editor in chief. In January, Oracle became a partial owner of TikTok, giving the Ellisons even more cultural currency.\n\nHere’s everything the family would control if the WBD deal goes through.\n\nCBS and CBS News\n\nBesides its news division, which includes 60 Minutes, CBS is also home to hits like Tracker and Matlock, along with reality stalwarts Survivor and Big Brother.\n\nHBO and HBO Max\n\nAmong the most Emmy-winningest networks to exist, HBO’s library includes classics like Game of Thrones, The Wire, and Veep, as well as newer hits like The Pitt, The Gilded Age, and Thrones spin-off A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. (Outside of Canada, HBO Max is also a key distributor of the hockey smut drama Heated Rivalry.)\n\nCNN\n\nWhile CNN’s ratings dipped last year, it remains a news juggernaut and a top 5 cable network, featuring household names like John King, Kaitlan Collins, and Anderson Cooper (who recently announced he will be leaving 60 Minutes at the end of the current season).\n\nDC Comics\n\nThe merger would put Paramount Skydance in control of storied comic book franchises like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nThe wizarding world of Harry Potter, including all eight fantasy films and the upcoming HBO television series slated to premiere in 2027 would also be under the Ellisons’ purview.\n\nTikTok\n\nAs of a deal finalized in January, Oracle now holds a 15 percent stake in TikTok’s US operations.\n\nStar Trek\n\nAll 13 Star Trek movies and television shows are owned by Paramount Skydance. At a press event last year, Dana Goldberg, cochair of Paramount Pictures and chair of Paramount Television, said the franchise would be a “priority across the company.”\n\nWarner Bros. Studios\n\nHome to blockbusters like Barbie, The Dark Knight, and more recently, One Battle After Another and Sinners.\n\nComedy Central\n\nSouth Park announced a five-year, $1.5 billion deal with Paramount last July, just prior to the merger with Skydance. The show has since skewered Donald Trump and those in his administration regularly.\n\nAvatar Studios\n\nIn December, Paramount+ announced it would be the exclusive streamer of Avatar Studios content, including animated film The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender and series Avatar: Seven Havens.\n\nA Bunch of Cable Channels and Networks\n\nThe Food Network, HGTV, Discovery, TLC, OWN, Adult Swim, Showtime, TNT, and TBS are all part of WBD.\n\nOther Key Franchises\n\nOther notable titles that are or would be controlled by the Ellisons, pending the WBD takeover, include: The Lord of the Rings franchise, the Mission Impossible franchise, and the distribution rights to Dune: Part Three.\n\n2/27/26, 2:34 PM EDT: WIRED updated details about Paramount Skydance's deal with Warner Bros.

            "content": "Before last week the name Alap Shah didn’t ring a bell for many people. The 45-year-old financial analyst and tech entrepreneur had spent the past two decades working in relative obscurity. Then last weekend he coauthored a blog with the research firm Citrini titled “The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis.” It was a “thought exercise” about the impacts of artificial intelligence, and it predicted that in June of that year, AI would jack up unemployment past 10 percent and force the Dow down, down, down. Writing in a confident, Nostradamic tone—as if auditioning for starring roles in the next Michael Lewis book—the authors painted a picture of a flywheel in reverse: AI agents take jobs from workers, people spend less, and struggling corporations conduct layoffs on top of layoffs.\n\nThere wasn’t much in it that hadn’t been previously heard, or speculated about. Tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have already estimated that half the entry level white collar jobs will soon be gone, and earlier this year, Anthropic’s release of new agentic tools spurred a Wall Street selloff. Nonetheless the report hit with the force of the blizzard blowing through lower Manhattan. When the closing chimes sounded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow was down 800 points. The name Alap Shah was now ringing bells.\n\nThe achievement is less impressive than it seems. Wall Street, like the rest of us, is in a persistent state of anxiety about AI, and it doesn’t take much to trigger a mini-panic. Financial markets don’t necessarily map to reality, but the jitters reflect a wider disquiet. The AI future is in a William Gibson zone—it’s here, but unevenly distributed—and the news from those already living in the agent-packed, AI code-writing universe is both exciting and unsettling. Emphasis on unsettling.\n\nNo one—no one!—knows exactly how AI will impact the economy, but clearly it will be significant. Right now stocks are soaring, so it seems to make sense to keep the party going. But then along comes the latest doom manifesto, or a paper indicating that a traditional business sector might be threatened by AI, and suddenly money managers are reminded that the biggest issue of our time is totally unresolved. Case in point: earlier this month, a tiny company (valuation under $6 million) that had previously sold karaoke machines pivoted to AI-powered shipping logistics and put out a report saying that it had discovered some efficiencies in loading semi-trucks. That was enough to erase billions of dollars from the share prices of several major logistics companies, none of which had karaoke experience.\n\nAfter it did its job on Wall Street, the Citrini report came under considerable fire. Critics climbed over each other to proclaim its flimsiness. For one thing, they pointed out, AI has had very little discernable impact on the economy so far. Others cited the long history of resilience after technological upheavals. A mocking response by the respected trading firm Citadel Securities read, “For AI to produce a sustained negative demand shock, the economy must see a material acceleration in adoption, experience near-total labor substitution, no fiscal response, negligible investment absorption, and unconstrained scaling of compute.”\n\nThe most withering critiques disputed the report’s contention that much of the economy involves non-productive “rent-seeking” by middlemen and market makers, taking advantage of the laziness of the general population. When everyone has a few dozen AI agents working on their behalf, writes Shah, consumers will be able to effortlessly find the best goods for the best prices. Apps will be rendered unnecessary—just type what you want into the LLM and an army of agents will do everything for you. The “poster child” for this phenomenon, Shah says, is DoorDash. Instead of being limited to the restaurants on the app, consumers will send out AI agents to find their ideal meal options, contracting directly with restaurants and delivery people—no apps needed. Zero friction! The DoorDashes of the world are avocado toast!"

In my opinion, Aventon has made the least ebikey bike on the ebike market, which provides the most fun I’ve yet had riding an electrically powered bicycle. (Sorry, I couldn’t in good conscience write “ebike” in that sentence a third time.)\n\nThe Soltera 3 is a class 1 electric bike, meaning it has a top speed of 20 miles per hour. (Motor-assisted, of course. Your legs combined with a downhill can get this thing going a whole lot faster.) It also lacks any sort of throttle control. However, the bike's pedal assist is super responsive and offers immediate aid with the slightest bit of rider input.\n\nIt has a claimed range of up to 70 miles—though, given how hilly my area is and how much assistance I typically use on an ebike, I got closer to 50 on a full charge—and takes less than two hours to charge its integrated battery from flat to full.\n\nCarbon Belt\n\nPhotograph: Michael Venutolo-Mantovani\n\nOK, now that all of the spec sheet info is out of the way, we can talk about the coolest part of the Soltera 3: It has a carbon belt in place of a chain."

            "content": "Two of the largest internet providers in the US are set to merge, as the FCC announced its approval of Charter’s $34.5 billion acquisition of Cox Communications Friday afternoon.\n\nCharter, which sells phone, internet and TV services under the Spectrum brand, agreed to buy Cox in May 2025. The deal will create the largest internet provider in the country, with Cox’s 6.5 million customers joining Charter’s 31 million.\n\nWhile internet monopolies are a major problem in the US -- over a third of Americans only have access to one or no internet provider -- this acquisition won’t necessarily make that problem worse. That’s because Charter and Cox have very little overlap in the areas where they operate.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\n“No consumer is going to lose a competitive offering they currently have,” Blair Levin, a former FCC chief of staff and a telecom industry analyst at New Street Research, told CNET. “There's no reduction of competition in any relevant geographical product market.”\n\nThe FCC’s announcement doesn’t specify when Cox customers will transfer to Spectrum, but it could be a welcome change for many. Cox received a score of 68/100 in the most recent American Customer Satisfaction Index survey, while Spectrum earned a 71/100.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nHowever, a CNET analysis of internet plans found Spectrum’s price hikes to be steeper, with Spectrum increasing prices by an average of $37 monthly after one or two years, depending on the location. Cox’s plans increased by $28 per month, but only after two years.\n\nSome critics argued that the FCC should have done more to help consumers before granting Charter approval.\n\n“The FCC approved the largest cable merger in nearly a decade and did not require Charter to do anything it wasn’t already planning to do,” John Bergmayer, legal director at the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said in a statement. “Consumers, as always, will bear the costs of reduced competition.”\n\nAs part of the approval process, Charter agreed to move all of Cox’s offshore jobs to America within 18 months. According to a post on its website, Charter says it has a 100% US-based workforce as of Dec. 31, 2025."

While AI seems to be taking over entire industries, businesses such as Taco Bell have found that rolling out AI to hungry customers is a lot harder than it sounds. A pilot for AI ordering from McDonald's ended in 2024, unsuccessfully.\n\n\"Not every guest is ready for this,\" Roux said.\n\nLabor's view on AI-enabled burger crafting\n\nNot everyone is a fan, either.\n\nThe new executive director of the AFL-CIO's Technology Institute, Lauren McFerran, said that what Burger King is planning is part of a larger trend in the workplace toward using AI for employee surveillance.\n\n\"Workers across the economy are being subjected to invasive and dehumanizing monitoring that underscores the need for strict and enforceable guardrails,\" McFerran said. \"AI should be used to make jobs better and safer, not as an invasive tool to harm working people.\""

Tara Brown/CNET\n\nMobile World Congress 2026 is kicking off on Monday, teeing up a week that's likely to be filled with product announcements and futuristic phone concepts.\n\nOur expectations for this year's MWC 2026 include upcoming phones that we already know about -- including the Nothing Phone 4A that's set to launch March 5 -- along with launch events from companies like Xiaomi and Honor. Motorola's also attending, and considering the company revealed its upcoming Razr Fold at CES 2026, we'd expect the company to provide more details about the book-style folding phone.\n\nWe've also historically seen concepts at MWC that have never made it beyond the development stage but are still so cool to see. That's included Motorola debuting a flexible phone concept that you can wear on your wrist and Lenovo showing a solar-charging laptop.\n\nAnd even though Apple isn't expected to attend MWC, it's quite possible that the company might be debuting the rumored iPhone 17E over the course of the week. Apple has announced that it's going to be making new product announcements starting Monday in the lead-up to a March 4 event in New York, London and Shanghai. We'll certainly be keeping an eye out in case a new iPhone is one of them.\n\nWe'll be covering all the reveals, concepts and fun highlights we find in Barcelona in this live blog. Keep checking back for more updates."

            "content": "Key takeaways:\n\nAll five watches tracked steps and distance accurately, but heart rate accuracy varied.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 11 was the most accurate heart rate monitor during workouts.\n\nThe Garmin Venu 4's heart rate tracking has more data, ideal for serious training analysis.\n\nIf steps and distance accuracy are your priorities, you don't need an expensive smartwatch.\n\nTraining for a marathon definitely wasn't in the cards when I began this project. Testing five smartwatches for accuracy looked to me more like a few leisurely jogs, rocking what looked like the entire smartwatch section of Best Buy stacked on my wrists. I've tested dozens of smartwatches over the years, but never five at once, and never under the level of scrutiny this test demanded. Mile after mile, I pushed my heart rate (and my body) well beyond my comfort zone with the finish line in focus.\n\nFitness trackers have come a long way since the early Fitbit days of step counting, and in today's wearable landscape, a reliable step counter isn't enough. Smartwatches, rings, fitness bands and even earbuds compete for real estate on your body to monitor everything from heart rate to temperature. To edge out the competition, they must be accurate enough to catch subtle changes in your vitals and turn that data into results.\n\nI tested five models (one at a time), ranging from $80 to $550, to determine which was most accurate for steps, distance and heart rate. Heart rate, in particular, is the most critical (and the hardest to get right) since so many other metrics depend on it.\n\nFrom left to right: Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, Google Pixel Watch 4, Amazfit Bip 6, Garmin Venu 4 and Apple Watch Series 11, alongside the Polar H10 chest strap and tally counter used in our accuracy tests. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nIt's not like I was starting from scratch. I'd already reviewed the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, Google Pixel Watch 4, Garmin Venu 4, Apple Watch Series 11 and Amazfit Bip 6, and each had proven itself in its category. There's a reason they landed on our best lists. But glancing at a workout summary and dissecting raw data are entirely different beasts.\n\nAfter two months and more than 30 miles of testing, I'm finally ready to share the results (and give my legs a rest). The biggest takeaway: All five watches performed well in real-world testing. None deviated by more than a few percentage points from the control when measuring steps and distance.\n\nHeart rate accuracy proved to be the biggest differentiator. On the surface, the watches looked similar: average and maximum heart rates were often only a few beats apart. But the gaps became clear in the second-by-second data. While most stayed within 8% of our control, the Apple Watch Series 11 remained within 1% of the Polar H10 chest strap, which served as our control, earning it the CNET Labs Award for most accurate heart rate tracking.\n\nThe Garmin Venu 4 came in second, recording heart rate every second compared to every 5 seconds on the Apple Watch. For most people, that level of granularity is overkill, but for serious athletes who depend on second-by-second feedback, it could be the deciding factor.\n\nHeart rate: electrodes vs. optical sensors\n\nHeart rate is one of the most important vitals your smartwatch tracks because it feeds into so many other metrics, like calories burned, intensity, heart rate variability (a measure of the variation in time between heartbeats), and VO2 max (the maximum amount of oxygen your body uses during exercise). As a casual fitness enthusiast, I regularly use live heart rate data from my watch to make runs and strength training workouts more intense.\n\nMost smartwatches, including the five we tested, take background heart rate readings at intervals throughout the day. However, they increase sampling frequency during exercise. Even a short workout can generate hundreds more data points than passive tracking alone.\n\nWe used the Polar H10 chest strap as our control during the heart rate tests. Giselle Castro-Sloboda/CNET\n\nCNET's heart rate test\n\nTo capture a broad range of heart rate data, I tested each watch individually across three separate 1-mile runs on a flat track. I held a moderate intensity for the first half of the run (roughly Zones 3 to 4), then went all out for the second half, pushing myself as close to my peak (Zone 5) as possible.\n\nI cleaned the sensors and secured each watch snugly (about one to two fingers below the wrist bone) before each run. Each watch was tested one at a time alongside a Polar H10 chest strap, CNET's top-rated consumer heart rate monitor. Unlike wrist-based optical sensors, which detect changes in blood flow using light, chest straps like Polar's use electrodes to directly measure the heart's electrical signals. Because of this method and proximity to the heart, chest straps are widely considered more precise than wrist-based devices. Matching that level of precision isn't realistic for a watch, but they're coming close.\n\nDuring testing, I noticed a consistent pattern: most watches lagged behind the chest strap during the first minute of a run, when heart rate rose rapidly from rest. Once I reached cruising altitude (Zones 3 and 4), the readings aligned more closely. But when I pushed into Zone 5, differences reappeared, with some watches struggling to keep up during spikes above 160 beats per minute. The Bip 6, for example, never registered my peak heart rate. That lag helps explain why workout summaries often look similar. Average and peak heart rate were just a few beats away from the chest strap, while the second-by-second analysis revealed significantly wider gaps.\n\nBecause raw, second-by-second heart rate data isn't easily accessible in most apps and can include thousands of data points, I teamed up with CNET Senior Lab Engineer Gianmarco Chumbe to interpret and map the results. The graph above shows just how close the Apple Watch Series 11 was to the Polar chest strap, with an error rate of less than 1% (an average of 1.4 bpm for the three tests). In our results, it tracked almost side-by-side throughout the run, even at the outer edges of the graph where the other watches struggled. This consistency earned it our Labs Award for most accurate heart rate tracking. There is, however, an important nuance.\n\nThe Apple Watch data we extracted (via the HealthFit app pulling from Apple Health) sampled heart rate roughly every five seconds. By comparison, the Polar chest strap and Garmin Venu 4 recorded data nearly every second. Of the data points we could compare, the Apple Watch was closest to the chest strap, but it had fewer data points. The Venu 4 matched the chest strap's sampling frequency, but with a slightly higher error rate of 3.89% (5.5 bpm). Those extra seconds of data could help guide training decisions and, over time, mean the difference between finishing strong and setting a new personal record.\n\nAll of the watches posted heart rate error rates below 8%, which is impressive -- especially at higher-intensity levels. It's worth noting these were short workouts (8-9 minutes per run). Because the Google Pixel Watch (5.6% error rate) and Samsung Galaxy Watch (6.6%) tended to catch up to the chest strap over time, longer runs would likely narrow some of those gaps. The Amazfit posted a similar overall error rate (7%), but struggled to capture the highest heart rate spikes. That limitation makes it less ideal for prioritizing heart rate precision for intense workouts.\n\nAfter over 30 miles of testing, I'm more convinced than ever that heart rate accuracy really does impact training. Over six weeks, my VO2 max climbed from 41.3 to 45.8, according to Apple Health. I haven't reached that level since before my third pregnancy three years ago. Without the watches and chest strap as a guide, I might not have recognized what \"pushing myself\" actually felt like in the moment.\n\nCNET distance test\n\nMeasuring distance proved significantly easier, both physically and technically. Distance accuracy matters because it also feeds into other metrics, such as pace, calories burned and training load (the duration and intensity of exercise over a specific period of time).\n\nThe most reliable way to test distance was on a route with precise measurements and minimal elevation change. (Credit goes to Gianmarco for suggesting a track test.) Most high school and college tracks are built to official specifications: 400 meters per lap. I found an old college track near my house that had been paved over, but remained within regulation length. I even broke out a measuring wheel to be sure. I ran every single test on this track, reliving high school mile day 30 times over, but with more knee pain.\n\nThis is the track as shown in the Polar H10 chest strap app (summary view, not raw data). Vanessa Hand Orellana/Polar/CNET\n\nWhile GPS is a major factor in outdoor tracking, distance is also calculated using accelerometer and motion sensor data. To control for variables, I put the watch's paired phone on airplane mode before each run to prevent it from using GPS. I photographed each watch display after every lap (400m increments) to capture a data point, repeating the process four times (1,600m is a little more than 1 mile).\n\nAll five watches were within a tenth of the actual distance, which is an impressively tight spread. The Apple Watch again led the pack, measuring my runs at 0.99 miles for all three tests. The runner-up was the Garmin Venu 4, which averaged 0.96 miles per test (only 0.03 miles behind the Apple Watch).\n\nAccurate distance tracking isn't reserved for premium price tags. The $80 Amazfit Bip 6 averaged 0.95 miles per test, proving it is more than capable for casual walkers or joggers looking to log miles.\n\nCNET's step test\n\nOnce considered the holy grail of fitness tracking, step count has slid down the metric hierarchy as more advanced health markers have taken center stage. And while the 10,000-step goal is somewhat arbitrary, it set a target and got people moving.\n\nToday, we know it's less important to hit a specific step count and more about walking and your progress over time. Steps remain an accessible starting point for many people, and accuracy is important. \"Extra credit\" from a faulty tracker can lull people into a false sense of accomplishment. And if a device can't nail the basics, it raises questions about the rest of its metrics.\n\nWhile pedometers were once considered the gold standard in this category, a $10 model today is likely less precise than the smartwatches on this list. Traditional pedometers use a simple mechanical switch triggered by hip movement, while most modern smartwatches use accelerometers and motion sensors to detect and measure movement in multiple directions.\n\nThis (photos) is how I'd keep tabs of the steps out in the field: smartwatch on the left and clicker (tally counter) in my right hand. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nTo test accuracy, I went old-school and counted every single step myself with a manual tally counter (like what you use for baseball). I also used StepsApp, a pedometer app on my phone, as a backup. I started with 1,000 steps for each watch on a flat path. I didn't use the track, but didn't follow the exact same route for every test, which may introduce minor variance.\n\nThe results were impressively tight; all within about 10 steps of the clicker. The Galaxy Watch 8's results (18 steps off) were the exception, but I suspected it might be a fluke. So I re-tested and raised the stakes; this time, walking 2,500 steps with each watch. The results were nearly identical. None deviated by more than 11 steps, or less than half of a percentage point.\n\nThe differences were negligible, so all of the watches were winners in this category, proving that you don't have to splurge for accuracy. That Amazfit Bip 6 is looking pretty fantastic right now.\n\nTwists, turns and variables to consider when tracking workouts\n\nEven with the best intentions, 30 miles of testing and a data scientist in my corner, there is no way to eliminate every variable in real-world conditions. These results aren't gospel. They're rigorous, repeated and carefully averaged, but they're still human, and your mileage may vary (pun intended).\n\nIt took more than 30 miles of testing before I felt comfortable putting results down on paper because I kept encountering variables, especially for heart rate.\n\nThe testing order was significant. The first watch in any session was always at a disadvantage because my heart rate started lower and spiked more dramatically. By the second and third runs -- even with deliberate rest periods to bring my heart rate back down -- the jump wasn't as sharp. Your body doesn't fully reset that quickly.\n\nTo mitigate this, I rotated the starting watch for each session. I limited each outing to three runs (three miles total), making sure that every device had a chance to be tested first, middle and last. Our Labs data and results (on the charts in the story) are averages of the error rates across these three tests.\n\nFit and sensor interference were other issues. My jacket sleeve occasionally moved the watch; warmer days meant more sweat by mile three, which can interfere with optical readings, and then there was the time I almost cut off my circulation from wearing the Galaxy Watch too tightly.\n\nThe data extraction nightmare\n\nThis is just a snapshot of the layers of folders and raw data we had to comb through to compare heart rate. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nThen came the data. Polar's raw heart rate data can be downloaded as a .CSV file (spreadsheet) ready for analysis.\n\nGarmin's is almost as easy, as long as you have a data analyst and Reddit thread on hand. It can export workout-specific heart rate data as a .TCX file, which was foreign to me. Gianmarco wrote custom code, based on info he found on Reddit, to extract and convert the data into a format that matched Polar's output. Amazfit required a similar conversion process.\n\nApple, Google and Samsung made us work for it. All three require exporting your entire health archive (and I mean everything, not just workouts or heart rate). For me, this meant downloading more than a decade of health data. Once extracted, the compressed file opens into a maze of nested folders with cryptic labels. The best strategy is to sort by date and hope that one of the files mentions heart rate.\n\nFor Google, I got lucky and found the right file after what felt like hours of searching. For Apple, several third-party apps are available that can do the sorting for you. I downloaded the $6 HealthFit app, which filters and extracts data directly from the Health app. However, the sampling frequency wasn't as dense as the Polar strap, leaving fewer data points for comparison. It's hard to say whether it would've been any different if I'd been able to extract it directly from the Health app.\n\nWith Samsung, the only workable option was to use the Strava app as a middleman. I started workouts in the Strava watch app and exporting the data to the desktop version. All of this took two people many hours across multiple days to figure out. Accessing your own health data shouldn't be this hard.\n\nThe paved college track at sunset where I completed all distance and heart rate testing. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nSmartwatch accuracy bottom line\n\nIf heart rate accuracy is your top priority, the $400 Apple Watch Series 11 is what to buy. It was the all-around winner, consistently strong across every category and the most precise for heart rate, staying within 1% of the chest strap during runs.\n\nBut the bigger takeaway after 30 miles of testing is that you can't go wrong with any of these watches; it just depends on what you value most.\n\nThe $550 Garmin Venu 4 may be better suited for data nerds and serious athletes. It's Gianmarco's pick: \"The combination of high fidelity and clean export access makes it especially appealing for users like me, who want full visibility into their training data.\"\n\nIt's also the best option for Android phone owners wanting elite-level heart rate tracking.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 8 (both $350) are reliable for steps, distance and overall heart rate trends. You may not get the same second-by-second precision during intervals, but for everyday workouts, they're more than capable. And the Amazfit Bip 6 is the reminder that accurate distance tracking doesn't have to be expensive. For beginners looking to build a baseline without a major investment, it's better than its $80 price suggests."

            "content": "President Donald Trump on Friday called for US federal agencies to stop using Anthropic's Claude AI after the company refused to grant the Department of Defense permission to use it for mass domestic surveillance or for fully autonomous weapons systems.\n\nThe president posted on the Truth Social platform, which he owns, that he is ordering the federal government to \"IMMEDIATELY CEASE\" use of Anthropic's tools, saying there would be a six-month phaseout for agencies like the Department of Defense. He also decried Anthropic as a \"RADICAL LEFT, WOKE COMPANY.\" The post signaled the latest step in a showdown that escalated significantly this week between Anthropic and the federal government.\n\nClaude is widely used across the Pentagon, including in classified systems, but the Trump administration has sought to use the technology for \"any lawful purpose.\" Anthropic has insisted in its existing contract that the technology not be used for mass surveillance of Americans or in autonomous offensive weapons systems without human input.\n\nEarlier this week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei that he would invoke seldom-used powers to either force Anthropic to let the Pentagon use Claude for any lawful purpose or label the company a supply chain risk -- jeopardizing its use by the government or defense contractors. Hegseth gave Anthropic a Friday deadline to comply.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a statement that the company, which was founded with a stated focus on AI safety, \"cannot in good conscience accede to [the Pentagon's] request\" that it remove contract provisions stating Claude cannot be used in fully autonomous weapons systems or for domestic surveillance.\n\n\n\nWorries about AI and mass surveillance\n\nAmodei raised concerns that the law has not caught up with the potential for mass surveillance of Americans. The government can already buy information like Americans' browsing history and records of individual movements without a warrant, but artificial intelligence raises the stakes. \"Powerful AI makes it possible to assemble this scattered, individually innocuous data into a comprehensive picture of any person's life -- automatically and at massive scale,\" he wrote.\n\nMichael Pastor, dean for technology law programs at New York Law School, said in an email that it's typical in contract law for those involved to seek clarity on terms. \"Anthropic is right to press hard on what 'for lawful purposes' means,\" he said. \"If the Pentagon is unwilling to clarify whether it would use Anthropic's technology for mass domestic surveillance, that raises flags Anthropic seems justified in waving.\"\n\nAnthropic's Claude is reportedly the most widely used AI system by the US military. Alternatives could include tools from OpenAI, Google or Elon Musk's xAI.\n\nIn an internal memo reported by The Wall Street Journal Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly told employees that the company has the same red lines as Anthropic -- no mass domestic surveillance or autonomous offensive weapons. Altman said he believed those guardrails could be managed through technical requirements, such as requiring models to be deployed in the cloud. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\n\nEmployees of Google and OpenAI circulated a petition calling for their companies to stand with Anthropic in refusing to allow the use of AI models for domestic mass surveillance or fully autonomous lethal weapons systems. The petition said the Pentagon is \"trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in. That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.\"\n\nJust as in consumer technology, artificial intelligence systems have seen widespread adoption in government and military cases. These tools have seen their capabilities grow significantly just in the past few years, and that pace of change has not slowed. Regulation and oversight of AI haven't kept up. AI has magnified the potential harms of corporate or government surveillance by making it easier and cheaper.\n\nPastor said this dispute could have significant ramifications for what leverage governments and tech companies have against each other when their views on the appropriate use of technology clash. \"Anthropic may feel that yielding here opens a Pandora's box of uses for which Claude could be deployed,\" he said."
