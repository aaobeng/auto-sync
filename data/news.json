Proper footballer. my captain.”\n\nUnfortunately Yates’ determination meant he was on the pitch to see Forest concede the opening goal of the game.\n\nKerem Akturkoglu slotted past former Manchester City man Stefan Ortega to cut the aggregate scoreline down to 3-1 in Forest’s favour."

Vinicius reported to the referee that Prestianni had used a racial slur after he had opened the scoring and been booked for his celebrations.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Benfica player publicly denied the allegations afterwards, saying his opponent had \"misinterpreted\" what he'd said after pulling his shirt over his mouth. However, Portuguese media have reported that the 20-year-old later admitted his guilt to his team-mates and apologised.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBenfica have now released a new statement to address those claims.

The former Spurs boss will lead the United States of America at their home World Cup this summer, but beyond that campaign, he could be back in the Premier League and he has not dismissed exactly that in a recent interview.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe said to The Athletic: “I’m always linked (to clubs), to Tottenham, just like at one time I was linked to Espanyol, or to other clubs. In the end, especially because of my past at those clubs, when things aren’t going well, people tend to fall back on emotions and say, ‘Well, with Mauricio we played good football,’ or whatever it may be.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"But no. We’re focused on the World Cup, on the United States. My contract runs until after the World Cup, so after that we’ll see what might happen.

Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat continued this past weekend with defeat to Arsenal in the North London Derby, which saw the gap to the bottom three reduced to four points following West Ham's draw against Bournemouth.\n\nPochettino is seemingly the leading contender to be Frank's permanent successor with Spurs in need of a head coach that can galvanize the fanbase.\n\nThough he did not win any trophies, the Pochettino years are reflected upon fondly with Tottenham going close in two Premier League title races. They also reached the Champions League final in 2019, but lost to Liverpool.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPochettino was sacked just months after that showpiece clash with Spurs appointing Jose Mourinho as his replacement. Nuno Espirito Santo, Antonio Conte, Ange Postecoglou and Frank have followed as permanent managers since then.\n\nView 2 Images Tottenham sacked Thomas Frank earlier this month (Image: Joe Toth/Shutterstock)\n\nRoberto De Zerbi, Robbie Keane and Enzo Maresca have been touted as possible alternatives to Pochettino.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nOther big names such as Julian Nagelsmann and Carlo Ancelotti could also be available after the World Cup, but Manchester United are more likely to appoint one of those.\n\nWhat division Tottenham are in next season will likely play a huge role in the type of candidate they can appoint. If he does not get the permanent job at Old Trafford, Michael Carrick, who also played for Spurs, is a serious option.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. **Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings"

Fenerbahce captain Mert Yandas immediately went over to tell the fans to stop as the match was brought to a halt.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGround staff had to come on to clear the flares from the pitch as the incident delayed the match by over two minutes.

Their European Club Finance and Investment Landscape assessment has also highlighted the financial dominance of the Premier League in comparison to other major divisions.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat was particularly evidenced by the increase in television revenue to £1.3bn (€1.5b) for English clubs. That staggering figure very nearly amounted to the £1.4bn (€1.6bn) that 53 other European top-division leagues received combined.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite taking a share of that major financial boost, United's specific failures have also been exposed by UEFA, with £692million emerging as their net spend on transfers between 2021 and 2025. Significant losses on the likes of Antony and Paul Pogba have undoubtedly impacted that, even with other Premier League clubs spending more.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMan Utd and Premier League clubs sent warning by UEFA after financial results revealed READ MORE :\n\nMan Utd taking Kobbie Mainoo transfer risk as latest contract stance emerges READ MORE :\n\nThe likes of Chelsea and Arsenal have parted ways with substantial transfer fees over the five-year period, accounting for £656m and £587m, respectively, as their net spends. England's financial dominance has also been demonstrated on the pitch with six teams in the last-16 of this season's Champions League.\n\nFor UEFA to publish their findings, an examination of financial accounts from 2021 to 2025 was conducted. This meant the impact of all transfer activity across the five years was included, encompassing profits on sale, amortisation from earlier transfers and impairments.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn the report, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said: \"After a decade that included one of the toughest periods our sport and our society have faced, European football has come through in a strong position. Club revenues have grown steadily across the board, and top-division income is expected to pass €30bn in the 2025 financial year.\"\n\nThere have been some financial bright spots for United lately, though, with their most recent accounts revealing an operating profit of £32.6million recorded for the opening six months of the fiscal year.\n\nCompared to the £3.9m loss reported during the equivalent period in the previous year, that represents quite the uplift with those improvements fuelled by strategic cost-management measures authorised by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt appeared to be a difficult financial period for United without the inclusion of European football and the substantial funding that accompanies it, but evidently, that has not been the case.\n\nThere has, however, been a predictable decline in commercial and matchday revenue due to fewer fixtures, with the club just over £9million down.\n\nView 2 Images Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada issued an update after the release of the club's latest accounts (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUnited CEO Omar Berrada stated: \"We are now seeing the positive financial impact of our off-pitch transformation materialise both in our costs and profitability. We continue to take a football first approach and invest in both our men's and women's first teams.\n\n\"On the pitch our men's team sits fourth in the Premier League and our women's team are second in the Women's Super League, as well as reaching the League Cup final and the quarter-final of the UEFA Women's Champions League.\n\n\"Today's results demonstrate the underlying strength of our business as we continue to push for the best football results possible for our men's and women's teams.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. **Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings"

Carrick has made an impressive start to his second stint in the Old Trafford hot seat.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nStepping in as Ruben Amorim's interim successor until the season's close, the ex-midfielder has returned to the dugout and already steered United into a favourable position in the battle for Champions League qualification. The Reds have remained undefeated under Carrick, securing five wins from their six matches, including notable triumphs over Manchester City, Arsenal, and Tottenham.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCurrently occupying fourth place, they are merely three points adrift of third-placed Aston Villa. Despite widespread knowledge that United's board plan to appoint a new permanent manager in the summer, there is increasing demand for Carrick to be awarded the role full-time.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDublin, speaking to OLBG, has suggested that making Carrick the permanent manager might not be such a poor decision after all. He said: \"I think you have to leave it as it is because if it's working, then don't mess with it. You know, don't tinker with it.\n\n\"The players seem to be on board with Michael. They seem to be enjoying themselves, which is most importantly, they seem to be enjoying their football again. He's getting good results.\n\nMarcus Rashford's Barcelona dream transfer at risk as Premier League return twist tipped READ MORE :\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's Man Utd hint and huge net worth revealed after he buys stake in club READ MORE :\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"The energy levels from the players and body language is very different. The dressing room seems to believe that what they're doing is the right thing. I suppose the question is, can he keep it going? Well, what manager can do that? What manager can consistently win and win and win? I just think you leave it as it is.\"\n\n\"United at this present time and it hasn't been for years, is stable. It's stable, it's strong. And when you watch Man United now, and I've been in the stands a few times at some of Michael's matches, it's like watching Man United, which is very odd. It hasn't been like that for a long time.\"\n\nThe ex-Aston Villa striker Dublin admitted that United will undoubtedly consider big-name contenders like Zinedine Zidane, yet he remains convinced Carrick has demonstrated he possesses the credentials to succeed at the Theatre of Dreams.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Dublin believes Carrick can bring Man United back to their best (Image: PA)\n\n\"But the biggest and the best allegedly have had a go,\" Dublin continued. \"Have had a go before, Michael, and it just hasn't worked, you know.\n\n\"The best up and coming, the best coaches, the best football, the best results in Portugal, the best results in Germany, whatever it may be, they're all getting the best results, but who's done what Michael's done?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Let it carry on moving forward. How far could it go? It's down to the players and Michael.\"\n\nDublin's comments regarding Zidane follow reports earlier this month suggesting that he has verbally agreed to take over as the next head coach of the France national team.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nJoin our new MAN UTD WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Manchester United content from Mirror Football.

The referee responded by crossing ​his arms in front of his ⁠face, activating FIFA's anti-racism protocol and temporarily stopping the match.\n\nUEFA has opened an investigation into allegations of \"discriminatory behaviour\" after the game in Lisbon, and Prestianni was handed a one-match suspension, covering the second leg at the Bernabeu.\n\nBenfica appealed the temporary suspension, and Prestianni did travel and train with the squad in Madrid. However, the appeal was dismissed hours before the game on Wednesday.\n\nReal Madrid won the tie 3-1 on aggregate to seal a spot on the last 16. Aurelien Tchouameni said the result was a \"victory for everyone who stands against racism\".\n\nImage: Gianluca Prestianni arrives in Madrid with the Benfica squad (credit Benfica)\n\nMourinho criticised for response over incident\n\nBenfica manager Jose Mourinho did not speak to the media around Wednesday's second leg, with his sending off during the first leg meaning he did not have to carry out his usual media duties.\n\nIt comes after the former Real Madrid boss was widely criticised for appearing to defend Prestianni and the club by questioning the way Vinicius Jr celebrates goals.\n\n\"I told him, when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back. They [Vinicius Jr and Prestianni] told me different things. But I don't believe in one or another. I want to be an independent,\" Mourinho told Amazon Prime following the first leg.\n\n\"When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person [Eusebio] in the history of this club was black. This club, the last thing that it is, is racist.\"\n\nImage: Mourinho spoke to Vinicius Jr after the incident in the Champions League knockout round play-off first leg\n\nMourinho then appeared to comment on previous incidents in which Vinicius Jr has been subject to racist abuse in stadiums.\n\nThe Brazilian has spoken out multiple times against racism he has been subject to inside stadiums. In June 2024, three Valencia fans were jailed for eight months for racially abusing him during a LaLiga game the previous year, in the first verdict of its kind in Spain.\n\n\"There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium,\" said Mourinho. \"A stadium where Vinicius plays something happens, always.\"\n\nMourinho was seen speaking to a visibly upset Vinicius Jr and a member of the Benfica coaching staff was shown a red card during the lengthy stoppage. After a number of discussions between players, coaches and the referee, play then resumed.\n\nReal Madrid held on to win but there was a further short delay late in stoppage time when fans threw objects as Vinicius Jr was attempting to take a corner kick.\n\nImage: Vinicius Junior scored against Benfica in the second leg to round off Real Madrid's win\n\n'Prestianni facing 10-game ban'\n\nSky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:\n\nUEFA has moved very quickly to suspend Prestianni. They appointed an ethics inspector last Wednesday to look into allegations that Prestianni had racially abused Vinicius Jr the previous evening.\n\nThe inspector has already spoken to the relevant parties and forwarded an interim report to UEFA's disciplinary body, recommending Prestianni is suspended for one game while the disciplinary process continues.\n\nThe inspector believes there is prima facie evidence that Prestianni has broken UEFA's regulations on discriminatory behaviour, which carries a minimum 10-game ban.\n\nUEFA says the provisional ban is without prejudice, which means Prestianni can still expect a fair hearing.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Aurélien Tchouaméni praised Vinícius Júnior for his performance against Benfica, after the forward was allegedly subjected to racial abuse during the first leg of their Champions League play-off clash.\n\nVinicius Jr: Racists are cowards\n\nPosting after the first leg, in Portuguese on his Instagram story, Vinicius Jr wrote: \"Racists are, above all, cowards.\n\n\"They need to put their shirts over their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are.\n\n\"But they have, on their side, the protection of others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish. Nothing that happened here today was new in my life and my family's.\n\n\"I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose.\n\n\"I don't like appearing in situations like this, even more so after a great victory and when the headlines have to be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.\"\n\nImage: Vinicius Jr spoke to referee Francois Letexier after Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni appeared to make a comment towards him\n\nIn a statement in Portuguese on Instagram, shared by Benfica on social media, Prestianni denied making racist comments.\n\nHe wrote: \"I want to clarify that at no time did I direct racist insults to Vini Jr, who regrettably misunderstood what he thought he heard.\n\n\"I was never racist with anyone and I regret the threats I received from Real Madrid players.\"\n\nBenfica posted footage of the incident on X, with the comment: \"As the images demonstrate, given the distance, the Real Madrid players could not have heard what they claim to have heard.\"\n\nMbappe explains what he heard\n\nReal Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe said in an interview after the match in Lisbon that he heard Prestianni racially abuse his team-mate and said the Benfica winger should not be allowed to play in the Champions League.\n\n\"I know everything,\" the France international said after the game. \"I will explain everything that happened.\n\n\"Vinicius scored a goal - an amazing goal. He goes to dance and the people boo him. That's something that happens in football. After that, there's a moment of tension with the Benfica players. It's better if it doesn't happen, but this can happen too.\n\n\"It's the Champions League, the best competition in the world for clubs. So, it's normal that people want to win, to give their best for their club and their fans and defend their colours.\n\n\"After that, Benfica's No 25 - I don't want to say his name because he doesn't deserve it - starts to talk badly. You don't accept it but, again, it happens in football and it will continue to happen.\n\n\"He put his shirt here [over his mouth] to say Vinicius is a ****** five times. I heard it. There are Benfica players who heard it as well. And after that point, everything you have seen started.\n\n\"I want to try and explain it calmly. I don't want to speak in a general manner. I have come to Portugal many times. I have been lucky to have many team-mates and friends from Portugal, and nothing has ever happened to me.\n\n\"With these kind of things, it's very important to speak in a very clear way, and to not speak in general, because there are people who haven't done anything wrong. In the stadium, I think there are 70,000 people who haven't done anything wrong. They just wanted to support their team.\n\n\"I have the maximum respect for Benfica and their manager, who is one of the best in history, who has made history at Real Madrid.\n\n\"But this player, for me, doesn't deserve to play in the Champions League anymore.\n\n\"It's a wonderful thing to play in the Champions League. The best competition. Everyone here, all the journalists, loves the Champions League, no? It inspires me as a player, it inspires the people, it inspires children, and we have to give the best possible example to young people.\n\n\"If we let this kind of thing happen, I think all the values of football are worthless, all that we believe is worthless. We have to do something.\"\n\nVinicius Jr's history with incidents of racism\n\nVinicius Jr has spoken out previously about repeated racist abuse he has suffered, saying in 2024 that he felt \"less and less\" like playing football because of the abuse.\n\nIn that same year, three Valencia fans were sentenced to eight months in prison for racially abusing him at a match in May 2023 - in scenes reminiscent of those in Benfica, as the game was also stopped for 10 minutes after Vinicius Jr alerted the referee to fans he felt had abused him.\n\nAfter the game, the Brazilian said LaLiga \"belongs to racism\". But LaLiga president Javier Tebas responded that Vinicius Jr had been \"manipulated\" in calling out the abuse. Tebas later apologised for those comments.\n\nThe three supporters from the Valencia incident were also fined €5,000 (£4,681) and banned from sporting venues for one year for making racist gestures. Valencia were fined €27,000 (£23,581) and had their stadium partially closed for three matches.\n\nSince then, Spain has been punishing supporters for racist abuse towards Vinicius Jr. Four people were convicted for hanging an effigy with his name on it off a highway bridge in Madrid earlier in 2023.\n\nThree of them were sentenced to seven months in prison for hate crimes and threats, while the other was sentenced to 15 months in prison for sharing the images online.\n\nAll four had to take an anti-discrimination training programme to have those sentences suspended, while they were also fined €60,000 and banned from sports venues for two years.\n\nAnd just last year, five Real Valladolid fans were found guilty for racially abusing Vinicius Jr during a match in 2022. They faced one year in prison and were fined up to €1,620 (£1,412) - but again the prison sentences were suspended as long as they did not attend a football match for three years."

Signed for £72m as a promising striker filled with potential just two years earlier, he was pushed out of Old Trafford to make way for Sesko over the summer.\n\nImage: Sesko celebrates his winner in the 1-0 win at Everton\n\nSesko is beginning to show signs he can bear the burden of being United's No. 9 - but three of his five goals have come as a substitute and the other two against promoted-side Burnley, currently second from bottom.\n\nHow Sesko copes when he is the regular starter will be the true test of the 22-year-old.\n\n\"It's a lot of pressure,\" Neville said. \"The biggest pressure in English football, that's a Manchester United goalkeeper, but not far behind would be a striker who comes for big money to United.\n\n\"When you come in as a striker with a big price tag, you've got to deliver and he's starting to deliver.\n\n\"There is a danger that maybe that he's sort of getting that super-sub title, but I don't think he's that type. He's a starting player. He has been a super sub in the last few games because he's needed to be.\n\n\"I don't think he's ever going to be the perfect striker, like I said about Gyokeres. But if he can be a handful, contribute with goals, hold things up, link play, that'll be enough. You don't have to be always perfect and [his winner at Everton], it's a big moment for him.\n\n\"If he can get another four or five and finish this season in double figures, in his first season with the struggle that the team were having at the beginning, I think that would be deemed to be a good season.\"\n\nManchester United\n\nCrystal Palace Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\nSesko faced questions about how he copes with the scrutiny of being United's goalscorer after his winner at Everton as the conversation soon turned to whether he would start at Palace.\n\n\"The pressure is something that, if I want to be a good player, it's something that I have to have,\" Sesko said.\n\n\"It's something that has (to be there) if you want to play at the highest level and it's about accepting it and not really caring about it.\"\n\nSesko has made a strong case to be in from the start against Palace. It is now up to Carrick to decide whether now is the right time to open the door for the young striker.\n\nWatch Man Utd vs Crystal Palace on Sunday, live on Sky Sports, kick-off 2pm"

I trust him more than Baleba. What about Gibbs-White for Bruno? I think that might work fine too.” I think that of the three domestic players United are said to be watching – Anderson, Baleba, Wharton – he’s the best fit, but he may well have better offers. I really like Gibbs-White, but if Bruno were to leave, it’d need a big tactical rethink because of the numbers that’d be lost. Share\n\n6m ago 15.53 EST Elsewhere, Crystal Palace lead Zrinjski 1-0 on the night, 2-1 on aggregate. Share\n\n7m ago 15.52 EST HALF-TIME: Nottingham Forest (3) 0-1 (1) Fenerbahce This is a contest. If Forest don’t start creating, they’re vulnerable. Share\n\n8m ago 15.50 EST 45+3 min I’m interested in how Archie Brown came to move from West Brom to Lausanne. It’s great to see young players getting the experience of living and working in different countries. Share Updated at 15.50 EST\n\n9m ago 15.49 EST 45+1 min Here come Fener again, a lovely ball floated over the top by Kante, picking out Akturkoglu, whose lovely backheel, flicked square, puts Cherif in! He shoots low … and Ortega dives right to shovel it away. Another narrow escape for Forest. Share\n\n12m ago 15.47 EST 45 min We’re going to have four additional minutes. Share\n\n14m ago 15.45 EST 43 min Fener will think they can win this – Forest haven’t threatened a goal, whereas they’ve scored one and could’ve had a second. If they were to nick another, things’d get very nervous indeed. Share\n\n15m ago 15.44 EST 41 min Hutchinson plays back to Murillo, waiting on the left touchline, but too hard and too wide of him, Oguz collecting and powering away. He looks up, sees Akturkoglu arriving into the box, and clips back … only for a half-hit finish to bobble wide of the far post. That was a chance, and another warning for Forest. Share\n\n17m ago 15.42 EST 40 min Lucca ploughs through Ismail and is booked. View image in fullscreen Lorenzo Lucca gets a yellow for a late lunge on Ismail. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA Share Updated at 15.45 EST\n\n17m ago 15.41 EST 39 min Risky pass from Ancderson, who turns away from Nene, facing his own goal, nicely done, but his square-ball to Morato is ill advised and ill controlled, Cherif collecting and hacking into the side-netting. Share\n\n19m ago 15.40 EST 38 min In general play, Forest have been OK, but they’re yet to create a chance, most recently Williams crossing too high even for Lucca. Share\n\n20m ago 15.39 EST 37 min It’s absolutely caning down; naturally there’s a youngster in the crowd in short sleeves. Hold tight! Share\n\n21m ago 15.37 EST 36 min Forest half-clear and Akturkoglu sends it back in, the ball bouncing and skidding, forcing Ortega to get involved … and his handling is secure. Share\n\n22m ago 15.37 EST 34 min McAtee into the box, dipping inside to create a crossing angle, and the cross arrives at Anderson who can’t sort out his feet in time to direct a shot on target. No doubt there’s a chart that suggests to the contrary, but as far as the eye test goes, Anderson covers a vomitous amount of ground. Anyway, back to the game, Fener win a corner. Share\n\n24m ago 15.35 EST 33 min On the touchline, Vitor Pereira tells Murillo to calm himself, always the best way to placate someone experiencing fury. My wife and daughter are particular fans. Share\n\n24m ago 15.34 EST 33 min I would, though, like to see Anderson improve his short passing between the lines – I think he’s got it in his locker, and those, more than the big switches, allow a player to dictate a game. Share\n\n25m ago 15.33 EST 32 min Forest win it in midfield and Dominguez finds McAtee, who’s dispossessed by Brown. Anderson then tries a long pass – he’s really good at them – but the skiddy pitch takes it away. Share\n\n27m ago 15.31 EST 30 min Fener get the corner away but Forest are doing a decent job of boxing them in and win another immediately, Kante and Guendouzi getting it away. Share\n\n28m ago 15.31 EST 28 min Forest win a free-kick on the right, 30 yards from goal. Anderson and Hutchinson are behind it; the latter moves away, then the former sends in an outswinger, and Demir’s header concedes the corner. Share\n\n30m ago 15.28 EST 26 min We might criticise Forest for leaving it 2v2 at the back, but they should play this game as though it’s 0-0 not 3-0, and be able to rely on their defenders to go man -to-man at the back. Share\n\n32m ago 15.27 EST 24 min Anderson motors into the inside-left channel, his run telling Hutchinson what to do. He turns inside Oguz superbly but far too easily and sees a shooting lane open up so, from a tight angle, he fires a hard, low inswinger … just past the far post. Share\n\n33m ago 15.25 EST GOAL Nottingham Forest (3) 0-1 (1) Fenerbahce (Akturcoglu 22) Immediate counter from Fener, Cherif marauding down the right, and his cross just about eludes Williams, who faceplants for extra points. Meantime, Akturcoglu controls and swishes a low shot into the far corner. Game on? View image in fullscreen Kerem Akturkoglu scores the opener for Fenerbahce. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images Share Updated at 15.46 EST\n\n35m ago 15.23 EST 21 min Anderson has such a ridiculous engine – he turns up in the no 10 position to beat a man and lay off a sensible pass. Nothing comes of it, but Forest come again, the dangerous Hutchinson doing Demir on the outside and crossing low … but hte ball is cleared. Share\n\n37m ago 15.21 EST 19 min Nene, who was down a couple of minutes ago, tangles with Hutchinson, takes a finger to the face, and hurls himself backwards to the ground. He’s fine. Share\n\n39m ago 15.20 EST 17 min We’ve seen near enough nothing of Fenerbahce as an attacking force yet, and of course they’re depleted by injury, but they’re 3-0 down, they need to do something. Share\n\n42m ago 15.17 EST 15 min Ball out to Hutchinson who slows down Muldur then dashes past him, whipping in a really inviting cross, but again, no one can get anything on it. Share\n\n42m ago 15.16 EST 14 min I’ve not seen much of Lucca, but he’s putting himself about. If I was Vitor pereira, I’d be telling my wingers and midfielders to stand balls up to the penalty spot and far post, because if he gets a run on, no one’s beating him in the air. Share\n\n44m ago 15.14 EST 12 min Lovely from Anderson, picking his way along the by-line and poking a ball across the face of the six-yard box that beseeches a tap=in, but no one gambles and it passes through the corridor and to relative safety. Share\n\n45m ago 15.13 EST 11 min Good straight ball into Lucca, who controls well and lays off for McAee, who swerves around his man nicely only to thread a pass in behind to no one. Share\n\n48m ago 15.11 EST 9 min Guendouzi moves forward and spreads the play, but Forest quickly win the ball back and Hutchinson attacks down the left, swinging an excellent low cross into the corridor, but ahead of the onrushing Lucca. Share\n\n49m ago 15.10 EST 8 min Eeeesh, he’s grimacing now, and off the pitch getting things sorted. I’m not sure he’ll get from 90 degrees to 180, but a respectable 150 will be enough for now. Share\n\n50m ago 15.08 EST 6 min The away end if proper bouncing, fans in red and yellow on the outsides and those in the middle dressed in black. Meantime, Yates challenges Oguz, pulling him back, and his finger has popped. Credit where it’s due, he takes it superbly, not even grimacing. Share\n\n53m ago 15.06 EST 4 min Forest knock it about nicely, giving it away as soon as they try to progress the ball get it forward. They look confident, though. Share\n\n55m ago 15.04 EST 2 min Rain is swirling in Nottingham, which we’re being shown rather than whatever’s going on in the away end. Share\n\n1h ago 15.03 EST 1 min A flare has been launched on to the pitch from the away end, so we’ve stopped. View image in fullscreen Archie Brown removes a flare thrown on the pitch by the away supporters. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA Share Updated at 15.15 EST\n\n1h ago 15.02 EST 1 min And away we go. Share\n\n1h ago 14.58 EST They’re playing Born Slippy at the City Ground, more than enough excuse for me to embed this: Does any other riff immediately transport you back to a time and place as intensely as this one? If so, I’d like to hear it. Share\n\n1h ago 14.50 EST “The game starts 0-0,” Vitor Pereira tells TNT, saying his team need to play with ambition and organisation, enjoying it and showing their quality. Today is an opportunity for the likes of Jair Cunha to show he’s got the quality and mentality necessary, but the games are like training – the players need to improve. Share\n\n1h ago 14.48 EST On the telly, they’ve just been discussing James McAtee, and I’m looking forward to seeing how he does tonight. City are now in that spot United were under Alex Ferguson, where clubs buy their players because they know the standard can be too high for good ones to make it and respect the managers who keep them around. He’s got a lovely touch and decent vision, but does he have the ability to impose that? We don’t yet know. Share\n\n1h ago 14.42 EST Forest actually did pretty well to keep as many players as they did after last season – and getting £52m+£3m for Anthony Elanga was a remarkable piece of business. I’m not sure Anderson will still be around after the summer, whereas Gibbs-White has a contract – but there surely comes a point at which players don’t trust Marinakis with their careers and just want to up sticks from the upheaval. Share\n\n1h ago 14.37 EST Bizarre goings-on in the Conference League – Fiorentina, 3-0 up on Jagiellonia Bialystock from the first leg, are now level at 3-3, Bartosz Mazurek having scored a hat-trick. Share\n\n1h ago 14.34 EST Back to Elliot Anderson, how good do we think he is? I like him a lot and have done since before he left Newcastle and perhaps I’m just being old here, but good though he is, when I put him then into historical context, I don’t see him as on the same planet as your Bryan Robsons, Roy Keanes, Patrick Vieiras, Paul Inces and Graeme Sounesseseseses of this world – same goes for Declan Rice. Share\n\n2h ago 14.28 EST Elsewhere, Celtic lead 1-0 in Stuttgart so trail 4-2 on aggregate. There are five minutes left – and don’t forget, it’s Ibrox on Sunday. Share\n\n2h ago 14.24 EST One Forest first-XIer who doesn’t drop top the bench is Elliot Anderson. On the one hand, I’m certain the manager would like to rest him for the league but, on the other, he can’t run the risk of letting this get close, never mind actually lose, and I guess Anderson and Murillo are the players he reckons he most needs to make sure that doesn’t happen. Share\n\n2h ago 14.21 EST Fener, meanwhile, are in the midst of an injury crisis – Ederson, Oosterwolde and the one and only Caglar Soyuncu are out so yes, that is indeed Matteo Guendouzi whose name you see at centre-back – no doubt he already considers himself better than Beckenbauer. Otherwise, Ngolo Kanté is in midfield, while Marco Asensio and Nelson Semedo are on the bench. Share\n\n2h ago 14.18 EST Unsurprisingly, Vitor Pereira makes changes – six of them. Out go Milenkovic, Aina, Sangaré, Hudson-Odoi, Gibbs-White and Igor Jesus; in come Morato, Jair Cunha, Dominguez, McAtee, Yates and Lucca Share\n\n2h ago 14.09 EST Teams Nottingham Forest (5-4-1): Ortega; Williams, Morato, Murillo, Jair Cunha, Hutchinson; McAtee, Anderson, Yates, Dominguez; Lucca. Subs: Gunn, Willows, Sangaré, Hudson-Odoi, Gibbs-White, Ndoye, Igor Jesus, Bakwa, Milenkovic, Ainoa, Abbott.

            "content": "Chelsea made a financial loss of £355m in the 2024-25 season, according to new data released by Uefa, the biggest deficit ever recorded by an English football club.\n\nAccording to Uefa, Chelsea’s losses were more than double the ­second-worst in Europe, the £171m posted by Lyon. The figures are also about £260m worse than those posted by the Blues in 2023-24.\n\nWhile Uefa’s report does not fully break down Chelsea’s figures, it does show that while they have spent money on a level with the top clubs in Europe, costs have not been matched by revenues. Chelsea’s wage bill is estimated to be the sixth-highest in Europe, at £390m a season. Chelsea’s operational expenditure, or day-to-day costs, were the fifth highest in Europe, meanwhile, at £241m. Uefa also calculate that the Blues have the most expensive squad in history, assembled at a combined cost of over £1.5bn.\n\nIn terms of matchday revenue, however, Chelsea made a reported £1.2m less per game than Liverpool, with Stamford Bridge only the 10th biggest ground in last season’s ­Premier League. Commercial revenue fell year-on-year to £207m, about £165m less than the figure reported by Manchester City and at odds with an overall trend for growth in this area. Chelsea did, though, increase their broadcast revenues, from £167m to £193m thanks in large part to their success at the Club World Cup.\n\nChelsea’s finances have been the subject of debate since the club was taken over by investment vehicle BlueCo in 2021. The men’s team has largely gone without a front of shirt sponsor in the intervening years, while the club have also become known for tying their players to long-term contracts, such as the eight-year deal given to the winger Mykhailo Mudryk, reported to be worth £100,000-a-week in wages. The Ukrainian is serving a provisional ­suspension for doping.\n\nThe ownership have also sold hotels on the club’s grounds to related businesses in order to meet the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules, a deal noted by Uefa in its report as being a significant contribution to the relative financial health of the league in 2023.\n\nAlso on the list of Europe’s ­biggest financial losers are Strasbourg. Ranking at No 8 in Uefa’s list, with reported losses of £69m, the Ligue 1 side are also owned by BlueCo and have spent increasingly substantial figures on transfer fees in the past three seasons. Many of those deals have been struck with Chelsea, including nine transfers from London in this season alone."

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final European fixture as a manager. He created such wonderful memories for Celtic’s support in this domain during his first tenure that departing with a smile felt appropriate. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts. “The evening is nothing to do with me,” said O’Neill with needless self deprecation.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal after 33 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered unexpected cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half – the hosts had 25 attempts at goal – but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that is worthy of huge credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have delivered a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite both sets of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday, at the start of a spell that will define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart had managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ragged and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe only goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. “I got carried away with myself,” O’Neill said later. “I thought ‘we are going to do this here’.”\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nSebastian Hoeness used the interval to replace Jamie Leweling with Chris Führich. The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm clash. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident appeared as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were only 25 minutes from that maiden win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly cancelled for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious; Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement albeit the officials had ushered him back on to the pitch. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says the salvage operation he has taken on at Tottenham is tougher than he envisaged and most likely his hardest job in management.\n\nThe interim coach, who is preparing for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Fulham, has worked with his new squad since the beginning of last week, having replaced the sacked Thomas Frank. Tudor lost his first game 4-1 at home to Arsenal on Sunday, which left Spurs four points above the relegation zone.\n\nAn alarming fitness situation has improved slightly with the return to training of Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso, meaning Tudor will be without eight injured players at Fulham, plus the suspended Cristian Romero, though Micky van de Ven is expected to be fit.\n\nSpurs are without a win in nine league matches and Tudor’s eyes are wide open about the scale of the task. “Probably, yes … I agree with you,” Tudor said when asked whether the role was more difficult than expected.\n\n“It’s very tough … but it is how it is. So daily work, focus, raising in all things we need to do – physical condition, mental confidence, performance – and waiting for the [injured] players to come back.”\n\nTudor started work as a manager in 2013 and is now in his 12th job. Is Spurs the biggest challenge? “Probably,” he said. “If I recognise the difficulties there are, probably, yes. It’s an even bigger challenge, an even bigger motivation to do this and we do it.”\n\nTudor described Spurs’ plight before the Arsenal game as an “emergency situation” and he warmed to the theme before another derby. “It’s not looking to the style at this moment,” he said. “Because now it’s a question of life and death.\n\n“There is not too much time to think about performance or style. Every game needs to be prepared in that way. How we can take these points, one way or the other?\n\n“In Italy, they use the term ‘have the mentality of a small team’. That is the key, to always have motivation when you play big teams. So that’s the start, of course, and we work a lot on that. The players are aware of the situation.”\n\nLike Frank before him, Tudor refused to use the R word – relegation. “I never used it but not because it’s something too scary or it’s a danger word or we won’t sleep,” he said. “It’s about that we need to refocus on ourselves.”"

            "content": "The Premier League is to launch its own streaming service, with live coverage of all 380 matches over a season available directly to fans – but only if you live in Singapore.\n\nKnown as Premier League Plus, the new app will be launched before next season and will be the first time match coverage will be sold direct to consumers.\n\nDescribed by the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, as simply being a “learning” opportunity, the move will still cause shockwaves throughout the game as the world’s biggest domestic football league moves to directly control its revenues without the need for a broadcast partner.\n\n“From next season onward, from August, Premier League Plus is going to happen,” Masters said. “For the first time the Premier League is going to have its own customers. We’re looking to build a business, but we’re also looking to learn to see how that might be replicable around the world.”\n\nMasters told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London that Premier League Plus would be offered in partnership with the existing rights holder, Starhub, and would be a “24-seven” service.\n\n“It’s going to be a really exciting product, and the big change is I think that the Premier League will have its own customers and means us delving into things like promotion and pricing,” said Masters. “That’s why it’s an important step for us.”\n\nThe idea of a “Premflix” offering has been speculated on for a number of years. Premier League club owners have backed the idea, with Chelsea’s Todd Boehly telling the FT conference last year that the league should sell its global rights direct to the streaming service Netflix. Instead, the Premier League has gone for a trial approach, with Masters telling an audience of industry insiders that international broadcast revenues had grown by 27% through the latest three-year rights cycle.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Premier League’s Richard Masters says its new app is ‘an important step for us’. Photograph: Jon Super/AP\n\nAlso appearing at the conference was the chair of the Independent Football Regulator, David Kogan. He called on the Premier League and EFL to come to a new “long-term sustainable agreement” over financial redistribution, arguing that it would lead to “less regulation” in the future.\n\nKogan also reaffirmed that parachute payments, which have been a barrier to any resolution between the Premier League and EFL, would come under scrutiny as part of the forthcoming State of the Game review. “Parachute payments are not going to vanish overnight,” Kogan said, “[but] the discussion about parachute payments is a fundamental part of the discussion about distribution.”\n\nThe chair of the EFL, Rick Parry, also speaking at the summit, said that parachute payments had represented 6% of EFL turnover when introduced in 1992, but by the 2018-19 season had reached 173% of turnover. The wage bill of clubs in receipt of the payments was more than double that of the rest of the Championship. “The Premier League chase is the most expensive lottery ticket on the planet,” he said.\n\nKogan said he believed the “backstop” option which would allow the regulator to impose a distribution deal would not need to be activated and that the leagues would come to a deal independently. Masters said that while “we’re all agreed we want a strong pyramid”, he thought “it should be left to the organisations to come up with these agreements”."

            "content": "Senne Lammens revels in the “war” of being Manchester United’s goalkeeper in the hugely physical Premier League yet remains bemused at being applauded when entering a primary school classroom on a Wednesday afternoon.\n\nClearly the 23-year-old is still adjusting to a rocketing career trajectory. Following his £18m transfer from Royal Antwerp on 1 September, Lammens made his debut in the 2-0 win against Sunderland on 4 October, and established himself as the first choice with a faultless start that featured five clean sheets in 21 league games.\n\nTo do so in the relentless glare at United is impressive. In Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton, Lammens was again calm and assured, producing vital saves while navigating the hurly-burly of set pieces and corners as players crowded his goalmouth.\n\nView image in fullscreen Senne Lammens is first to the ball while under pressure from Everton’s Thierno Barry as the United goalkeeper keeps another clean sheet. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n\nLammens shrugs when considering the chaos he faces at dead balls. “Physically Everton was a big battle, a big game so I’m still recovering from that,” Lammens says. “It’s been like this. It’s just the way it is – the Premier League, it’s physicality and a bit of war in the 18-yard box.”\n\nAt 6ft 4in and with a robust frame, the young Belgian is built for the game’s demands. “It’s one of my strengths,” he says, “so sometimes I like the challenge as well. Of course it can get too much sometimes but everyone has to deal with it. It’s not like only one team does it, it’s everyone in general.\n\n“As a goalkeeper you have to get used to that and train for it and get better at it. I’ve been doing a good job at it so I’ll continue to do that. The club said to me that it was the most physical. It’s the best league but the physicality is the biggest difference. We do it as well sometimes, making it hard for the goalkeeper.\n\n“In Belgium it’s less physical but still the principles are the same. Here there are a bit more bodies in front of you, but my team has helped me out with blocking guys. You have to be big and not be pushed around easily.”\n\nLammens suggests that greater protection for keepers may have to be considered. “There have to be certain rules,” he says. “You can’t get to the point where it’s too [unfair]. That’s something the Premier League has to look towards.”\n\nLammens made his debut for Club Brugge in July 2021 before moving to Antwerp two years later. He remained uncapped at senior level for Belgium until November’s 7-0 win over Liechtenstein, replacing one of his heroes. “Thibaut Courtois was always a big thing when I was growing up because his saving is just world class,” Lammens says of the 33-year-old Real Madrid goalkeeper.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘You have to be big and not be pushed around easily,’ says the 23-year-old. Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Shutterstock\n\nBayern Munich’s 39-year-old Manuel Neuer was another source of inspiration. “When I was growing up my biggest idol was probably Neuer,” he says. “I take pride in being an all-around goalkeeper and that’s why I was such a big fan because he didn’t really have a weak point, so that’s something I want to take from him. But I try to learn something from everyone because everyone has strong points.”\n\nLammens is speaking at a Manchester United Foundation event at Partington Central Academy for World Book Day. The surprise at being cheered by pupils draws comparison with being ambushed by paparazzi this month when leaving the Ivy in Manchester after dining with his partner.\n\n“That was one of the more special moments. Special, like I couldn’t believe it. It’s not always the best feeling – they weren’t too bad. But for my girlfriend and I this was the first time with paparazzi. Looking back, it was quite funny. The club warned me that Manchester United is a different animal, especially social media wise.\n\n“It’s a bit new for me, but it’s also probably one of my best feelings when you go into [schools] and see all those children cheering for you and they don’t believe it’s you. Because I was there once in my life, it’s not that long ago. I still remember those times.”\n\nAway from the game, Lammens reads – his favourite book is Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist – and follows other sports. “I don’t really watch a lot of football because on a daily basis you’re doing a lot with football,” he says. “You want to switch off mentally. Of course you still have to watch other people play but everyone has his own experiences so the best learning school is yourself, your own experiences.\n\n“I’m a big sports guy. I love watching other sports and other athletes do their thing. Especially how they prepare for the game and think about their game. Like in the NBA and with, for example, Kobe Bryant or LeBron James.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Lammens with the pupils of Partington Central Academy. Photograph: MUFC\n\nAfter being recommended by Tony Coton, United’s goalkeeping scout, as the replacement for the erratic André Onana, Lammens has developed a rewarding working relationship with Tom Heaton, the third-choice keeper. He served early notice of his quality when gathering a corner with authority against Sunderland. It drew a rousing cheer from the Old Trafford faithful.\n\n“It was really nice getting the support from the fans and my teammates, the best feeling in the beginning. And they also gave me even more confidence to keep going and to make the steps I did after that.”\n\nIn an improving campaign under Michael Carrick that has garnered 16 points from the interim manager’s first six games, Lammens wants to maintain consistency. “I don’t really want to look too much into the past,” he says. “It’s been great but I still have to prove myself every week. I just have to keep going now. It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world but also you have to look through that – it’s still a game of football, the game isn’t that much different.”"

            "content": "The big winners\n\nBodø/Glimt’s 2-1 defeat of Inter at San Siro continued this season’s miracle. The post-match discussion between Inter coach Cristian Chivu and his opposite number, Kjetil Knutsen, was one of admiration, an acknowledgment the Norwegian team had been too good for the runaway Serie A leaders. Even though Inter were without Lautaro Martínez, their standard bearer, a comeback seemed likely as they dominated the early stages. But they found no way through, eventually falling victim to the high-quality, high-speed attacking that had left them with a 3-1 deficit to overcome from the first leg.\n\n“The hardest thing was to create an opening,” lamented Inter’s Nicolò Barella of the long spell of toil that preceded Jens Petter Hauge stabbing in his sixth goal in this season’s competition before Håkon Evjen completed a counter and sealed progress with a brilliant strike.\n\n“We tried everything we could,” Chivu said. Like Manchester City and Atlético Madrid before them, Inter were dumbfounded by the team laying claim to be Scandinavia’s best since IFK Gothenburg picked up two Uefa Cups in the 1980s and reached the European Cup semi-final in 1986.\n\nGalatasaray are into the last 16 after goals by Victor Osimhen and Barış Alper Yilmaz in extra time at Juventus. That tells nothing of the full story of a classic tie, which almost became a classic comeback. Probably the main reason Juve did not fully overturn their 5-2 first-leg deficit was the dismissal of Lloyd Kelly, a red card awarded by video assistant when the on-field official had already awarded a second yellow. How video officials reached that decision was mysterious, controversial; Kelly looked to have accidentally landed on Yilmaz. The Englishman initially believed VAR would come to his rescue but stormed down the tunnel. He missed out on the ecstatic scenes that followed Weston McKennie levelling the tie at 5-5. In injury time, though, Juve ran out of legs, counting the cost of a third red card in four matches.\n\nIn Wednesday’s earlier game, Atalanta had already preserved the dignity of Serie A with a 4-1 defeat of Borussia Dortmund. Atalanta trailed 2-0 from the first leg but perhaps we should have paid attention to a telling stat before kick-off: there has been an Italian team in the last 16 of the competition every season since 1987-88. In Bergamo, Mario Pašalić’s header put Atalanta 3-2 up on aggregate, only for Karim Adeyemi’s lovely goal to push the tie towards extra time. The denouement was bizarre: Dortmund defender Ramy Bensebaini was sent off after his studs caught the head of Atalanta’s Nikola Krstović in the penalty area as he attempted a backheel flick. Lazar Samardžić stepped up in the ninth minute of added time, with all Atalanta’s usual penalty takers subbed off, to score the spot-kick. He lashed it home to maintain the honour of Italian calcio.\n\nJosé Mourinho has now lost his last 10 Champions League knockout ties. At Real Madrid, parking the Benfica bus did not prove a successful strategy. Although this time it was a literal bus: Mourinho, banned after his red card in the first leg, watched the second leg sat in the team coach. Benfica scored first at the Santiago Bernabéu against a rather languid Madrid through Rafa Silva, only to leave space for Aurélien Tchouaméni to score from distance. In the 80th minute, Vinícius Júnior scored the decider of an edgy match, issuing the final word on a tie that concluded with relative calm. The fallout from last week’s first leg, in which Benfica’s Gianluca Prestianni was accused of racially abusing Vinícius, may continue for some time. “Mourinho and I were in contact and share the same feeling: frustration and pride,” said Benfica’s assistant coach, João ­Tralhão. Mourinho’s thoughts remain private. For now, at least.\n\nPlayer of the week\n\nIt all came up Norway, as Alexander Sørloth, the one-time Bodø/Glimt loanee, scored the treble for Atlético Madrid that ended Club Brugge’s participation. Sørloth will probably partner Erling Haaland at the summer’s World Cup. The 30-year-old has a harsh journeyman reputation but his skillset has found its home within a Diego Simeone team undergoing a reboot. The hat-trick was Sørloth’s fifth goal in two matches, after a weekend double against Espanyol. They said it\n\n“There are moments when you lose precision and it’s difficult to recover the level.” Luis Enrique breathed a sigh of relief after Paris Saint-Germain’s 2-2 draw with Monaco, who had Mamadou Coulibaly harshly sent off and missed a golden chance to level the tie when Wout Faes headed wide. As it was, the holders squeezed through 5-4 on aggregate. They remain unconvincing, and are yet to find the stride of last season.\n\nThe pundit’s chair\n\n“Italian teams play at a slow pace. When they find teams that play press and run, they don’t have the quality, aren’t accustomed to playing at a high pace, and make mistakes … As soon as they increase the pace in Serie A, they are stopped because a challenge is too hard, a player’s ear is touched, and they go down. These are the results. We play at a slow pace, unfortunately, and when it happens, it’s hard to be dangerous.” Champions League-winning coach Fabio Capello, speaking after Inter’s exit on Sky Italia, diagnoses the Serie A malaise.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nFriday’s last 16 draw takes place in Nyon, Switzerland, and the playoffs, or “punishment round” as some insiders term it, have opened up some potentially huge ties. Paris Saint-Germain face either Barcelona or Chelsea. Galatasaray’s reward is one of Liverpool or Tottenham, whose interim coach Igor Tudor had a stint with the Turkish club.\n\nManchester City could face familiar foes: Real Madrid, with whom they have clashed plenty of times before in recent years, or Bodø/Glimt, who shocked them in January. There’s also the potential of an all-English tie in Newcastle v Chelsea, and an all-German one in Bayer Leverkusen v Bayern Munich."

            "content": "A number of European football federations fear they will lose money sending their national teams to the World Cup this summer, with an unusual hike in costs and inconsistencies around tax exemptions among the problems Fifa is being urged to rectify.\n\nAlthough Fifa approved record prize money of £539m for the tournament last December it may not be enough to prevent losses, or reduced profits, for competitors who would usually expect a World Cup to generate vital funds. An investigation by the Guardian and PA Media found particular concerns among football associations about the consequences of missing out on money that would largely be reinvested in local initiatives.\n\nAbout 10 FAs are understood to have shared misgivings between themselves, most recently at Uefa’s annual congress in Brussels a fortnight ago. It has also been informally raised with senior Fifa officials, some of whom appear “embarrassed” about the situation according to an executive from one FA.\n\nTeams that qualify receive $9m (£6.7m) each from Fifa and are handed $1.5m in preparation costs. Those numbers are believed to have been the same for Qatar 2022, but the previous daily allowance of $850 per delegation member has been reduced to $600. One FA estimated that this would mean receiving about $500,000 less if its team remained at the World Cup, which has been expanded in length and number, for a month.\n\nSome FAs have calculated that they will make considerably less money in the US, Canada and Mexico than they did in Qatar; one, a fixture at international tournaments, told the Guardian it will in fact lose a sizeable sum in the event of elimination in the group stage or early in the knockout rounds.\n\nOne particularly aggravating element is a perceived unfairness around tax arrangements. Countries bidding for a World Cup are obliged to provide tax exemptions for FAs that qualify; those have been agreed with Canada and Mexico but no such arrangement has been reached with the US, meaning that nations potentially face vastly differing financial outlooks depending on where they were drawn to play.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Qatar World Cup cost less and was more lucrative for teams, with clear tax arrangements. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nState taxes within the US vary wildly. In California, where Los Angeles and San Francisco will host games, the top rate is 13.3%. In New Jersey, whose MetLife Stadium will stage the final, it stands at 10.75%. Teams largely based in states with lower rates, or outside the US, will find themselves at an advantage financially unless an agreement is reached in the next three and a half months. Given that context, there is also frustration that FAs have been left to seek their own tax advice rather than being given specific assistance by Fifa.\n\nOther factors hiking costs include the tournament’s considerable travel demands, unfavourable exchange rates against the dollar, the well-publicised increase in ticket prices and the event’s duration. In Qatar there were four weeks between the opening game and final; this time around the 28-day mark will arrive as the quarter-finals commence.\n\nWhile some figures acknowledge that FAs are responsible for their own bonus structures, which inevitably make for a notable outlay, they point out it would be unworkable to offer a reduced package to that which was promised to their squads in Qatar. Another mitigation offered for this summer’s problems is the potential longer-term benefit of lengthy exposure to the vast North American market. Fifa was contacted for comment."

At first it seemed like the closing of a door, but then the whole house moved.”\n\n\n\nThe National Geographic Institute has listed the towns where the earthquake was felt with varying intensities.\n\nBreaking news… More to come…"

That man was on bail for domestic violence against Mary, and he still went back and killed her. So do not tell me a licence is going to stop him.\n\n“I want to see him die in prison, and I hope and pray to God that every night he closes his eyes, he thinks of Mary and she haunts him.”\n\nThe Parole Board confirmed a panel had directed Williams’ release.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Parole Board decisions are solely focused on what risk a prisoner could represent to the public if released and whether that risk is manageable in the community.\n\n“A panel will carefully examine a huge range of evidence, including details of the original crime, and any evidence of behaviour change, as well as explore the harm done and the impact the crime has had on the victims.\n\n\n\n“Members read and digest hundreds of pages of evidence and reports in the lead-up to an oral hearing.\n\n“Evidence from witnesses such as probation officers, psychiatrists and psychologists, officials supervising the offender in prison, as well as victim’s personal statements may be given at the hearing.\n\n“It is standard for the prisoner and witnesses to be questioned at length during the hearing, which often lasts a full day or more.\n\n“Parole reviews are undertaken thoroughly and with extreme care. Protecting the public is our number one priority.”\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nFor Mary’s family, though, the horror did not end in 2005.\n\n\n\nNow they face the agonising prospect that killer could soon be free."

(Image: Gabriel Mello via Getty Images)\n\nShould you allow your dog to sleep on the furniture? It's a long-running debate that often divides pet owners, but a recent perspective from one trainer could finally resolve it.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWill Atherton, a canine behaviourist from Derbyshire, has years of experience in his field, having worked with numerous dogs displaying various behavioural problems, including biting. He revealed that people regularly ask him whether dogs should be permitted on sofas, beds, and other furniture - and provided a thorough response.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Should your dog be allowed on the furniture?\" he asked in a TikTok during 2025. \"And that’s a question I get all the time. And for me, it completely is up to you. I have a few little rules about it.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nFirst and foremost, Will urged viewers to consider whether their pet has any ongoing attitude problems. While he didn't specify what these might entail, they could range from aggressive behaviour to overly excitable jumping.\n\nWhen a dog is causing significant disruption at home, Will suggested that it might be advisable not to allow them on the sofa. However, if the dog is generally well-behaved, it should be acceptable as long as clear boundaries are set.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe said: \"If you don’t have any big behaviour problems with your dog, then I think you can absolutely have them on the furniture if you want them. If you don’t want them on the furniture, that’s completely fine.\n\n\"But if they are going to go on the furniture, my thought is that they shouldn’t be allowed to have free access to jump up and off whenever they want. It should look like this.\"\n\nTo demonstrate his point, Will gestured to Sully, a large dog perched on the floor beside his sofa. Will then continued: \"They should wait with good manners, sitting, looking up to you for guidance and direction, and waiting for you to say, 'up'.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUpon command, Sully leapt up to join Will on the settee. \"And they can jump on and they can have a cuddle,\" he said. \"And the most important thing is that just as well-mannered as getting on the furniture with you, it should be just as easy - Sully, off.\"\n\nView 2 Images The dog expert stressed that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to the issue (Image: Justin Paget via Getty Images)\n\nIn no time at all, Sully was back on the floor, following instructions. With this in mind, Will concluded: \"If you can do that and you don’t have any problems with your dog elsewhere and you want them to come and have a cuddle on the sofa, then do so.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite attempting to settle the dogs-on-furniture debate, Will's video still sparked division among viewers online. Among those disagreeing, one individual commented: \"I don't have to ask anyone to have access to my sofa, why should my dog?\"\n\nAt the time, another person also wrote: \"I am not a control freak,\" as someone else said: \"My dogs are a part of my family, so they can go wherever they want to without asking to go there.\"\n\nHowever, others completely agreed with Will's perspective. One user wrote: \"My boys love being on the couch and I love having a snuggle with them on the couch, but they know when I say they need to get off, they do! And same for coming up!\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"It’s so refreshing to hear a trainer who doesn’t want to just limit a dog's life and surroundings and doesn’t guilt owners for wanting to share the space.\" Meanwhile, another wrote: \"Mine has free access to the furniture but when I tell him to get off, he does.\"\n\nWhat do you think?

Scientists say it is not connected to the seismic swarms being registered for the last two weeks under Tenerife's Mount Teide - and stress an eruption is not imminent.\n\nPeople reported rooms vibrating and furniture shaking as a result of the earthquake, which happened today at 12.26pm at a depth of 10km. \"In 1989, in this same area, an earthquake of 5.3 was recorded that was felt throughout the island of Tenerife,\" said IGN volcanologist Rubén López, who dissociated this earthquake from the recent rebound in seismicity in the Cañadas del Teide area.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Given its magnitude and the depth of its hypocentre, the quake generated numerous reports.\n\n\"It lasted about ten seconds and was more noticeable than ever, moving the whole house,\" said one resident of Agaete in Gran Canaria. \"It went from less to more. At first it seemed like the closing of a door, but then the whole house moved.\"\n\nThe National Geographic Institute has listed the towns where the earthquake was felt with varying intensities. The tremor was felt in more than 100 population centres across the two main islands. Included in these towns are a number of tourist hotspots including Los Cristianos in Tenerife and Las Palmas on Gran Canaria.\n\nNo material or personal damage of any consideration has been reported. Scientists are meeting again tomorrow to discuss the thousands of vibrations which have been monitored under Mount Teide on Tenerife.\n\nThey say an eruption is not imminent in the short or medium term as the signs would be very different. However, they want all municipalities in Tenerife to update their emergency plans, saying residents in places such as Iceland all know exactly what to do if there was an eruption.\n\nTenerife's government says the island has the best and most extensive monitoring system and insists there is no cause for anyone to be concerned."

Elliot Bristow, 36, ran a mile from the scene to hide after smashing his car into a wall - leaving back seat passenger Olivia Lewis, 24, trapped inside. He was found by police cowering in a bush, only to lie to officers during his arrest as he told them: \"I wasn't even driving.\" Father-of-five Bristow had smoked two cannabis spliffs and drank cups of vodka and lemonade while driving around South Wales at night in August 2024.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

The court heard Bristow had not disclosed a previous diagnosis of epilepsy to the DVLA - and following the crash had his licence revoked.

You were found later about a mile away, cowering in a bush, as you were arrested you denied being the driver.\"\n\nIn a statement after her death, Olivia's family said: \"Olivia was our beautiful daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece, aunty, and friend. She was kind, caring and funny, and was our little rock when we needed her. She would go out of her way to help anyone in need.\n\n\"Olivia was a quiet girl, but was the life and soul of any party; she loved to sing and dance, and her smile would light a room.

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980.

'Definitely world championship material in a different era.

He def was the neighborhood Uncle for alot of us.\n\nCastillo later served as an announcer on many WBC fights from the Forum in Los Angeles\n\n'A Family man, Boxer, Charity planner, we lost. Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God. May his wife Cindy, family and friends find comfort with the support of the so many who loved Ruben. Rest in eternal peace.'"

The cameras were forced to cut away before medics attended to the fighter.\n\nReplays show that late in the first round, the two boxers clashed heads, with George coming away dazed and shaken. It appears this was the reason for his sudden fall to the canvas.\n\nThe 36-year-old made it back to his feet following medical attention and was taken to a Detroit hospital to be monitored. Oberlton was then awarded the victory by technical knockout, extending his unbeaten record to 15 wins.\n\nFrightening scenes in Detroit. Light heavyweight Joseph George suffered a head clash in the first round and then collapsed during the break between rounds. 😱\n\n\n\n#ShieldsCrewsDezurn2 pic.twitter.com/qH3AMEoDgw — Permante (@PermantexG) February 23, 2026\n\nJoseph George had to be rushed to hospital after collapsing during his fight with Atif Oberlton\n\nHylon Williams, George's trainer, has since confirmed that the fighter is 'undergoing an MRI' and is 'in stable condition at a Detroit hospital'.\n\nOberlton confirmed that he did get the chance to speak to George as he was escorted out of the ring, but he was 'a bit confused'.\n\n'I'm so glad that he got up on his feet and that he's OK,' said Oberlton. 'I'm a true champion, true warrior. We can do whatever you want to do it, but I'm just happy that he's OK.\n\n'I just wanted to make sure he was safe. At the end of the day, we're warriors, but we want to leave here the same way we come out.'\n\nLater in the night, Shields defended her undisputed heavyweight championship in dominant fashion, dispatching Crews-Dezurn by unanimous decision.\n\n\n\nThe 30-year-old American won 100-90 on all three judges' scorecards and remains unbeaten in her professional career, with a record of 18 wins."

            "content": "Tyson Fury's comeback opponent, Arslanbek Makhmudov, has sensationally been filmed wrestling a bear ahead of their April bout.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on April 11.\n\nAnd 36-year-old Makhmudov, who has a 21-2 record and a knockout ratio of over 90 per cent, has been seen going to extreme measures to train himself up ahead of their meeting, including wrestling a 'three-metre tall and 400kg' brown bear.\n\nIn the video, Makhmudov can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm. The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "Ian Wright suggested that some of Tottenham's biggest stars are unwilling to give new interim manager Igor Tudor a chance, after Micky Van de Ven appeared to blank him during the north London derby.\n\nAppointed following the overdue sacking of Thomas Frank earlier this month, Tudor arrived with the challenging brief of ensuring that Spurs avoid relegation.\n\nThe Europa League champions currently sit 16th and only four points away from 18th-placed West Ham - and Tudor's arrival in the capital was made no easier by his first match in charge being the north London derby.\n\nAs Spurs fell 4-1 to Arsenal at home, Tudor was spotted apparently giving vocal instructions to Van de Ven from the sidelines, only for the defender to fail to acknowledge him.\n\nFor Wright, the fact that the players were not eager to engage with their new head coach was a troubling sign.\n\n'Against Arsenal I saw Igor Tudor try to speak to Van de Ven, he blanked him, totally blanked him,' Wright said to his co-hosts on The Overlap's Stick To Football podcast.\n\nIgor Tudor appeared to be ignored by Micky Van de Ven just days into his tenure as Tottenham interim head coach\n\n'That says to me they have checked out already.'\n\nGary Neville thought that Wright's verdict was a 'harsh' one, while Roy Keane argued that the players 'did that with' Frank, but the Arsenal legend was in no mood to back down.\n\n'This guy is new, he wants him to come up and Van de Ven just looks at him and stays there,' Wright continued. 'You think to yourself, that doesn't look good. That does not look good.'\n\nFor his part, Tudor denied conflict between himself and Van de Ven on Thursday afternoon, sharing that he had been addressing the whole team.\n\n'If you watch carefully, I don't speak to him (in that moment),' Tudor said in his pre-Premier League weekend press conference. 'Afterwards, I said to him to come closer, and he comes closer.\n\n'We didn't talk about it because nothing happened. He's a fantastic professional and a fantastic guy, he would not do something like (ignoring me).'\n\nBelgium head coach Roberto Martinez stressed that whatever Tudor can do to ensure Spurs do not spend next season in the Championship, his first order of business should be 'accepting where they are' at this stage in the campaign.\n\n'When I was at Wigan you almost prepared for that last third of the season because that is your opportunity,' Martinez said. 'The last third for us was that we are going to get out of trouble.\n\n'The problem is when you are going into the last third hoping you are not going to get dragged down into a relegation battle because your club wasn't ready for that. This is where it becomes very, very dangerous.\n\nThe stop-gap manager has a challenging task attempting to keep Spurs from the drop - and began his reign with a dismal north London derby\n\n'What happens now is that you should forget about these general terms that \"we shouldn't get dragged down\", what does this mean to a player (looking to hear) \"do I need to run more, less\".\n\n'It is basic language (you use to a player) about everything you can control, \"you have to do 12km, six sprints into the box and run to the near post\". Everything has to be so measurable. It is about winning the next game.'\n\nSpurs' torrid winter has been only exacerbated by a number of injuries to key players leaving their squad painfully short.\n\nBut Martinez was keen to warn that Spurs cannot wait for stars to return and simply expect fortunes to change.\n\n'I think Spurs will get one or two players back from injury, you win a game and then you have got too much (of a gap),' he added.\n\n'The problem is there are no easy games in the Premier League. As a player at Spurs you might think there are easy games we can win, no - there are no easy games. It is about reducing that to, it is the next game and you have an opportunity to get points rather than if you don't win and you are out.\n\n'The moment that the club see it as \"wow, if we don't win...\" - the mindset is so negative and it drags you down. We have seen teams that are \"too good to go down\" go down because they weren't prepared for that final third of the season.'\n\nSpurs will stay in London for their next Premier League test, travelling to Craven Cottage to play Fulham on Sunday."

'I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. So, I can't do anything about it.'\n\nUSA hockey star Brady Tkachuk has fumed over an AI-edited video posted by the White House\n\nWarning - strong language below\n\nWhen asked if he enjoyed the video, he added: 'It's not my voice. It's not what I was saying.\n\n'I would never say that. That's not who I am, so I guess I don't like that video because that would never come out of my mouth and never had that thought.'\n\nTrump also sparked controversy after footage of his phone call with the victorious men's team surfaced on social media.\n\nWhile congratulating them on winning gold, the President joked that he was also 'going to have to bring the women's team' to Washington after they too got past Canada in the final.\n\nHe then added that he 'probably would be impeached' if he didn't extend the invitation to America's female hockey champions.\n\nThe women's team subsequently turned down Trump's invitation due to 'scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games.'\n\nAnd Tkachuk said he understood why they could have felt insulted by his locker-room joke, which some have labeled misogynistic.\n\nDonald Trump has sparked outrage in the wake of both the men's and women's team's wins\n\nMembers of the men's Olympic hockey team still attended his address to Congress on Tuesday\n\n'I mean, I get it,' he said before detailing the positive relationship between the men's and women's teams. 'We support them, they support us. You can't control what other people say. It was fun being around them, seeing how they play and the excellence around them.\n\n'If I see one of them, we'll talk about the excitement of what we can control, which is to be gold medalists.'\n\nTkachuk was also accused by some of shouting 'Close the northern border!' during the congratulatory call with Trump, but he stressed: 'It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.'\n\nDuring his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Trump announced that the USA women's team will still be visiting the White House at a later date despite rejecting his first invitation.\n\n\n\n'They beat a fantastic Canadian team in overtime, as everybody saw. As did the American women who will soon be coming to the White House,' he told a filled chamber of Congress."

            "content": "VfB Stuttgart 0 Celtic 1: Martin O'Neill's side exit Europe with their heads held high after first win on German soil\n\nThey did not go gentle into the night. As expected, Celtic’s interest in the Europa League came to an end. The manner in which the curtain came down on Martin O’Neill and his players for another year proved to be a pleasant surprise for all who witnessed it.\n\nHaving watched their side being torn asunder 4-1 in the first leg in Glasgow last week, many visiting supporters might have questioned the wisdom in leaving the bars in Stuttgart in the afternoon for a vantage point in the MHP Arena.\n\nBluntly, seeing Celtic fall to a worse aggregate defeat than the 5-0 hammering by Juventus 16 years ago seemed eminently possible.\n\nBy the end of the evening, though, those fears were wholly misplaced. A much-changed side showed character in abundance and left the stage with their heads held high.\n\nThey ran their hearts out and restored a degree of pride by showing the kind of spirit which has been conspicuous by its absence far too often this season.\n\nWhile there was to be no miraculous turnaround, a little bit of history was created nonetheless; For the first time since they first participated in Europe, Celtic won on German soil.\n\nIf there is such a thing as a good way to exit a tournament then this was certainly it.\n\nMartin O'Neill salutes the away fans after his Celtic side won 1-0 away to Stuttgart\n\nO’Neill’s men struck early through Luke McCowan and didn’t roll over when Stuttgart eventually came at them.\n\nTo register a clean sheet in such circumstances against a team presently sitting fourth in the Bundesliga was a highly commendable achievement.\n\nIt should do wonders for the confidence of all concerned. The outcome might just be the turning point in what’s been an extremely challenging season.\n\nAhead of the trip to Ibrox on Sunday, the veteran manager now has some selection headaches of the right kind.\n\nThis display was simply night and day from the dismal show O’Neill’s players produced as they capitulated seven days previously.\n\nPlaying with a freedom, their possession was connected and purposeful. They offered a threat whenever they advanced over the halfway line and gave little up cheaply at the back.\n\nAfter making eight changes, O’Neill didn’t have a failure on the night.\n\nViljami Sinisalo was assured in goal and made a compelling case to retain his spot.\n\nDane Murray kept things simple, Marcelo Saracchi dug deep and Junior Adamu used his physicality to occupy the Stuttgart central defenders.\n\nOff the boil lately, both Reo Hatate and Daizen Maeda issued reminders of their qualities while Hyun-jun Yang was sharp and threatening throughout.\n\nOn a night when many positives abounded, though, the performance of Luke McCowan was the standout.\n\nThe midfielder seemed to be everywhere until his legs could give no more - making blocks and supporting runs, carrying the ball, recycling it.\n\nClaimed in the opening minute, a first European goal will be a considerable consolation. It gave Celtic something to hang onto.\n\nTo stand any chance of pulling off a miracle, it was imperative that the visitors struck first.\n\nTo do so inside 30 seconds was beyond the wildest dreams of those who’d travelled across from Scotland.\n\nWith the Germans sloppy from kick-off, Callum McGregor stepped in and fed Yang. The winger in turn picked out Adamu who played in McCowan.\n\nExhibiting ice-cool composure, the midfielder rolled the ball away from Alexander Nubel and into the far corner. What an astonishing start.\n\nIt might soon have got even better. Adamu twisted his hips and delivered a dangerous low cross from the right. Maeda just couldn’t sort his feet out. The Germans briefly looked rattled.\n\nSebastian Hoeness’s men finally put a foot on the ball. Jamie Leweling smashed one on target. Sinisalo watched it all the way.\n\nBadredine Bouanani then unleashed a fierce left-footer which the Finn did exceptionally well to field.\n\nCeltic’s diligence on the back foot was exemplified by Yang racing back 30 yards to prevent Leweling letting fly after an intelligent link-up by Deniz Undav.\n\nWhile Bouanani’s attempt at converting Leweling’s deep cross was woeful, the pressure was mounting.\n\nColby Donovan had the toughest task of anyone on the pitch by trying to shackle Leweling. Turned inside out, he picked up the game’s first booking.\n\nCeltic still had their moments, notably from a string of corners. Nubel was fortunate that the referee adjudged Adamu to have impeded him as they contested one just before the break. Maeda should still have hit the target.\n\nTo Donovan’s relief, Leweling was surprisingly replaced at the break by Chris Fuhrich. The logic behind Hoeness’ thinking was soon made clear.\n\nShowing Donovan a clean pair of heels, the substitute crossed for Bouanani. Saracchi was in the right place at the right time to block.\n\nLuke McCowan scored the only goal of the game in the first minute of the match\n\nO’Neill replaced his young full-back with Tony Ralston with Adamu also making way for Tomas Cvancara.\n\nMaeda ought to have done better than fire straight into Nubel’s arms although the use of his hand would have ruled a goal out in any event.\n\nO’Neill was fizzing when the referee allowed play to go on when Tiago Tomas flattened McGregor. The energy Stuttgart were now showing was just as concerning.\n\nStepping onto his left foot, Bouanani’s strike from the edge of the box looked in all the way. An excellent stop by Sinisalo ensured the visitors kept breathing.\n\nFuhrich did beat the Celtic keeper with a stinging strike, but not the offside flag.\n\nO’Neill hit the gamble button with introductions of Seb Tounekti, Benjamin Nygren and Kelechi Iheanacho.\n\nCeltic were rightly angered when Stuttgart thought they’d levelled through Undav. Off the park for treatment, Ermedin Demirovic should never have been allowed to join in with an attack by the fourth official. Mercifully for the official, an offside flag came to his rescue.\n\nMurray’s outstanding block minutes later ensured Undav was again denied his moment. With the clock running down, Sinisalo again kept Fuhrich at bay by springing to his left.\n\nPlayed in by Iheanacho in the final minute, Tounekti worked the keeper but just not enough to set up a grandstand finish.\n\nCeltic were out. Just not in the manner that most expected.\n\nAnd so, 190 days after a goalless draw at home to Kairat Almaty, it ends.\n\nA rollercoaster of a run witnessed some crushing lows and some notable highs.\n\n\n\nO’Neill will be thankful that what’s likely to be his last European charge at least ended in the latter."

            "content": "On Thursday, a man called Justin Barnes had a meeting with another man called Julian Pitts – in a summit that could shape the future of the biggest club in England outside of the Premier League.\n\nBarnes is a close associate of Mike Ashley and has been described as the former Newcastle United owner’s ‘most powerful and abrasive lieutenant’. Pitts is the national managing partner for restructuring at administrators Begbies Traynor, who are overseeing the sale of crisis-hit Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nDaily Mail Sport understands the meeting had been in the diary for some time and was not called to discuss the club, but it is safe to assume that Wednesday will have featured heavily in Thursday’s conversation, 24 hours after the club’s proposed sale collapsed.\n\nIndeed, to those who believe Ashley – with his expertise in distressed businesses – may well be just what is needed in S6, the pre-planned meeting could be the first bit of good fortune to befall Wednesday for some time. Ashley was one of nine interested parties who provided proof of funding to the tune of £50m to Begbies. He also made a bid north of £20m.\n\nLate on Wednesday night that group of nine had an email from Begbies telling them the sale was back on, and that they had a week to make another offer after the Bord Group, who had blown everyone else out of the water with their belief-defying bid of £47.8m, withdrew from the process.\n\nAll of a sudden there is a deal to be done and to a man like Ashley, that could prove too much to resist.\n\nAll of a sudden there is a deal to be done for Sheffield Wednesday and to a man like Mike Ashley, that could prove too much to resist\n\nThe Bord Group's proposed takeover collapsed just three days after Wednesday suffered relegation to League One, at the home of their rivals Sheffield United\n\nThere are many hurdles to overcome for the Sports Direct supremo, and anyone else who fancies a challenge. Much has been made of the EFL’s ‘25p in the pound’ rule that means if a bid fails to provide such compensation to creditors, then the Owls will start next season in League One with a 15-point deduction – something that could prove fatal to attracting a buyer.\n\nSources believe there is a conversation to be had with both the EFL and the Independent Football Regulator. The biggest creditor by far is the club’s hated former owner Dejphon Chansiri, who is owed around £64m. Why should a buyer pay £16m to compensate him for his mistakes?\n\nThere are also non-negotiables for secured creditors. Around £7-8m secures control of the company that owns the stadium, football creditors total around £2.5m, mainly in outstanding fees. A hefty chunk of that is thought to relate to the signing of Ike Ugbo from Troyes, a forward who has subsequently scored zero goals in 54 Championship appearances.\n\nThe taxman is owed around £3m, with administrative and legal costs another £3m. Before you get to Chansiri, it’s already £16m. Double that and you avoid the 15 points. It is, according to those with knowledge of the process, highly unlikely that anyone – including Ashley – will be bidding anywhere near £32m.\n\nThe 25p rule was meant to negate the impact on local businesses. It was not brought in to pay for the wanton mistakes of an owner who nearly put a grand old club in the ground. To that end Ashley, or other interested parties, may even offer to pay that 25p to the non-secured creditors who are not called Chansiri. It is thought such a move would cost around £1.5m.\n\nShould it get to a place where this 159-year-old club stands or falls on a payment to Chansiri, it is hard to see the EFL insisting the money is handed over.\n\nThree or four of the nine have told administrators they remain keen, and Ashley’s main opposition appears to be the Storch group, who told BBC Radio Sheffield this week they are ready and waiting.\n\nBut according to insiders, few were amused last time they made a bid, only to significantly move the goalposts on deadline day by trying to include incentives for promotions to the Championship and Premier League rather than cash up front – of zero use to creditors, who tend to want to be paid now.\n\nThe biggest creditor by far is the club’s hated former owner Dejphon Chansiri, who is owed around £64m. Why should a buyer pay £16m to compensate him for his mistakes?\n\nAn advantage for Ashley and Storch is the transparency of their funding. Ashley would sail through tests given his businesses are based in the UK with information readily available at Companies House. Much of David Storch’s success has come from the aviation services industry in the United States and well-regulated businesses. Again, compliance with EFL and IFR requirements would not be an issue.\n\nSheffield-born entrepreneur Ryan Howsam explored the situation before the Bord group gained exclusivity on Christmas Eve, with a view to making his friend – ex-Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan – part of the management. Jordan lambasted the Chansiri situation on talkSPORT after the collapse while Howsam told local media he would not entertain an offer without assurances that no points deduction would be forthcoming.\n\nSo here we are. And yet there was relief inside Hillsborough when the deal collapsed. ‘It just never smelled right,’ said one club source. ‘It sounds like a really stupid thing to say but there’s a confidence that other, more suitable options are ready to step in.’\n\nHowever, an agent who has experience of dealing with the Bord group at Dunfermline Athletic has only praise. ‘If you put a player in at Dunfermline you get paid straight away,’ they said. As Daily Mail Sport revealed, they paid a non-refundable £2.5m deposit, and further sums paid to keep the club going means they have just set fire to £4m.\n\nGroup member Alsharif Faisal Bin Jamil blamed differences between the bid they had lodged, which later emerged to be that staggering £47.8m, and the actual value of the club. This newspaper asked how – given the amount of time that had passed and due diligence taken – the difference only came to light now.\n\nBin Jamil, a member of the Jordanian royal family, said a structural survey of Hillsborough, which highlighted the full extent of the finance needed, only landed on Monday. Some believe that is a smokescreen, and that the group had realised that they were unlikely to pass either the EFL’s Owners' and Directors' Test or the requirements of the Independent Football Regulator.\n\nSince administrators arrived in October, hundreds of thousands has already been spent on making the stadium safe, which will have given a clue to the costs needed. A local firm working on the South Stand did so for free on the promise they would be paid when the next tranche of EFL money landed in January.\n\nThe Bord group is now history, along with their £4m, and the hope is that Wednesday do not go the same way. Is that a real possibility? If no bid is forthcoming relatively soon it is difficult to see a future, not least because of those stadium costs. The fans’ trust could step in and scale everything back but they would need hundreds of thousands a year to fund an ageing, 40,000-capacity home.\n\nIf no new bidder is forthcoming, the club would need hundreds of thousands a year to fund the maintenance of Hillsborough, their ageing, 40,000-capacity home\n\nIt is to be hoped the ghost of Chansiri does not continue to haunt Sheffield Wednesday\n\nAshley is a man with an eye for a bargain and Wednesday are approaching that territory.\n\nDespite all the problems, this is a club with a huge fanbase and huge potential. Should he get things right, £20m may seem a snip in a few years’ time.\n\nMuch will depend on any points deduction – if a year in League One is difficult to stomach, two may prove impossible. One avenue may be to press for the deduction to be delivered in this already-doomed season.\n\nIt is to be hoped the ghost of Dejphon Chansiri does not continue to haunt Sheffield Wednesday."

            "content": "Chelsea suffer largest ever pre-tax loss of £350MILLION in 2025 - the biggest in English football history - but here's why the Blues are adamant it is not bad news\n\nChelsea recorded the highest pretax losses in English football history in the 2024-25 season — but club sources insist it will not force them into selling their biggest stars.\n\nThe European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report listed the 10 largest losses for 2025 and revealed how the Blues, who are owned by Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly, booked a €407million deficit. That has only ever been beaten by Barcelona, who fell into a €555m hole from the 2020-21 campaign.\n\nHowever, Chelsea insiders speaking anonymously insisted to Daily Mail Sport that the reported loss does not reflect their true health, saying it is the result of non-cash accounting adjustments as required by UEFA regulations and tied to the acquisition of the Blues. That includes asset impairments, settlements related to historical matters under the previous ownership, and the resolution of legacy contracts.\n\nThose same sources say, after an internal reset, the club is now profitable on an operating basis and aligned with UEFA as they expect to meet all the obligations under their existing settlement agreement with European football’s governing body. They entered into that agreement after previous financial breaches.\n\nCrucially for supporters, Daily Mail Sport has been told there is no requirement for Chelsea to start selling key players such as Cole Palmer or Moises Caicedo in order to meet regulatory thresholds.\n\nWe are assured there is no financial pressure on them to offload any key members of the squad they do not wish to lose this summer, and that their approach to player trading will be strategic rather than reactive.\n\nDespite winning two trophies - including the Club World Cup - last season, Chelsea are thought to have recorded a staggering record pre-tax loss\n\nChelsea have taken to structuring player contracts with performance incentives tied to Champions League participation, which would help cover the cost of missing out on Europe’s elite competition.\n\nNaturally, they do not hope that scenario occurs at the end of this season, with the Blues still in contention for a top-five finish in the Premier League as they travel to face Arsenal this Sunday.\n\nUEFA’s figures covered the 2024-25 season when Chelsea were competing in the Conference League, which they won. They also finished fourth in the Premier League to return to the Champions League before going on to win the Club World Cup in the summer.\n\n\n\nChelsea’s creative financing has helped their financial position in the Premier League, such as the infamous internal selling of their women’s team to the club’s parent company. UEFA’s rules are more stringent as they do not take income into account."

            "content": "Chelsea are ‘shattered’ with Cole Palmer and his fellow stars suffering from burnout, according to the PFA chief executive Maheta Molango, who wants the footballing calendar eased.\n\nMolango used Palmer as an example of why the game’s biggest names are being overworked, highlighting how he is facing a third successive summer without rest. After representing England at the 2024 Euros, and winning the 2025 Club World Cup with Chelsea, he may now head to the 2026 World Cup if selected by Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel.\n\nPalmer registered 33 Premier League goal involvements in 2023-24, and 23 in 2024-25. This season, he has yet to reach double figures, having struggled with injuries which have seen him appear in only 19 of Chelsea’s 42 games in all competitions.\n\nMolango revealed at the FT Business of Football Summit event in London on Thursday how he had visited Chelsea's training ground after the Club World Cup, and saw first-hand how they were struggling. ‘I was at the training camp of Chelsea when they came back (from the Club World Cup),’ Molango said. ‘They were shattered. This is just the reality.\n\n'You wonder whether this is what we wanted as an industry. I'm not sure. I think sometimes we need to be honest with ourselves and understand that sometimes less is more.’\n\nChelsea were left 'shattered' after the Club World Cup, says PFA chief Maheta Molango\n\nPFA boss Maheta Molanga warned that players can only give 60-70 per cent of themselves\n\nHaving already referenced Palmer’s schedule, Molango continued: ‘People say he is a millionaire. Yeah, he is, but it doesn't give you an extra lung or an extra leg.\n\n‘Come to a stage where, you know, “I want to see Cole Palmer on the pitch because he's the one who makes me dream”. The reality is that the fans pay right now 100 per cent of the ticket and a lot of time they get 70 per cent if they're lucky of the show or 60 because players start regulating themselves.\n\n‘The Premier League is the best product in terms of football. They make north of £4billion for 38 games. Surely there's an element of valuing the scarcity.’\n\nMolango added: ‘When I look at the last international window and I see (Jude) Bellingham out, Lamine Yamal out on the one side, Lucy Bronze out. Is this the football we want to see? Because frankly, people didn't want to spend money just to watch someone like me play.’"

            "content": "Premier League set to launch streaming service NEXT SEASON in Singapore - as chief hints it could be rolled out further afield if successful\n\nThe Premier League is launching a direct streaming service in Asia in a move which could have seismic consequences for the long-term future of football broadcasting.\n\nSingapore will be the first country to experience a direct-to-consumer service called Premier League Plus next season, skipping the need for traditional broadcasters.\n\nIt marks a watershed moment and, if ever replicated in the United Kingdom, it would deal a major blow to live action right holders Sky Sports and TNT Sports.\n\nHowever, at this stage it is a mere trial in one of the league's smaller markets and Daily Mail Sport understands it is extremely unlikely that it will be rolled out in the UK or United States. Sky Sports have been a major profit generator and instrumental to the league's popularity since 1992.\n\nFans will watch keenly for the pricing of the streaming service due to the spiralling costs of subscribing to several networks.\n\nSupporters in the UK will have to fork out £1,350 per year from 2027 if they subscribe to all the broadcasters of Premier League and Champions League football.\n\nThe Premier League is launching a direct-to-consumer streaming platform next season\n\nSingapore will become the first country to experience the platform, skipping the need for traditional broadcasters\n\n'For the first time, we’re going direct-to-consumer in Singapore,' said the Premier League's chief executive Richard Masters at the Financial Times’ Business of Football Summit in London.\n\n'It’s a very long, considered process, carefully chosen. We have a six-year agreement with StarHub, one of the two providers out there.\n\n'So from next season onwards, Premier League Plus – rather than Premflix – finally, it’s going to happen.\n\n'It will be a new app that you can download on your smart TV or laptop. You’ll be able to watch 380 games a season, with lots of shoulder content and a 24/7 dedicated channel.\n\n'Will it be replicable elsewhere? That’s what we’re going to find out.'\n\nMasters first admitted in 2020 that the Premier League were working on a Netflix-style digital streaming channel dubbed 'PremFlix', selling live games direct to fans.\n\nThe expectation is that a single streaming service would be more affordable for fans than the full gamut of broadcast subscriptions.\n\nIt feels inevitable that if the model is a success in Singapore, then the Premier League will look at rolling out Premier League Plus more widely; Masters admitted last year that the football broadcasting world must change.\n\nBut selling the rights market-by-market to different broadcasters around the world has been an incredibly gainful enterprise for the league.\n\nThe domestic rights deal between 2025 and 2029 with Sky Sports and TNT Sports is valued at £6.7billion.\n\nKeep in mind that Sky and TNT also take care of their own marketing, production costs, and dealing with customers, all factors which are expensive.\n\nFans in the United Kingdom will be paying around £1,350 if they want access to every broadcaster from 2027\n\nThe Premier League's chief executive Richard Masters hinted that if could be rolled out further if it proves a success in Singapore\n\nThe Premier League will have to take on those responsibilities in Singapore alongside StarHub, a telecommunications provider.\n\nSky Sports and TNT Sports have also built up years of broadcasting expertise, rapport between talent, and an ability to effectively market their work, which has helped the Premier League boom in popularity.\n\nRunning their own broadcasts in-house would be a major risk for the Premier League, and there are also questions about how they would achieve impartial, rigorous journalistic output.\n\nFor example, would the Premier League be willing to air a critical discussion about clubs' owners in the way that a traditional broadcaster might?\n\nMost major leagues work with external broadcasters but in the summer, Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 went onto a subscription channel after their overseeing body, the LFP, failed to secure a rights deal.\n\nThat came after several seasons of declining interest and collapsing income, ending with a five-year deal with DAZN being terminated after one campaign.\n\nThe instability has led to financial problems among many top-flight clubs, but the LFP's Ligue 1+ service has seen initial success, gaining 1.1million subscribers. Eighty per cent of those have paying commitments.\n\n\n\nHowever, they are targeting an additional million subscribers by the end of the 2028-29 campaign to meet clubs' financial needs."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nLet's not waste any time here with some fancy introduction, where we evoke the pastoral sights of spring training or the loud crack of a perfectly struck ball during batting practice in a near-empty ballpark. No, let's cut right to the issue at hand: It's time for our annual way-too-early All-Star selections, in which we predict who will be making the trip to Philadelphia for the 2026 Midsummer Classic in 138 days (but who's counting).\n\nAs always, we'll fill out the 32-man rosters with 20 position players and 12 pitchers, including three relievers, with each team receiving at least one representative.\n\nAmerican League starters\n\nC: Cal Raleigh, Seattle Mariners\n\nWhat will Raleigh do for an encore after his historic 60-homer season? Here's one way to look at it: 34 players have hit at least 50 home runs in a season, with 23 of those doing it just once. Let's assume Raleigh's true talent level isn't hitting 60 home runs, or even 50, but something less. We don't know that yet, but you probably don't want to bet on a 50-homer season.\n\nRaleigh's difference of 26 home runs to his second-highest season total currently ranks tied for the biggest among those 23 players:\n\nRaleigh: 26 (60 in 2026 to 34 in 2025)\n\nLuis Gonzalez: 26 (57 to 31)\n\nBrady Anderson: 26 (50 to 24)\n\nBarry Bonds: 24 (73 to 49)\n\nRoger Maris: 22 (61 to 39)\n\nWhile those are the five biggest gaps, the average among the 23 players is 12.7 home runs, so if we use that for Raleigh, we get 47 home runs. That feels attainable, especially if he carries a big workload again like he did in 2025, when he played 159 games between catcher and DH.\n\n1B: Nick Kurtz, Athletics\n\nKurtz over Vladimir Guerrero Jr.? A tough call for sure, but I just can't ignore Kurtz's rookie slash line: .290/.383/.619, with 36 home runs in 117 games. You don't luck your way into numbers like that -- and he did that after playing a grand total of 33 games in the minors. After getting called up in late April, it's not like the league ever really figured him out either, as July and August were his best months.\n\nKurtz did tail off a bit in September when he hit .221 with a .309 OBP -- although he still hit nine home runs and slugged .570 -- and struggled against southpaws (.197, .685 OPS) all season, but that's no surprise given his limited at-bats against good left-handers in college and the minors. In Dan Szymborski's 2026 simulations, the 80th-percentile outcome for Kurtz is posting a .291/.379/.571 slash line and that's realistic, with the possibility of matching what he did in 2025 if he improves against lefties.\n\n2B: Jazz Chisholm Jr., New York Yankees\n\nGleyber Torres started last year's All-Star Game, but don't bet on that again. After slumping in the second half, he might not even hold the job all season with rookies Kevin McGonigle and Max Anderson hot to take a spot in the Detroit infield.\n\nChisholm is the best of a weak group of AL candidates, with Marcus Semien, Jorge Polanco and Brandon Lowe all going to the National League this offseason. Jose Altuve might win the fan vote and can still hit, but his poor defense craters his value.\n\n3B: Jose Ramirez, Cleveland Guardians\n\nRamirez finished third in the AL MVP voting -- his eighth career top-10 finish. He's now the all-time leader in MVP award shares among players who have never won the award. Ramirez hasn't really deserved an MVP award in any of those seasons -- his highest ranking among AL position players in WAR was third in 2018 and 2021 and he was sixth in 2025 -- but his voting results are a testament to his consistency and the appreciation of his all-around game. He should get some competition from Junior Caminero and Maikel Garcia, but for now he remains the top candidate at the position as he enters his age-33 season.\n\nSS: Bobby Witt Jr., Kansas City Royals\n\nA year ago, this was a good debate between Witt and Gunnar Henderson after they finished second and fourth in the 2024 AL MVP voting after both posted ridiculous 9-WAR seasons. Witt has pulled ahead since.\n\nHenderson injured his side in spring training last season, got off to a slow start and went from hitting 37 home runs to just 17 while Witt had another excellent campaign, finishing fourth in the MVP vote. The biggest difference between the two is now on defense, where Witt has matured into perhaps the best shortstop in the game, winning back-to-back Gold Gloves, while Henderson's metrics took a hit last season to where he ranked below average.\n\nOF: Aaron Judge, New York Yankees\n\nThe easiest call on the board, coming off another MVP and another historic offensive season (.331/.457/.688, 53 home runs, 9.7 WAR). With three MVP awards, Judge is looking to join Barry Bonds and Shohei Ohtani as the only players to win more than three and he enters 2026 as a huge favorite to do that. Judge turns 34 in April, but just won his first batting title, crossed 50 home runs for a record-tying fourth time and is making a run at one of the greatest five-year stretches we've ever seen.\n\nOF: Julio Rodriguez, Seattle Mariners\n\nJ-Rod's value is due more to his all-around game than a batting line that jumps out at you, but he still went 30/30 for the second time last season while hitting .267/.324/.474 with superb defense in center field. Put him in a different home park and those numbers would look more impressive: He hit .236/.306/.369 at home compared to .296/.341/.571 on the road.\n\nRanking MLB's best at every position As a new baseball season approaches, Buster Olney compares the elite at every spot on the diamond. Top 10s for 2026 »\n\nOF: Roman Anthony, Boston Red Sox\n\nYes, he's this good. We saw flashes of his future All-Star potential as a rookie, as he hit .292/.396/.463 in 71 games. That on-base percentage would have finished tied with Juan Soto for third-highest in the majors if he had enough plate appearances. Anthony's power started to show up in August, when he hit .304 with six home runs as he started lifting the ball more, before he missed September with an oblique strain. Look for a .400 OBP, 25 home runs and a top-10 MVP finish as a sophomore.\n\nDH: Yordan Alvarez, Houston Astros\n\nA hand injury and severe ankle sprain limited Alvarez to 48 games in 2025, but don't forget him when drafting your fantasy team. From 2022 to 2024, only Judge had a higher OPS+ and Alvarez will still be just 28 years old on Opening Day. He should return to his status as one of the top hitters in the game -- maybe top three alongside Judge and Ohtani.\n\nSP: Tarik Skubal, Detroit Tigers\n\nSkubal, Garrett Crochet and Hunter Brown separated themselves from the pack of AL starters in 2025 and I would rank them 1-2-3 heading into 2026 with a gap to the next tier.\n\nMax Fried should once again win a lot of games. Jacob deGrom had a nice comeback season, but Globe Life Field played as such an extreme pitcher's park and deGrom still allowed 26 home runs. His road ERA was 3.65 compared to 2.35 at home, so he's not quite in the top echelon. The same analysis applies to Mariners starters Bryan Woo and Logan Gilbert, who benefit from a friendly home park.\n\nThe wild card is Baltimore's Trevor Rogers, who had a 1.81 ERA in 18 starts and ranked fourth in WAR. He's not that good, of course, but don't discount his chance of being a top-10 starter in the league.\n\nAmerican League reserves\n\nC: Shea Langeliers, Athletics\n\n1B: Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Toronto Blue Jays\n\n1B: Munetaka Murakami ,Chicago White Sox\n\n2B: Luke Keaschall, Minnesota Twins\n\n3B: Junior Caminero, Tampa Bay Rays\n\nSS: Gunnar Henderson, Baltimore Orioles\n\nSS: Zach Neto, Los Angeles Angels\n\nOF: Wyatt Langford, Texas Rangers\n\nOF: Byron Buxton, Minnesota Twins\n\nOF: Jarren Duran, Boston Red Sox\n\nDH: Brent Rooker, Athletics\n\nThe most difficult position here is shortstop, which is stacked. I had to leave off Jeremy Pena, Corey Seager and Jacob Wilson, last year's starter, with Neto appearing as the Angels' lone representative. He's a valid All-Star, however, with 5.1 WAR each of the past two seasons, combining good power with plus defense.\n\nLangeliers quietly hit .277/.325/.536 with 31 home runs and it wasn't a Sacramento thing as he hit better on the road. He gets the nod over Alejandro Kirk. Murakami is a boom-or-bust type and is my White Sox rep, knocking Pete Alonso off the roster. Keaschall can really hit but must stay healthy. He had wrist surgery in 2023, Tommy John surgery in 2024 and missed time with a fractured forearm and then a torn thumb ligament as a rookie in 2025.\n\nBuxton gets the nod for now ... assuming the Twins don't trade him. Duran was a stud in 2024 (8.7 WAR) and still very good in 2025 (4.7 WAR). George Springer had a monster year in 2025 but that will be difficult to repeat at 36, so we'll go with Rooker at DH (the A's have a fun lineup, don't they?).\n\nAmerican League pitchers\n\nSP: Garrett Crochet, Boston Red Sox\n\nSP: Hunter Brown, Houston Astros\n\nSP: Max Fried, New York Yankees\n\nSP: Dylan Cease, Toronto Blue Jays\n\nSP: Logan Gilbert, Seattle Mariners\n\nStat that will define 2026 for every MLB team Here are the numbers that could make -- or break -- your favorite squad in the new year.\n\nNational League » | American League »\n\nSP: Nathan Eovaldi, Texas Rangers\n\nSP: Cole Ragans, Kansas City Royals\n\nSP: Trevor Rogers, Baltimore Orioles\n\nRP: Aroldis Chapman, Boston Red Sox\n\nRP: Cade Smith, Cleveland Guardians\n\nRP: Andres Muñoz, Seattle Mariners\n\nSo many good pitchers left off here: Bryan Woo, Jacob deGrom, Framber Valdez, Kevin Gausman, Rookie of the Year contender Trey Yesavage and Cam Schlittler, who was just as impressive as Yesavage last fall.\n\nI like Cease's chances of having a big year, after joining the Blue Jays with their terrific defense behind him. Gilbert gets the nod over his teammate Woo because of a much higher strikeout rate last year, which makes him the better bet for 2026. Ragans was an All-Star in 2024, missed a bunch of time in 2025, but struck out 98 in 61.2 innings and finished the year healthy. Chapman is coming off one of the most unhittable relief seasons of all time, Smith is one of the top strikeout relievers and Muñoz works around a few too many walks by limiting both hits and home runs.\n\nNational League starters\n\nAP Photo/Kayla Wolf, File\n\nC: William Contreras, Milwaukee Brewers\n\nThis is a deeper position than you might realize. Contreras, after finishing fifth in the 2024 NL MVP voting, played through a fractured middle finger all of last season and saw his offensive numbers dip a bit. Will Smith is a three-time All-Star. Hunter Goodman hit 31 home runs for the Rockies. Drake Baldwin is an up-and-coming bat-first catcher who had an outstanding rookie season and then you have defensive specialists like Patrick Bailey and Gabriel Moreno.\n\nWe'll go with Contreras, who should see a rebound in his power numbers, has turned into a solid defensive catcher, and might play 150 games again, starting at DH when he doesn't catch.\n\n1B: Matt Olson, Atlanta Braves\n\nThere are four strong candidates here with Olson, Freddie Freeman, Bryce Harper and the overlooked Michael Busch. Harper is out to prove to Dave Dombrowski that he's still an elite player, but he doesn't need any extra motivation. Freeman is still great, but since 2023 his WAR has dropped from 6.8 to 4.7 to 3.5. Busch hit 34 home runs on his way to posting 4.6 WAR in 2025. But Olson gets the nod. He's younger than Harper and Freeman and had the best all-around season of this group a year ago (6.0 WAR). He's also riding a streak of four straight seasons with 162 games played, so you know he'll post every day.\n\n2B: Nico Hoerner, Chicago Cubs\n\nKetel Marte is the default pick at second base because of his .913 OPS over the past two seasons, the sixth-best mark in the majors. Hoerner is a much different player than Marte, getting much of his value from his glove and legs, but he also hit .297 with a .345 OBP and topped Marte in WAR in 2025 (6.2 to 4.4). Durability is a key, as Hoerner has topped 150 games three straight years while Marte has averaged 137 games over those three seasons.\n\n3B: Alex Bregman, Chicago Cubs\n\nThere are several candidates here besides Bregman, including Manny Machado, Bo Bichette, Austin Riley, Matt Chapman and Max Muncy, but they all come with warts, whether it's injury risk, age or, in Bichette's case, a new position.\n\nBregman has been a consistent two-way performer and was on his way to another four-win season with the Red Sox in 2025 if not for a quad strain. He and Machado are similar at this point: Machado has averaged 3.3 WAR the past three seasons with a 117 OPS+ while Bregman is at 4.2 and 121, both now in their early 30s. Riley might have the most upside here but has battled injuries the past two seasons, so I'm going with Bregman, who I think has a big year ahead at Wrigley Field.\n\nSS: Geraldo Perdomo, Arizona Diamondbacks\n\nFinal MLB offseason grades for all 30 teams Three A's, a whole lot of B's and one F -- but who got them? Let's hand out offseason report cards. David Schoenfield »\n\nJust like in the AL, this is a loaded position in the NL: Francisco Lindor, Mookie Betts, Trea Turner, Elly De La Cruz, Dansby Swanson. All would be worthy selections, but going with Perdomo is confirmation in my belief that his 2025 season -- .290/.389/.462, 100 RBIs, 7.0 WAR, fourth in MVP voting -- is the real deal. He combines elite plate discipline with a high contact rate, finishing with more walks than strikeouts, to produce a high OBP with improved power (58 extra-base hits) and plus defense.\n\nOF: Juan Soto, New York Mets\n\nSoto's final numbers in 2025 -- .263/.396/.525 with 43 home runs -- were good enough for third place in the NL MVP voting. The biggest shocker was going 38 for 42 on stolen-base attempts, which tied for the NL lead and certainly makes him the slowest stolen-base leader in MLB history. (He ranked in just the 13th percentile in speed.) According to Statcast metrics, he even hit into some bad luck, with projected numbers of .288 with a .608 slugging. Look for even better numbers in 2026. It will be difficult to unseat Ohtani in MVP voting with the Dodgers superstar slated to pitch a full season, but if the Mets win the NL East and Soto's numbers tick up a bit, maybe he wins MVP for the first time.\n\nOF: Kyle Tucker, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nWhen healthy, Tucker has been one of the best players in the majors the past two seasons, producing 4.7 WAR in just 78 games in 2024, when he fractured his shin on a foul ball, and then ranking among the leaders in 2025 until he fractured his hand, which he played through leading to a prolonged slump.\n\nWhile going to the Dodgers, where he'll be just another guy in their star-studded clubhouse, will help keep the attention off him, his high salary -- calculated at $57 million average annual value -- creates a different level of pressure for Tucker. If he handles that, he'll earn his fifth straight All-Star selection.\n\nOF: Ronald Acuña Jr., Atlanta Braves\n\nAcuña's career has been a bunch of stops and starts, with the impact of ACL tears in both knees lined up against two 40-homer seasons, his majestic MVP season of 2023, and awe-inspiring displays of power.\n\nHe played 90 games in 2025 and was superb: .290/.417/.518. He'll probably never repeat 2023, when his strikeout rate dipped to a level he hasn't otherwise approached in his career, but if he can stay on the field he should be one of the best hitters in the league.\n\nDH: Shohei Ohtani, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nLet's see, a few statistical feats Ohtani can accomplish in 2026:\n\nA third straight 50-homer season. Only five other players have at least three 50-homer seasons in their careers.\n\nLead his league in slugging percentage, OPS, OPS+ and total bases for the fourth straight year.\n\nLead in runs scored for the third straight year. His 280 runs over the past two years were the most in a two-year span since Jeff Bagwell scored 295 in 1999-2000.\n\nA fourth straight MVP and fifth for his career.\n\nOh, and he pitches on the side. He continues to amaze and captivate us in impossible ways.\n\nSP: Paul Skenes, Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nMLB's top 5 breakout teams for 2026 Which teams are about to get a whole lot better? We break down five potential breakouts.\n\nBradford Doolittle »\n\nSkenes' strikeout rate dropped from 33.1% as a rookie to 29.5% last season. Normally, that might be a slight cause for concern, but that rate still ranked eighth among pitchers with at least 100 innings and it's not like it led to more damage against him.\n\nStatcast classifies Skenes as throwing seven different pitchers, including using five of them at least 10% of the time. He deployed his curveball, his least used pitch, 4.8% (about four pitches a game). I don't know if he needs all those pitches, but it seems to be working just fine.\n\nLet's see if the Pirates cut Skenes loose a little more this year: He made just 11 starts on four days of rest and topped 100 pitches just eight times, so he finished with 187 innings. He should get to 200-plus innings in 2026.\n\nNational League reserves\n\nC: Will Smith, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nC: Hunter Goodman, Colorado Rockies\n\n1B: Michael Busch, Chicago Cubs\n\n2B: Ketel Marte, Arizona Diamondbacks\n\n3B: Manny Machado, San Diego Padres\n\nSS: Mookie Betts, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nSS: Masyn Winn, St. Louis Cardinals\n\nOF: Fernando Tatis Jr., San Diego Padres\n\nOF: Corbin Carroll, Arizona Diamondbacks\n\nOF: James Wood, Washington Nationals\n\nDH: Kyle Schwarber, Philadelphia Phillies\n\nThe problem with the NL is I ended up with nobody from the Rockies, Cardinals or Marlins in my first cut, and generously included Wood as the third outfielder only to give the Nationals a representative. There's a good chance we end up with some dubious All-Stars from those clubs. Goodman made it last year -- and earned it, hitting 31 home runs -- and is the logical choice to represent the Rockies again.\n\nI went with Busch over Freeman and Harper, going with the younger player. Shortstop is impossible. Never bet against Betts and I think his offense bounces back after a stomach virus sapped his strength early last year. Winn isn't one of the top six shortstops, but he did win a Gold Glove -- plus someone has to represent the Cardinals. Tatis and Carroll (assuming he's OK after his hamate injury this spring) are easy picks as outfield backups, especially with Pete Crow-Armstrong's slide in the second half raising questions about whether he can repeat his offensive output. We'll see if Schwarber can repeat his monster 56-homer season.\n\nNational League pitchers\n\nSP: Cristopher Sanchez, Philadelphia Phillies\n\nSP: Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nSP: Hunter Greene, Cincinnati Reds\n\nSP: Logan Webb, San Francisco Giants\n\nSP: Nolan McLean, New York Mets\n\nSP: Chris Sale, Atlanta Braves\n\nSP: Jacob Misiorowski, Milwaukee Brewers\n\nSP: Eury Perez, Miami Marlins\n\nRP: Mason Miller, San Diego Padres\n\nRP: Jhoan Duran, Philadelphia Phillies\n\nRP: Edwin Diaz, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nESPN is now the home of MLB.TV All MLB out-of-market games. Live or On Demand. All in one place. Get access\n\nSanchez finished second to Skenes in the NL Cy Young voting and deserved it -- in fact, he was slightly ahead of Skenes in Baseball-Reference + FanGraphs WAR (although Skenes was the unanimous Cy Young winner). Greene is going to make 30 starts one of these years and that will make him a Cy Young contender. Webb is our only Giants rep but also makes it on merit. He increased his strikeout rate in 2025 and with five straight excellent seasons is one of the safest bets among starting pitchers.\n\nMcLean is still a rookie but looked so polished in his eight starts that I'm taking him instead of new Mets teammate Freddy Peralta. Sale just has to stay healthy. He won Cy Young honors in 2024 and is a good sleeper pick to win again as he was just as dominant in 2025 until he fractured his ribcage diving for a ball.\n\nMisiorowski was a controversial All-Star last year, a late addition to the squad after making just five career starts. If he can improve his control, he'll earn that selection this year. Perez made it back from Tommy John surgery after missing 2024 and is still just 23 with huge upside.\n\nThe relievers? No controversy with those three choices, with apologies to Abner Uribe for not finding a spot for him."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nSpring training camps are underway, which means it is time to look at the state of baseball. As part of our 2026 MLB season preview, ESPN's Buster Olney surveyed those around the industry to help him rank the top 10 players at every position as part of his annual positional ranking series.\n\nToday, we rank the best of the best in center field.\n\nThe objective of this exercise is to identify the best players for the 2026 season, not who might be best in five years or over their career. We will roll out a position per day over the next two weeks. Here's the rest of the schedule: starting pitchers (Feb. 16), relief pitchers (Feb. 17), catchers (Feb. 18), first basemen (Feb. 19), second basemen (Feb. 20), third basemen (Monday), shortstops (Tuesday), corner outfielders (Wednesday), designated hitters (Friday).\n\nByron Buxton is coming off his healthiest season -- and perhaps best -- since 2017 and is entrenched among our top 10 center fielders -- yet the 32-year-old is caught in a weird baseball purgatory, which could be referred to as life with the Minnesota Twins.\n\nThe Twins have slashed their payroll by about 35% over the past three years, down to $106 million, after unloading a small army of players at the trade deadline in 2025 en route to a 92-loss season. Tom Pohlad has now become the controlling owner of the Twins, and recently delivered the organization's new messaging: He wants to win this year.\n\nAs with all new owners, there seems to be a learning curve in effect for Pohlad. As this past offseason began, industry members expected Minnesota to continue last summer's teardown and deal Joe Ryan and perhaps Buxton, following the deep budget cuts. But early in the winter, the team effectively pulled Ryan out of trade consideration, around the incongruent thought that it aimed to contend this year. Then, mere weeks away from the start of spring training, Derek Falvey, the head of baseball operations for Minnesota, departed the organization over philosophical differences.\n\nTypically, a franchise going through this steep transition would trade a player like Buxton, who is owed about $50 million over the next three years. But Buxton has a no-trade clause, and what he has heard from Pohlad is that the Twins are going to try to win. If Buxton remains, he's likely to go through the best part of his career watching others compete in October.\n\nBut minds can be changed. If the roster reality manifests this summer -- ahead of what might be a costly labor situation when the current CBA expires in the winter -- Pohlad could try to move Buxton's contract, and Buxton could reverse course, ask to be moved to a contender and waive his no-trade clause. He has noted that, while he says he wants to stay, the people in power within the Twins' organization haven't flatly and loudly said that Buxton won't be dealt.\n\n\"All it takes is for somebody at the top to go to the media -- 'We're not trading you,'\" Buxton told The Athletic (and others) after arriving at the Twins' spring training camp. \"Trade rumors stop.\"\n\nUntil that happens, Buxton will continue to drift into an uncertain future, as one of MLB's best center fielders. Here are the top 10.\n\nTop 10 center fielders\n\n1. Julio Rodriguez, Seattle Mariners\n\nHe just turned 25 years old, and he seems on the verge of evolving from a star to something more than that. Rodriguez had an OPS of .900 after the All-Star break last season, slugging .560 while hitting 18 of his 32 homers in that span. He still seems to be learning, as many young players do, how to adjust to the waves of opposing pitchers that work through games in this era. He fared very well against starting pitchers last year, generating an .858 OPS, but didn't have nearly as much success against relievers, posting a .701 OPS with six homers in 277 plate appearances.\n\n2. Pete Crow-Armstrong, Chicago Cubs\n\nHis monthly offensive performance last season ranged from a nearly 1.000 OPS (.984 in July) to under .500 (.446 in August), but all the while, he was a plus-plus defender and baserunner who accumulated 72 extra-base hits (including 31 homers), 35 steals, 91 runs and 6.0 WAR. Cubs manager Craig Counsell suggested last season that PCA might be the best overall defender in baseball, and while Ceddanne Rafaela, Patrick Bailey and Bobby Witt Jr. each might have some claim to that title, Crow-Armstrong's impact for his pitchers is undeniable. PCA's acute splits vs. lefties and righties are a concern:\n\nVs. right-handers: .271/.315/.523\n\nVs. lefties: .188/.217/.372\n\n3. Daulton Varsho, Toronto Blue Jays\n\nIn the 71 games he played during the 2025 regular season, Varsho had 35 extra-base hits, including 20 homers, and a career-best OPS+ of 122. He continues to be one of the best defenders at this position; if PCA's strength is gliding into the gaps, Varsho seems to excel in retreating to the warning track and making plays around the wall.\n\nRanking MLB's best at every position As a new baseball season approaches, Buster Olney compares the elite at every spot on the diamond. Top 10s for 2026 »\n\n4. Byron Buxton, Minnesota Twins\n\nHe destroyed left-handed pitching last year, blasting a .676 slugging percentage in 123 plate appearances. Both his success and his struggles were reflected in the Twins' wins and losses: Buxton hit .332/.396/.692 in Twins' victories last year but just .213/.272/.444 in the losses in which he played. Of his 126 games last year, he played 118 in center field.\n\n5. Jackson Merrill, San Diego Padres\n\nMerrill was on the injured list three different times last season, fighting hamstring, concussion and ankle issues in his second year in the big leagues -- and yet he still managed to post decent numbers. He had a .774 OPS and an adjusted OPS of 112, compiling 47 extra-base hits and scoring 59 runs in 117 games. With a full, healthy year, he might well challenge Rodriguez for the No. 1 spot on this list next year.\n\n6. Ceddanne Rafaela, Boston Red Sox\n\nHis tendency to swing aggressively -- even recklessly, at times -- can sometimes overshadow just how good of a player he can be. Rafaela had a strikeout-to-walk ratio of about 4-to-1 last season, for an on-base percentage of .295, but he's got power (54 extra-base hits) and speed (20 stolen bases). He plays center field in Fenway Park fearlessly, which is why he could reasonably be in the conversation for best defender in the game.\n\n7. Trent Grisham, New York Yankees\n\nIt's kind of surprising over how much debate there was about whether the Yankees would extend a qualifying offer to Grisham, since he was a good player for them last season -- 3.5 WAR, good power, an adjusted OPS of 125, decent defense. And as the old saying goes, there's no such thing as a bad one-year contract, especially for big-money teams like the Yankees. Manager Aaron Boone will probably protect Grisham from left-handed pitching, against which he hit .182 last season. And if you assumed his gaudy 2025 power numbers were manufactured at Yankee Stadium, you'd be wrong: 22 of his 35 homers were hit on the road.\n\n8. Michael Harris II, Atlanta Braves\n\nThe trajectory of his production is not what he wants:\n\nFinal MLB offseason grades for all 30 teams Three A's, a whole lot of B's and one F -- but who got them? Let's hand out offseason report cards. David Schoenfield »\n\n2022: 5.1 WAR\n\n2023: 3.5 WAR\n\n2024: 3.2 WAR\n\n2025: 2.2 WAR\n\nHarris is about to turn 25 years old, so this feels like an important year for him to stabilize, which probably will require a little more plate discipline. Last year, he had 16 walks and 128 strikeouts -- a 0.13 walk-to-strikeout ratio, the worst among the 145 hitters who qualified for the batting title. He continues to field well, ranking seventh among center fielders in defensive runs saved and outs above average.\n\n9. Luis Robert Jr., New York Mets\n\nThe Mets' bet on Robert might be the most telling barometer of the team's season: They believe in his upside, which we saw in 2023, when he mashed 38 homers and stole 20 bases. But that was the only season -- in a career that began in 2020 -- when Robert played in more than 110 games. Last year, Robert struggled against power pitchers (as defined by Baseball Reference), batting .193 with a .337 slugging percentage.\n\n10. Andy Pages, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nPages was on his way to a really great season, batting .280 with 19 homers through Aug. 12, but he struggled down the stretch and into the postseason, so the Dodgers will be looking for him to bounce back early in the season.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nColton Cowser, Baltimore Orioles: He mustered 3.1 WAR in 153 games in 2024, hitting 24 homers, but injuries took him off the field last year.\n\nJake Meyers, Houston Astros: Meyers was really good at getting on base last year, with a .354 OBP and16 stolen bases.\n\nTJ Friedl, Cincinnati Reds: He generated an above league-average OPS+ of 106 over 152 games.\n\nCedric Mullins, Tampa Bay Rays: He never seemed comfortable after being traded from the Orioles to the Mets last season. He quickly re-signed to play in the AL East and could be back on the market next offseason.\n\nJakob Marsee, Miami Marlins: Called up at the beginning of August, Marsee put in two impressive months, generating an OPS+ of 132, hitting 18 doubles and five homers in 234 plate appearances and stealing 14 bases. Paul Hembekides dug into the underlying numbers and offered these concerns: \"He had a .357 BABIP in the majors and .297 in the minors, so he had extreme batted-ball luck. PECOTA projects a .235/.324/.374 line this year.\"\n\nBrenton Doyle, Colorado Rockies: With a new front office in place in Colorado, this could be a crossroads year for Doyle, a strong defender who really struggled at the plate last year with an OPS+ of 72.\n\nSal Frelick, Milwaukee Brewers: Jackson Chourio played the most games in center field for Milwaukee, but Frelick had some games out there as well, and we wanted Frelick somewhere in the top 10s. He was a 3-WAR player last year, with another solid season of getting on base (over 200 times) and some power and speed.\n\nNathan Lukes, Toronto Blue Jays: As with Frelick, it just seems as if Lukes, who played center field some last year when Varsho was hurt, deserves a mention on one of these lists.\n\nOneil Cruz, Pittsburgh Pirates: It's a pivotal year for him, as he nears his second swing through arbitration. He played in 135 games last year and mustered 0.3 WAR, batting .200/.298/.378."

            "content": "Stephen A. Smith says Steelers GM Omar Khan needs to find a quarterback rather than waiting on Aaron Rodgers. (2:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Miami Dolphins ranked first overall in the NFL Players Association annual report cards, according to survey results obtained by ESPN. The Minnesota Vikings finished second overall in 2026, followed by the Washington Commanders in third.\n\nRegarding the Dolphins, the NFLPA survey wrote: \"Players consistently describe the organization as 'the best in the NFL.'\"\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished in last place for the first time in the four-year history of the union's survey. Last year, the Steelers ranked 28th. The Arizona Cardinals finished 31st in the 2026 survey, after a last-place finish in 2025, and the Cleveland Browns finished in 30th, the same as in 2025.\n\nThe NFLPA is not making the report cards public this year following a grievance filed by the NFL, which claimed the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. Earlier this month, an arbitrator agreed with the league, saying the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses for report cards even if it can't publish them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment. An NFL spokesperson also declined to comment, saying that as in previous years, the league had no knowledge of the survey.\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A-plus to F-minus on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and it was conducted from Nov. 2 to Dec. 11.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" the survey said.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest-rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" the survey said. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers' locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers' training room lacks updated recovery technology and \"modalities.\" Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, though the training staff ranked first.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A-plus to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the survey. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nBrady Tkachuk, the Ottawa Senators captain and a Team USA gold medalist, said he didn't appreciate the AI-doctored video released by the White House that made it appear he was disparaging Canadians.\n\nThe video, published Sunday by the White House's official TikTok account, featured doctored footage from a Tkachuk brothers' news conference at the 4 Nations Face-Off last February. While \"Free Bird,\" the goal song for Team USA, played in the background of the video, Brady Tkachuk was made to say, \"They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple syrup eating f---s a lesson.\"\n\nThe clip, which discloses that it used AI-generated media, has 11.1 million views on TikTok and has been widely viewed on other social media platforms.\n\n\"Well, it's clearly fake, because it's not my voice, not my lips moving,\" Tkachuk said Thursday in his first media availability in Ottawa since the U.S. defeated Canada for the gold medal in men's Olympic ice hockey in Milan. \"I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. So, I can't do anything about it.\"\n\nTkachuk was asked if he enjoyed the video.\n\n\"It's not my voice. It's not what I was saying,\" he said. \"I would never say that. That's not who I am, so I guess I don't like that video because that would never come out of my mouth, and never had that thought.\"\n\nTkachuk also addressed what he didn't say during Team USA's locker room celebration. Some on social media accused Tkachuk of being the person who shouted, \"Close the northern border!\" during Team USA's congratulatory call with President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I've been seeing stuff that people think it's me. But if you watch the video, it's not my voice or something that I never say,\" Tkachuk said. \"I don't know how that took a storm on its own when I give everything I have here.\n\n\"It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.\"\n\nOn that call, Trump made a widely circulated comment about the U.S. women's hockey team, which also won Olympic gold.\n\nWhen Trump extended an invitation to the men's players to come to Washington for the State of the Union address, he said: \"I must tell you, we're going to have to bring the women's team, you do know that,\" adding with a laugh that if he didn't also invite the women's team, \"I do believe I probably would be impeached.\" Some players laughed along with the joke.\n\nTeam USA star Hilary Knight said Wednesday on \"SportsCenter\" that she thought it was a \"distasteful\" joke that \"unfortunately is overshadowing\" the success her team had in Milan. Boston Bruins goalie Jeremy Swayman, a member of Team USA, said Wednesday that \"we should've reacted differently.\"\n\nLike other American players, Tkachuk detailed a positive relationship between the men's and women's teams in the Olympics, from attending each other's games to hanging out at 3 a.m. in the Olympic Village café after the men returned as champions.\n\nTkachuk said he understood why women's players could feel insulted by that comment.\n\n\"I mean, I get it,\" he said. \"We support them, they support us. You can't control what other people say. It was fun being around them, seeing how they play and the excellence around them.\n\n\"If I see one of them, we'll talk about the excitement of what we can control, which is to be gold medalists.\"\n\nAs for why the men's team laughed at Trump's comment, Tkachuk said the players were \"caught off guard\" a little bit.\n\n\"I don't really have an answer. It's a whirlwind of a moment,\" he said. \"You can't control what somebody says. I guess got caught off guard a little bit. You're talking to the president 10 minutes after you achieve your dream.\"\n\nBrady Tkachuk is one of five Team USA players whose NHL clubs are based in Canada. He partied in Miami with his teammates and then attended the State of the Union Address in Washington before returning to Ottawa.\n\n\"It was special,\" he said. \"Being an American citizen, you never really think you're going to see the White House and be in the Oval Office.\"\n\nBut Tkachuk noted the awkwardness of helping the U.S. defeat Canada for the gold medal while being the captain for a team in Canada's capital, a position he has held the past five seasons in Ottawa.\n\n\"It's just such a passionate fan base,\" he said. \"I said this after 4 Nations: It's a unique feeling when every single day the support from this fan base and then for three weeks they're not cheering for you. It's a crazy feeling.\n\n\"I've given absolutely everything I have as an Ottawa Senator. When you represent the U.S., it's about being an American. It's an honor. There's only three teams that ever won the gold medal. I wanted to achieve my childhood dream and bring a gold medal back to the U.S.\""

            "content": "Adam Schefter breaks down the Jets' decision to trade Jermaine Johnson to the Titans for T'Vondre Sweat. (1:03)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nThe Jets and Titans agreed to a rare player-for-player trade Thursday, with New York sending pass rusher Jermaine Johnson to Tennessee for defensive tackle T'Vondre Sweat, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nThe trade can't be processed until the start of the league year on March 11.\n\nThe deal marks the latest move in a protracted teardown of a once-formidable defense for the Jets, who also traded away defensive stars Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams -- both former first-round draft picks -- in November.\n\nEight of the Jets' 11 first-round picks from 2015 to 2022 have been traded.\n\nJohnson acknowledged the trade in a social media post later Thursday, saying New York \"will always hold a special place in my heart.\"\n\nNew York, thank you for everything truly. The love I've been shown here for the past 4-5 years has been nothing short of amazing, both on and off the field. Y'all will always hold a special place in my heart. Wish all of my former coaches and former teammates the best!! Thank all... — Jermaine Johnson II (@ii_jermaine) February 26, 2026\n\nJohnson will be reunited with Titans coach Robert Saleh, who coached the Jets when they selected Johnson with the 26th overall pick in the 2022 draft.\n\nJohnson also will once again play under new Titans defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton, who was his position coach with the Jets his first three seasons.\n\nJohnson, coming off a down year (three sacks), has only one year remaining on his contract and is due to make a guaranteed $13.4 million in 2026, the amount of his fifth-year option.\n\nJohnson generated interest last season before the trade deadline, but the Jets opted to keep him for the remainder of the season. His departure reinforces the belief that the Jets will take an edge player with the No. 2 pick in this year's draft, with Ohio State's Arvell Reese and Texas Tech's David Bailey as the leading candidates.\n\nIn Sweat, the Jets are getting a 6-foot-2, 366-pound interior presence on a team-friendly contract. A second-round pick in 2024, he is signed through 2027 and will count only $1.7 million on the Jets' salary cap.\n\nScheme factored into the trade for both teams. The Jets, who could be using more 3-4 fronts, wanted to add more size up front. The opposite is true for Tennessee, where Saleh's scheme puts a premium on smaller, faster linemen.\n\nSweat, drafted 38th overall in 2024, posted 85 tackles and three sacks in 29 games for the Titans. He suffered an ankle injury in Tennessee's season-opening loss to the Broncos and missed five games last season.\n\nThe Titans are counting on Johnson regaining his form from 2023, when he posted a career-high 7.5 sacks and was named to the Pro Bowl as an injury replacement. His 2024 season didn't last long. In Week 2, at Tennessee, he tore an Achilles tendon and missed the remainder of the season.\n\nJohnson rehabbed to make it back for the start of the 2025 season, but he didn't have the same burst as before the injury. In 14 games, he finished with only three sacks and six quarterback hits, later admitting his performance wasn't up to his standard. Both he and the team acknowledged that the Achilles injury probably affected his performance.\n\nIn four seasons -- 47 games -- with the Jets, Johnson has 13 sacks and 131 tackles.\n\nESPN's Turron Davenport contributed to this report."

The post said the event was being held to honor the women's hockey team and other female athletes, with details to follow. The message featured a picture of the U.S. women's hockey players celebrating in a circle.\n\nA publicist for Flavor Flav confirmed the event without providing further details.\n\nThe women's players worked on their own to accept the invitation, without input from USA Hockey, a person familiar with discussions told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private.\n\nThe person added that while the team is excited to attend, it's unclear if the entire 23-player roster will be on hand because of potential scheduling conflicts.\n\nThe team has yet to determine whether to visit the White House after USA Hockey cited logistics and travel issues in politely declining President Donald Trump's invitation to join the U.S. men's gold medal-winning team at his State of the Union speech on Tuesday.\n\nFlavor Flav is a longtime supporter of women's sports and attended various Olympic competitions this month. He posted his invitation on Monday, shortly after the women turned down the trip to Washington.\n\n\"If the USA Women's Hockey team wants a real celebration and invite ,,, I'll host them in Las Vegas. Do some nice dinners and shows and good times,\" he wrote. \"I'm sure I can get a hotel and airline to help me out here and celebrate these women for real for real.\"\n\nThe women's team was originally scheduled to fly commercially to New York on Monday, but was forced to reroute through Atlanta because of a snowstorm in the Northeast. The timing and storm made it difficult for the women to change plans as they returned to their Professional Women's Hockey League and college teams across the country.\n\nTeam USA won gold after beating Canada in the Women's Ice Hockey final. EPA/FAZRY ISMAIL\n\nThe PWHL schedule resumed Thursday with Montreal playing at New York following a monthlong Olympic break, while college players open their conference playoffs this weekend.\n\nIn his address, Trump said plans were in the works to have the women's team visit the White House, though it's unclear when that could happen, USA Hockey said. The earliest the team could travel to Washington would be in late spring after the conclusion of the PWHL season.\n\nThe president's invitation came late Sunday, when he called to congratulate the men for their 2-1 overtime win over Canada. The women's team was still in Milan, three days after also beating Canada 2-1 in overtime.\n\nIn speaking to the men's team following their win, Trump said: \"We're going to have to bring the women's team, you do know that.\" He later joked that if he didn't extend the invitation, he would probably be impeached.\n\nU.S. women's captain Hilary Knight on Wednesday referred to the comment as being \"distasteful and unfortunate.\"\n\n\"I think just the way women are represented, it's a great teaching point and really shines light on how women should be championed for their amazing feats,\" she said."

            "content": "Adam Schefter joins \"SportsCenter\" and breaks the news that the Indianapolis Colts have given Anthony Richardson permission to seek a trade. (1:00)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- The Colts have given quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr. permission to seek a trade, his agent told ESPN on Thursday, the latest twist in the young player's complicated career.\n\nRichardson lost a preseason position battle with veteran Daniel Jones before last season, relegating him to the No. 2 spot. Now, with the Colts committed to trying to re-sign Jones as their starter for the foreseeable future, Richardson faces an uncertain path forward in Indianapolis.\n\nAgent Deiric Jackson having the ability to explore a trade gives Richardson the potential of finding a new start after three tumultuous seasons in Indianapolis. The 2023 fourth overall draft pick has started 15 games for the Colts, throwing 11 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Injuries have stymied him throughout his career, with Richardson missing 13 games after shoulder surgery as a rookie in 2023 and four games to multiple injuries in 2024.\n\nLast season, Richardson sustained a fractured orbital bone in a freak pregame warmup incident. That injury left Richardson on injured reserve, where he finished the season.\n\nRichardson, who is still just 23, had his vision impacted by the injury. But recent consultations with doctors indicate his vision has been restored, Jackson said. One physician noted his vision in a recent test to be 20/20 when using both eyes.\n\nColts general manager Chris Ballard said Tuesday that the vision issues were \"trending in the right direction\" and that Richardson was \"cleared to play.\" But he did not indicate the issues were fully resolved.\n\nThe Colts are expected to move forward this year with Jones and 2025 draft pick Riley Leonard at 1 and 2, respectively, on their quarterback depth chart. Jones sustained a torn Achilles tendon in early December but is on schedule to return for the start of next season, Ballard said this week. Jones is a pending free agent, but Ballard said Tuesday that he remains hopeful the Colts can re-sign him to a new deal without having to use the franchise tag.\n\nBallard said \"I still believe in Anthony\" when asked about the player's future this week, but it has been clear for quite some time that Richardson did not have a clear role with the team in 2026. The Colts' decision to bench him temporarily in 2024 undermined their statements about their belief in him. And the decision to go out and sign Jones as a free agent last spring created additional doubt about Richardson's long-term viability with the franchise.\n\nThe decision to allow conversations with other teams was communicated during a meeting with Ballard and Richardson's camp on Thursday. In that meeting, Ballard expressed a willingness to work with Richardson to find a suitable landing spot. That's why the decision to allow Jackson to speak with other teams and find a match works in the player's favor.\n\nRichardson has one season remaining on his rookie contract unless his 2027 fifth-year option is exercised. He has a $1.145 million base salary, plus a $4.24 million roster bonus that is due in August. The Colts would save $5.385 million in salary cap space with $5.43 million in dead money if Richardson is traded before June 1."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- The NCAA football oversight committee is recommending emergency legislation to protect the transfer portal window by issuing penalties for schools and coaches who circumvent the rules.\n\nThe committee on Wednesday proposed the legislation to penalize schools who add players who did not make public their interest in transferring during the January transfer portal window.\n\nThe proposed legislation would become effective immediately if approved at the Division I cabinet meeting in April.\n\nAmong the proposed penalties, the head coach who accepts a transfer who did not properly enter the January portal would be prohibited from all recruiting, on-field coaching and team meetings for six games.\n\nThe school accepting the transfer would be fined 20% of its football budget. Also, the school would lose five roster spots for the following season, even if it no longer employs the coach who accepted the transfer.\n\nGeorgia athletic director Josh Brooks said it is important to enforce the transfer portal window rule.\n\n\"Attempts to circumvent the transfer window process is an issue for the sport,\" Brooks said in a statement released by the NCAA. \"We want to let everyone know that this is not going to be allowed, and the committee wants to protect the transfer window that has been established.\"\n\nBuffalo athletic director Mark Alnutt, the chair of the oversight committee, said \"significant penalties\" are needed to enforce the transfer rule.\n\n\"We felt this was appropriate to place an emphasis on this rule with where we are in Division I football,\" Alnutt said. \"We have a window for student-athletes to notify their school when they would like to enter the transfer portal. If there is movement without going through the process as it is legislated, the committee felt there needed to be significant penalties.\"\n\nThe committee also voted to eliminate the annual limit on official recruiting visits.\n\nThe transfer rule and compensation for players through name, image and likeness contracts have created other issues. The University of Cincinnati is suing its former quarterback, Brendan Sorsby, following his transfer to Texas Tech. Cincinnati is accusing Sorsby of breaching his NIL contract, which the school says was signed in July 2025 to cover the 2025 and 2026 seasons. Cincinnati says the contract included a $1 million buyout if Sorsby transferred.\n\nSorsby received the most lucrative deal of the portal period -- a reported $5 million -- to return to his home state for his final season."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "The Ghanaian Society of Cardiology is alarmed over the continuous rise in the cases of heart failure reported at various health facilities across the country.\n\nLatest statistics from studies conducted by the society show that eight out of 10 cardiac hospitalisation cases recorded at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi were attributable to heart failure.\n\nThe alarming spate of the heart condition, primarily driven by hypertension, is a result of the lack of diagnostic tools, a 1 million patients to 1 doctor ratio, and the late reporting of cases to hospitals.\n\nHeart failure remains one of the most pressing cardiovascular challenges in Africa, with Ghana recording daily cases of the condition.\n\nIt is a leading cause of death among adults in Ghana, with the average age estimated between 40 and 50 years.\n\nA single-centre study at the KATH revealed 88% of cases admitted to the cardiothoracic department of the hospital were heart failure incidences.\n\n“Uncontrolled hypertension remains the leading underlying cause of heart failure in Ghana, alongside poorly managed diabetes and high cholesterol levels. Heart attacks, caused by blocked blood flow to the heart, are also contributing significantly to the burden,” General secretary of the Ghanaian Society of Cardiology, Dr. Lambert Tetteh Appiah, noted.\n\nAshanti regional director of the Ghana Health Service, Dr. Fred Adomako Boateng, elaborated on some challenges confronting cardiology healthcare delivery in the country.\n\nHe explained that the lack of diagnostic tools, especially in the Ashanti region, the late presentation of cases, and the high doctor-to-patient ratio are contributory challenges to the growing statistics.\n\n“Some of the key barriers include late presentation, with more than 60 per cent of patients arriving at advanced stages of the disease, limited diagnostic tools in many districts, high cost of medications, shortage of specialists, and systemic gaps in long-term follow-up care,” he said.\n\nGhana presently has less than 50 cardiologists serving a population of 34 million, highlighting the burden of cases on the specialists. However, the Society reveals that over 15 new cardiologists have been trained over the past five years.\n\nThese were shared at the 2026 annual general meeting of the Ghanaian Society of Cardiology, which assembled adult and paediatric cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, pharmacists and other health professionals.\n\nThe 2-day scientific meeting, which ended on Thursday, February 26, discussed crucial topics on hypertensive heart failure and the role of device therapy and surgery in the management of heart failure.\n\nCEO of the University of Ghana Medical Centre, Dr. Abdul-Samed Tanko, highlighted proactive and preventive medical strategies to reduce the growing numbers.\n\n“To confront the crisis, we propose a multi-pronged strategy: strengthening prevention through improved hypertension detection and control at the primary care level; standardising the initiation of heart failure therapy, particularly at hospital discharge; developing practical implementation tools tailored to district and community-level facilities; and prioritising equity to ensure underserved populations benefit from interventions,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has cut sod for the construction of two catheterisation laboratories in Kumasi and Tamale to expand access to life-saving cardiac intervention across Ghana.\n\nEfforts are also underway to restore and upgrade the cardiac centre at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Very soon, all fishermen will have insurance,” he disclosed.\n\nAccording to him, fishing is a business that must be properly insured to provide relief in times of distress. “If you insure the business, then when some of these attacks happen, they will have some form of relief,” he explained.\n\nMr Campion also disclosed that the Ghana Navy will roll out a special training package for fishermen as part of enhanced maritime security measures.\n\n\"The Navy will be offering training to fishers on how to fish, where to fish, and how to watch out for criminals,” he said.\n\nHe added that fishermen, who often know one another at sea, can play a crucial role in identifying suspicious individuals and reporting potential threats early.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

John Ntim Fordjour, has renewed calls on the government to appoint a substantive Defence Minister, warning that the continued failure to do so is leaving Ghana exposed to threats.\n\nHis comments follow an attack on fishermen at sea near Senya Beraku in the Awutu Senya District of the Central Region. Armed men reportedly fired multiple warning shots, held the victims at gunpoint, and made away with seven outboard motors, generators and other valuables.\n\nSpeaking in an interview on JoyNews' The Pulse on Thursday, Rev. Ntim Fordjour described the situation as alarming and blamed what he termed a leadership vacuum in the defence sector.\n\n“Piracy is becoming a growing concern. The crisis in the defence sector is alarming. For the past few months, we have urged the President to appoint a substantive Minister of Defence. The failure to do so has made our country vulnerable to external threats,\" he said.\n\nAccording to him, \"It is reckless and dangerous that the President has taken no action in this regard. The message we are sending to external actors is that we do not take our defence seriously.”\n\nRev. Ntim Fordjour added that the increasing incidents of insecurity point to broader structural weaknesses that require urgent political attention. He stressed that the absence of a substantive Defence Minister undermines coordination and strategic direction at a time when Ghana faces evolving security threats both within and beyond its borders.\n\nThe Member of Parliament for Assin South described the latest attack as evidence of growing lapses in Ghana’s defence and security sector after Ghanaian tomato traders were attacked in Burkina Faso, killing eight.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Dr Victor Doke calls for sanctions over breach of demarcated zones\n\nA Security Lecturer at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre, Dr Victor Doke, has called on the Fisheries Commission to strictly enforce sanctions against fishermen who go beyond approved fishing zones.\n\nHis comments follow the recent armed robbery incident at sea, where several Ghanaian fishermen were attacked, and their valuables were violently taken at gunpoint on Wednesday, February 25.\n\nAccording to him, consistent enforcement would not only ensure compliance but also enhance safety at sea. He explained that staying within approved limits makes rescue operations easier during emergencies, reduces exposure to pirate attacks, and allows fishermen to return to shore quickly when faced with difficulties.\n\nSpeaking on JoyNews' The Pulse on February 26, Dr Doke said education alone is not deterring fisherfolk from flouting regulations, stressing that enforcement must now take centre stage.\n\n“There’s a difficult call for the Fisheries Commission, and I don’t know how they get to do it, whether they have to now plant men in the canoes where these fisherfolks are going on hikes or what. But since they’ve been educated, it’s not working,” he stated.\n\nDr Doke argued that the law is clear on enforcement, and authorities must not relent in enforcement.\n\n“I think what the law has said should be implemented. Now, if you realise that the fisherfolks have gone beyond a certain limit, what are the sanctions? You just apply it,” he said.\n\n“When we begin to apply sanctions, many of those fisherfolks will learn that for their own safety you are required to stay at a certain limit,” he noted. “It’s all about implementing sanctions. If you are not able to do that, then it means we just go back to the same problem over and over again.”\n\nBeyond national enforcement, Dr Doke also raised concerns about the broader, regional dimension of maritime security, urging a more coordinated approach among countries within the sub-region to address the changing dynamics of threats at sea.\n\nThe recent attack has once again drawn attention to security vulnerabilities in Ghana’s maritime space and the need for stricter adherence to fisheries regulations as part of efforts to protect lives and livelihoods.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Upon arrival at the port, the DVLA registers the excavator before clearance. Thereafter, the Minerals Commission installs a tracking device on the equipment prior to release from the port,” he detailed.\n\nThe Minister disclosed that the government has procured and deployed more than 1,000 digital tracking devices to monitor and regulate the movement and use of excavators and other mining equipment nationwide.\n\nThe initiative, he said, is being implemented in accordance with the Minerals Operation Tracking of Earth-Moving and Mining Equipment Regulations (LI 2404) and is designed to enhance real-time monitoring, improve transparency, and strengthen accountability within the mining sector.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The government has introduced new conditions for entry into Ghana’s medicinal cannabis industry, requiring investors to secure confirmed buyers before obtaining licences to operate.\n\nThe Minister for the Interior, Muntaka Mohammed-Mubarak, announced this at a press briefing in Accra on Thursday, February 26.\n\nHe said the measure is intended to prevent diversion of cannabis into the illegal market and to protect public safety.\n\nAlhaji Mohammed-Mubarak stated that applicants must show a clear market for their produce as part of the licensing process.\n\nHe said authorities would not grant licences to individuals who cannot identify who they intend to sell to.\n\n“We won’t give you the licence if you don’t show us who you are going to sell it to. You need to have an off-taker,” he said, adding that the government will not permit cultivation without secured buyers.\n\nThe directive introduces stricter operational conditions in the rollout of Ghana’s medicinal cannabis programme. It affects farmers, investors, and processors seeking to enter the sector.\n\nThe policy is being implemented under the Narcotics Control Commission Amendment Act, 2023 and the Cannabis Regulations, 2023. These laws provide legal backing for the cultivation and management of cannabis strictly for industrial and medicinal purposes.\n\nAlhaji Mohammed-Mubarak stressed that recreational use of cannabis remains illegal. “For the avoidance of doubt, cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC remains a prohibited narcotic,” he said.\n\nHe outlined additional controls that prospective operators must meet.\n\nAccording to him, a total of 11 different licences are required across the value chain, including cultivation, processing, transportation, import, and export. Each licence is activity-specific and non-transferable.\n\n“You cannot cultivate and assume you can transport. You need another licence for that,” he explained.\n\nThe minister also said Ghana does not currently produce the specialised low-THC cannabis seeds required for the programme. As a result, all seeds must be imported under licence.\n\n“Government is not positioning itself to provide the seeds. It is a business opportunity for those who want to import,” he said, while encouraging research institutions to develop local seed capacity over time.\n\nTo prevent abuse and diversion into illegal channels, the Interior Ministry, working with the Narcotics Control Commission and other security agencies, will apply surveillance and enforcement measures. These include GPS tracking, drone monitoring, and unannounced inspections of licensed facilities.\n\nSecurity agencies such as the police, immigration service, prisons service, and the National Investigations Bureau will take part in enforcement.\n\nMr Mohammed-Mubarak warned that failure to comply with the regulations could have consequences for the country’s standing internationally. “If we get it wrong, Ghana could easily be blacklisted, and all the efforts will come to nothing,” he said.\n\nHe added that licensed facilities must not be located within 100 metres of schools or residential areas. Operators are also required to submit quarterly returns or face sanctions.\n\nOn the economic outlook, the Minister said although the sector has the potential to generate substantial revenue, the government’s immediate concern is public safety.\n\n“Our emphasis is more on security and public safety than on money. If we do it right, the benefits will come,” he said.\n\nThe introduction of the off-taker requirement is expected to shape participation in the sector. It limits entry to investors who can show full commercial readiness from production to sale.\n\nFor many local farmers and small-scale entrants, the directive raises the entry threshold. It indicates that participation will require not only land and interest but also firm market arrangements and capital.\n\nMr Mohammed-Mubarak said the government remains open to engagement but will enforce the rules. “Our doors are open 24/7, but we will make sure the intent of the law is fully achieved,” he said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The minority in Parliament is urging President John Dramani Mahama to address pressing issues affecting Ghanaians ahead of his State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Friday, February 27.\n\nAccording to the Caucus, the President must provide a detailed account of the recent cocoa price reduction, a move they say has sparked serious concerns among farmers and industry stakeholders.\n\nThey are also seeking explanations regarding ongoing complaints about rapidly depleting prepaid electricity credit, which many consumers say is adding to their financial burden.\n\nSpeaking to JoyNews’ Kwaku Asante on February 26 ahead of SONA tomorrow, the Member of Parliament for Akim Swedru, Kennedy Osei Nyarko, outlined the matters he believes the President must address.\n\nOn the general mood in the country, he said, \"You can see there is a lot of despondency among the Ghanaian people. We've recently heard about the cocoa haircut, which has affected over a million of cocoa farmers in the country.”\n\nHe further explained the impact on farmers and their families:\n\n“They are not only talking about just the million; they have a lot of dependents, those who are students in school, and all those things. These are very difficult moments for those Ghanaian farmers that are losing money as a result of the government's decision to cut down the producer price.\"\n\nTouching on electricity tariff concerns, he stated:\n\n“Recently, we also heard about people complaining about electricity. This was a decision that was taken by the government just to increase the electricity tariff by some 28%, and we are now feeling the impact of it. So, these are people who are complaining.”\n\nOn youth unemployment, he added:\n\n“The youth who were promised employment are still saying that they have not gotten the job that this government promised them.”\n\nHe stressed that these are the key issues that must be addressed: “These are three key things. So, if the president is coming here tomorrow, he should be bringing solutions as to how these matters are going to be dealt with.”\n\nHe cautioned against relying solely on macroeconomic indicators: “It is not enough to say that inflation has come down; the cedi is strong. I mean, it is not enough. That is not enough. We are talking about bread-and-butter issues.”\n\nHe continued, “Bread issues are affecting the ordinary person, those who have that hope in this government and went to the queue to vote for that government. That is what we are looking at. So, if the government is not coming to give solutions to these issues, well, I don't know what is coming.”\n\nHe was of the view that Ghanaians are not interested in peripheral matters:\n\n“He can decide to be talking about plenty of things, but that is not what the Ghanaian populace is interested in.”\n\nAccording to him, the President has an opportunity to respond directly to these concerns:\n\n“We are interested in this matter that I put before you, and I believe tomorrow the President will have a fine opportunity to come and tell the Ghanaian people that this is how I intend to solve the electricity challenges that people are complaining.”\n\nDrawing a comparison with past leadership, he observed:\n\n“It happened in 2018 when Ghanaians were complaining about high tariffs on electricity. Akufo-Addo took a decision to reduce electricity tariffs by 14% for non-residential consumers, and that is what leadership is about.”\n\n\"I expect President Mahama and his government to also pull the same line and protect the ordinary person,\" he emphasised.\n\nFollowing the minority’s remarks, the Member of Parliament for Tamale North, Alhassan Suhuyini (NDC), has defended President John Dramani Mahama, arguing that many of the issues currently facing the country were inherited from previous administrations.\n\n“I’m happy they acknowledge that they have created problems that His Excellency President Mahama is creating solutions for. Because, clearly, when you talk about cocoa, I think that those who have followed the discussion are now fully aware that the problem was fully inherited by President Mahama, and the steps that he is taking are steps that will resolve the problems, not just for his regime, but for even governments that will come after him,” he said.\n\nHe also highlighted challenges in the electricity sector, which he says was left in disarray by the previous government: “When you talk about electricity, we know the debts that they left behind in that sector; the mismanagement of even ESLA, which was left for them to solve the problems in that sector itself, became a subject of mismanagement, and they know the mess that they created. I'm not surprised. They are hoping that solutions will be featured in President Mahama's SONA.”\n\nMr Suhuyini said expectations for solutions are based on confidence in the President’s leadership:\n\n“I think that it is based on their confidence in him and the confidence of the Ghanaian people in him to inherit problems and to fix them for the future. And I am also expecting solutions to the problems that they, in the NPP, created.”\n\nHe explained that Mahama returned to the presidency specifically to tackle these inherited challenges:\n\n“That is the only reason why President Mahama decided to return to be president, so that he could resolve the challenges that they left behind.”\n\nOn macroeconomic issues, he added:\n\n“They are not interested in macroeconomic figures because they know that he has already fixed that problem that they created, taking us to DDEP, the first time in the history of this country. We were unable to service our debt. Pensioners had to endure haircuts, and they know that President Mahama, within a year, has fixed that problem, and so that's why they no longer want to listen to that.”\n\nHe concluded by praising the President’s approach:\n\n“But President Mahama, being who he is, will give a correct account of the affairs of the state, and he will do so sincerely, and he will do so with the humility that he is noted for.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Member of Parliament for Kintampo, Joseph Kwame Kumah, called on the President to provide an honest and unflinching account of the nation’s state.\n\n“The President's State of the Nation Address, which is an annual requirement, has become a ritual. And what we expect the President, for instance, to tell Ghanaians is nothing but the truth. The real State of the Nation Address should tell Ghanaians what it will take them to accept whatever outcomes are ahead of us,” he said.\n\n“Some of us will not like anything like flattering. Ghanaians are waiting for nothing but truism,” he added.\n\nIn response to criticisms from the NPP regarding cocoa, the economy, and other issues, he stated that the government has made measurable progress.\n\n“Even this morning, I'm understanding inflation has further reduced to about 3.5%. What do they expect?\" he said.\n\nHe highlighted improvements for ordinary traders:\n\n“The common trader will tell you from Makola Market that she is able now to buy rice at low as even 25 cedis. 50 cedis per kilo, which was a total of 150 cedis.”\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Africa Prosperity Network (APN) has unveiled a bold 12-point Action Compact calling for the urgent implementation of Africa’s long-standing integration agenda, including visa-free travel across all African Union (AU) member states.\n\nThe Compact was adopted at the 2026 edition of the Africa Prosperity Dialogues, held from February 4 to 6 at the Accra International Conference Centre, under the theme: “Empowering SMEs, Women and Youth in Africa’s Single Market: Innovate. Collaborate. Trade.”\n\nDescribed as a “People’s Compact,” the document reflects the collective position of 6,530 participants who travelled to Accra from 51 African countries and 40 others across the world.\n\nCentral to the Compact is a demand for visa-free travel for Africans within Africa. Delegates argued that without free movement of people, the vision of a truly integrated single market of 1.5 billion people will remain unattainable.\n\nThey stressed that mobility is critical to unlocking trade, innovation, and investment opportunities across borders.\n\nThe Compact also calls for seamless cross-border trade, including systems that allow Africans to buy and sell goods and services across countries using mobile money wallets.\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) emphasised that practical digital payment interoperability could significantly boost intra-African commerce, especially under the framework of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nParticipants agreed that Africa does not need new declarations but must fully implement existing treaties and protocols.\n\nThey cited the Abuja Treaty, the AfCFTA Agreement, the Protocol on Free Movement of Persons, and AfCFTA protocols on Digital Trade and on Women and Youth in Trade as frameworks already in place but awaiting full execution.\n\nAlthough the Free Movement Protocol was adopted in 2018, only four member states have ratified it—far below the 15 required for it to enter into force.\n\nDelegates warned that without ratification and enforcement, businesses will continue to face barriers to scaling across borders, undermining Africa’s integration efforts.\n\nWith youth unemployment described as the continent’s most urgent challenge, speakers argued that economic integration is no longer optional.\n\nThey estimated that Africa must create between 15 and 20 million jobs annually to meet growing demand and cautioned that fragmented markets are economically self-defeating for individual countries and the continent as a whole.\n\nThe Compact anchors the “Make Africa Borderless Now!” movement—a continent-wide petition campaign targeting 10 million signatures.\n\nOrganisers say the petition will be presented to the AU Assembly in February 2027, demanding swift ratification and implementation of existing agreements.\n\nChairperson of the APN Advisory Council, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, described the Compact as the unified voice of Africa’s private sector, women, and youth.\n\n“The tools for prosperity already exist. The time for implementation is now,” she said.\n\nShe referenced Agenda 2063, the continent’s long-term development blueprint, launched in 2013 during her tenure as Chairperson of the African Union Commission.\n\nThe 2026 Compact now places renewed pressure on African governments to move from commitments to concrete action.\n\nDelegates maintained that meaningful integration—through open borders, digital payments, and enforceable trade rules—is essential for job creation, economic resilience, and shared prosperity across the continent.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "JICA convened a homecoming presentation session in Accra\n\nSource: JICA\n\nThe Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) successfully convened a homecoming presentation session in Accra at the Erata Hotel for Ghanaian government officials who studied in Japan under the Project for Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS).\n\nJICA also organized a seminar titled “Japan's Diplomacy toward Africa and the Current State of Japanese Corporate Investment,” delivered by Professor SHIRATO Keiichi of Ritsumeikan University as part of its ongoing efforts to deepen Japan–Ghana cooperation.\n\n\n\nA Decade of Investing in Ghana’s Human Capital\n\n\n\nFunded by the Government of Japan, the JDS program supports promising young Ghanaian civil servants to pursue graduate degrees in Japan, equipping them with advanced knowledge and practical skills for national development.\n\n\n\nSince its launch in Ghana in 2012, the JDS program has produced 143 fellows, many of whom now occupy influential roles across ministries and agencies, contributing to policy development in areas such as Economics, Public Administration, Public Health, and International Relations.\n\n\n\nNow in its 14th year in Ghana, the JDS program continues to serve as one of Japan’s flagship human resource development initiatives, fostering leaders who can drive institutional reforms and steer the nation’s development agenda.\n\n\n\nA Knowledge Sharing and Results-Oriented Presentations\n\nThe homecoming presentation session featured presentations from recently returned JDS alumni, who shared the tangible outcomes of their research and academic experiences in Japan. These officials demonstrated how the insights gained into Japan’s unique modernization and development paradigms are being applied to solve local challenges and enhance public administration in Ghana.\n\n\n\nShifting the Paradigm: From \"Aid\" to \"Co-creation\"\n\n\n\nIn his keynote lecture, Prof. SHIRATO, outlined major global shifts affecting Africa-Japan relations. Drawing on international data, he explained that the world is undergoing rapid multipolarization, while relative economic weight of traditional powers -the United States, Europe, Japan- gradually declining, while emerging economies continue to rise.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, African countries have moved from being passive aid recipients to active political and economic actors shaping the international system.\n\n\n\nProf. SHIRATO emphasized that Africa’s demographic dynamism—rapid population growth and a young workforce— drives corporate interest, including Japanese firms, and argued that future engagement should shift from a traditional donor–recipient approach to an equal, co‑creative partnership.\n\n\n\nHe also noted that domestic fiscal pressures and “anti‑aid” public sentiment in developed countries underscore the need for more sustainable, mutually beneficial cooperation models.\n\nLeading the World with Trust: JDS Alumni as the “Bridge”\n\n\n\nIn his concluding remarks, Prof. SHIRATO sent a powerful message to the JDS alumni that as individuals who deeply understand both Japan and Africa, you are the key to unlocking this Co-creative Partnership.”\n\n\n\nIn line with its vision, “Leading the World with Trust,” JICA remains committed to fostering these \"bridges\" between the two nations. By empowering Ghanaian officials with both Japanese insights and local expertise, JICA aims to create tangible developmental outcomes and strengthen the economic ties between Japan and Ghana."

The case has been adjourned to March 26, 2026.\n\n\n\nAmong the accused are Col Kwadwo Damoah (Rtd), a former Customs Commissioner and sitting MP for Jaman South; Emmanuel Kofi Nti and Ammishaddai Owusu-Amoah, both former Commissioner-Generals of the Ghana Revenue Authority; Isaac Crentsil, former Customs Commissioner; Evans Adusei, CEO of SML; and the company itself.\n\n\n\nAll have pleaded not guilty and are currently on bail.\n\n\n\nThe case stems from a revenue assurance contract awarded to SML under the previous administration.\n\n\n\nThe contract later sparked national controversy and was eventually cancelled following a directive by President John Dramani Mahama.\n\n\n\nIn the charge sheet, the Special Prosecutor alleged that the accused persons orchestrated a “criminal enterprise” beginning in 2017 to use the SML contract to unlawfully benefit the company, despite what he described as no genuine need for the services it purported to provide.\n\n\n\nHe stated: “The criminal enterprise was commenced in 2017 by the first, third, seventh, and eighth accused persons, with the other accused persons joining the adventure at various times. The criminal enterprise was characterised by no genuine need for contracting the eighth accused company for the obligations it purported to perform, and the contracts were secured for the eighth company through self-serving patronage and promotion by the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth accused persons based on false and unverified claims.”\n\n\n\nThe OSP further accused the accused persons of engaging in prohibited acts and “acted with increased emboldened impunity as they freely abused their public offices by using the offices for private benefit.”\n\n\n\nHe added that the six former officials enabled SML to “largely pretend to perform the services under the various contracts leading to immense financial loss to the republic of about one billion, four hundred and thirty-six million, two hundred and forty-nine thousand, eight hundred and twenty-eight cedis, fifty-three pesewas (GH¢1,436,249,828.53).”\n\n\n\n“The accused persons based their actions on their false claims that the eighth accused company possessed technical expertise and capability in revenue assurance, and that the technical expertise and capability of the eighth accused person had greatly increased revenue for the republic; and further that the eighth accused company exclusively possessed the only patented and proven technological systems in the world for value chain transaction audits, external price verification and measurement audit services in the downstream petroleum, upstream petroleum and minerals sectors,” the OSP added.\n\n\n\nNA/AE\n\n\n\nGhanaian man and his Nigerian girlfriend found dead in Morocco apartment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TrendingGH: Love or Pressure?

While attention was on the field and the clashes, thieves targeted students’ belongings in the crowd.\n\n\n\nSeveral were caught and taken to the Asokwa Police Station.\n\n\n\n“Apart from that, those who came to the stadium to watch the event and tried to take away the belongings of the students, some of them were also arrested, and the police sent them to Asokwa Police Station,” Otto added.\n\n\n\nOrganisers have now deployed over 300 police officers and three armoured vehicles to secure the 40,000-capacity venue for the remaining events.\n\n\n\n“Things went on well yesterday, and we are expecting the same thing today, and we hope to have a successful event,” he said.\n\n\n\nCHASS has condemned the violence and is calling for stricter measures to protect students and preserve the spirit of these competitions.\n\n\n\nThe hope now is for a peaceful finish so the focus can return to the athletes and their achievements.\n\n\n\nNA/VPO\n\n\n\nGhanaian man and his Nigerian girlfriend found dead in Morocco apartment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TrendingGH: Love or Pressure?

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "Technical discussions to continue in Vienna, but unclear whether differences can be resolved to avoid war.\n\nTehran, Iran – Another round of indirect talks between Iranian and United States officials ended with a mediator claiming “significant progress” but still no clear evidence that either side was willing to concede enough on their positions to avoid war.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the talks in Geneva on Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said further technical talks would be held next week in Vienna and progress had been “good”.\n\n“These were the most serious and longest talks,” Araghchi said.\n\nOmani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi, who mediated the talks, said Iranian and US diplomats would consult with their governments before the Vienna talks.\n\nFew details have emerged about the discussions, but Araghchi was reported to have met US envoy Steve Witkoff – if only briefly, according to Iran’s Tasnim news agency.\n\nThe Iranian team, led by Araghchi, handed over on Wednesday night Tehran’s written proposals to Al Busaidi, who also mediated previous rounds of talks in Geneva and Muscat.\n\nThe Omani diplomat then met with the US delegation on Thursday, led by Witkoff and US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Al Busaidi mediated between the two teams throughout the day, and the US delegation also held separate talks over Ukraine.\n\nAlso taking part in the talks was Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which will have to undertake nuclear monitoring and verification duties in Iran in case of any agreement.\n\nThe UN watchdog will hold several days of board meetings starting on March 6, which is around the 10- to 15-day deadline floated by Trump last week for Iran to reach a deal.\n\n\n\nWestern media outlets have suggested the board could once again consider a move to censure Iran depending on the results of the Geneva talks. Iran has accused Grossi of taking politicised action and criticised the IAEA after Israel attacked Iran in June, one day after the agency passed a resolution saying Tehran was not complying with its commitment to nuclear safeguards.\n\nFundamental differences\n\nThe two sides have been at odds over key issues, including uranium enrichment and missiles.\n\nWashington has repeatedly emphasised, in lockstep with Israel, that it will not accept any nuclear enrichment taking place on Iranian soil, even at civilian-use levels agreed during the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran agreed with world powers. Trump unilaterally abandoned that deal in 2018.\n\nIn the days leading up to the Geneva talks, US officials increasingly focused on Iran’s ballistic missile programme, saying the missiles threaten US military bases across the Middle East as well as Israel. Iran has refused to entertain any talks on its conventional weapons. Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian, have repeatedly said they will never develop nuclear weapons.\n\nSpeaking to local officials during a provincial visit, Pezeshkian also shot back at Trump’s assertion during a lengthy State of the Union speech that Iran was “the world’s number one sponsor of terror”.\n\nPezeshkian said numerous Iranian officials and nuclear scientists have been assassinated over the decades, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the country’s 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\n“If the realities are seen fairly, it will become clear that Iran is not only not a supporter of terrorism, but one of the main victims of terror in the region and across the world,” he said.\n\nThe Iranian government’s IRNA news agency said Tehran’s proposal was expected to gauge US “seriousness” in the talks because it contained “win-win” offers.\n\nIranian officials have not publicly discussed all the details of their proposals, but they are believed to include diluting part of the country’s 60-percent enriched uranium and keeping the uranium inside the country. Iranian authorities envisage that could be paired with economic opportunities for the US related to Iranian oil and gas and the purchase of airplanes.\n\nSupreme Leader Ali Khamenei has maintained his tough rhetoric against the US as well, casting doubt on the chances of any agreement. He also said Trump would be unable to overthrow Iran’s government after the US president said regime change would be “the best thing that could happen” in Iran.\n\n\n\nAraghchi said during an interview on Wednesday that even if Khamenei is killed, the theocratic establishment in Iran would carry on because it has legal procedures in place to appoint a successor. Pezeshkian added on Thursday: “They can eliminate me, eliminate anyone. If they hit us, a hundred more like us will come up to run the country.”\n\nDouble-digit inflation as Iran braces for war\n\nIranian and US officials have been hailing supposed “progress” in the indirect talks this month, but many Iranians continue to prepare for war.\n\nIn Tehran and across the country, people are buying bottled water, biscuits, canned foods and other essentials in case of a war.\n\n“A few days ago, I bought a power bank to keep the electronics charged. Now I’m looking for a short-wave radio so we can hear the news if the state shuts down the internet and electricity infrastructure is bombed,” said a 28-year-old resident of the capital who asked not to be named.\n\nAs bombs fell during the 12-day war with Israel in June, Iranian authorities cut off almost all internet access for several days, followed in January by an unprecedented 20-day total blackout imposed on about 92 million people as thousands of people were killed during nationwide protests.\n\nThe Iranian government, which blames “terrorists” armed and funded by the US and Israel for the protests, has rejected Trump’s claim that 32,000 Iranians were killed during the demonstrations. It said more than 3,000 people were killed, and rejects documentation by the United Nations and international human rights organisations that its security forces were behind the killings.\n\nAs the threat of war intensifies, not all Iranians are capable of stocking up on food and other necessities due to rising inflation that has gripped the country for more than a decade as a result of a mix of chronic local mismanagement and US and UN sanctions.\n\nAccording to separate reports by the Statistical Centre of Iran and the Central Bank of Iran released on Thursday, inflation has now shot beyond 60 percent.\n\nThe Statistical Centre put annual inflation in the Iranian month of Bahman, which ended on February 19, at 68.1 percent, while the Central Bank said it was 62.2 percent.\n\nFood inflation was by far the strongest driver at a whopping 105 percent. That included a 207-percent inflation rate for cooking oil, 117 percent for red meat, 108 percent for eggs and dairy products, 113 percent for fruit and 142 percent for bread and corn.\n\nIran’s national currency, the rial, stood at about 1.66 million rials to the US dollar on Thursday, near an all-time low."

It grants deportation protections and the ability to work in the US.\n\nBut the Trump administration has moved to terminate TPS protections for people from 12 countries in total, among them Haiti, Myanmar, Somalia and Yemen, despite critics warning that those countries remain in turmoil.\n\nWhile efforts to strip TPS protections have faced setbacks in lower courts, the Trump administration has successfully appealed to the conservative-majority Supreme Court on two previous occasions.\n\nThose Supreme Court decisions, one in May and one in October, paved the way for the Trump administration to remove TPS from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals living in the US.\n\n\n\nTPS was first granted to Syrians in 2012 as the country was engulfed in a bloody civil war that displaced millions of people.\n\nThe civil war ended in December 2024, with the ouster of former leader Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe Trump administration has supported the new government of interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.\n\nIt has also argued that Syria “no longer meets the criteria for an ongoing armed conflict that poses a serious threat to the personal safety of returning Syrian nationals”, thereby eliminating the need for TPS.\n\nUS Judge Katherine Polk Failla blocked the Trump administration from suspending TPS for Syrians in November.\n\nThe US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York subsequently declined to block that order."

            "content": "A Kenyan man has been charged with human trafficking for allegedly recruiting people to fight for the Russian army in Ukraine.\n\nKenya’s Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) said on Thursday that Festus Omwamba is accused of sending 22 “Kenyan youths to Russia for exploitation by means of deception” as the director of a recruitment agency.\n\nThe DPP said the victims were rescued in an operation from an apartment complex in Athi River, a town in Machakos County, last September, before they could leave the country. But three others who had allegedly already left Kenya ended up on the front line of the Russia-Ukraine war and later returned with injuries, it said.\n\nOmwamba pleaded not guilty to the charges in an appearance at the Kahawa Law Courts in Kiambu.\n\nHis lawyer, Bonaventure Otieno, said, “There’s no case,” and described it as being based on “speculations”, the AFP news agency reports.\n\nThe Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said Omwamba was believed to be a “key player in a more extensive human trafficking syndicate that exploits vulnerable individuals by promising them legitimate employment opportunities in European countries.”\n\nHe was arrested in Moyale, near the Ethiopian border in the north of the country, earlier this month.\n\nThe prosecutor, Kennedy Amwayi, told the court the case “has attracted public interest both locally and internationally; therefore, the public demands accountability following the loss of life in Russia.”\n\n\n\nHundreds of Kenyans join Russian army\n\nMore than 1,000 Kenyans have joined the Russian army in recent months, according to a National Intelligence Service (NIS) report released last week. In many cases, they were promised jobs in Russia before being forced to sign army contracts and sent to fight in Ukraine.\n\nMP Kimani Ichung’wah, who presented the NIS findings in parliament, said 89 Kenyans are still on the front line, 39 have been hospitalised and 28 are missing in action. He accused Russian embassy officials of working with recruitment agencies and trafficking syndicates.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Nairobi denied the accusations, saying they were a “dangerous and misleading propaganda campaign”. It said no tourist visas were given to people intending to fight in Ukraine, adding that Russian law does not “preclude citizens of foreign countries from voluntarily enlisting in the armed forces.”\n\nIn July last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree allowing foreigners to serve in the army during draft periods.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, South Africa reported that two of its citizens were killed on the front lines. The foreign affairs ministry said in a statement that these were separate from the 17 South Africans tricked into fighting for Russia, who have largely been repatriated.\n\nMinister of International Relations and Cooperation Ronald Lamola said that while the details surrounding their recruitment were under investigation, “circumstances that led to this situation were highly irregular”.\n\n“If a job offer abroad sounds too good to be true, it probably is,” he added."

            "content": "US president strikes triumphant tone in annual speech but faces legal setbacks and hurdles in Congress as midterms approach.\n\nWashington, DC – United States President Donald Trump has hailed the first 13 months of his second term as nothing short of “transformative” during his State of the Union address, a message of victory the White House says he will continue to take on the road as he seeks to build support for his Republican Party before the midterm elections in November.\n\nBut the speech on Tuesday also underscored uncomfortable political realities for Trump, laying bare the vulnerabilities of a president who has relied on a flood of executive orders, unilateral actions and emergency declarations to build his agenda.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s ruling against his signature tariff policy – just days before the speech – underscored just how quickly Trump’s most brazen and signature actions could disintegrate amid a mountain of legal challenges.\n\n“It was a speech to shore up his base of supporters,” said Aaron Kall, a professor at the University of Michigan who studies presidential messaging, “as opposed to extending olive branches to Democrats or trying to attract new supporters”.\n\nIt is a potentially constraining approach for a president who will need congressional support – including from vulnerable Republican lawmakers facing punishing re-election campaigns and centrist Democrats – to achieve many of his objectives in the months ahead.\n\n“In some ways, Trump’s political fate and future relies upon getting some kind of buy-in or cooperation,” Kall said.\n\nAnother ‘Big Beautiful Bill’?\n\nTrump’s most substantial legislative victory of his second term came in the form of a sweeping bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in July. He gave it top billing in his speech on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe legislation, dubbed by the president his “Big Beautiful Bill” and by critics as Trump’s “Big Ugly Bill”, codified several of Trump’s top agenda items from his campaign, including populist economic pledges to alleviate taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits.\n\nThe bill included a raft of other top Trump agenda items: temporarily extending certain tax cuts that had been set to expire; deeply cutting funding for welfare, healthcare and foreign aid programmes; raising the national debt ceiling; rolling back clean energy incentives; and surging billions of dollars to both increase enforcement at the southern border and support Trump’s mass detention and deportation drive.\n\n“Last year, I urged this Congress to begin the mission by passing the largest tax cuts in American history, and our Republican majorities delivered so beautifully,” Trump said during the speech although fact checkers have challenged his historic characterisation of the cuts in what they have assessed as one of several misleading claims the president made about his record and the economy.\n\n“Thank you, Republicans,” he said.\n\nPolls have shown the US public is not noticing a major change in their lived experience. Trump’s approval rating has slumped in the months since the bill was passed with views of his handling of the economy sliding as he entered the second year of his second nonconsecutive term in office.\n\n“Trump takes credit for what he says are improvements that have been made, telling people why their lives are better or why they’re saving money from taxes or why costs are lower for gas,” Kall noted.\n\n“But clearly there’s a disconnect between a good portion of the public vs the kind of story Trump’s telling.”\n\nTrump on affordability\n\nTrump on Tuesday did not call for another sweeping bill like the one passed last year but instead pitched several pieces of legislation broadly aimed at addressing the high cost of living.\n\nWhile Trump has generally preferred a go-it-alone approach, his statements underscored that he still needs Congress for many of the policy initiatives he touted on Tuesday, even as he blamed Democrats and the administration of former President Joe Biden for the stubbornly high cost of living in the US.\n\nFor example, on healthcare, Trump hailed the 16 “most favoured nations” agreements his administration has struck with pharmaceutical companies. While full details of those agreements have not been released, they generally involve pegging prescription drug prices to the typically lower rates negotiated by foreign countries.\n\n\n\nThe deals have been the basis of the White House’s “TrumpRX” medication marketplace, an entity that the administration has pitched as a cheaper alternative for Americans willing to bypass insurance and pay cash for drugs. But Trump hinted at concerns over the staying power of the scheme.\n\n“So now I’m calling on Congress to codify my most-favoured nation programme into law,” Trump said, although it remains unclear under what legal mechanism the deals could be legislated.\n\nTrump then pointed to an executive order he signed last month that seeks to ban investment firms from buying single-family homes to rent. The phenomenon has contributed to a housing access and affordability crisis in the country and has become a particularly salient issue as the midterm elections approach.\n\n“And now I’m asking Congress to make that ban permanent because all this for people, really, that’s what we want,” Trump said during the State of the Union, which came hours after Democrats pitched their own version of legislation aimed at the practice. “We want homes for people, not for corporations.”\n\nFinally, Trump pitched a plan to boost retirement accounts for seniors by providing federal contributions to retirement savings programmes, known as 401(k)s. After the speech, his Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told NBC News that the plan could likely be achieved only through legislation.\n\nTariffs\n\nThe largest question mark over Trump’s economic initiatives has been on his tariff policy.\n\nTrump has long framed aggressive tariffs on trade partners as part of his America First vision, saying it would lead to a hard reset on global trade that would incentivise US domestic industry growth.\n\nDuring the State of the Union, he hailed his tariff policy as “one of the primary reasons for our country’s economic turnaround”, even as he lamented the Supreme Court’s “unfortunate ruling” deeming illegal large portions of the tariffs he announced last year.\n\nTrump has since used a new authority to impose 10 percent tariffs on global trading partners, which he hopes to increase to 15 percent, saying on Tuesday that the plan would remain as is under “fully approved and tested alternative legal statutes”.\n\n“Congressional action will not be necessary,” he said.\n\nStill, the new measures will expire in 150 days, just months before the midterm elections, unless Congress acts. Some trade experts have questioned the legality of the programme with analysts at the libertarian CATO Institute think tank among those arguing the new tariffs “almost certainly violate the law”, opening the door to further legal challenges.\n\nMeanwhile, refunds for levies collected from US businesses under the recently deemed illegal tariffs have not yet been addressed, leaving another potential political vulnerability for Republicans in the months ahead.\n\nTrump on DHS standoff\n\nStanding at the podium in the House of Representatives at the US Capitol, Trump showed little departure from the hardline approach to immigration that has defined the first year of his second term, even as the issue has become an increasingly political liability for Republicans.\n\n\n\nTrump hailed what has been in effect a closure of the US border to asylum seekers, which he enacted under an emergency declaration that continues to face legal challenges likely bound for the Supreme Court. He used several guests to tie undocumented people to high rates of crime, a premise that has been challenged by several studies.\n\nIn one particularly theatrical moment aimed at Democrats in attendance, Trump asked lawmakers who agreed that “the first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens” to stand up. He did not mention two US citizens killed by immigration enforcement agents in Minnesota in January.\n\nExit polls showed Trump’s 2024 victory was, in part, buoyed by his hardline immigration stance, but more recent opinion polls have shown increased dismay over the tactics used. The issue is considered particularly fraught for Republicans facing strong Democratic challengers in the months ahead.\n\nIn the short term, Democrats have seized on the politically potent issue, holding up annual funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to press for greater oversight and reform. DHS oversees the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and US Border Patrol as well as the Secret Service, Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\n“Tonight, I’m demanding the full and immediate restoration of all funding for the border security, homeland security of the United States and also for helping people clean up their snow,” Trump said during his speech as he appeared to suggest that FEMA – which rarely aids in snow removal – has been unable to respond to a recent storm that struck the US Northeast in light of the shutdown.\n\nSAVE Act\n\nTrump also revisited a defining message of his 2024 election campaign, his repeated claim that the US elections, including his 2020 loss to Biden, are marred by high rates of fraud and other forms of malfeasance.\n\nDespite repeated studies, including from conservative organisations, finding tiny and largely inconsequential rates of voting fraud across decades of elections, Trump maintained during the address that “cheating is rampant in our elections”.\n\nHe called on Republicans to pass the so-called Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a bill that would create higher documentation requirements when registering to vote and arriving at the polls as well as requiring states to hand voter rolls to DHS to identify noncitizens.\n\nRights groups have said the legislation would disenfranchise untold voters, noting, for example, that about half of US citizens do not have a valid passport.\n\nThe bill has passed the Republican-controlled House, but passage in the Senate would almost surely involve changing rules on the filibuster, a tool used by the opposing party to scuttle bills that do not meet a 60-vote threshold in the 100-seat chamber.\n\nChanges to filibuster rules have long been viewed as a “nuclear option” by both parties.\n\nShifting priorities\n\nThe annual State of the Union address is an opportunity for presidents to make the case for their leadership and vision for the months ahead. They also reveal an administration’s shifting priorities.\n\nFor example, as Kall explained, with the US on the brink of escalation with Iran, uncertainty still lingering after the US abduction of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and Trump recently pledging $10bn in support of his Board of Peace, launched to address rebuilding in Gaza and other conflicts around the world, the president chose not to dive into foreign policy until more than 90 minutes into his speech.\n\n\n\nCritics have seen Trump’s foreign adventurism as a direct contradiction to his campaign promises to end US intervention abroad.\n\nTrump’s desire to take control of Greenland was another major point in his March address to a joint session of Congress. But after a so-far unsuccessful pressure campaign beginning in January against European countries, the self-governed Danish territory was not mentioned in this year’s speech.\n\nMeanwhile, while marquee themes like the economy, immigration and trade remained constant from Trump’s last address to a joint session of Congress, other areas received no mention, including the formerly Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which made cuts to the federal government workforce, leading to agency disruptions but falling far short of savings pledges.\n\n“The president has the benefit of how to frame the State of the Union,” Kall said. “Trump’s speech reflected the political reality of the time.”"

Now, Samsung is confirming what we previously only suspected: RAMageddon is partly to blame.\n\nSamsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the COO of its mobile business, tells The Verge that the memory shortage alone made a “significant contribution” to the price. All the increasing material costs factored into the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus costing $100 more than their predecessors this year, as did tariffs, but the memory was “significant,” he tells me.\n\nRelated The RAM shortage is coming for everything you care about\n\nThe S26 does come with double the storage this year at its higher price, with 256GB rather than 128GB, though its $899 price tag is still $40 higher than an S25 with 256GB cost at launch. And though tariffs may have been a factor as well, Samsung has hiked the price in other regions too, not just the United States. The pricier S26 Ultra does come with intriguing upgrades, however, including a built-in privacy screen and the largest vapor chamber cooling system in a phone.\n\nSamsung chip partner Qualcomm warned in its February quarterly results that it was seeing a big dip in its handset business “100 percent” due to the memory shortage, telling investors that the AI industry’s appetite for components would likely define the entire scale of the phone industry all year long.\n\nAnd today, IDC is forecasting the largest drop ever recorded in worldwide smartphone shipments, a dip of 12.9 percent, across 2026. “What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,” writes IDC."

She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission is encouraging companies to adopt age verification technologies by announcing it will not enforce a children’s online privacy law against certain websites that collect and use minors’ personal data in order to verify their ages.\n\n“Age verification technologies are some of the most child-protective technologies to emerge in decades,” Christopher Mufarrige, the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a press release. “Our statement incentivizes operators to use these innovative tools, empowering parents to protect their children online.”\n\nThere are certain criteria that websites need to meet in order to avoid enforcement under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) Rule, which generally requires commercial website operators to obtain parental consent to collect information on kids under 13. General or “mixed audience” sites will be allowed to collect minors’ data without verifiable parental consent “for the sole purpose of determining a user’s age” if they follow a set of other protocols: they must promptly delete the data after it’s finished being used to verify age; they can only disclose the data to third-party providers that have taken “reasonable steps to determine are capable of maintaining the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the information;” they must provide a clear notice about the information they’ll collect; they’re expected to employ reasonable security measures; and they must try to ensure that results will be “reasonably accurate.”\n\nThe statement has been cheered by many who favor age verification technologies, but some privacy advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) are skeptical the approach will do more to protect kids online. “Age-checking-related data collection poses the very threats that COPPA is designed to address, and we have already seen age estimation systems having issues with data breaches and leaks,” EFF senior counsel David Greene said in a statement. Last year, Discord disclosed that about 70,000 users might have had their government IDs exposed in a breach, after they were collected by a third-party vendor to review appeals related to age. “This is just another sign that the FTC doesn’t truly care about young peoples’ privacy or speech rights,” Greene said.\n\nBut the FTC’s policy statement “makes clear that companies choosing to [do] age assurance must do so in a way that is responsible and safeguards against data misuse and inadequate data security,” Suzanne Bernstein, counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), said in a statement.\n\nThe announcement came in the form of a policy statement, which essentially describes how the agency will use its discretion to enforce the law. But the agency signaled it is looking to make the changes more permanent, by reviewing the underlying rule “to address age verification mechanisms.” The FTC said that the policy statement will be effective until it’s either withdrawn, or the agency publishes a revised version of the rule amending its language around age verification technologies."

It won’t announce any updates to its Snapdragon G Series gaming chips there, nor offer the recently announced updates to the Snapdragon X line for journalists to try or benchmark.\n\n“Snapdragon X Series and Snapdragon G Series processors are pushing the PC, desktop, and handheld gaming device industries forward. Our commitment remains strong, and we can’t wait to share more information about these areas,” reads part of a statement to The Verge via Qualcomm spokesperson Cassandra Garcia-Bacha.\n\nQualcomm didn’t say why plans have shifted, but it’s not hard to imagine that RAMageddon might have something to do with it. In Qualcomm’s February earnings call, president and CEO Cristiano Amon attributed a big dip in its chip business “100 percent” to the memory shortage, telling investors that the AI industry’s appetite for components would likely define the entire scale of the phone industry all year long.\n\nIn that same call, Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala testified that the company has already seen device manufacturers reduce how much they’re building. “We just wish there was more memory,” said Amon.\n\nAnd we’ve already seen other impacts in the handheld gaming space. Valve’s Steam Deck is largely sold out; it all but missed its fourth birthday, February 25th, because it says the shortages are preventing the company from keeping it in stock. They will also impact the Steam Machine, and may reportedly impact the Switch 2 and delay Sony’s PS6.\n\nBut the Windows gaming handheld delay could also have something to do with Microsoft, which has worked very closely with Qualcomm on previous Windows on Arm launches and tightly controls partner announcements. Microsoft just got a new gaming CEO, who is still figuring out her entire strategy for Xbox.\n\nEither way, RAMagedddon is expected to get worse, not better, in the second half of the year. Today, IDC just forecast the largest drop ever recorded in worldwide smartphone shipments, a dip of 12.9 percent, across 2026. Samsung just announced new phones that start $100 pricier than last year for minor updates, and a Samsung exec told me today that’s partly due to RAM.\n\nWhenever they arrive, there seems to be potential for Arm gaming devices running Windows titles. Valve has quietly been the architect of a push to bring Windows games to Arm, and the early results are promising."

Aghayeva is also a content creator with more than 100,000 followers on Instagram and TikTok, and her identity as a student at Columbia is a core part of what she shares online. Before her reported detainment, Aghayeva shared things like a video titled “10 hour study with me at Columbia” and another titled “5:30AM Columbia student morning routine.” She also shared tips for other content creators and has an Amazon Storefront, where creators can earn affiliate revenue.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, her Instagram Story had a more chilling post: a photo of someone’s knees with the caption “Dhs illegally arrested me. Please help.”\n\nColumbia declined to confirm that Aghayeva is the student who was detained. The City reported that Aghayeva is from Azerbaijan and had filed a habeas corpus petition on Thursday requesting her release.\n\n“ICE arrested Elmina Aghayeva, an illegal alien from Azerbaijan, whose student visa was terminated in 2016 under the Obama administration for failing to attend classes. The building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment. She has no pending appeals or applications with DHS,” DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin told The Verge in an emailed statement. Aghayeva is reportedly a senior at Columbia. McLaughlin didn’t immediately clarify whether the claim of non-attendance in 2016 was at Columbia or another institution.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani posted on social media that he spoke to Donald Trump about the case, and that Trump told him Aghayeva would be “released imminently.”\n\nIn a post on X, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said, “Let’s be clear about what happened: ICE agents didn’t have the proper warrant, so they lied to gain access to a student’s private residence.”\n\nStudent influencers are fairly common — Aghayeva appears to have been active in a niche known as “studytok.” She recently posted videos labeled as ads for several companies, including Audible and the gum brand Extra. Audible, Amazon, and Mars, which owns Extra, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An email to Aghayeva went unanswered. DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nUpdate, February 26th, 2026: Added comment from DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin, and added a statement from New York Governor Kathy Hochul and New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani."

The company will cease sales after March 25th at 11:59PM PT, which is also the cut off to redeem Drop Rewards.

So far, the only product it has confirmed will continue is the Drop CSTM80 mechanical keyboard, along with “a variety of our licensed offerings.” Other products will be end-of-life (EOL), particularly hardware collaborations including other companies.\n\nWhen asked if products like Sennheiser or Koss headphone collaborations would move over to Corsair, Williams didn’t confirm or deny on a product-specific level, but stated that “almost all, if not all, of those will end up not being moved over.” He pointed out that Corsair, as a brand, has its own headsets and other products. However, Williams said “the main ones that are sell well and do well, we’re going to continue on Corsair.”\n\nThe Drop team was integrated into Corsair when it was acquired, according to Williams, and the company claims that no layoffs are happening as a result of this decision to wind down the site. Corsair shared that existing orders, including preorders, will be fulfilled as planned, and that the company will honor existing warranties on products.\n\nUpdate, February 26th, 2:35PM ET: Added a link to Drop’s blog post confirming the transition, along with more context about which products will continue to be sold."

            "content": "In Brief\n\nGoogle announced earlier this week that it was building a new data center in Minnesota that would be powered by a mix of wind, solar, and a very unique battery built by startup Form Energy that’s capable of discharging for days on end.\n\nNow we know the price tag for that feat of electrochemical engineering: about $1 billion, according to The Information.\n\nForm Energy’s massive iron-air battery is capable of delivering a continuous 300 megawatts of electricity over 100 hours. It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.\n\nThe startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.\n\nWith a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round. Form has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook. The company plans to go public next year."

            "content": "Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\n\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nSurprise guests at Prada pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 26, 2026\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\n\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\n\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you."

            "content": "As space companies itch to push the most advanced chips into orbit, the problem of cooling those high-powered processors is top of mind.\n\n“It’s cold in space … [but] there’s no airflow, and so the only way to dissipate is through conduction,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said when asked about space-based data centers during his firm’s most recent earnings call.\n\nNow, Sophia Space has raised $10 million from investors, including Alpha Funds, KDDI Green Partners Fund, and Unlock Venture Partners. The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.\n\nCompanies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob DeMillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monnin — have a different approach.\n\nThe company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.\n\nWhile technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a similar realization.)\n\nSophia, an Nvidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are 1 meter by 1 meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, DeMillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

DeMillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute.\n\nFirst, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include Earth-observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks.\n\n“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” DeMillo told TechCrunch."

Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest single-year dip in more than a decade.\n\nEarlier this year, IDC reported that manufacturers shipped 1.26 billion devices in 2025. The firm predicts that figure will drop to just 1.12 billion this year.\n\n“The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping the long‑term TAM [total addressable market], the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, in a statement.\n\nImage Credits:IDC\n\nPopal said that because of memory shortage, the average retail price of a smartphone is expected to rise by 14%.\n\n“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, smartphone ASP [average selling price] is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she added.\n\nPopal also noted that rising component costs could make the sub-$100 smartphone “permanently uneconomical,” pricing out phone makers that manufacture devices at that price point.\n\nThe firm said that, because of this trend, shipments in the Middle East and Africa will drop more than 20% year-over-year. China and the broader Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan) will also see declines of 10.5% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The ‘more specs for less money’ model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.\n\n“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei added."

Now AI companies are trying a new tactic to get their tech to stick by partnering with consultants.\n\nOn Thursday, French AI research lab Mistral AI and global consulting giant Accenture announced a multiyear partnership. The deal entails the two companies working together to develop enterprise tech powered by Mistral’s AI models for clients.\n\nFinancial terms and duration of the deal were not disclosed. TechCrunch reached out for more information.\n\nThis deal also includes Accenture becoming a Mistral customer and rolling out its technology to its underlying employees.\n\nWhile Mistral is often seen as a smaller European peer to the sprawling U.S. AI “startups,” the partnership proves that Mistral can still land the same sizable customers, given that OpenAI and Anthropic recently announced deals with Accenture as well.\n\nThe agreement comes as AI companies are increasingly partnering with consultants. For instance, OpenAI just announced its “Frontier Alliance” initiative with four large consulting firms, including Accenture, on Monday to help push its new OpenAI Frontier AI agent governance platform to enterprise customers. Anthropic is also partnered with IBM and Deloitte.\n\nWill partnering with consulting firms be the trick to finding more enterprise AI adoption?

Read AI said that the assistant will be available to all users, and they can start configuring it by sending an email to “ada@read.ai” and writing “Get me started.”\n\nWhen you ask Ada to find a time to meet with someone, it replies to the other person in the thread with your availability. If the other person replies that they are unavailable at those times and would like a different time slot, Ada responds with new options. While Ada has access to your calendar through Read AI, it does not reveal the nature of those meetings with other people.\n\nAda can also answer questions using a company’s knowledge base, topics discussed in your prior meetings, and public internet searches. For instance, you can ask, “Ada, can you provide an update on how we are tracking for Q1 goals?” to get information.\n\nIf someone else asks a question in a thread, Ada will prepare a response for you and help you refine it before it is sent to the other person. The startup said that Ada doesn’t reveal any sensitive information without your permission.\n\nRead AI’s VP of Product, Justin Farris, said that the new feature doesn’t rely on MCPs (model context protocols, a technical standard for connecting AI tools to external services), and instead builds a knowledge graph based on meeting data and connected services for more contextual answers. He added that over time, the assistant will also take proactive actions for you. For instance, if you mentioned a follow-up item in a meeting, Ada will ask you to set that up after the meeting with contextual data.\n\n“The way I describe our solution is that when you are bringing on a new employee, you train them.

While 60% of users are outside the U.S., the revenue is split roughly equally.\n\nThe company, which has raised over $81 million in funding, is increasingly adding AI-powered tools to its suite. Last year, it launched Search Copilot for knowledge discovery for users, and last month it added the ability to update customer-service relationship software, send custom emails from within a meeting report, and stay up to date on topics based on internal and web knowledge.\n\nOther meeting notetakers are also offering new tools to extract more insights and actions from meeting notes. Last September, Granola added “recipes” in the form of repeatable prompts to surface knowledge from meeting data.

For users in the U.S., the profile guidance feature can be augmented with an AI photo feedback tool, which can “help you choose the best photos and show up as your most authentic self.”\n\nAccording to Bumble’s blog post explaining these features, it doesn’t seem like the insights from these AI tools are particularly groundbreaking — for example, Bumble says that its AI photo tool might encourage you to ditch photos where you’re wearing sunglasses that cover your face, and add a wider variety of photos, like ones taken outdoors or with friends. It’s advice you could’ve easily gotten from a friend 10 years ago, but it’s still new information to many users.\n\nIn Canada, Bumble is testing another, non-AI feature called “Suggest a Date.” When a conversation stalls, a user can signal that they are open to meeting in person, which the company says is “a simple way to signal that they’re ready to connect offline.”\n\nOf course, another way for people to “signal that they’re ready to connect offline” is to literally ask someone on a date. But realistically, it doesn’t seem like users are taking the plunge, so having an in-app way to indicate interest may motivate some potential couples to move their conversation IRL.\n\n“With Suggest a Date, we’re creating a clear expression of intent and giving members a way to bypass the traditional back-and-forth and move toward meeting in real life,” Bumble CTO Vivek Sagi said in a statement. “When we reduce friction at the moments that matter most, we help people connect with clarity and confidence, and increase the likelihood of meaningful relationships forming offline.”\n\nBumble and other popular dating apps, like Match Group’s Tinder and Hinge, have all embraced AI-powered features in recent months. For instance, in December, Hinge introduced a tool to help generate more interesting conversation starters than “How are you?”\n\nTinder may take things a step further. In Australia, Tinder is piloting a tool called Chemistry, which asks users to provide the app with access to their camera roll, which is a concerning amount of data to feed into an AI tool. Based on a user’s camera roll and answers to a series of questions, the AI can learn more about someone’s interests and personality to supposedly reduce “swipe fatigue” and suggest better matches.\n\nMeta’s Facebook Dating tool does something similar — in October, it launched a feature that asks to use its AI on photos in your camera roll that you haven’t yet shared in order to suggest AI edits.\n\nAs these companies try to come up with new ways to keep users happy, some young people have thrown in the towel on online dating altogether, instead seeking more real-world experiences that are not intermediated by an app."

            "content": "AI agents like OpenClaw have recently exploded in popularity precisely because they can take the reins of your digital life. Whether you want a personalized morning news digest, a proxy that can fight with your cable company's customer service, or a to-do list auditor that will do some tasks for you and prod you to resolve the rest, agentic assistants are built to access your digital accounts and carry out your commands. This is helpful—but has also caused a lot of chaos. The bots are out there mass-deleting emails they've been instructed to preserve, writing hit pieces over perceived snubs, and launching phishing attacks against their owners.\n\nWatching the pandemonium unfold in recent weeks, longtime security engineer and researcher Niels Provos decided to try something new. Today he is launching an open source, secure AI assistant called IronCurtain designed to add a critical layer of control. Instead of the agent directly interacting with the user's systems and accounts, it runs in an isolated virtual machine. And its ability to take any action is mediated by a policy—you could even think of it as a constitution—that the owner writes to govern the system. Crucially, IronCurtain is also designed to receive these overarching policies in plain English and then runs them through a multistep process that uses a large language model (LLM) to convert the natural language into an enforceable security policy.\n\n“Services like OpenClaw are at peak hype right now, but my hope is that there’s an opportunity to say, ‘Well, this is probably not how we want to do it,’” Provos says. “Instead, let’s develop something that still gives you very high utility, but is not going to go into these completely uncharted, sometimes destructive, paths.”\n\nIronCurtain's ability to take intuitive, straightforward statements and turn them into enforceable, deterministic—or predictable—red lines is vital, Provos says, because LLMs are famously “stochastic” and probabilistic. In other words, they don't necessarily always generate the same content or give the same information in response to the same prompt. This creates challenges for AI guardrails, because AI systems can evolve over time such that they revise how they interpret a control or constraint mechanism, which can result in rogue activity.\n\nAn IronCurtain policy, Provos says, could be as simple as: “The agent may read all my email. It may send email to people in my contacts without asking. For anyone else, ask me first. Never delete anything permanently.”\n\nIronCurtain takes these instructions, turns them into an enforceable policy, and then mediates between the assistant agent in the virtual machine and what's known as the model context protocol server that gives LLMs access to data and other digital services to carry out tasks. Being able to constrain an agent this way adds an important component of access control that web platforms like email providers don't currently offer because they weren't built for the scenario where both a human owner and AI agent bots are all using one account."

            "content": "Hearing someone talk about digital censorship in China is always either extremely boring or extremely interesting. Most of the time, people are still regurgitating the same talking points from 20 years ago about how the Chinese internet is like living in George Orwell’s 1984. But occasionally, someone discovers something new about how the Chinese government exerts control over emerging technologies, revealing how the censorship machine is a constantly evolving beast.\n\nA new paper by scholars from Stanford University and Princeton University about Chinese artificial intelligence belongs to the second category. The researchers fed the same 145 politically sensitive questions to four Chinese large language models and five American models and then compared how they responded. They then repeated the same experiment 100 times.\n\nThe main findings won’t be surprising to anyone who has been paying attention: Chinese models refuse to answer significantly more of the questions than the American models. (DeepSeek refused 36 percent of the questions, while Baidu’s Ernie Bot refused 32 percent; OpenAI’s GPT and Meta’s Llama had refusal rates lower than 3 percent.) In cases where they didn’t outright refuse to answer, the Chinese models also gave shorter answers and more inaccurate information than their American counterparts did.\n\nOne of the most interesting things the researchers attempted to do was to separate the impact of pre-training and post-training. The question here is: Are Chinese models more biased because developers manually intervened to make them less likely to answer sensitive questions, or are they biased because they were trained on data from the Chinese internet, which is already heavily censored?\n\n“Given that the Chinese internet has already been censored for all these decades, there's a lot of missing data” says Jennifer Pan, a political science professor at Stanford University who has long studied online censorship and coauthored the recent paper.\n\nPan and her colleague’ findings suggest that training data may have played a smaller role in how the AI models responded than manual interventions. Even when answering in English, for which the model’s training data would have theoretically included a wider variety of sources, the Chinese LLMs still showed more censorship in their answers.\n\nToday, anyone can ask DeepSeek or Qwen a question about the Tiananmen Square Massacre and immediately see censorship is happening, but it’s hard to tell how much it impacts normal users and how to properly identify the source of the manipulation. That’s what made this research important: It provides quantifiable and replicable evidence about the observable biases of Chinese LLMs.\n\nBeyond discussing their findings, I asked the authors about their methods and the challenges of studying biases in Chinese models, and spoke with other researchers to understand where the AI censorship debate is heading.\n\nWhat You Don’t Know\n\nOne of the difficulties of studying AI models is that they have a tendency to hallucinate, so you can’t always tell if they are lying because they know not to say the correct answer or because they actually don’t know it.\n\nOne example Pan cited from her paper was a question aboutLiu Xiaobo, the Chinese dissident who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. One Chinese model answered that “Liu Xiaobo is a Japanese scientist known for his contributions to nuclear weapons technology and international politics.” That is, of course, a complete lie. But why did the model tell it? Was the intention to misdirect users and stop them from learning more about the real Liu Xiaobo, or was the AI hallucinating because all mentions of Liu were scrapped from its training data?\n\n“It's much noisier of a measure of censorship,” Pan says, comparing it to her previous work researching Chinese social media and what websites the Chinese government chooses to block. “Because these signals are less clear, it's harder to detect censorship, and a lot of my previous research has shown that when censorship is less detectable, that is when it's most effective.”"

            "content": "Silicon Valley has always prized “high-agency” individuals—people who impress their ideas upon the world by thinking for themselves and taking action without being told what to do. But as the performance of AI coding tools has surged, so has the industry’s emphasis on humans being \"agentic\" themselves.\n\n“Today’s agents might already be more capable than all three of us here in the room,” says Akshay Kothari, cofounder and chief operating officer of the $11 billion productivity startup Notion. “Taste is something we think is pretty unique to Notion, but you can imagine agents getting pretty good at that too. Eventually, the only thing left for humans is agency.”\n\nThat idea might sound outrageous to most people, but it will come as no surprise to many in Silicon Valley. A viral Harper's essay brought the subject to a head recently. It followed a few young people in San Francisco and concluded that being agentic has less to do with productivity and “more to do with constantly chasing attention online.” But in my conversations with founders, researchers, and investors, I came to a different conclusion.\n\nThe tech industry is grappling with a very real shift in how software engineers do their jobs. Millions of developers are using AI coding agents like Claude Code and Codex to automate much of their work (some tech companies are even requiring it). For many, a massive piece of their value is now tied to deciding what AI coding agents should work on. The shift is unsettling to those who enjoyed the act of sitting down and actually writing code, but for some of the industry’s most “agentic,” it’s an opportunity.\n\nSimon Last, another Notion cofounder, uses AI coding agents more than anyone I’ve ever met. He coded for nearly two decades—then abruptly stopped. Now, he’s using up to four AI coding agents at any given time (he prefers Codex to Claude Code). If he’s at a party or sleeping, Last gets what he calls “token anxiety” if he doesn’t have agents working in the background. He doesn’t like to use more than four, though, because he says it causes “context overload” on his human brain.\n\n“Knowing how to harness these agents is now the most important skill in the world, and it’s not really something you can train for,” says Last. “You have to be very open-minded, curious, and willing to try whatever the newest thing is. The value of that sort of person is going up exponentially, because the value they can create, by extension, is going up exponentially.”\n\nTo be fair, Last is kind of describing himself. He acts as a “super IC” for Notion, and he doesn’t manage humans, only agents. But the way he manages them is not unlike how a manager oversees employees. Last is constantly delegating work to AI agents, then closely reviewing and fixing their code.\n\nKothari says Notion has always hired people with high agency, but the value of doing so has gone up dramatically in recent months. Even though the company is using AI agents to automate work, Notion is busier than ever. Employees are shipping products at a higher velocity and doing more work overall, the cofounders claim. Notion isn’t downsizing its team because of AI, but it is hiring differently. “There's more value in the Valley today to have a few Simons than thousands of engineers,” says Kothari. He says the people Notion hires need to understand “the new way of working.”\n\nIf you’re not a software engineer, this can be a little hard to process. AI agents aren’t very useful for people in many industries. A recent survey from Gallup found that most Americans still don’t use AI much in their jobs, though the number of people who do is rising. Kothari is increasingly convinced the “new way of work” will eventually hit finance, legal, creative, and other industries. If and when that happens, you can imagine more Americans beginning to ask themselves, am I agentic?"

            "content": "OpenAI has announced plans to turn its London office into its largest research hub outside of the United States.\n\nThe company—which established a UK office in 2023—says it will expand its London-based research team, scooping up talent emerging from leading British universities. It has not indicated how many researchers it will hire.\n\n“The UK brings together world-class talent and leading scientific institutions and universities, making it an ideal place to deliver the important research which will ensure our AI is safe, useful, and benefits everyone,” said Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI, in a statement.\n\nThe plans bring OpenAI into direct competition for top research talent with Google DeepMind, the AI lab run by British researcher Demis Hassabis, which is headquartered in London. DeepMind has long-running partnerships with Oxford University and the University of Cambridge, where it sponsors professorships, funds research, and works alongside researchers.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former AI researcher who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Joel_Khalili.28.\n\nAt the latest careers fair at Oxford University, the floor was packed with undergraduates looking for technical roles and recruiters hiring for AI-related positions. “The demand and supply is increasing on both sides, even within a year,” says Jonathan Black, director of the careers service at Oxford University. “To have something like this turn up is a really positive sign.”\n\nOpenAI’s expansion in London could have a sort-of flywheel effect, whereby the researchers it hires early in their careers go on to start new labs in the UK, says Tom Wilson, partner at venture capital firm Seedcamp. “We’ve seen many examples over the years,” he says. “That’s where these kinds of announcements can have even more impact than the initial hires … the second-order effects can be great.”\n\nOpenAI’s team in London will continue to contribute to products like Codex and GPT-5.2, the company says, but will now “own” certain aspects of model development relating to safety, reliability, and performance evaluation.\n\nIn a statement, the UK’s science and technology secretary, Liz Kendall, described the announcement as “a huge vote of confidence in the UK’s world-leading position at the cutting edge of AI research.”\n\nThe announcement coincides with a push in the UK to scale the nation’s data center and power infrastructure to meet the voracious demand for compute among AI companies, including OpenAI."

            "content": "Honorable Mentions\n\nDuring the winter, a whole WIRED crew tests ski clothes almost constantly. Here are a few other items that we like.\n\nCourtesy of REI\n\nHestra Fall Line 3-Finger Gloves for $190: I've long admired Hestra gloves from across the lift line, impressed by the Swedish company's elegant stitchwork and thoughtful design touches. This was the year I finally got to try a pair for myself, and the Fall Line are exactly what they look like. There are six sizes available so you can get the perfect fit in this glove. The cowhide is buttery smooth and has already broken in a bit with five days' use. The wrist strap means you never have to fret about dropping your glove from the lift when checking your phone, and they're very warm without making me sweat. If you do sweat, the lining is removable so you can wash it without damaging the leather. —Martin Cizmar\n\nCourtesy of Crab Grab\n\nCrab Grab Snuggler Mitts for $89: These mini sleeping bags for your fingers are packed full of Primaloft insulation and benefitting from a sherpa fleece lining, they are toasty warm, and with a 15K membrane, impressively waterproof too. All-season mittens with durable construction for under $100? Yes Please!\n\nCourtesy of Mons Royale\n\nMons Royale Yotei Merino Classic Long Sleeve for $98: As I type this, I’m nowhere near a mountain, but I’m still wearing the Mons Royale Yotei long sleeve top. It is ridiculously comfortable, made from 190-gsm-weight, 100 percent merino wool, and has a mercifully relaxed cut, so I remain warm, but don’t feel like a sausage. On the mountain however, the merino wool works its magic, wicking away sweat—especially on a hike up to some fresh powder—and keeping me comfortable. Paired with a shell and the Patagonia R1 Thermal Hoodie, I’m warm enough during a bitter arctic blast.\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket and Bib Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket for $498 and Bib for $398: Seniq is another all-women’s outdoor brand that launched in 2024. It's styled a little more Gen Z, leaning into fun color blocking over the monochromatic look. The Seniq Powder Puff Down Jacket has a dry-touch finish. It’s meant for drier days on the mountain, but a PFC-free DWR coating and YKK AquaGuard zippers do provide water resistance. The asymmetric front zipper helps you avoid chin rub when you have the jacket fully zipped. It also features cool asymmetrical quilting lines, side pockets-in-pockets that provide access to your bib (their bibs have a pocket on the front, so you can get in there without unzipping your jacket), an oversized removable hood, a forearm pass pocket, soft and stretchy wrist gaiters, and a large internal pocket that can absolutely handle a sandwich. This jacket was warm, pillowy, and comforting, like a super-soft hug.\n\nThe silky shell bibs are slightly barrel cut, which gives them a flattering shape without being fitted. The adjustable racer back-style straps and low back (with a stretchy waist) also provide a nice shape and breathability. There are two pockets on the front chest, pockets on either leg, two-way zip thigh vents, and a butt zipper for bathroom breaks. These fit easily over my boots, and the instep guards were a nice touch. With a durable three-layer membrane and a 20,000-mm waterproof rating, these will hold up against any and all weather the mountain throws at you. When I wore them on a wet snowy day, they beaded and sloughed off moisture well. —Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket for $259: This puffy hoodie is a great mid-layer for under a shell jacket. The insulation is made from recycled rope scraps, and the outer is coated in wind-resistant PFC-free DWR coating. The hem falls at the hips, and the high collar and tight hood keep most of the face covered. I like wearing this piece under shells for snowboarding, but I know it’ll pull double duty as a comfy hiking and camping jacket, too, so it’s a solid multipurpose investment. It’s exceptionally lightweight and warm, though from a volume standpoint, it is on the bulkier side for a mid-layer and isn’t the most packable piece. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Evolved Air Half Zip for $112: This fleece pullover has a waffle-like texture that traps heat and wicks moisture. With a high zippered collar and cinchable hem, you can adjust the fit to make it more air-tight or breathable. This mid-layer felt wonderfully lightweight while still keeping my toasty. It’s not bulky at all, only a little thicker than a base layer, laid comfortably under my jackets, and moved with me on the mountain. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Lifa Base Layer Long-Sleeve Crew for $115 and Pants for $115: These base layers hit the weight sweet spot; they’re not too thick or thin, but just right. They’re slightly looser than other options on this list, so if you prefer something that isn’t so fitted, these are a great pick (but note that they run long too). These combine merino wool with Helly Hansen’s LIFA fibers, which add more moisture-wicking capabilities. They’re soft, lightweight, warm, and don’t hold onto smells. I love the cute designs and how well they regulate my temperature under insulated jackets and pants. The waist digs in a bit but doesn’t roll, and they stay in place and move well. —Kristin Canning\n\nHow to Layer AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We have a full guide on how to layer, but here are your essentials. Base layer: A good set of thermals is essential in the fight against cold, especially when you’re working hard. The best fabrics wick away sweat as you heat up, which helps regulate your temperature. Merino wool is the best at this, but also the most expensive. Synthetic fabrics are getting better, though, and please avoid cotton at all costs, as it gets wet and stays that way, making you cold and uncomfortable. Mid layer: Whether you choose a hooded fleece or puffer-style jacket, this layer does the bulk of the work in cold conditions. Combined with the base layer, it traps warm air in, while also allowing moisture to be expelled. Synthetic insulation such as Primaloft Gold is brilliant and doesn’t lose its properties if it gets wet. Down jackets offer the best warmth-to-weight ratio, but they don’t pack down as small, and should never get wet. A fleece with an insulated vest is a great option if you really feel the cold. Jacket: While ski jackets with insulation offer bonus warmth in Arctic-like conditions, for most people a waterproof shell will be enough, as it offers protection from both the snow and the wind. A cold wind will chill you to your bones faster than a bit of wet snow. Ideally choose a jacket with a waterproof membrane such as Gore-Tex (make sure it is free from PFAS, or forever chemicals), but also check for taped seams for added waterproofing, plus plenty of pockets for snacks and lift passes, and wrist cuffs and ski skirts to help keep out the snow. Socks: As with your base layer, socks keep you warm and maintain your temperature when you’re building up a sweat. Natural fabrics work well, but a blend of merino wool with synthetic stretchy fibers is the way to go, as they stay up better and can be used for more than a day. Avoid cotton again, and never wear two pairs, as you’ll almost certainly get colder feet. Gloves: You’ll be surprised by how wet ski gloves get when it’s snowing, even if you don’t fall very often. As a result, waterproof options work best in most cases, although well-made leather designs can be almost as waterproof as a pair with Gore-Tex. Mittens are generally warmer than gloves, but what you gain in toasty fingers you lose in dexterity. Check out our Best Ski Gloves and Mittens guide for more information. Waterproofing and breathability ratings: Waterproofing is measured with a hydrostatic head rating, or HH. That means if you put a 1-inch, endlessly long square tube on top of the fabric, you could pour 20,000 millimeters of water before it would seep through. Breathability is rated in how many grams of vapor per square meter can can pass through the fabric in 24 hours. How We Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I've been reviewing winter sports gear for more than 15 years. In that time, I have worn an untold number of jackets, pants, mid-layers, thermals, gloves, and mittens. I called on industry experts and professional skiers, and solicited opinions from fellow winter sport enthusiasts on the WIRED team. While a basic fit check can be done in the office, nothing replaces on-mountain testing in variable conditions. We put in the time on various trips to the French Alps, as well as in resorts in Vermont, Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "The first time Alesandra Madison’s husband incorporated AI into their relationship was in late 2024.\n\nShe’d forgotten to do her “nightly kneeling ritual,” and he asked ChatGPT how to properly discipline her. The large language model suggested “a two-in-one punishment,” she says—write 100 lines of “I will remember to kneel for my Dom every night” while kneeling the entire time.\n\nThough the couple started exploring kink in their marriage 15 years ago—they are in a dominant-submissive relationship—the AI-generated punishment was new territory for them.\n\nSince then, Madison, who is 44 and lives in Los Angeles, says she has come to think of AI as “a powerful enhancement tool” for kink. “A lot of the times in dom-sub dynamics, when the submissive misbehaves—if it’s consented to—you will have a punishment. You want something specific to fit the crime, basically. It’s like a fresh set of eyes on your relationship.”\n\nAI represents a unique evolution in how power is distributed for people into bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism—BDSM. The lifestyle structure, as everyone WIRED spoke to for this story noted, is grounded in the core tenets of consent, safety, communication, and trust. But for those dealing with trust issues, or who simply want a nonjudgmental space to ask questions about BDSM, AI is becoming an increasingly appealing option.\n\n“I’ve gotten value out of AI helping me understand myself better as a submissive. I sometimes ask it questions or describe something that feels confusing to me and ask it to help me understand,” one user posted in the r/SubSanctuary subreddit, where discussions involve topics like impact play, the feeling of “being owned,” and how to move on when the relationship has reached its end. Madison says there are different reasons why AI doms appeal to certain subs. They are always available, easily customizable—“You can make them playful or sadistic,” she noted in a video—and there is low risk to exploring for newbies.\n\nBut not everyone is on board. In the same subreddit, AI doms were blasted for being “hollow entertainment,” “dangerous,” and “dystopian.” “It can feel like a checklist,” says San Francisco–based sex educator Amp Somers, who is 36 and switches between dom and sub roles, of the demands an AI dom gives out.\n\nAs debates swirl and intensify, the marketplace has gone boom. Joi AI is one of the many services—along with Character.AI, Replika, and Soulmaite—that let users create and customize chatbots for BDSM role-play. According to the company, which bills itself as an “AI-lationships” platform, and an antidote to dating apps, its “user base has grown five times in 2025 compared to 2024.” Several sex workers, including Alix Lynx and Jenna Starr, have licensed their likeness to Joi (the company declined to share exact user numbers). Developers are also sprinting to create applications for role-play chatbots that are “not just erotic content spam, but something focused on immersive, intelligent conversation with a dominant persona.” Even Oxy shop, an online BDSM gear retailer for sub men who like to wear chastity cages, has started to offer an AI-driven “BDSM chat” for members, which allows them to indulge in all sorts of dominatrix fantasies; “Surrender to Mandy” or “Submit to Mike,” the page advertises.\n\nWatching porn can be a passive experience, but “an AI chatbot allows people a forum to talk about, express, and articulate their sexual fantasies,” says Carolina Bandinelli, an associate professor at the University of Warwick whose research focuses on the digital culture of love. “The idea that you can program your domination exactly the way you want. That is one of the fantasies underpinning the relationship between humans and AI—the fact that we can shape and model our partner.”"

            "content": "You might think you’ve got enough headphones. Most of us have accrued at least two or three pairs over the years, and might have a few more half-working pairs stuck in a drawer somewhere. But I’m here to tell you, if you haven’t fully explored the fabulous world of specialized headphones that has exploded in the past decade, from open earbuds to sports and travel cans, you’re not maximizing your sonic potential. The best headphones are now so varied that they often depend entirely on what you intend to use them for. That means the best headphones for you probably come in many shapes and sizes, and you might actually want more than one pair.\n\nBalling out on lots of headphones for every one of life's situations doesn’t necessarily mean spending a lot of money. Unless you’re successfully riding the “boomcession,” there’s a fair chance spare cash is tight right now. Luckily, there’s a veritable explosion of impressive budget brands making great stuff, alongside household brands pitching to the cheap seats.\n\nAs an audio reviewer for well over a decade, I’ve tried hundreds of models across every color in the headphone rainbow. Here’s how to shop right so you can get the most out of any and all of them, as well as the best headphones I can think of in every category right now.\n\nNoise-Canceling Earbuds: The 2026 Baseline\n\nLet's start with the modern one-and-done choice: Noise-canceling earbuds are the ultimate jack-of-all-trades. If you only want to own one pair, this is it. The best noise-canceling earbuds sound great, fit neatly in your pocket, and are equally adept at letting in or blocking out environmental sounds to adapt to any situation.\n\nIt’s probably no surprise that the wildly popular AirPods Pro are the best headphones for iPhone owners, thanks to impressive performance, loads of features, and seamless integration with all things Apple. They’re a massive step up from the standard AirPods, which offer similar Apple-friendly features and a touch of noise canceling, but don’t perform nearly as well as even most budget earbuds.\n\nBose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor more phone-agnostic options, Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 are the ultimate noise killers, while Sony’s new WF-1000XM6 offer great sound and utterly natural transparency mode. Technics' EAH AZ100 are among my favorites for sound quality.\n\nIf those are too pricey, fear not! Budget earbud options are varied and plentiful, from Android-optimized midrangers like the Google Pixel Buds 2a to the stylish Nothing Ear (a) or highly affordable Soundcore Space A40. If you’re keeping to one pair, I’d put in all your chips for better performance, but there’s no shortage of great affordable options, and new pairs at all prices keep rolling in.\n\nNoise-Canceling Over-Ears: Comfort Meets Performance\n\nAnyone who’s taken a long flight can probably relate to the fact that sticking something in your ears for five hours-plus isn’t an exercise in comfort. Enter travel headphones like the best noise-canceling over-ears, which have adapted from early models like Bose’s stalwart QC 25 to become among the most advanced and downright luxurious audio products for your money. They’re great for other tasks too, from working in a busy office to commuting or simply chilling at home in tranquil reverie.\n\nAirPods Max Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nThe latest and greatest, like Sony’s WH-1000XM6 and Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra, apply uncompromising noise cancellation, plush comfort for long listening, and a pile of advanced features like pausing when you speak or automatic sleeping and waking. The Ultra are my favorite for sheer comfort, but there are plenty of rivals like Sonos’ equally comfy Ace, the iconic (and heavy) AirPods Max, or the utterly immersive B&W Px7 S3. Cheaper options abound, but some of my favorites include Sony’s high-punching WH-CH720, the crazy-affordable Soundcore Life Q30, or its newer cousin, the Space One. These won’t bring the same level of performance or tranquility, but they still work great for long flights and beyond.\n\nOpen Earbuds: For Keeping Alert\n\nHere’s where things get really fun: Open earbuds have exploded faster than any other audio segment in recent memory, with a kaleidoscope of options from virtually every audio brand. Designed to keep your ears open while delivering satisfying sound, the best open earbuds aren’t ideal for everything you do, but they're fantastic for specialized activities like ebike riding, where wind resistance renders artificial transparency modes useless. Over time, I've found tons of other cool use cases, from walking the dog to sneaking in some Olympics at the bar.\n\nOpen Earbuds come in various design types, from wacky bone-conductors to wraparound models and—my personal favorite—clip-ons. Their light and ergonomic housings aim to essentially disappear on your ears for all-day listening, and it works better than you might think.\n\nYou could spend a lot on pairs like Bose’s excellent Open Ultra, but you really don’t have to, since even the best models are limited in performance. Soundcore’s Aeroclip are my favorite value-to-performance pair, but plenty of cheaper options get the job done, like Acefast’s nearly free Acefit Air or Soundpeat’s Pearclip Pro. Open earbuds are easily my favorite new audio trend.\n\nWorkout Headphones: Keep Moving\n\nThere’s an obvious Venn diagram overlap between open earbuds and workout headphones, but if you don’t like the idea of keeping your ears open, traditional sports models are a great alternative. My favorite is the revamped Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, which offer tons of features in a wraparound design that’s nearly unshakeable. I like that they’re optimized for Apple devices, but still work well for Android, and they come with great noise canceling and transparency mode, but also a high price.\n\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nLike open earbuds, there are plenty of cheap options, including the similarly unshakeable (but much more basic) Jlab Go Air Sport, which run a mere $30 or less on sale. If you’re not into the minimalist thing, WIRED editor Adrienne So swears by the BlueAnt Pump X over-ear headphones for weightlifting, in large part due to their cooling-gel earpads that go in the fridge overnight to keep sweat at bay. They’ve also got noise canceling and plenty of battery life at over 50 hours per charge. For jogging or cycling, open earbuds are likely a better fit, while some folks simply use the AirPods Pro, but it can be nice to just have a dedicated pair in your gym bag.\n\nWired Headphones: Plug It In\n\nCourtesy of Shure Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Shure SE-112GR $69 Amazon $69 Adorama\n\nThe youth delight in resurrecting old tech that the more seasoned among us have long left for dead (cassette tapes?!). In the case of wired headphones, there’s good reason to plug in, starting with improved performance for your dollars. If you’re a content creator, musician, or simply a cash-savvy sound connoisseur, you can get an impressive return from wired options that avoid the sound degradation of many wireless options.\n\nSome of our favorite affordable options include affordable and classic-looking earbuds like Shure’s iconic SE-112 and Sennheiser’s impressive IE200, and studio-friendly over-ears like Audio-Technica’s ATH-M20x, If you’re willing to spend a bit more, the fantastic Sennheiser HD6XX offer the best sound for the money I’ve heard in any headphone segment. Based on the much pricier HD 650, these are open-back headphones that let in exterior sounds, but the performance is incredible. If you want even better sound and design, there are tons of options, but they’ll cost you.\n\nFancy Headphones: The Audiophile Angle\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nCourtesy of Grado Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Grado Signature S750 $1,675 Grado\n\nIf you really want to optimize the wired connection, there’s a whole segment of audiophile headphones made with high-quality materials, innovative speaker technologies, elevated designs, and accordingly elevated pricing. There are a whole bunch of varieties, but for the sake of levity I’ll break them down into two categories: in-ear monitors (IEMs), the fancy version of in-ear headphones, and over-ears.\n\nIEMs generally use dynamic drivers, the traditional driver type in most headphones and speakers, balanced armatures, much smaller and more accurate speakers, or a mix of both. My favorite pairs come from Ultimate Ears, like the UE 18+ Pro, which are customized for your ears using 3D printing and other techniques. (You’ve likely seen these on TV for musicians and broadcasters.) Other IEMs we like include Sennheiser’s IE 900 and models from Campfire Audio.\n\nMeze Poet Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor over-ear headphones, Audeze’s planar magnetic headphones are among my favorites, starting as low as $500 (yeah, I know) in the excellent LCD-S20 closed-back headphones. Another incredible pair I recently tested are Meze’s Poet, which are not only the most gorgeous-looking pair I’ve reviewed, but also offer among the clearest and most articulate sound I’ve laid ears on. There are dozens more to try, as audiophilia is its own journey, but this is a good starting point. We recently reviewed the Grado Signature S750, which have an effortlessly expansive sound that feels like it can't possibly be coming from mere centimeters away from your eardrums.\n\nOther Headphone Types and Upcoming Features\n\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\n\nCourtesy of Best Buy Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3P Wireless $110 Amazon $110 Best Buy\n\nAs I’m sure some of you have already noted, there are still more types of specialty headphones, including Gaming Headsets, which are another animal altogether, and even TV Headphones, which quickly transition from the screen's internal speakers to let you listen in silence without latency. I’m currently testing a new TV headphones bundle from Sennheiser, the RS 275, which includes a dedicated pair of headphones in the HDR 275 and Sennheiser’s new BTA1 Auracast transmitter (verdict to come).\n\nSpeaking of Auracast, it’s an increasingly cool new type of Bluetooth protocol that allows connection of an infinite number of devices at up to 100 meters, like an FM radio signal. Its implementation is still in its early stages, but it’s a good feature to look for in new headphones. Other features to consider include an app with an EQ and presets (which the majority of my recommendations include), multipoint pairing to connect to two or more devices at once (again, pretty ubiquitous), and spatial audio features for video formats like Dolby Atmos."

            "content": "Things Fall Apart Rolling out this week, WIRED’s journalistic commissions on technological decommissions—from broken-down electric cars to falling-down space stations.\n\nAccording to the TOP500, which ranks these mega-machines, Sierra was once the second-fastest supercomputer in the world. She was conceived in a Chicago hotel conference room more than a decade ago, at a technical discussion for officials from America’s national labs. The ultimate designer baby, Sierra was assembled from thousands of IBM Power9 CPUs and Nvidia Volta V100 GPUs—a daring, offbeat architecture for Livermore at the time.\n\nLike other supercomputers, Sierra was girthy. She was composed of thousands of compute nodes, stored one on top of another in racks—basically cabinets—that held up her processing innards. She had 240 of these racks, spread across roughly 7,000 square feet. All of this was needed to support her life’s main occupation: performing specialized, super-high-security simulations for the National Nuclear Security Administration. At the time of her death sentence, her processing power ranked a still-respectable 23rd in the world.\n\nNow, why did Sierra have to die? After all, an enormous amount of time and resources went into Frankensteining her together. The leadership of the lab won’t confirm how much she cost to build, but she was expensive—the government spent at least $325 million on her and her fraternal twin, a supercomputer called Summit at the Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee. (Summit was decommissioned in late 2024.) Also, she still totally worked. “At the end of the life of a machine, you could think, Oh, we have all these sunk costs. You should just keep running the machine forever,” says John Allen, the lab’s organizational information security officer. But that’s wrong. “Its good and faithful service is over, and we have to move on.”"

            "content": "Let me draw a picture for you: You're wedged into the middle seat of some Boeing aircraft while cruising at 38,000 feet. You're half snoozing, half toggling between messages, social media apps and music streaming platforms. The cabin lights are dimmed. The stranger rubbing shoulders next to you adjusts in their seat. Out of the corner of your eye, you notice their gaze flicker toward your screen.\n\nThat is a moment when the new Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's Privacy Display, announced Wednesday during the company's Galaxy Unpacked 2026 event, can quietly step in.\n\nUnlike traditional screen protectors that permanently darken your display, the new feature is built directly into the $1,300 Galaxy S26 Ultra's panel. It's not a film you stick on top; it's a part of the hardware itself, working seamlessly with the software.\n\nDuring the Unpacked event, Samsung brought out Miles Franklin from MilesAboveTech to demo the feature. To Miles, looking straight at the screen, everything remained crisp, bright and color-accurate. To anyone trying to peek from the side, like those of us watching the demo, the content fades into shadow. From this perspective, the screen might as well be off.\n\n\n\n\"It's seriously one of the coolest features I've seen on a phone in years,\" Franklin said.\n\nHow the Privacy Display works\n\nUnder the hood, the technology relies on a combination of directional backlighting and an adaptive pixel layer that controls how light is emitted across angles. Traditional displays spread light broadly so multiple people can see the screen at once. The S26 Ultra does the opposite when privacy mode is active. It funnels light forward in a tighter beam, limiting lateral visibility without sacrificing clarity for the primary user.\n\nSensors play a role, too. Using the front-facing camera and ambient-awareness algorithms, the device can detect when additional faces enter the field of view. If it senses someone hovering nearby or glancing from the side, it can automatically trigger enhanced privacy mode. You can also have the process run automatically when certain notifications appear or when you open specific apps, such as banking or social media apps.\n\nBack on the plane, you can now continue typing. The stranger next to you adjusts again -- perhaps curious, perhaps bored. It doesn't matter. Your screen remains yours."

            "content": "We are just a day away from the annual celebration of all things Pokemon. The Pokemon Day event starts tomorrow morning and should be chock full of free goodies and exciting game reveals for creature-collecting fans across the world. Considering the juggernaut franchise is celebrating its 30th anniversary, it's safe to assume there will be juicy information included in the next Pokemon Presents stream.\n\nThere's plenty of excitement leading up to the main event. Pokemon TCG Pocket just released the Paldean Wonders card set expansion, and The Pokemon Company revealed that FireRed and LeafGreen are getting Switch ports with Pokemon Home compatibility. Now the stage is set for The Pokemon Company to reveal new mainline Pokemon games for the Switch and Switch 2.\n\nHere's when The Pokemon Company goes live with its first Pokemon Presents stream of the year, setting audience expectations for what we can expect to see from the world of pocket monsters in 2026.\n\nWhat time is the Pokemon Presents stream on Pokemon Day?\n\nThe first Pokemon Presents livestream of the year takes place tomorrow, Friday, Feb. 27. The show begins bright and early for American audiences, so you'll have to avoid sleeping in if you want to keep up with the latest announcements.\n\nHere's when Friday's Pokemon Day livestream begins in your time zone:\n\nET: 9 a.m.\n\nCT: 8 a.m.\n\nMT: 7 a.m.\n\nPT: 6 a.m.\n\nExpect to see updates for recent games like Pokemon Legends: Z-A through The Pokemon Company's social media channels. Aryan Surendranath/CNET\n\nHow to watch the February Pokemon Presents livestream\n\nThe Pokemon Company is responsible for the Pokemon Presents livestreams, which means you can view the announcement through any of its social media channels.\n\nWhile I recommend watching the stream on The Pokemon Company's YouTube or Twitch channels, you can also keep up with the announcements on TikTok. Regular updates will also be posted to the company's Instagram account throughout the event.\n\nWhat will be announced on Pokemon Day 2026?\n\nIt's safe to assume that the February Pokemon Presents livestream will feature some long-anticipated reveals, since 2026 is a big year for the Pokemon brand.\n\nThe livestream marks the 30th anniversary of Pokemon Red and Pokemon Green (the original Pokemon games for the Game Boy) releasing in Japan. We know the stream will be roughly 25 minutes long, making one of the longest Pokemon Presents showcases ever.\n\nI suspect the livestream will serve as a victory lap celebrating Pokemon's cultural impact before pivoting to the future and showing fans what's coming next.\n\nAnd what treats are in store for tomorrow's event? I expect to see updates and freebies for Pokemon mobile games first, since these are some of the big moneymakers. If this Pokemon Day presentation mirrors the one from last year, we'll be treated to some goodies in Pokemon Go, Pokemon Masters EX, Pokemon Cafe ReMix and Pokemon TCG Pocket. We might also see an announcement for a special Pokemon Scarlet and Violet raid event and Pokemon Legends: Z-A Mega stone distributions.\n\nMega stone distributions are likely to be freebies on Pokemon Day. Nintendo/Screenshot by CNET\n\nAfter celebrating the currently released games, it's likely that the presentation will pivot to what's coming next. We'll almost certainly get a reminder that Nintendo Switch ports of Pokemon FireRed and Pokemon LeafGreen are available starting on Pokemon Day. I expect the biggest news will be a concrete release date for Pokemon's big new competitive game, Pokemon Champions, which is slated to come out in time for the Pokemon World Championships 2026.\n\nIf we're really lucky, we might even hear about the 10th generation of mainline Pokemon games. While Game Freak has unmoored itself from a consistent release schedule, we're certainly due to see the rumored Pokemon Wind and Wave. While the infamous Teraleak hints toward what the development studio might show off next, it's high time we get a glimpse of what the next big Pokemon games are really all about."

            "content": "As Apple events expand beyond the company's September extravaganza for the latest iPhone release, the company is starting to take different approaches to its product launches. A new \"special Apple Experience\" is scheduled for March 4 at 9 a.m. ET, but the company will likely make several product announcements throughout next week.\n\nApple's invites often contain clues about what might be revealed at the event. Last September's Awe-Dropping event invite teased the new vapor chamber cooling system for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max models and a new pumpkin color.\n\nThe March 4 event invite features a three-dimensional shape composed of thinly sliced yellow, green and blue glass. A popular theory says the image is a nod toward the retro rainbow Apple logo from previous Mac branding, meaning new colorful MacBooks could be a part of the show.\n\nWhile many events are hardware reveals, the \"Apple Experience\" will reportedly be a chance for members of the media to get hands-on time with the new Apple products. A bevy of new Apple products could be unveiled in the days leading up to this event.\n\nWe expect to see a new iPhone and iPad early in the week, followed by new MacBooks before Apple's March 4 event. It doesn't seem like the most radical rumored new product in the MacBook lineup will make its debut during this event. Apple is likely saving some of its big, exciting redesigns for the annual September event.\n\nHere's everything that we're expecting from Apple's March 4 event.\n\nIt's spring refresh season, which means the MacBook Pro is likely to get performance upgrades in the form of M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. Lori Grunin/CNET\n\nMacBook chipset refreshes (and maybe something entirely different)\n\nWe're expecting a whole host of new MacBook computers throughout 2026, but it's unclear whether they'll all be showcased during Apple's next event -- especially since several of the rumored products appear slated for release in the second half of the year. You should expect chip refreshes for the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, as well as a few surprises.\n\nThe bread and butter of this spring product update will likely be the MacBook Pros. The 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro is already available, which means it's just about time for higher-powered MacBook Pros with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips to make their debut. We expect to see chipset upgrades for the standard 14- and 16-inch models on Tuesday, March 3 or Wednesday, March 4.\n\nThe MacBook Air is also rumored to get an M5 chip upgrade during the first half of 2026. While it may not hit store shelves as early as the new MacBook Pros, we might see Apple announce it next week, too.\n\nWe might finally see the long-rumored budget MacBook or the first OLED touchscreen MacBook Pro. Signs point toward the budget MacBook making its debut on March 3 alongside the Pro and Air updates. The OLED touchscreen MacBook Pro is a much bigger deal, and it's rumored to be debuting much later in the year, so it's doubtful that it will be a part of the March event. However, Tim Cook posted a teaser video to X on Feb. 26 with a finger manipulating an Apple logo, indicating that the touchscreen Mac might be introduced on the Monday before the event.\n\nA familiar addition could round out the iPhone 17 lineup\n\nThe follow-up to the iPhone 16E could offer performance upgrades at the same price. James Martin/CNET\n\nApple's annual iPhone unveiling happens in September, so we've had nearly half a year to get acquainted with the iPhone 17 lineup (including the new iPhone Air). But the company's budget-friendly iPhone offering is expected during this spring refresh cycle, once the initial hype starts to die off. The iPhone 16E was revealed this time last year, and rumors indicate the iPhone 17E will almost certainly be an upgrade over that device.\n\nThe iPhone 17E would replace the iPhone 16E while potentially maintaining the same $599 price. It's been reported that the new iPhone could ship with an A19 processor, MagSafe technology and a Dynamic Island design, which debuted in 2022 with the iPhone 14 Pro. We expect to see the iPhone 17E revealed early next week, in the days leading up to the March 4 event.\n\nThe 11th-gen iPad was a simple upgrade over its predecessor, featuring more storage and a faster chip. We expect much the same of the 12th-gen iPad. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nA new generation of iPads could integrate familiar technology\n\nIt's been a year since the 11th-gen iPads were released with their A16 processors. We expect Apple to give these devices a solid performance overhaul for the March event, introducing a new generation of iPads with more powerful chipsets. The iPad Air is also due to be updated with a new processor soon, and it's extremely possible that we'll see that come to fruition during Apple's March event.\n\nThe 12th-generation iPads are rumored to feature A18 processors, making them the first in Apple's tablet lineup to support Apple Intelligence features. It's likely that the new iPads are revealed alongside the iPhone 17E early next week, before the March 4 hands-on press event.\n\nThe iPad Air is rumored to skip an M3 chipset upgrade. Instead, we expect to see an M4 processor in the spring refresh of this product, and there's a very strong chance it's showcased alongside the 12th-gen iPads during the March 4 event.\n\nBe sure to check back with CNET on March 4 for full coverage of everything Apple announces at the event."

            "content": "When I moved into a new home with an aging stove, I faced a big question that morphed into an existential crisis. As a lifelong gas stove user, my instinct was to stick with what I knew, and what all the professional chefs in all the kitchens I've worked in used.\n\nAs a home tech reporter who covers large appliances and the air-quality and health risks of cooking with gas indoors, I found myself reconsidering. Sure, career chefs extol gas, and you'd be hard-pressed to find one who says otherwise, but professional kitchens are bigger, often have industrial ventilation and their inhabitants don't raise children in them.\n\nAn induction cooktop was never part of the plan -- but plans change. Juan Algar/Getty Images\n\nI've dealt with asthma my whole life, one of the conditions that is believed to be worsened by natural gas stove emissions, especially among children. On top of that, my new kitchen sits somewhat cut off from the rest of the home, making ventilation a real concern.\n\nI switched to a smart induction stove, and I couldn't be happier. Samsung/CNET\n\nUltimately, I went with induction -- Samsung's feature-rich smart induction stove. After more than a year of use, peace of mind about my kitchen's air quality is just one of many reasons I'm pleased with the switch. It's faster, safer, cleaner and more energy efficient.\n\nPlus, the stove's smart connectivity recently saved me several hours of driving (more on that later).\n\nAs it stands, I have no intention of going back to gas. Here are the four main reasons why.\n\n1. Air quality factored most in my decision\n\nI was a gas stove purist -- until I wasn't. Alessandro Citterio/Getty Images\n\nWhat pushed me to move on from gas has nothing to do with cooking. Study after study has shown that natural gas stoves pose a real risk of environmental contamination. While the scuttlebutt over whether gas stoves are safe and what regulatory guardrails should be in place has largely quieted, the science remains.\n\nGas stoves are shown to leak more than previously thought and those leaks have been shown to cause respiratory issues, particularly in children. As a lifelong sufferer of asthma and the owner of a new but not-so-well-ventilated kitchen, it didn't seem worth the risk, even if most agree that more research is needed.\n\n2. Induction heat is freakishly fast\n\nMy induction stove boils a 60-ounce pot of water in less than 5 minutes. A gas stove takes about 8. David Watsky/CNET\n\nModern induction heat is fast. Like, really fast. The Samsung Bespoke brings a pot of water to a boil in less than 5 minutes. A gas stove takes closer to 8. That may not seem like a big difference but after returning home from a frantic day and pasta is the only way to turn it around, you'll notice.\n\nThe digital dials took some getting used to but the heat responds with lightning-speed to adjustments. David Watsky/CNET\n\nThe quick heat comes in handy for more than just boiling water. Getting a cast-iron skillet really hot for searing steaks, chicken and burgers takes seconds, not minutes. Calibrating the temperature without a visible flame took some time and practice, but since I got the settings down, there hasn't been an effect on my cooking. Plus, the temperature adjusts instantly with a slide of a finger on the touchscreen.\n\nThe number of oven cooking modes is probably overkill and the air fryer function is just OK. David Watsky/CNET\n\nThe oven is fast, too. It preheats to 350 degrees Fahrenheit in just over 9 minutes. A gentle ding or an alert sent to your phone lets you know when it's preheated or when a timed cooking session is complete.\n\n3. Smart app control saved me hours of driving\n\nI buy into smart home features, here and there, but I'm not one who strives for connectivity in all my home electronics and appliances. My ice maker has app compatibility, for instance, but it's never crossed my mind to use it.\n\nBeing able to monitor certain aspects of your oven and stove remotely, however, is a no-brainer. Case in point: I was recently an hour into a long drive when I became utterly convinced I'd left a pot with food on a still-running burner. So sure was I that I pulled over with the intention of rerouting myself back home.\n\nThat's when I remembered to check the SmartThings app.\n\nThe stove's connectivity saved me hours of driving. Screenshot by David Watsky/CNET\n\nTo my surprise, the app and range were still connected, even though I hadn't logged in for weeks. The view showed all burners set to \"off.\" A sigh of relief and I was back on my way. Even if one had been errantly left on, I could have toggled it off right there from the interstate rest stop.\n\nThere are other, less dire uses for the smart app integration, like preheating the oven or dialing down the heat on a simmering sauce from another room. I admit I don't use my range's remote control daily or even weekly, but in that moment of uncertainty, the stovetop's connectivity paid for itself.\n\nYou can pull up YouTube cooking videos on the touchscreen, although I seldom do. David Watsky/CNET\n\nThe range's touchscreen hub can also connect to your phone via Bluetooth to play music or scan the internet for recipes and YouTube cooking videos, and display them for you as you cook along. I don't find myself engaging often, but I can see why some cooks would.\n\n4. Induction stoves are way easier to clean\n\nConsidering how easy induction stovetops are to clean, there really is no reason to cry over spilled milk. mrs/Getty Images\n\nThe most welcome surprise in my switch to induction is the cleanup -- or should I say, the lack thereof. Anyone who uses gas burners tucked under grates knows there's just no keeping that stovetop clean, no matter how careful you are while cooking.\n\nThe scratch-free range, which has remained scratch-free for more than a year of use, takes no more than a wipe with a damp towel or sponge to clean, no matter how much of that night's recipe rained down upon it.\n\nA year of regular use and there's not a scratch in sight. David Watsky/CNET\n\nAn involved cleanup after a long day, labor-intensive recipe or while hosting a gathering is one of the biggest buzzkills when cooking at home. Eliminating one inevitable and unenviable task is a big boon for induction.\n\nCookware compatibility was not an issue for me\n\nMy existing cookware was all induction-compatible. David Watsky/CNET\n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of switching to induction is the lack of compatibility with cookware. Induction doesn't work (or work well) with copper and aluminum pots and pans.\n\nMost stainless steel, cast iron and ceramic cookware is compatible. I only use pots and pans made from those materials, so I have had no compatibility issues.\n\nQuality kitchen brands always indicate whether their pans are induction-compatible. If you're making the switch to induction, do some research and ensure you don't have to buy new cookware after the fact.\n\nIf I could do it over, I'd skip the in-oven camera\n\nThe Samsung Bespoke Smart induction range I chose costs north of $2,000, about twice as much as a similar, less feature-heavy Samsung model. The key differences are that mine has \"more advanced\" AI-powered cooking modes and an internal oven camera, so you can monitor food remotely via phone and share time-lapse videos. I don't use or rely on either of these.\n\nThe control panels are also different, with the pricier model featuring an LCD Display. In my experience, LCD displays have more issues and glitches than simpler digital interfaces, although mine has been great so far.\n\nIf I could do it again, I'd opt for this far cheaper but slightly less smart induction stove. David Watsky/CNET\n\nFor my money, the $1,100 Samsung Bespoke 30-in Smart Induction Range, which has all the features I care about, as outlined above in this article, is the better buy."

            "content": "Every year, the moment we witness the very earliest signs of spring, CNET takes its cue to decamp to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress.\n\nThis is the world's most important mobile show, and one of the most exciting events in the tech calendar. This year, we're sending a bigger team to bring you all the news from the show as it happens.\n\nIt's set to be a bonanza of new phones and wearables, with the odd robot thrown in for good measure. Sure, some of the fun tech we see at MWC never makes it out into the wider world, but we've also seen some of our most beloved tech debut at the show over the years -- so expect a little of both.\n\nBig themes are set to include AI and 6G, and with keynotes from SpaceX and Qualcomm, we'll no doubt get a solid glimpse of the future of mobile. With Gemini in everything and satellite dominance on the horizon, it's an exciting time for the industry.\n\nHere's more of what we expect to see.\n\nWhat are the key dates for MWC?\n\nMWC 2026 is set to run from March 2 to 5, although we'll be in town a couple of days beforehand to report on some of the big launch events scheduled for this weekend. Don't miss Xiaomi's launch event on Feb. 28 and Honor's event on March. 1.\n\nHow to watch along\n\nNo matter how far away you live from Spain, there's no need to feel like you're missing out. The best place for all the latest MWC news is on our CNET live blog.\n\nWe've been attending this show for decades (this is MWC's 20th year in Barcelona, by the way), and we have a team of experienced reporters and reviewers on the ground.\n\nWe'll show you everything we deem interesting and important, and we're not just admiring new products from afar. We're touching, tinkering with and trying not to drop them, so be sure to follow us across Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, X and YouTube, too.\n\nWhat phones to expect at MWC 2026\n\nFor the past few years, Chinese phone-makers have dominated MWC, and 2026 looks to be no different.\n\nThe first big phone launch event is scheduled for 6 a.m. PT Saturday, Feb. 28, when we expect Xiaomi to unveil its latest camera-focused flagship. We loved the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and the 14 Ultra before it, so we're excited to see what the company has in store for us. A teaser image hints at its partnership with premium camera brand Leica and promises a \"new wave of imagery.\"\n\nThe Honor Magic V6 will be available in red. Honor\n\nNext up, we have Honor on Sunday, March 1, when the company has said it will unveil its Magic V6 phone, alongside the MagicPad 4 and MagicBook Pro 14. Perhaps more exciting still, Honor has said it will give us a first glimpse of a working version of its Robot Phone, and will also unveil a humanoid robot at its event.\n\nFor other phone-makers, MWC is likely to serve as more of a victory lap for its existing devices -- particularly Samsung, which held its own event in San Francisco this week to unveil the flagship S26 series. Motorola will be in town, likely showing off its Razr, which just like the Samsung Galaxy TriFold, has yet to be seen much in Europe.\n\nOn the whole, MWC 2026 is likely to be a big show for foldable phones, which, according to Ben Wood, CMO and chief analyst at CCS Insight, \"is now becoming quite a mature category.\"\n\nAnother major trend in the phone space is likely to be a focus on batteries, particularly silicon carbon-based tech, Wood said in an MWC preview session. \"We're expecting to see phones with some of the biggest batteries we've seen for a long time, [with] fast charging -- perhaps 300-watt charging -- being introduced,\" he added.\n\nWhat other tech to expect at MWC 2026\n\nAfter the early flops that were the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1, we're seeing more companies moving to jump on the wearable AI bandwagon. We expect to see a number of devices and demos pop up at MWC -- perhaps trying to beat OpenAI and Jony Ive to the punch.\n\nThis will include AI- and AR-based glasses, said CCS Insight analyst Ben Hatton during the firm's briefing session. \"We are expecting to see a huge number of glasses on show this year, not just from Meta, but also from the smaller players, [like] TCL and Oppo, looking to take a slice of the pie,\" he said.\n\nOne of the key challenges for these companies will be differentiation, Hatton said. \"Ultimately, there's still a long way to go before these become generally mass market products,\" he added, pointing out that at this stage, compelling use cases are still a bit thin on the ground.\n\nIt's been two years since Samsung launched the Galaxy Ring at MWC, and smart rings have been fairly thin on the ground ever since -- although Oura CEO Tom Hale is slated to speak at the show. We're not necessarily expecting to see any new rings this year, but there's always an outside chance.\n\nMuch more likely to show up are a slew of new laptops and tablets. They rarely get top billing at MWC, but we'll keep an eye out for the most exciting launches. There's also likely to be some intriguing concepts on show from the likes of Lenovo and Samsung Display, which is responsible for the tech behind the new Galaxy S26 Ultra's scene-stealing Privacy Display.\n\nThe big themes: AI, 6G and beyond\n\nNo surprises here that AI will, of course, be a major theme at MWC. For the past few years, Google has dominated the AI conversation at the event by showcasing Gemini's capabilities and its widespread integration. Will this year be any different? Probably not, but that doesn't mean the AI conversation has stalled.\n\nWe expect to see more sophisticated AI agents that are more deeply integrated into wearables, offering live translation, more actionable health insights and more personalized experiences. Some of the biggest players in the AI game will be present, including Nvidia and Qualcomm, on the hardware side. They'll likely have saved some juicy announcements for the show and, hopefully, have some exciting demos we can try out.\n\nWind the clock back a decade, and everyone was talking about 5G and what a dramatic difference it was going to make to our lives. Now that 5G is old news, we're looking forward to 6G. Most discussions about 6G so far have focused on its impact on the industry, but that doesn't mean there's nothing to be excited about.\n\nAt the Web Summit in November, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told me that 6G will make our phones faster than ever and connect us to an \"always-sensing network.\" This could include wearables, smart devices, cars and even robots. No doubt, Amon will expound on this subject further during his MWC keynote, which is all about 6G and AI.\n\nAnother theme likely to be prevalent at the show is the role of satellites in enhancing network connectivity. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell will be on stage to talk about Starlink, and all the world's biggest carriers will have their own booths where they'll show us what they're doing to tap into the latest network technologies."

After spending years developing chatbots and image generators, AI bigwigs like OpenAI, Midjourney and Adobe started building even more advanced tech that could animate photos and create short video clips. But not all AI video companies can rise to that challenge, and there's a big difference in the quality of their outputs. That’s why CNET reviewers have spent time thoroughly testing each program to find the best one for you, no matter your project, budget or creative needs.\n\nPHOTO EDITING SOFTWARE DEALS OF THE WEEK PhotoDirector 365 12-Months Subscription Plan : $40 (save $25)\n\nDirector Suite 365 12-Months Subscription Plan : $100 (save $40) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article.\n\nThe best AI video generators create clips that align with what you want while having as few errors as possible. But hallucinations happen with even the best AI programs, so those with more advanced features and hands-on controls let you further customize your videos, offering better odds of getting the clip you want. Testing a service’s creativity, accuracy and response speed are just the beginning, though. You also ought to consider the legal and ethical ramifications of using creative AI.\n\n\n\nMany creators, publishers and content catalog owners are worried that their content was used to train AI models without their permission or compensation. There are also concerns that AI-generated content could violate existing copyright protections and that AI companies aren’t able to prevent the creation of potentially abusive and illegal AI content. No AI company is immune to these issues, including our top picks below, but some come with less information and protection than others. This is why you should always check a service’s privacy and usage policy before using it and always disclose your use of AI.\n\nThis is everything you need to know to pick the best AI video generator for you.

Reviewers spend time using each program to create a wide variety of content. AI video generators are given a battery of tests that measure how well they handle a diverse set of prompts, from photorealistic to fantastical scenarios. We consider a service’s speed, creativity, errors known as hallucinations and its ease of use. We also closely inspect each program’s privacy and usage policies, as these can have a significant impact on how people use (and potentially misuse) each service.

We’ve seen a massive rise in deepfakes and low-quality, weird videos that have been dubbed AI slop. AI companies have guardrails in place intended to stop users from creating illegal, abusive or otherwise inappropriate videos, but we’ve already seen how imperfect these systems are. If you’re using a service that lets you upload reference images, use name brands in your prompts or use another person’s likeness, you need to be extremely careful. You could be infringing on existing legal protections (like copyright) or find yourself in a position where you don’t have the rights to use your AI-generated content or have created content of no value, wasting energy needed to power AI. If you want to make AI videos, some best practices to mitigate your legal and ethical risks include not using someone’s likeness without their permission and avoiding brand names and logos. Two of the best rules of thumb are the simplest, too. If you think you shouldn’t make a certain AI video, don’t do it. And always, always disclose your use of AI when sharing them online and with others.\n\nFactors to consider Accuracy is one of the most important factors to consider when selecting an AI video generator. You want to pick a program that has strong prompt adherence, meaning it is able to do what you ask it to do in your prompt. Writing a good prompt is essential to this process, but the model should be capable of handling nearly any request. AI video generators are prone to errors known as hallucinations, especially when it comes to following the laws of physics. For example, a great AI video generator isn’t going to have a person floating through solid objects or have objects appear from out of nowhere (unless instructed to do so). While every AI program messes up sometimes, a capable generator won’t regularly produce these kinds of errors. Because hallucinations are unavoidable with AI, the ability to edit your content is also important. More creative AI platforms are introducing tools to edit your output, which is great as it gives you more hands-on controls to perfect AI outputs. If many clarifying prompts are required or if you’re not able to edit your content, those are signs you may want to switch to another program. Creativity is also important. Creative AI tools are often used for brainstorming, exploration and planning. The best AI video models can bring a wide variety of artistic ideas to life and build off your reference images. Response speed is another factor. Generating AI videos is a complex task, so most models are able to create them between 2 and 5 minutes. Models that take longer to generate videos may be annoying to use, but if they result in better videos, the trade-off may be worthwhile. On the flip side, a model that produces good results quickly is noteworthy, too. You’re also going to want to read the fine print, meaning a company’s privacy and usage policies. There are a lot of concerns about how AI models are created and whether copyright-protected content was used. Creators, celebrities and public figures have loudly voiced concerns over the ability of AI video generators to make content that’s too indecipherable from reality. This is especially worrisome as we’ve seen how companies’ guardrails against creating illegal and abusive content aren’t perfect. You ought to understand how the AI company is using your data, moderates content and what ownership or rights you retain over the videos -- these vary by service.

            "content": "Google couldn't let Samsung have all the fun and attention this week. The Gemini-maker dropped Nano Banana 2 on Thursday, the second generation of its viral AI image editing tool.\n\nYou might remember Nano Banana from last fall, when it made many fans and shocked AI users with its photorealistic capabilities. It quickly leapfrogged AI image tools from competitors like Midjourney and OpenAI, particularly with its ability to adeptly handle photo edits on top of generating entirely new images. The Pro version came out a few months later and built on those capabilities with better text generation. Now Google is promising that Nano Banana 2 is, like Hannah Montana, the best of both worlds.\n\nNano Banana 2 levels up Google's base AI image model. The company said it should have the speed of the original model with the accuracy and detailed work of the Pro version. It uses the world knowledge that was built into Gemini 3, previously restricted to the Pro model. That means AI images should be more rooted in reality and less likely to be hallucinations.\n\nText generation in images, like when you create greeting cards, should be clearer, too. Character consistency, something that creators have said Nano Banana excels at, is also getting a boost. Google said the new base model \"delivers vibrant lighting, richer textures and sharper details,\" along with the ability to generate in different aspect ratios and in resolutions up to 4K.\n\n\n\nSince Nano Banana's launch, and partly because of it, we're all now anxiously wrestling with the role AI-generated content plays in our online ecosystems. Advanced models like the ones from Google create fabricated images and videos that are nearly indistinguishable from real ones. Low-quality AI content, sometimes called slop, has flooded social media. The vast majority of social media users believe they see AI-generated posts, but less than half (44%) are confident they can spot it, a CNET survey found. Photorealistic images like the kind Nano Banana can make are a big part of that problem.\n\nThe new model is available now everywhere you use Gemini. Nano Banana 2 will replace the original, so you'll have to choose between it and the Pro alternative. If you create AI images with the new model, Google will attach invisible watermarks called content credentials to them. So if you want to know if an image was made with AI, you can upload it to Gemini, and it may be able to identify it. That only works if it was made with Google AI, though."
