Onana is spending the 2025/26 season on loan with Trabzonspor, with Senne Lammens impressing as United's new No.1 goalkeeper.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLammens arrived in a £18million move from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day in September and United then decided to send Onana on loan to Turkey. Trabzonspor do not have the option to sign the Cameroon international permanently, meaning Onana will return to his parent club this summer, where he has played 72 times.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe has made 20 appearances for the Turkish side, yet his performances may well be of little interest to United given Lammens' form. The Belgian has been an assured presence in between the posts, starting 21 consecutive games under Amorim, Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLammens has kept five clean sheets for United so far and is part of an improving defence under Carrick. Altay Bayindir is the number two goalkeeper behind Lammens currently, with veteran Tom Heaton also part of the goalkeeping group.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!

His friend, former Cameroon and Chelsea star Geremi, says Onana still harbours hope of turning things around at United.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Listen, I know Andre very well and during his time at United there were a lot of things that were not right,\" he told Telecom Asia. “It wasn’t just him. And believe me, with the arrival of Michael Carrick, things are looking good for everyone, including him.\n\n“He is clearly talented and his gifts are rare. The next thing is for him to go back there and fight for his spot. Andre has always excelled when faced with a challenge. He thrives when he’s given a fair chance to prove himself.”\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

The club's hierarchy are looking for a long-term successor to Amorim, with Carrick among the options being considered.\n\nIf Carrick does get the role permanently, then Onana's hopes could be dashed, with the interim boss delighted by Lammens' form. \"For me, as a goalkeeper, to be reliable, to be trustworthy. Instead of creating the chaos, you want them to take the chaos away and calm things down I think Senne is that,\" he said after his man of the match performance in the 1-0 win over Everton.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“He’s quite quiet at times and unassuming, but he’s got a real steel in this. To step in, it’s a big, big role for some. And others are talking there about coping and just being comfortable in the environment. Sometimes it takes time, sometimes not. But how he’s gone about it at the moment is that calmness, that composure. I think it does help those in front of him an awful lot.”\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nJoin our new MAN UTD WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Manchester United content from Mirror Football.

The 20-year-old has returned to training for the first time since sustaining a serious hamstring injury back in September.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe striker, whose father is former Premier League midfielder Neil Danns, has been out of the public eye since that setback. Yet it's taken virtually no time for the Reds prospect to begin showcasing his quality again among his academy colleagues.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSupporters were largely united in their response after catching their first glimpse of the forward in nearly six months. Danns has netted 29 times in 48 appearances across Liverpool's under-18s and under-21s, with fans eager to see him replicate that output at senior level.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAt the bare minimum, he certainly possesses the physical attributes to compete alongside the first-team squad.

He was already standing at roughly six feet tall when he picked up his injury, though at just 20, it's entirely feasible he hasn't yet reached his full height.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nArne Slot confirms Liverpool's worst fears with concerning injury update on star READ MORE :\n\nOthers couldn't hide their excitement, with one supporter hailing Danns as \"the next starboy.\" Not every response was quite so measured, mind you, as another fan simply declared: \"DANNS IS SOOOOO BACK.\"\n\nOne supporter even raised the question of whether the emerging talent was ready to be thrown straight into first-team contention. More level-headed fans were quick to intervene, however, reminding that rushing him back too soon would only risk stunting his long-term development again.\n\nView 2 Images Danns has scored three times in 10 senior appearances for Liverpool (Image: Ed Sykes/Sportsphoto/Allstar Via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nExpectations are sky-high for what lies ahead for Danns. Physically, he certainly appears to tick the boxes required to thrive at the very highest level.\n\nFurthermore, he's already netted three goals (all in the FA Cup) across 10 senior appearances for the club he's supported since childhood. He spent a portion of last season on loan at Sunderland but failed to make a single appearance for the Black Cats because of a back injury.\n\nHe certainly has his work cut out given the formidable options currently available to Arne Slot. Alexander Isak has been ruled out for several months with a broken leg, but the Premier League's record signing and Hugo Ekitike represent a formidable partnership to dislodge once back to full strength.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFor the time being, though, Danns' sole priority should be focused entirely on regaining his own fitness. And it's evident a considerable portion of the club's supporters are firmly behind him in that pursuit.\n\nJoin our LFC WhatsApp community and get all the latest LFC news, views, transfer gossip and more, as it happens We also treat our community members to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

Chief executive Richard Masters has announced on Thursday that Premier League +, a direct-to-consumer platform, will be launched next season to show all 380 games.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite the Premier League's insistence otherwise, industry experts believe it could be the first step on the road to the blackout being lifted. Minal Modha from Ampere Analysis says that, while the Premier League don’t want to upset Sky Sports and TNT Sports, who are paying them £6.7bn over the current broadcast deal, they are keen to test the market.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“There’s still a handful of games in the blackout, so maybe they will become the first step towards a direct-to-consumer platform because it’s not damaging to any of the packages that they’re already in the market selling,” Modha told Mirror Football.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“That way they’re not competing with TNT or Sky for scheduling slots, because they don’t want that either. Those 3pm slots feel like they could be a happy medium to test the waters in the UK.”\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\nMan City could hand Pep Guardiola a new job once his exit is confirmed READ MORE :\n\nSky Sports has the rights to 215 games currently, with TNT showing a further 52, and their money is still vital to the Premier League. Mirror Football understands that, for now, neither broadcaster feels threatened by the Premier League’s move, which has been in the works for some time.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“If they’re going to do it in the UK, those 3pm games are the best way without upsetting broadcasters,” Modha added.\n\n“Unless what they do is take one of the broadcast packages away, but then you’re taking away potentially guaranteed broadcast revenue. My gut says they will spend the next three years rolling out direct-to-consumer in other markets, testing it out, before making a call on the UK.”\n\nDespite the last Premier League broadcast deal being hailed as a record, it was actually a backwards step, with the rights worth £1.675bn a year, less than the £1.713bn a year over the 2016-2019 seasons. The fragmentation and stagnation of the sports rights market in Europe is a problem for the Premier League, as is the piracy that comes with the 3pm kick-offs.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\nView 3 Images The Premier League is launching its own streaming service (Image: Mark Leech/Offside via Getty Images)\n\nModha says the league wants to future-proof its business without jeopardizing their broadcast partners. She draws a comparison with F1, which launched F1 TV Pro, its own direct-to-consumer platform, but has used it mainly as negotiation tactic with broadcasters while not stepping on the toes of Sky Sports.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat is partly because the costs associated with going to a full streaming services, instead of using broadcasters, would be too high. Ampere Analysis have estimated that Premier League + would need to cost between £45 and £56 per month in order to come close to matching what the league already makes from TNT and Sky.\n\nIt therefore makes commercial sense for the Premier League to lift the 3pm blackout, in place to protect attendances, and open up more content to viewers. That move would come after the conclusion of the current rights cycle in 2029, but wouldn’t be without risk.\n\nThe Premier League would have to appease the Football League, who are in favour of the 3pm blackout on Saturdays in order to encourage fans to attend matches. They would also have to convince fans to fork out for yet another subscription.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images The Premier League doesn't want to upset Sky Sports (Image: PA)\n\n“We’re living in a time when purses are already squeezed, people are struggling with rising fuel and food prices already,” Modha noted. “Normally entertainment is well shielded from that, but sport can sometimes be more vulnerable because it becomes harder to justify so many services.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Football Supporters Association said: \"The English pyramid is the envy of the world with attendances all the way down to non-league dwarfing those of elite level games in many other countries.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“That must be protected. We're all responsible - leagues, clubs, fans - for maintaining that environment in which the game can survive and thrive. Any changes to the 3pm blackout must include all stakeholders, they cannot be based on one league, and its broadcasting wants, alone.\"\n\nNevertheless, it could go down well, with polling by YouGov in November revealing that 57 per cent of fans oppose the blackout, although that percentage dips to 47 per cent among match-going supporters.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The Hoops crashed out of the Europa League against Stuttgart on Thursday night, with a respectable 1-0 victory in Germany not enough to overturn their hefty 4-1 first-leg deficit.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCeltic now face two Old Firm clashes against Rangers at Ibrox in the space of a week, between a trip to Aberdeen. The club will be aware that anything short of two wins over their fierce rivals will lead to increased fan scrutiny over why more was not spent on strengthening the squad this season.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking on Premier Sports in Ireland during coverage of the Stuttgart clash, Lennon appeared to align himself with disgruntled supporters, pointing to Brendan Rodgers ' departure as evidence of an issue within the club. However, the 54-year-old stopped short of calling for a Bodo/Glimt-style fairytale, insisting fans should not expect Celtic to consistently perform well in European competition.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Something was not right in the summer in terms of the recruitment. I don't know what it was,\" Lennon said. \"There were some grievances with Brendan, who was definitely disconnected and you could see the reasons why at the end. There's no director of football at the minute, that needs to be addressed.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\n\"Overall, the recruitment has been disappointing. You're not going to get it right every year, but I do add value to some of the fans' questions as to why they didn't spend more money or bring more quality in.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNottingham Forest Europa League match stopped after one minute as player confronts crowd READ MORE :\n\nChampions League paths to final become clearer after draw as Arsenal and Liverpool learn routes READ MORE :\n\n\"Certainly with Carter-Vickers being out, he's been a big loss. They knew he was out long-term but didn't bring a mature centre-half in to complement Scales. They might have tried to do that, January is always a tough window.\n\n\"There are valid questions to be asked of the board. But over the piece, over the past 15 years, the board's record has been impeccable.\"\n\nHowever, Lennon disagrees that splashing the cash on new signings could transform Celtic into European giant-slayers in the mould of Norwegian outfit Bodo, who have defeated Manchester City, Atletico Madrid and Inter Milan to reach the last 16 in the Champions League.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Celtic were on that run last year,\" Lennon continued. \"So you're not going to get it every year.\n\nView 2 Images Lennon has had two spells as Celtic manager (Image: Ian MacNicol, Getty Images)\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Bodo/Glimt is maybe an exception to the rule this year. They have their own way of doing things. The salary cap, you can't do that at Celtic. They've just got Norwegian and Danish players. (If Celtic wanted to do that), they'd just have to reset and just sign Scottish and Irish players.\n\n\"And then they'd have to have a four or five year plan. Are the fans going to be willing to sacrifice domestic dominance to build a team for Europe in four or five years time?\n\n\"That's the question. These questions were asked about Midtjylland as well. Everyone's going on about the structure of Celtic... since 2000, they've had three last 16s and a Europa League Final. When we got to the last 16 in 2012, the following summer we sold Wanyama, Hooper and Kelvin Wilson. Because it's not sustainable.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"The other thing is, clubs who are successful get assets stripped. For Bodo/Glimt, can they keep Knutsen? Will there be clubs coming in for their players? And can they then replace that? That's what Celtic try and have to do year in year out.\"\n\nHowever, when asked why Celtic aren't investing more money on new players, Lennon admitted: \"I don't know the answer to that, to be honest with you.\n\n\"It's difficult to attract £10m, £12m, £15m players to Scotland unless you're guaranteed Champions League. That's in my own experience. If they'd have qualified against Kairat, I imagine they'd have spent a sizeable amount of money on the squad.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The 'Process' is over, and the mandate is now binary: deliver a major trophy or be tarred as an Arsenal failure.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAs harsh as that might sound for someone who hauled the Gunners out of the post-Wenger wilderness and into title contention for the first time in nearly two decades, there's no getting away from it: winning the Premier League or the Champions League is no longer an aspiration. It's the bare minimum expectation.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFor Arsenal, the Champions League draw was, quite frankly, kinder than the smile on N'Golo Kante's face. A round of 16 encounter with Bayer Leverkusen leads into a quarter-final against either Bodo/Glimt or Sporting CP - a sequence that feels more like a pre-season tour than a European knockout gauntlet.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn the last four, their biggest threat is an inconsistent, cash-strapped Barcelona side, with the very real possibility of facing Premier League stragglers Tottenham or Newcastle instead. Meanwhile, the real monsters - Real Madrid, Manchester City, Liverpool, PSG and Bayern Munich - are all safely cordoned off on the opposite side of the bracket.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\nPremier League clubs' Champions League hopes ranked after nightmare draws READ MORE :\n\nChampions League paths to final become clearer after draw as Arsenal and Liverpool learn routes READ MORE :\n\nThis is, without a doubt, Arsenal's greatest-ever chance to claim the trophy that has eluded them forever - the absence of which has long made them the punchline of domestic rivals. For Arteta, the maths is simple: a draw this favourable doesn't just invite success, it demands it.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd therein lies the problem. While Gunners fans couldn't have wished for a kinder path to the final in Budapest on May 30, the draw has effectively stripped Arteta of his greatest safety net: the underdog narrative.\n\nHe is now forced to split focus and resources between two competitions he is categorically expected to win. Failure in either would no longer be a valiant effort; it would be a giant blot on his record, another blown chance, another 'bottle job.'\n\nAs strange as it sounds, the Spaniard might have preferred being tossed into the bracket of death. A quarter-final exit to Real Madrid or Man City would sting, but it would be explainable, excusable. Particularly with the club so desperate to break a 22-year Premier League title drought, a loss to a titan offers a convenient 'out.'\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images The Champions League draw for the 2025/26 knockout rounds (Image: Kristian Skeie - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)\n\nWithout it, Arteta is facing the ultimate Catch-22. He is compelled to chase both trophies with equal fervour, but that very ambition could be his undoing.\n\nOn one hand, he stands on the precipice of the greatest season in Arsenal's history - a potential Double that would eclipse even the Invincibles. On the other hand, he is a slip or two away from a collapse that would turn Arsenal's brightest campaign in decades into a hollow, haunting disappointment, cementing a legacy defined not by how far he climbed, but by the ceiling he couldn't break.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSlips-ups, after all, have been plaguing Arsenal recently. Having won just three of their last eight Premier League games, the north London club have seen a commanding seven-point New Year's Day lead whittled down to a precarious gap. If City win their game-in-hand, their cushion vanishes entirely.\n\nIn any other year, Arteta would narrow his focus to steadying Arsenal's wobbling domestic form. But prioritising the league over Europe is no longer a luxury he can afford.\n\nView 3 Images Mikel Arteta will now be under pressure to win both the Premier League and the Champions League (Image: Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTo win one while letting the other slip would be a tragedy of missed opportunity. It would leave a campaign of historic magnitude - potentially the club's finest in a generation - overshadowed by a bitter, nagging sense of 'what if?'\n\nBut therein lies the trap. If he spreads his resources too thinly in a desperate bid for immortality, Arteta will risk total systemic failure. He could find himself not only empty-handed at the end of the season, but permanently branded as the manager who - despite having the world at his feet - simply could not get it done when it mattered.\n\nIt's a quandary of Shakespearean proportions. There's no middle ground left, and yet middle ground is all Arteta has left to stand on. This season will either be Arsenal's greatest triumph or a fumble so catastrophic that the Spaniard may never recover.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe 'Process' era is over. The 'Trophy' era must now begin. This is the ultimate litmus test for Mikel Arteta: win big now, or walk away with a legacy defined by 'almost'."

            "content": "Ahead of a busy Saturday filled with quality racing, the Weekend Winners team discussed their best bets for Newbury, Doncaster and Kelso.\n\nThe panel of Kate Tracey, Sam Boswell and Declan Rix paid special attention to Newbury's BetVictor Greatwood Gold Cup Handicap Chase - which is live on Sky Sports Racing at 3.45pm.\n\nVincenzo and Twinjets are towards the head of the market for this contest over two miles and four furlongs, which was won in sensational style by Booster Bob last term at the expense of the former.\n\nDeclan Rix\n\n\"It's obviously a competitive race. There's a combination of horses that have been walloped for wins last time out and horses who are not well-handicapped. I kept going further and further down and ended up with Josh The Boss for two reasons.\n\n\"Firstly, he's a novice and is unexposed to a degree over fences. He's had more runs than I've had hot dinners this year. This will be his seventh start of the season. He is backing up after running at Newcastle last week but he clearly takes his racing well. He jumps well for a novice and I thought last time out he had the run of the race and jumped well aside from nodding on the back of four out.\n\n\"His old nemesis Prairie Wolf will not be in to beat him this day and although it's a worry that he won't be able to dominate this field, I do believe he wants a good, even gallop over this trip because he'll probably stay a little further. If he's bounced out of the race alright, with Jamie Neild taking 7lbs off he has got a handicapping chance.\"\n\nKate Tracey\n\n\"Vincenzo is a standout for me, he looks as if he's got so much more to come. Last time out at Ascot he won by two lengths from Bad. It was a messy race overall but it was really good form in terms of talented horses and a testament to him that he can still produce this kind of effort, sticking to his task really well after hitting the front at the last.\n\n\"He's only been given a 2lb rise for that and I thought that was very fair and he could be even better going back left-handed, which suits him really well. I hope he's got plenty more mileage in his mark.\"\n\nSam Boswell\n\n\"The good news about Heltenham, if you like him like I do, is he loves it around Newbury. He's had one bad run from about six efforts, with three wins and a second to his name. His second was on seasonal reappearance this year against Twinjets. He got beaten by 10 lengths but there's a stone in favour today in favour of Heltenham, which is a massive plus point.\n\n\"I know we don't get the services of Harry Skelton but these are the types of races they're winning en route to a championship and Heltenham is going to be a massive plus point through the spring. He obviously went up against Jonbon last time, which was effectively a run to get round - he managed that.\n\n\"I do hope going back to his favoured Newbury will bring out the best in him. Charlie Todd has ridden the horse before to reasonably good effect when finishing third. We're a double digit price and he's an each-way play, I don't know why he won't be all out to take a really valuable prize.\"\n\nWatch Weekend Winners in full on the At The Races YouTube channel..."

Two years on from a dramatic penalty shoot-out win against Lille in the Conference League, the two sides meet again.\n\nPantomime villain Emiliano Martinez starred on that day, saving the decisive penalty after avoiding a red card midway through the shoot-out, despite receiving his second booking of the game.\n\nTrademark celebrations soon followed as he soaked up the animosity from the French crowd. That, coupled with his antics from the World Cup triumph with Argentina over France, could create quite the cauldron at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy when he returns.\n\nImage: Emi Martinez celebrates Aston Villa's ECL victory over Lille in 2024\n\nVilla will be tasked with replicating the same success over two legs to continue their quest to end their 30-year wait for a trophy and if they do achieve that, the drama won't stop there.\n\nA meeting with Roma and on-loan striker Donyell Malen could then await, should they be successful in the tie against Bologna. UEFA rules state no team can influence what line-up their opponent selects and that would allow Malen to face off against his parent club in a bid to dump them out of the competition.\n\nPorto, Nottingham Forest, Midtjylland and Stuttgart make up the rest of that side of the bracket. Villa were undoubtedly handed a harder route to glory; the storylines running alongside it just add to the drama.\n\nWhen will fixture dates be announced?\n\nThe last 16 match schedule will be available on Friday night.\n\nThe quarter-finals and, in principle, the semi-finals match schedule will be communicated on March 20.\n\nHome advantage in second legs for seeded teams\n\nThe top eight teams from the league phase in both competitions are seeded and will have home advantage in the second leg of their round of 16 games.\n\nThis will extend to the quarter-finals for the teams that finished in the top four of the league phase if they progress.\n\nThe top two will also have home advantage in the second leg of their semi-final if successful.\n\nAny team that eliminates a seeded team will take their privileges.\n\nWhen are the 2025/26 knockout stages?\n\nRound of 16: March 12 and 19\n\nQuarter-finals: April 9 and 16\n\nSemi-finals: April 30 and May 7\n\nFinal: May 20\n\nWhere are the finals?\n\nThe Europa League final will be held at Besiktas Park in Istanbul on May 20.\n\nThe Conference League final will be one week later at the Leipzig Stadium on May 27."

He kept on nicely when winning at Kempton last time and must have a strong chance despite another 3lb rise.\n\nFerrous was successful in this race last year under same pilot Tom Marquand. That was off a 10lb lower mark however and he will need to be at his best if he is to follow up. An excellent fourth behind subsequent winner Diligent Harry in the Kachy Stakes showed he is in rude health though.\n\nThe best of the rest may be Kevin Philippart de Foy's Lakers. He finished an excellent third from a wide draw in a strong race at Southwell and must be respected if in similar mood.\n\n3.00 Newbury - Miami Magic headlines strong novices' chase\n\nMiami Magic tops a quality line-up for the OLBG 'Chasing Excellence' Novices' Chase at Newbury.\n\nStuart Edmunds' stable star impressed when getting off the mark at the third time of asking at Cheltenham on his penultimate run. He struggled to land a blow in the Scilly Isles Novices' Chase at Sandown but given he did not jump with the same fluency, he should appreciate the drop down in class and is taken to concede the penalty under Charlie Hammond.\n\nWyenot has been a consistent performer for the Henry Daly team and has undergone a wind operation having disappointed at Bangor. Providing that is a success, she could bounce back and rates next best.\n\nThat's Nice, Elysian Knight and Thank You Ma'am complete the quintet.\n\n2.12 Lingfield - In-form Henrythenate and Mr Juggles clash\n\nAn ultra-competitive renewal of the Betmgm Awc 3 Year Old Trial Handicap where in-form pair Henrythenate and Mr Juggles headline.\n\nHenrythenate made it two wins from two for new trainer Stuart Williams when comfortably winning over five furlongs at Wolverhampton 15 days ago and he looks the type to go in again as he steps up in trip to six furlongs.\n\nMick Appleby's Mr Juggles was well-backed when making a winning handicap debut at Southwell earlier this month and he warrants plenty of respect under a 7lb penalty.\n\nOthers with each-way chances are Star Of Albion and Saffron Dandy, while Horace Wallace makes appeal on his first handicap start.\n\nBest of the rest\n\n3.45 Lingfield - AW Marathon Trial - Last year's winner Roaring Legend involved. Enemy another to note.\n\n4.20 Lingfield - AW Middle Distance Trial - Duke's Command fancied for Marquand. Lord Melbourne too.\n\n4.53 Lingfield - AW Mile Trial - Superposition among 10 runners.\n\n2.42 Lingfield - AW Fillies & Mares Trial - Bridget's View tops a field of 11.\n\n3.35 Newbury - Taunton winner Talk To The Man catches the eye for Paul Nicholls.\n\n4.08 Newbury - Fair handicap chase where Carbon Man and Daytime Dreaming feature.\n\n2.30 Newbury - Lady Cecilia is a potential improver for Lucy Wadham.\n\n6.15 Wolverhampton - Charlie Appleby and Conor Planas team up with well-bred Starglow. He is related to Romantic Style.\n\n5.45 Wolverhampton - Benacre and Maximising have claims.\n\n12.25 Chantilly - Vatican will be popular.\n\n1.00 Chantilly - Keep an eye on Turbulante."

They are a very good team now. They gave a very good balance between, it’s a very experienced team, with really, very experienced Premier League players, and very young players with huge talent. “It’s a good mix they have now, but I think the most important thing for them is they are consistently playing with their team and have a clear structure in the way they are playing. This is what I could see against Everton. They have a great spirit right now. It was really impressive seeing Matheus Cunha celebrating winning a duel in their own box. This, I think, is what Michael Carrick brought into this team.” Share\n\n2h ago 09.26 EST Manchester United: Michael Carrick on Harry Maguire’s contract running down. “Within the squad, there is that balance, you want that younger potential and excitement and helping develop players, you need the sweet spot in the middle with players at the peak, and experience is massive. “It’s hard to put a price on how valuable that can be.

He is strong and has trained this week.” “Players have incredible support on and off the pitch. Social media is part of the younger generation - it’s the way they communicate and the way they live. In a perfect world, players don’t take notice of what’s on social media but they do. I hope that the players that are on it realise it’s just noise. It’s people with opinions.

The Everton manager reckons Thomas Tuchel should take note. “He’s predominantly a midfield player but can play several positions,” said Moyes. “We had to play him left-back at the start of the season in a couple of games when we didn’t have anybody available. We’ve had to put him at right-back at different times because we think he’s as good as anybody there. In midfield he’s been excellent. I actually believe he’s getting close to being the levels to play for his country. So hopefully he can keep that up and could possibly get selected.” Share\n\n3h ago 08.30 EST Ben Fisher Nottingham Forest need goals if they are to avoid relegation and who better to provide them than Chris Wood, who racked up 20 last season? Only Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak outscored Wood in the last Premier League campaign. Now there is increasing optimism that Wood could feature in Forest’s run-in, an April return mooted. Vitor Pereira, the Forest head coach, said of the striker: “Yes, I hope [he can] recover as soon as possible, because this is very important for us. The information that I have is [that he is] working hard to come as soon as possible.” The 34-year-old has not played since October and underwent knee surgery at the end of last year. The New Zealand captain is desperate to return to fitness before the summer’s World Cup. His last Forest goal came in a home defeat to Midtjylland, who Forest have been drawn against in the two-legged round of 16 next month.

Ahead of the Glasgow derby at Ibrox on Sunday and with 10 fixtures remaining, Rangers are four points behind leaders Hearts and two ahead of Celtic, who have a game in hand over the leading pair. “I think at the moment we are in the second position, they are behind us,” said Rohl, upon being asked for a reaction to McCowan’s comments. “They have at the moment seven or eight defeats. I think in general it makes no sense to speak too much about the other side, we have to focus on ourselves. “We want to win this game. I see my team is ready to take points and then we’ll see on Sunday. Hopefully both teams try everything and I’m confident that we have a big chance of winning this game.” [Press Association] Share\n\n4h ago 07.23 EST Europa League Round of 16 draw Ferencvaros v Braga\n\nPanathinaikos v Real Betis\n\nGenk v Freiburg\n\nCelta Vigo v Lyon\n\nStuttgart v Porto\n\nNottingham Forest v Midtjylland\n\nBologna v Roma\n\nLille v Aston Villa As Villa and Forest are in the same half of the draw, there is no prospect of an all English final.

The Egypt international has won the Golden Boot four times since arriving at Anfield in 2017, the latest in last season’s title-winning campaign but has gone nine league matches without finding the net. It’s his worst run in the English top flight but Slot said while the criticism was to be expected because of the 33-year-old’s high standards it was not a cause for a concern as it was a problem afflicting all his forwards. “He set his own standards and those are so high and the moment he doesn’t score for a few games people are immediately surprised – that is the biggest compliment he can get,” said Slot. “With data you can use it to your advantage or disadvantage but not to use the FA Cup game – if we play a Premier League side - you could argue if that is fair. “Three games ago he had an assist and a goal against a very good Premier League team in Brighton so that is the reality and then you can change data and say he did not score in nine Premier League games. We are used to Mo scoring a lot of goals and at this moment in time that is maybe the biggest difference in his performance and game time. But we also know this has happened before, I don’t know if it happened nine games in a row but I’ve had these questions earlier if he didn’t score for three or five but I know in the end he always starts scoring again. He is not our only attacker at this moment in time that doesn’t score as much as we are used to.” [Press Association] Share\n\n6h ago 05.24 EST Football Association news: Kevin Thelwell has been appointed the FA’s Elite Coach Developer, tasked with supporting the progression of elite homegrown coaches.

Wirtz missed Liverpool’s somewhat fortuitous win against Nottingham Forest last weekend after being forced to pull out during the warm-up. “I don’t expect Florian to be available,” he says. “It’s a disappointment. Every time a player is not available is a disappointment, it’s something that I didn’t expect after last week. At this moment time, I don’t know [when he will return]. Usually when I say that, I do know and I don’t want to share. But this time, I honestly don’t know. “It’s a big accomplishment for Wirtz to stay fit for such a long time because he had to make a step up from where he played to the Premier League and Liverpool. It tells a lot about his mentality and work rate that he has stayed fit for so long. It is a disappointment for him and for us, because he has played really, really well lately” Slot also reveals that Jeremie Frimpong will be available for tomorrow’s match after being sidelined since the end of January.

            "content": "Liverpool had the highest wage bill in the Premier League when winning their 20th league title last season, the club’s latest set of accounts have revealed.\n\nLiverpool’s wage bill increased by £42m to £428m in the year ending 31 May 2025, when a Premier League title triumph in Arne Slot’s debut season as head coach and a return to the Champions League increased revenue to a record £703m. The club’s wages-to-revenue ratio stood at a healthy 61%. It was the biggest wage bill in the division, ahead of Manchester City on £408m, and included bonuses for the record-equalling title triumph.\n\nCommercial revenue increased by £15m to £323m and matchday revenue by £14m to £116m. The figures contributed to an increase of £89m in revenue for the highest-ranked Premier League club in the Deloitte Football Money League. But the rise in wages, which pushed administrative costs up by £57m to £657m, resulted in a relatively modest post-tax profit of £8m. Liverpool had a £57m loss in 2023-24 after failing to qualify for the Champions League.\n\n“We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it,” said Liverpool’s chief financial officer, Jenny Beacham. “The 2024-25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men’s team winning our 20th league title.\n\n“The club does face significant cost challenges, including rises in administrative, staffing and operational costs, alongside the need for us to compete at the highest level of the game, across our men and women’s teams.”\n\nLiverpool’s latest set of published accounts do not include last summer’s record spend of almost £450m on new players, including the British record signing of Alexander Isak for £125m from Newcastle. Slot said recently that failure to qualify for the Champions League would be unacceptable for Liverpool this season and the competition “does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run”.\n\nOn Friday Slot insisted it was not difficult to resist the clamour to start Rio Ngumoha because the level-headed teenager had not been carried away by the hype. The 17-year-old made a huge contribution to Liverpool’s late win at Nottingham Forest last weekend after his 77th-minute introduction, especially after switching wings to replace Mohamed Salah on the right. That has prompted calls for Ngumoha to start against West Ham on Saturday, when Florian Wirtz will again be absent through injury, but Slot will continue to develop the youngster carefully.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rio Ngumoha made a big impact for Liverpool from the bench against Nottingham Forest. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\n“It’s totally not difficult because of how he is,” Slot said of putting Ngumoha on the bench. “And that is something special for a 17-year-old who has been hyped like he is throughout his whole career.\n\n“There has been a lot of talk about him because we can all see how special he is and his talent. He is handling that situation really well, which is a big compliment to him but also to his parents, who raised him that he is down-to-earth, works really hard, keeps going and doesn’t lose his head because a few pundits have given positive feedback about his game. If you start believing how special you are after a few comments from pundits, that is probably not the way to become the player he wants to become.\n\n“We have to keep his special quality and that is beating players in one-v-one. That is not 10 out of 10 times working, and it doesn’t have to be, but he has to keep trying. There are not many players in modern football that can take on one-v-ones on a regular basis and beat their opponents a lot of times. That is a special quality and that is why we want to take such good care of him because we have a lot of belief in how special he is.”"

            "content": "THE CLASS(IC) SYSTEM\n\nLa Liga has El Clásico, France has Le Classique, and Argentina goes full gun with its Superclásico. English football has no true equivalent, with Liverpool and Manchester United fans unable to agree on a name for their grand-slam meetings. Up in the land of fitba, there’s this weekend’s 450th Old Firm/Glasgow derby (delete as applicable according to your stringency on Scottish company law). And Germany has Der Klassiker, between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. The Bundesliga marketing suits have been out in force this week for the one game, played on Saturday evening, that brings extra eyeballs. Though questions are often raised over whether this is a true, classic rivalry; Dortmund have not won a league title since Jürgen Klopp was making his rounds in 2012.\n\nSince then, Bayern have celebrated a league title with lashings of weissbier outside the Rathaus every year save for 2024, when Xabi Alonso’s Bayer Leverkusen went unbeaten to wear the crown. Dortmund v Bayern, is it a historic rivalry? Well, not really, since Bayern’s dominance of the Bundesliga goes back to 1968-69, when they succeeded Eintracht Braunschweig and Nürnberg as champions. The 1970s took in Borussia Mönchengladbach as their chief rivals, what with Günter Netzer, Allan Simonsen and all that.\n\nIt was not until the mid-90s that Dortmund, with two domestic titles and a Big Cup in 1997 (run Lars Ricken VT) realised the dreams of their vast fanbase. Here is where the needle began, with a spat between all-round nice guys Lothar Matthäus and Andy Möller in 1996 and then Oliver Kahn’s flying kick on Stéphane Chapuisat before biting Heiko Herrlich’s ear in 1999. All good stuff if you want to build up a deep-seated rivalry. After near-bankruptcy followed their 2002 Bundesliga triumph, it took Klopp’s heavy-metal thunder for Dortmund to upend Bayern. Since then, while FC Hollywood strut to repeated titles, Dortmund have become football’s leading kindergarten, a finishing school rather than a credible challenger.\n\nThis season, Bayern are eight points clear of Dortmund at the top, and only a win at the Westfalenstadion will prevent another procession. “For me, it’s always a title in its own right, even if people say we can’t win anything more now,” roared Vincent Kompany, ever the hype man. “These games are also important to the masses.” Kompany’s Bayern face a Dortmund team probably unable to believe what happened against Atalanta in Bigger Cup, Ramy Bensebaini’s swinging heel into Nikola Krstovic’s head a moment to have them waking up screaming in the night for decades. What might also keep Dortmund coach Niko Kovac awake is the prospect of facing Harry Kane, living up to the standards set by Robert Lewandowski in modern times and Gerd Müller in Bayern’s first golden era, scoring 45 goals in 37 matches for club and country this season. Truly best in class.\n\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\n\nJoin Tom Bassam at 8pm GMT for red-hot Premier League minute-by-minute updates on Wolves 0-0 Aston Villa.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n“It’s not looking to the style now at this moment.

I too was directly responsible for four opposition goals in one game: one came from my taking a corner that curved behind every one of my teammates, allowing five of the other lot to advance on our puffing centre-back; another was me slicing a clearance so badly that instead of arcing down the touchline, it went at 90 degrees, landing at the feet of an opponent with enough time and space at the edge of our box for his own Grand Designs project. I never again played any form of competitive sport” – Michael Hann.\n\ndouble quotation mark I feel compelled to point out that Ramy Bensebaini played left-sided centre-back of a back three against Atalanta rather than left-back (yesterday’s Football Daily). I noticed this because of the body language of his teammate Daniel Svensson each time Bensebaini recklessly served a goal up on Wednesday. Svensson was the recovering left wing-back at the Algerian’s side, head bowed and shoulders increasingly drooping” – Matthew Parham.\n\ndouble quotation mark I’ve come to the conclusion that the collection of words at the bottom of Football Daily’s full email edition (that rarely makes any sense to me) are a form of the popular location app what3words and give the venue of that evening’s secret ‘drinks’ for the hard-working hacks. It hasn’t escaped me that, when there are more than three words, my theory sheds more water than something that sheds water” – Shaun.\n\ndouble quotation mark Regarding yesterday’s last line ‘Hot Parents’ Chat Ahoy’ (full email edition), am I the only one wondering if it is the chat or the parents that are hot?

Celtic exited the Europa League in Stuttgart but the scale of spirit and togetherness visible during their 1-0, second-leg victory emphasised that tales of their demise may be overstated.\n\nCeltic’s key attribute during a critical week, which begins at Ibrox on Sunday, is course and distance specialism. The shortcomings within, and patched-up nature of, O’Neill’s squad are blindingly obvious. This is, however, a club that has become accustomed to dominating Scottish football over more than a decade. Much earlier, O’Neill had demonstrated he could emerge successful from title scraps. Contrary to giddy analysis, there is nothing miraculous or remarkable about O’Neill’s work during his second short-term stint of the season. It is, though, immediately striking how a 73-year-old can achieve such buy-in from players. Faith in O’Neill within Celtic is absolute.\n\nThis Celtic season, typified by managerial upheaval and protesting supporters, retains a pulse. Stuttgart felt significant because Celtic, in makeshift form, displayed character. The easier option would have been to limp out of the Europa League. Instead, there was an unwillingness to concede an equaliser that reflects positively on O’Neill and his squad.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill (left) is in his second interim stint of the season at Celtic and has galvanised the players after a rocky period.

Rangers’ home form is strong but Danny Röhl’s team are yet to remove the sense of a soft underbelly, demonstrated by draws at Hibernian, Motherwell and Livingston. The most recent of those, last Sunday, was a horrendous result; Livingston had not won in 25 league matches. The stakes are huge for Rangers, who should be embarrassed if a net spend of about £30m is not sufficient to prise the title from Celtic – at one point managed by Wilfried Nancy – and a Hearts side assembled for buttons in comparison. Celtic’s seven Premiership losses to date match their combined tally from the previous two seasons.\n\nA Rangers win would place Celtic in tricky territory, five points behind their oldest foes. Celtic’s game in hand will be played in Aberdeen on Wednesday, before a return to Ibrox on Scottish Cup business. Hearts hope to extend their lead at the top to seven points on Saturday when Aberdeen visit Edinburgh. An Old Firm draw would suit Hearts perfectly.\n\nView image in fullscreen Danny Röhl speaks to the media on Friday. Photograph: Luke Nickerson/Rangers FC/Shutterstock\n\nStuttgart gave O’Neill plenty food for thought. Luke McCowan’s terrific performance in midfield should afford him a start at Ibrox. O’Neill’s public backing of Kasper Schmeichel suggests he will restore the veteran goalkeeper despite almost weekly errors. Schmeichel’s deputy, Viljami Sinisalo, repelled Stuttgart. Auston Trusty’s suspension leaves Celtic weak in central defence. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was not in Celtic’s European squad, was surely signed to play in fixtures such as the derby.\n\nO’Neill is aware of a bigger picture, despite that hardly being his concern given he is due to leave in the summer. “European football is what big clubs in Scotland should be aiming for,” he said. “Not for the coefficient points to be dropping out of sight. It’s ridiculous. This is what it’s all about.”\n\nHis regular reference to the country’s coefficient, which is indeed dipping to a worrying level, is intriguing. There is a theory Celtic’s reluctance to spend heavily on players is linked at least in part to knowledge that their potential lack of access to European revenue in upcoming years could swallow up cash reserves. In a worst-case but feasible situation, Celtic could be staring at Conference League football. This does not, however, explain the horrendous lack of preparation for this season’s Champions League playoff tie. Sensible investment would have been sufficient to topple Kairat Almaty, who instead left Celtic with red faces.\n\nThe shadow boxing has started. McCowan has asserted no team in the league can touch Celtic when at their best. In truth, it would be more of a story had McCowan stipulated Celtic are also-rans. Röhl cast aspersions on Celtic’s approach in Stuttgart; this was amusing, given Rangers finished 32nd out of 36 in the Europa League table.\n\nAll Old Firm jousts are fascinating. This one carries more meaning than most. Events in Germany suggested Celtic are formed of the kind of substance that Rangers must be wary of."

            "content": "Michael Carrick has hinted that Harry Maguire will be offered a new deal with Manchester United and believes “there’s a lot more to come” from the defender.\n\nMaguire’s contract runs out in the summer and he has yet to sign a new one, but there is optimism at Old Trafford that he will stay at the club he joined for £80m in August 2019. United host Crystal Palace on Sunday, aiming to extend their six-match unbeaten run under Carrick. They have only dropped one point in that period, with Maguire’s value to the interim head coach seen by the fact he has started every fixture of his tenure.\n\n“Harry’s an impressive character. He’s had a great career so far, hopefully there’s a lot more to come,” Carrick said. “The journey and the experiences that he’s had, certainly since he’s been here and with England as well, showed exactly what he is. I think we all know the player that he is and what he’s capable of doing.\n\n“The other night [against Everton] I thought he was fantastic. Experience helps. His attributes help, and his character. His willingness to put himself out there. He’s really impressive at his age and he’s been really important for us.”\n\nThe 32-year-old has not always been universally popular since arriving from Leicester but has rediscovered his best form in recent weeks. It is likely that Maguire will need to take a wage reduction to remain at the club, but following the announcement that Casemiro will leave at the end of the season, there is an eagerness to keep some experience around the squad.\n\n“Within the squad there’s always that balance,” Carrick said. “You want that younger potential and that excitement of developing players and helping players. but you need that little sweet spot in the middle where the play is at the peak. You need that within the group and experience is massive. It’s hard to put a price on how valuable that can be, whether that’s individuals or experience as a whole group.”\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe is keen to keep costs down and wages is a key part of it, especially after it was revealed in a filing to the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday that the sacking of Ruben Amorim and his staff could cost the club up to £16m. United said in a November 2024 filing they were paying Sporting £10m to hire Amorim to replace Erik ten Hag, whose exit was costing £10.4m. The combined changes around Amorim’s appointment could cost United £36.3m."

            "content": "1 Emery seeks to end Wolves duck\n\nUnai Emery has seen most things in this game but he has never won at Wolves. In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on direct rivals. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season. Will Unwin\n\nBournemouth v Sunderland, Saturday 12.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Back in business: Granit Xhaka looks set to give Sunderland a timely boost. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea, where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in matchday chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) as they sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL interpreters will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here. Andy Hunter\n\nLiverpool v West Ham, Saturday 3pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Liverpool fans sing You’ll Never Walk Alone before kick-off at Anfield. Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images\n\n5 Centre stage for Gordon against old club\n\nNewcastle may be in the last 16 of the Champions League but they are also 11th in the Premier League, two places and one point behind Saturday’s visitors to St James’ Park, Everton. “We’ve raised our game at times in the Champions League, there’s no denying that,” says Eddie Howe. “But we want to get into Europe every season and we’re desperate to get our Premier League form back on track. We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left-winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German, who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire on Saturday. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track after a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croat’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and, considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance. WU\n\nFulham v Tottenham, Sunday 2pm\n\nView image in fullscreen João Palhinha (left) battles with Leandro Trossard during an uncomfortable afternoon in the north London derby. Photograph: Ian Walton/AP\n\n9 Amad to make way for Sesko?\n\nFor Michael Carrick to find a fall guy for Benjamin Sesko, who is seeking a first start under him, the interim manager need look no further than Amad Diallo. The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third goal in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes after the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "Two months ago, Aston Villa were just three points off top spot in the Premier League. They were on a run of 12 wins in 14 games that included victories against Manchester City and Arsenal. Their run of eight consecutive wins in the league was their best since they won 10 in a row in 1910. You wouldn’t have blamed Villa fans for daring to dream about lifting their first league title since 1981.\n\nBut success breeds expectation, and expectation carries its own cruel weight. Arsenal tore Villa apart in a 4-1 win in late December and victories have been hard to come by in the new year – they have only won three of their last nine league games. Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea are still below them in the table but the gap is narrowing. With games against United and Chelsea coming in March, the top-three spot Villa have occupied since they beat Wolves in late November suddenly looks in jeopardy. So does their place in the Champions League next season.\n\nThey salvaged a point against Leeds on Saturday courtesy of a scrambled 88th-minute finish from Tammy Abraham, but the 1-1 draw at Villa Park did little to disguise the deeper issues. Unai Emery’s side looked anxious and lacked inspiration for long periods of the game. A slow start left them chasing the game and, not for the first time this season, they relied on a set-piece goal to bail them out of trouble. “It’s a good point,” said a clearly relieved Emery. Daniel Farke’s reaction was telling. “It’s crazy that you can come here as a newly promoted side – to one of the title contenders, one of the best teams in this country and in Europe – and you are slightly disappointed with just one point.”\n\nThe tension from the fans in Villa Park mirrored the hesitancy on the pitch – a rarity in what has been one of Europe’s most difficult venues to visit in recent years. Villa lost just one home game in the league last season and were on a run of eight straight wins at Villa Park this season before their current slump. And yet they were just minutes away from their fourth defeat in their last six home games in all competitions. For a side that has thrived on controlled possession, high-quality chance creation and adaptability, they looked one-dimensional and mistake-prone.\n\nVilla are lacking a creative pulse and their strikers are suffering. They have scored just one goal from open play in their last five matches. Injuries have had a large part to play in this. Three of their first-choice midfielders – Boubacar Kamara, Youri Tielemans and John McGinn – are out injured.\n\nTielemans and McGinn have set up 50 chances for teammates this season (only Morgan Rogers has been more creative) so it’s no surprise to see Villa struggle for goals. Without the physicality and control of their absent midfielders, Villa’s buildup play has been fractured and mistakes have crept in. Their replacements, Douglas Luiz and Amadou Onana, were injured earlier in the season and lack the match fitness required to complete games.\n\nView image in fullscreen Aston Villa have missed John McGinn, their captain, during his injury layoff. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nThe good news for Villa fans is that they have battled back from similar setbacks in the recent past. They failed to score a goal or win a point from their first four league matches this season yet were fighting for the title by Christmas.\n\nAnd they had to show plenty of character the last time they qualified for the Champions League, in the 2023–24 season. They were challenging for the title at Christmas, having lost just two of their first 18 games. But they struggled in the second half of the campaign, lost seven matches and found them themselves grinding out results. That team held on and finished fourth, booking their place in Europe’s top competition for the first time since the 1982-83 season.\n\nVilla are showing similar grit this season. After Abraham’s last-gasp equaliser against Leeds, Villa have won 19 points from losing positions – more than any other side in the division. They also have the third best defensive record, having conceded just 28 goals in 27 games. And they have one of the most experienced and shrewdest managers in Europe.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering that the Premier League is unusually competitive this season. The longest current winning streak in the league is just three matches (Manchester City). All of the top teams – even leaders Arsenal – have gone through periods when they have dug in. Villa’s resilience could prove decisive. Their recent draws against Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Leeds might feel like missed opportunities, but those points may prove crucial come May.\n\nMarch will be a season-defining month for Villa. Their recent form is patchy and their performances have been far from eye-catching. Fluidity in possession has given way to forced passes, and dominance has often been replaced by moments of desperation. But there remains a steel to this side that cannot be ignored. And, crucially given their upcoming games against their fellow Champions League chasers, they have a nice habit of beating the top sides. They have already beaten Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea in the league this season. There are plenty of reasons to go into the run-in with optimism.\n\nThis is an article by WhoScored"

Their expensive striker needs goals, and he starts in central midfield.\n\n\"Now, this is possibly because he doesn't trust him up front. He didn't play well in central midfield. Eddie Howe said he didn't play well in central midfield, saying it is the least he's affected the game since he arrived at the club.\n\n3 Woltemade recently ended his goal drought against Aston Villa Credit: Getty\n\n\"Now, on the talkSPORT YouTube channel, there is a programme called Inside The Toon, and it's all things Newcastle United, and Jack Cunningham is one of the contributors.\n\n\"He said, 'Newcastle should build the team around Woltemade'. Well, if Newcastle want to go down to the Championship that might be a brilliant idea. I do wonder what planet this guy is on.\n\n\"Is he a nine? No. One goal in 18 games is not a nine. Is he a midfielder? No, definitely not.\n\n\"Is he a ten? Have a look at the number tens around the Premier League. Morgan Rogers, Cole Palmer, Bruno Fernandes. Morgan Gibbs-White etc.\n\n\"There are better number tens in the Championship than Woltemade. Two Premier League assists all season, and when did Newcastle play with a ten? They aren't going to rip up that three-man midfield to put Woltemade at ten.\n\n\"Let's get this right. He is a footballer, he's got talent. But he has not got a place in the Newcastle United team, and I think that is the fundamental flaw here.\n\nInside The Toon on talkSPORT talkSPORT does Newcastle like nowhere else.

But it's the way Newcastle play, the fact they needed to replace Isak, Howe is putting him all over the park trying to find a place for him.\n\n\"£70m and he hasn't even got a place in the team? That's your big signing. That's a joke signing. So pound-for-pound, for what a team needed and what he brings, I make Woltemade the worst-ever Premier League signing.\"\n\nWell that's me told. But let's put it into context...\n\nDurham's comments came in response to the following point: \"He is someone you should build the team around,\" I said on Inside The Toon.\n\n\"It probably would be as a number ten, eventually because with Stuttgart players were always close to him. If you get players close to him, we can see what he can do.\n\n\"There were a few times against Qarabag, even in the second half when he was getting frustrated and losing the ball, there were times where he is picking up brilliant little pockets of space, and we don't find him.\n\n\"People are watching him and making him a scapegoat for things not working this season.\n\n\"You've got to accept that this is a £69million brilliant footballer, and you've got to find a way to get him in the team and work around it.\n\n\"There is this perception that because he's 6ft 6, he should score a load of headers. If you watch him, you'll realise that is not his game.\"\n\n3 Even if you discount his actual ability, the statistics for a forward in his first Premier League season aren't even that bad\n\nCase for the defence\n\nNewcastle at some point have to evolve if they are to be consistently a top side.\n\nWe see Arsenal and Manchester City play in different ways from game-to-game.\n\nBoth of those sides have a good mixture of technical and physical players, while the Toon have too many of the latter.\n\nWoltemade is very much a technical footballer, you only have to look at his goal against Brighton, the penalty against Nottingham Forest and his second in the 2-2 draw with Chelsea to know that this guy has incredible technique.\n\nThere are other moments of pure genius as well that show, with the right structure, Newcastle would get the best out of Woltemade.\n\ntalkSPORT understands that the Magpies are willing to sell Woltemade in the summer, which would be a mistake.\n\nEven if you don't rate him, Anthony Elanga and Yoane Wissa have so far contributed a lot less than the 6ft 6ins German.\n\nThe likes of Antony, Nicolas Pepe, and Ali Dia are somewhere breathing an almighty sigh of relief if Woltemade is the worst-ever top-flight signing.\n\nAnd forget about Premier League history, even just in Newcastle history, I can think of one signing who was far worse - Michael Owen.\n\nOwen was the Toon's record signing at the time, he spent the majority of it injured and never even wanted to be there.\n\nWoltemade has embraced life on Tyneside in every way, and for that alone, he's better than Owen.\n\nRegarding finding a place for him in the team, that is on Howe because he is at St James' Park now, and if you have to change the system to accommodate him, so be it because it would be a step in the team's evolution.\n\nHe has the ability and vision to unlock defences because we've seen it, and ultimately, Newcastle will win more games with him in the side than without.\n\nWoltemade probably won't turn out to be the Isak replacement, but for a club-record fee, the club have a supremely talented player who will prove everyone wrong.\n\nStarting with our very own Adrian Durham."

He has also shown a preference for playing this Leeds side, scoring twice in his three career matches against the Whites.\n\nSemenyo is a dangerous customer and is fancied to get on the scoresheet in this clash.\n\nBrendan Aaronson to score at anytime\n\nWhile Dominic Calvert-Lewin has taken most of the headlines, Brendan Aaronson has been quietly one of most impressive players in Daniel Farke’s lineup.\n\nHe has four goals in the Premier League and three assists but arguably his most impressive statistic is his 0.73 shots on target per 90 minutes.\n\nAaronson is particularly dangerous on the counter, where Manchester City have been vulnerable, and he is a tempting price to find the net against the visitors.\n\nGET UP TO £30 WHEN YOU BET ON THE FOOTBALL WITH talkSPORT BET\n\nOdds correct at time of publish and subject to change*\n\n18+ New customers only.

He's now started scoring goals, 'We're not happy with him scoring goals, we want him to score goals against better teams'.\n\n\"Is that where we are? I think he's doing absolutely fine.\n\nI've got the stats, I think his goal scoring ratio so far is more than acceptable, Gyokeres.\n\n\"And he's a bit like [Benjamin] Sesko, I think there's improvement in him.\n\n\"I think he'll continue to improve - and I don't think he'll start every game under [Mikel] Arteta.\""

The storm on Monday already caused damage, and early this morning there was even more damage,” said Rev. Ananias Simes, a pastor at a church in Juiz de Fora, the hardest-hit city.\n\nAll the victims have been found in Juiz de Fora and Uba, about 310 kilometers (192 miles) north of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nOfficials in Juiz de Fora have declared a state of public calamity and ordered evacuations along dozens of roads, directing residents to shelter in nearby schools.\n\nSimes, whose church is providing refuge and supplies, said many roads were shut as residents brace for more torrential rain.\n\n\n\nDespite the danger, he planned to travel to the city’s battered northern zone with food and water.\n\n“The situation is very chaotic,” he said. “Everyone is doing their utmost to make sure everyone stays safe.”\n\nForecasters warned of “great danger” until Friday evening across parts of Minas Gerais and other states including Rio and Sao Paulo, with risks of landslides, rivers bursting their banks and major flooding.\n\n\n\nYesterday, three houses, collapsed on Thiers Ceruti street.\n\nThree people were rescued by bystanders however a fourth, 26-year-old man died the tragic incident.\n\nFire crews urged residents to watch for warning signs their homes could collapse.\n\nThese signs included cracks in bulging walls, fissures, jammed doors or windows, muddy water rushing downhill, leaning trees or poles and cracking sounds from the ground.\n\n“Don’t wait. If theres any doubt, leave the house,” said military firefighter Cel. Joselito Oliveira de Paula, adding that six bodies had been removed since Wednesday and that fresh rain could slow rescue efforts.\n\n\n\nHealth officials have also issued an epidemiological alert warning of diseases linked to contaminated water such as leptospirosis.\n\nPresident Luiz Incio Lula da Silva said security forces have been deployed on rescue missions and are providing immediate help, with the federal government releasing around £490,000 (3.4 million reais) for reconstruction and humanitarian aid.\n\nScientists say extreme weather is becoming more frequent because of human-caused climate change.\n\nNearly a quarter of Juiz de Fora’s roughly 540,000 residents live in areas considered at risk from land – and water- related natural hazards, according to a 2023 Cemaden report.\n\n“We dont know when heavy rains will occur, but we know that they will,” said Natalie Unterstell, founder of the Talanoa Institute.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“Climate adaptation needs to be a priority. It’s not about reacting to a situation, but about investing in infrastructure to avoid deaths.”\n\nThe disaster echoes the massive floods that hit southern Rio Grande do Sul state in May 2024, which killed at least 185 people and caused more than 10 billion reais (£1.4 billion) in losses after devastating businesses, farms and factories."

In 2010 he was he received non life-threatening injuries to his neck after his throat was slashed.\n\nCarr, now 49, served 21 months for perverting justice after giving Huntley a false alibi. She now lives under a new identity."

            "content": "SAINT'S DAY Who was St David and what is St David’s Day?\n\nSAINT David’s Day is a traditional celebration dedicated to the miracle worker and saint of Wales, St David.\n\nAlthough it is not a public holiday, it has been celebrated across Wales since the 12th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho was Saint David?\n\nSaint David – or Dewi Sant in Welsh – is generally considered to have been born some time between 462 and 515AD and was the grandson of Ceredig, King of Ceredigion.\n\nAccording to legend, his mother, named Non, gave birth to him on a Pembrokeshire clifftop during a fierce storm.\n\nAfter being educated in Cardiganshire, he went on pilgrimage through south Wales and the west of England, where it is said that he founded religious centres such as Glastonbury and Croyland.\n\nHe even went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where he was made an archbishop.\n\nSt David eventually settled at Glyn Rhosyn (St David’s), in south-west Wales.\n\nMany miracles have been attributed to him.\n\nThe most incredible of these was when he caused the ground to rise underneath him so that he could be seen and heard by all, according to Rhigyfarch who wrote about him towards the end of the 11th century.\n\n\n\nWhen is St David’s Day 2026?\n\nThis year, Saint David’s Day will be celebrated on Sunday, March 1.\n\nWales celebrates St David’s feast day on the exact same date annually, in honour of their patron saint.\n\nSt David is believed to have died on March 1 in 589 AD, which is why it became St. David’s Day.\n\nThe feast was not regularly celebrated until he was canonised by Pope Callixtus II in 1120.\n\nPeople can be seen wearing daffodils and leeks, symbols of Wales and St. David.\n\n\n\nWelsh rarebit, cawl and Welsh cakes are eaten throughout the day, with many towns and cities throwing parades too.\n\nWhy do we celebrate St David?\n\nSt. David’s last words to his followers came from a sermon he gave on the previous Sunday: “Be joyful, keep the faith, and do the little things that you have heard and seen me do.’\n\nHe was buried at the site of St David’s Cathedral, where his shrine was a popular place of pilgrimage throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nThe phrase “Gwnewch y pethau bychain mewn bywyd” – “Do the little things in life” – is still a well-known maxim in Wales.\n\n\n\nFrom this period on, he was frequently referred to in the work of medieval Welsh poets such as Iolo Goch and Lewys Glyn Cothi.\n\nIn 1398, it was ordained that his feast day was to be kept by every church in the Province of Canterbury.\n\nThough the feast of St David as a religious festival ended with the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, the day of his birth became a national festival during the 18th century.\n\nWhat symbols are associated with St David’s Day?\n\nOn St David’s Day, many people in Wales pin either a daffodil or a leek to their clothes – as the Welsh have two national emblems.\n\n\n\nThe tradition of eating and wearing leeks on St David’s Day supposedly goes back to the sixth century.\n\nAlthough many associate St David with leeks or daffodils, his personal symbol is actually the dove, after one was said to have rested on his shoulder during a miracle.\n\nSt David was a teetotal vegetarian reputed to have consumed only leeks and water but the association likely pre-dates him.\n\nLeeks were hailed by Druids as a cure for the cold, protecting soldiers against wounds in battle, and even for keeping away evil spirits.\n\nEntries in the household accounts of the ‘Welsh’ Tudor Kings of England, record payments for leeks worn by the household guards on St David’s Day.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the fourteenth century, it is known that the feared Welsh archers adopted the green and white colours of the leek for their uniforms, perhaps at the Battle of Crecy, explains Historic UK.\n\nIn 1346, when the Prince of Wales, Edward the Black Prince, defeated the French at the Battle of Crécy, Welsh archers reportedly fought bravely in a field of leeks and as a reminder began to wear a leek in their caps every St David’s Day.\n\nDaffodils, which are in bloom around this time of year, have only become another national symbol for Wales in the 19th century.\n\nWales Online explains that St David’s feast day became a national festival during the 18th century.\n\nIt states: “By that time the leek had become a bit of a caricature and this may explain why daffodils became a popular alternative.”\n\n\n\nHow is St David’s celebrated?\n\nThe traditional meal on St David’s Day is a soup made of lamb, leeks and other vegetables known as cawl.\n\nThe day is celebrated with country festivals and dances – all with a dragon-theme – which take place across Wales on St David’s Day.\n\nImages of red dragons are used to celebrate because the dragon features on the Welsh national flag and is often considered a symbol of the country.\n\nChildren in Wales take part in school concerts or eisteddfodau, with recitation and singing being the main activities.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe flag of Saint David often plays a central role in the celebrations and can be seen flying throughout Wales.\n\nUnlike St Patrick’s Day in Ireland, St David’s Day is not a national holiday, though there is strong support for it becoming a bank holiday in Wales."

            "content": "NIGEL Farage has reported incidents of “family voting” to the cops after his party finished second to the Green Party.\n\nThe Reform UK leader raised concerns about sectarian voting and “cheating” straight after Hannah Spencer won the by-election.\n\n\n\nBut he has now reported cases in the Gorton and Denton by-election to both the police and the Electoral Commission.\n\n\n\nHis intervention came after election observer group Democracy Volunteers witnessed “concerningly high levels” of family voting.\n\nThis involves the illegal practice where two voters use just a single voting booth and possibly direct each other on how to vote.\n\nMr Farage said: “Reform has today reported the many cases of ‘family voting’ to the electoral commission and the police.\n\n“What was witnessed yesterday is deeply concerning and raises serious questions about the integrity of the democratic process in predominantly Muslim areas.\n\n“If this is what was happening at polling stations just imagine the potential for coercion with postal votes.\n\n“If action isn’t taken now, then we will ensure it is after the next General Election.”\n\nBritain has witnessed a political earthquake by Noa Hoffman, Political Correspondent BRITAIN woke up to a political earthquake today as the Greens hoovered up thousands of Labour votes to snatch victory at the Gorton and Denton by-election. In what had long been a traditional red stronghold, Sir Keir Starmer’s party was also beaten by Reform. The result tells us plenty about where the country’s politics is heading — and it foreshadows a fight that will be replayed across swathes of constituencies at the next general election. First, the PM’s career is back on the line. Despite riding out a major wobble amid the Mandelson scandal, Labour backbenchers will now feel more emboldened than ever to call time on Starmer’s leadership. They will argue the PM faces a far bigger threat from the left than the right — and that moves to curb immigration and crack down on benefits have ended up punishing the party. Sir Keir’s critics will also point to the loss of thousands of Muslim votes as a warning sign: that Labour isn’t hardline enough on sectarian issues and failed to take a strong stand on Gaza. The result will also lift the prospects of left-wing leadership rivals such as Angela Rayner and Andy Burnham, who will argue their more socialist approach would’ve stopped the party haemorrhaging support in inner-city areas. Gorton and Denton also signals a serious cracking of Britain’s two-party politics.\n\nThe Tories, for instance, were nowhere to be seen during the campaign and barely scraped 600 votes — a cataclysmic result for the party. Labour’s third-place finish, meanwhile, showed how readily voters will ditch the two main parties for alternatives, underlining deep frustration with the state of the country — and the political status quo. While Reform seized a sizeable chunk of the vote, the result also underlined the power of anti-Nigel Farage tactical voting. There is a huge coalition of voters ready to swing to whichever party they think is best placed to beat Reform. And the by-election also shone a light on a sharp rise in sectarian voting. Throughout the campaign, the Green Party leafleted near mosques and distributed flyers in Urdu. They told Muslim voters to “Labour must be punished for Gaza”.\n\nExpect a lot more of this campaigning style in seats with high Muslim populations from here on. The by-election also showed that left-wing populism is emerging as a real force in British politics, as it has been on the right. The Green Party hardly centred environmentalism during their campaign, instead breaking with tradition to focus on issues of immigration and the cost of living. Today the PM vowed to “keep on fighting” in the face of pressure to lurch further left or quit. It is unlikely any leadership challenge will come about in the immediate aftermath of the vote. Sir Keir’s leadership rivals from all wings of the party will want time to calibrate. And they will want to gain further momentum from the predicted major losses set to tarnish Labour in May local elections. It’s likely that no one will pounce until at least that point.\n\nManchester City Council insisted no issues had been reported. They said it was“extremely disappointing” that Democracy Volunteers waited until ballots closed to make claims.\n\nA Greater Manchester Police spokesperson said: “We can confirm a report has been made.\n\n\n\n“We are in the process of reviewing this report and will provide a further update in due course.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Electoral Commission said: “We work closely with electoral administrators to offer guidance, and make sure they have arrangements in place with their local police force to respond to allegations of fraud.\n\n“We can confirm that we have received a letter from Nigel Farage MP. We will carefully consider the points raised in line with our role in supporting well-run elections.”\n\nThe Greens said reporting the matter to the cops was “an attempt to undermine the democratic result and is straight out of the Trump playbook”.\n\nWhat do the Greens stand for? by Noa Hoffman, Political Correspondent What are Green Party’s bonkers policies? From ‘disgusting’ plan to legalise heroin to letting in ALL illegal migrants THE Green Party has been blasted for “disgusting” plans following their bombshell victory last night. Fighting for his political life yesterday, Sir Keir Starmer made a last minute attack on the Greens in an attempt to sway voters. But it was unsuccessful, with Labour coming third – and the result provided an opening for Andy Burnham‘s allies to claim things could have been different if he had been allowed to stand. The Greater Manchester Mayor – a challenger to Starmer – tried to stand in the constituency but was blocked by Labour’s ruling executive committee. The Gorton and Denton result signals a serious cracking of Britain’s two-party politics, with Reform and the Greens gaining more power and validity. But it has cast a light on the policies of both parties – with the Greens coming under fire for plans on drugs and immigration. Yesterday, Sir Keir came out swinging and told PMQs: “The Green Party’s policy isn’t just irresponsible, it’s reprehensible, legalising cocaine, heroin, ketamine and the date rape drug, GHB, a drug which we know is used to spike drinks for women. “I have to say, as the father of a 17-and-a-half-year-old son, that the idea that the argument is being made by the Greens that when he turns 18, in just a few months, it would be lawful to provide him with heroin and crack cocaine is absolutely disgusting.” Green candidate Hannah Spencer has previously said she thought “decriminalising is a conversation that we need to have”. Last year, the leader of the Greens said that all drugs – including heroin and crack cocaine – should be legalised. The Mail has also reportedly seen documents drawn up by the Greens that suggest giving amnesty to illegal migrants. It reported that Zack Polanski plans to let illegal arrivals use the NHS from the moment they land in the UK as part of a “world without borders”. This would apply even if their asylum claim was rejected.\n\nInternal documents read that “migration is not a criminal offence under any circumstances”, the Mail reports. Detention centres for illegal migrants would also be abolished in the plans. The Greens would also give them a wage on the level of benefits – but without the usual requirement to be in work or actively seek work. Reform, Labour and the Tories all blasted the scheme as “financially reckless but also dangerous”. Other Green Party plans include Net Zero by 2040, dismantling nuclear weapons, and more tax rises for earners above £50,000.\n\nHannah Spencer, the Green candidate, helped win the party its first ever parliamentary by-election.\n\n\n\nLabour were pushed into third place with Reform UK in second.\n\nSpencer, a councillor and plumber won with 14,980 votes and a majority of 4,402 votes.\n\nReform UK’s candidate Matt Goodwin got 10,578 votes. Labour’s Angeliki Stogia only picked up 9,36.\n\nThat was down from 18,555 in the 2024 general election.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe result will pile more pressure on Sir Keir Starmer with potential leadership challengers\n\n\n\nEx-deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the result should be a “wake up call” and the government must be “braver”."

            "content": "GEN Z-EN Two thirds of Gen Z office workers can’t work without headphones on, survey reveals\n\nNEW research has revealed two thirds of Gen Z office workers can’t work without headphones on.\n\nThe poll of 2,000 white collar staff found 64 per cent of 18 to 29-year-olds ‘need’ to be plugged in when doing their jobs – compared to just 27 per cent of Gen X.\n\n\n\nNot being able to concentrate amid the background noise (55 per cent) is the number one reason for depending on headphones.\n\n\n\nOne of the most significant background distractions is the sound of other people on calls (34 per cent).\n\nBut older generations are also contributing to the trend, with 69 per cent of employees across all age groups using headphones during the working day.\n\nPop (34 per cent), podcasts (22 per cent) and rock (19 per cent) top the nation’s workday soundtrack, followed closely by classical music (19 per cent).\n\nWhile nine per cent tune into ambient sounds, such as rainfall or crackling fires, and six per cent opt for the more abrasive tones of heavy metal.\n\n\n\nThe research was commissioned by Samsung Electronics to celebrate the launch of its noise cancelling Galaxy Buds4 Pro Series headphones.\n\nAnnika Bizon from the tech firm said: “Workplaces today are full of competing demands on our attention, whether that’s office chatter, back-to-back calls or the constant stream of notifications.\n\n“What this research shows is that many are actively creating their own focus zones, and headphones have become an essential tool for switching into a more productive mindset.”\n\nOverall, 35 per cent of office headphone users now struggle to work without them, while a fifth said they make fewer mistakes when listening to their favourite sounds on the job.\n\n\n\nNearly half (45 per cent) prefer noise cancelling tech, as 44 per cent said general background noise causes them to lose concentration, while 34 per cent bemoan the sound of others on calls.\n\nAnd 16 per cent added constant emails and message pings derail their train of thought.\n\nSix in 10 (61 per cent) believe they would work faster if there was less noise around them, with 37 per cent describing light music and background chatter as the optimum working environment.\n\nExploring listening habits further, the survey found 46 per cent typically listen to the same things every day.\n\n\n\nAnd 74 per cent believe there are clear generational differences when it comes to attitudes towards wearing headphones at work.\n\nAnnika Bizon from Samsung added: “When people are trying to concentrate, the quality of what they’re hearing – and what they’re able to block out – really matters.\n\n“Comfort is also chief among the elements that make a noticeable difference to concentration when working, as well as features like immersive sound and adaptive noise control.\n\n“Whichever devices people choose to get them through their day have the ability to help people stay engaged, reduce mistakes and feel more in control of their working environment.”"

Give them back those $10 million. Please.\n\n“I’ll give everything back to everyone we stole from, I’ll give everything back to everyone.”\n\nIn a separate unverified video, man claiming to be Igor allegedly admitted to running a bank account “scamming” business.\n\n\n\nLocal cops are trying to determine the authenticity of the clips.\n\nNow, mutilated human body parts have been found on the holiday hotspot island, which officials think may belong to Igor.\n\nPolice are working to identify the body parts and conducting DNA testing, including taking a sample from Igor’s mother.\n\nThe remains were reportedly in an advanced state of decomposition, with forensic specialists estimating the victim had been dead for more than three days.\n\nBali Police spokesperson Senior Commissioner Ariasandy said: “It could be [him] but again we cannot speculate, we can’t guess. We must rely on forensic results.”\n\n\n\n“We will then match [samples] with the DNA of families who feel their family members are missing, or who reported kidnapping or missing persons, including those we learned yesterday that a foreign national was reported kidnapped.”\n\nHe added: “Because it happened to be a kidnapping case, we are investigating all possible things, but we cannot speculate.”\n\n\n\nThe tourist was holidaying on island paradise Bali with his girlfriend, Yeva Mishalova, and his friend Yermak Petrovsky when the alleged kidnap took place.\n\nYeva is a lifestyle and food blogger with 146,000 followers.\n\nSome reports have claimed that the alleged captor located Igor by using social media posts.\n\nPolice have arrested six men as suspects in the alleged kidnap – the suspects were identified after officers arrested a foreign national attempting to flee.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nHe said: “Initially, we secured one foreign national with the initials CH, who rented vehicles using a false passport.\n\n\n\n“Following further investigation, we named six other foreign nationals as suspects — RM, BK, AS, VN, SM and DH. All are men.”"

Ibrahima died almost an hour later in hospital, meanwhile his killer ‘boasted’ about the knife attack in a rap video filmed in the aftermath, a court was told.\n\nAt a trial in December all three boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were convicted for their roles in the murder. Boy A, who stabbed Ibrahima, was found guilty of his murder. Boy B and Boy C, who were said to have assisted and encouraged the knifeman, were found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.\n\nImage: Family Handout/PA) Family Handout/PA)\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Boy B was sentenced to two years and ten months detention.\n\nBoy C was sentenced to two years and four months detention. Boy B and Boy C will both serve two-thirds of their sentences in detention.\n\nBoy A had already admitted manslaughter. He ‘boasted’ about the killing in a rap video filmed in the aftermath. “We just done a murder,” he said.\n\nIbrahima died on June 8, 2025 after suffering a single blow to the chest, in the assault in New Moston, north Manchester, Manchester Evening News reported.\n\nProsecutor Jaime Hamilton KC told the trial: “In the street, after a brief altercation, [Boy B] handed [Boy A] a knife that caused a wound which penetrated Ibrahima’s heart.\n\n“After being handed the knife, all three of these defendants chased Ibrahima. Tragically Ibrahima slipped to the floor and [Boy A] killed him, assisted and encouraged by the others.”\n\nImage: Sean Hansford | Manchester Evening News) Sean Hansford | Manchester Evening News)\n\nThe prosecutor said that Ibrahima, who was with other boys, had been on his way to play football when he encountered the three defendants, at about 5pm that day. Mr Hamilton claimed the defendants had been ‘part of a group that had been threatening Ibrahima, his family and his friendship group’.\n\nHe told the jury that the incident began with a fight involving Boy A and a friend of Ibrahima on Nuthurst Road. The friend was said to have thrown the first punch.\n\nMr Hamilton said that footage showed the fight ended and the two groups began to separate. He said that Boy B gave Boy A a knife, after Boy A asked him to ‘gimme the ting’.

After leaving the area and going to a house, Boy A ‘improvised’ a rap in the aftermath of the killing in which ‘boasted’ about it.\n\nBoy B gave evidence at the trial, while Boy A and Boy C both declined. Boy A’s barrister accused Boy B of trying to ‘throw’ his co-accused ‘under the bus’.\n\nIbrahima’s family paid tribute to him following his death. They said: “Ibrahima was a well-liked young boy. He was funny, caring, and hardworking. He was our best friend, and he looked after me.\n\n“He was so smiley and always made everybody laugh. He was a good boy. The killers have killed two people - me and my son. Why would anyone do this to him? He does nothing wrong. My family want justice.”"

It was a timely broadcast. Cara had been driving home from her boyfriend’s house lat eat night when she had been intercepted by her killer.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe following day, December 28, Cara’s car was found abandoned on a dead-end road in San Diego County. Her body was later recovered at the bottom of a 65 ft ravine nearby. With that brutal murder fresh in viewers’ minds, it seemed like a good idea for the TV news crew to take part in a “ride along” with California Highway Patrol officer Craig Peyer, who offered some valuable advice on how unaccompanied women could stay safe on the roads.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPeyer told viewers: ”Look, one of the most hazardous things that can happen to you beyond an accident on the highway is if you have some sort of car trouble that forces you to stop … because once you stop, there's an inclination for a lot of people to want to leave their vehicle. That’s a very dangerous thing to do.”.”\n\nLooking back on that video, podcaster Mr Ballen explained: “That evening, Officer Peyer’s actual segment aired on TV, to him and to the California Highway Patrol, it went great. It was a minute and a half long. It sort of hit all the high points. It showed Officer Peyer, talking about how to be safe on the highway and talking to the stranded motorists. You know, it kind of did exactly what they expected it to do.”\n\nView 4 Images Cara was stopped as she drove home from her boyfriend's house (Image: Wikipedia )\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut for a handful of women watching the broadcast, it did a lot more than that. “There were a few people when they watched this clip that noticed something, something very specific,” Mr Ballen said. “And within an hour of this clip airing on TV, those few people were calling the police in droves to tell them, ‘We know what happened to Cara Knott.’\n\n“The police would follow up on these tips. And sure enough, just over two weeks later, they had gathered enough evidence that they were able to arrest Cara Knott's killer.\n\nOver 20 calls had been made to local police after the KCST broadcast, all from women who had been pulled over by a police officer very close to the scene of Cara’s death. And every one of this callers said they recognised Peyer who had stopped them and made inappropriate sexual advances to them – in some cases stroking their hair and shoulders.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSeveral of these women had previously made complaints about Peyer’s creepy advances, but those reports had been discounted because of his 13-year unblemished record with the department.\n\nBut after all those calls came in, Peyer’s police colleagues looked again at his whereabouts that night. Cara was last seen alive at a petrol station just two miles away from the lonely road where she died. The gas station attendant remembered seeing a marked CHP patrol car making a U-turn on the road just after Cara had driven away, as if it was starting to follow her.\n\nView 4 Images Peyer was seen in the report giving advice to someone who'd left his car at the side of a road (Image: NBC News 7 San Diego)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nInspection of Peyer’s official police notebook revealed that certain details had been changed after the event such as the exact timings that he had handed out tickets for traffic offences.\n\nBut the most damning evidence against Peyer came from forensic experts. For example, a rope found in Peyer's patrol car was a close match to the rope marks around Cara’s neck. Unfortunately, in that case, Superior Court Judge Richard Huffman excluded the expert evidence because the technique used to gather it was too new.\n\nHowever, some of the other evidence proved undeniable. There were distinctive fibres from a California Highway Patrol uniform found on Cara’s body, and most conclusively, a drop of blood found on Peyer’s police-issue boots matched Cara’s extremely rare type.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nInvestigators concluded that Peyer had executed a traffic stop on Cara’s car, and directed her to pull off the freeway on an isolated, unfinished off-ramp. While in other cases his victims had shrugged off Peyer’s creepy approaches, Cara is believed to have threatened to report Peyer to his superiors.\n\nView 4 Images Cara's killer, Craig Alan Peyer was a thirteen-year veteran of the California Highway Patrol (Image: IMDB)\n\nWhen the altercation became physical, Cara raked her nails on the rogue cop’s face – causing scratches that were still plainly visible in the TV broadcast days later. In response Peyer clubbed her over the head repeatedly with his heavy flashlight before strangling her to death with a length of rope.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe killer then threw Cara’s body over the edge of the Los Peñasquitos Creek Arch Bridge, where she fell into the brush below.\n\nAfter a complex trial that nearly saw him acquitted, Peyer was sentenced on August 4, 1988, to 25 years to life in prison. His next eligibility for a parole hearing is set for January 2027, when he will be almost 77 years old."

The youngest daughter of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor co-founded the organisation with childhood friend Julia de Boinville in 2017 to focus on helping to end modern slavery.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEugenie, 35, has often posted about the charity on her personal Instagram page and took part in a podcast series about the issue with guests such as former Prime Minister Theresa May. While just two years ago, the organisation held a glamorous fund-raising event, where guests included Eugenie's mother and sister, Sarah Ferguson and Princess Beatrice, as well as her cousin Zara Tindall.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n5 View 5 Images Eugenie with her mother and sister at the Anti Slavery Collective's gala in 2023 (Image: Dave Benett/Getty Images for The) 5 View 5 Images Eugenie with Zara Tindall at the gala (Image: Dave Benett/Getty Images for The)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAt the end of last month, the latest batch of files relating to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein were released in the US, in which Eugenie was named.\n\nThey appeared to show that she, her mother and sister visited Epstein, who trafficked young women, just days after his release from jail, when Eugenie was 19. While emails hinted she had been asked to give tours of Buckingham Palace to Epstein contacts. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Ferguson or her daughters.\n\nSince this emerged, Eugenie's charity has been quiet, not posting on Instagram since January 20 - just days before the files were released - despite posting regularly before this.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Times reported that it has received no response from the organisation in recent weeks despite contacting it multiple times. Meanwhile, the charity's chief executive last posted on LinkedIn about the organisation's fake fashion campaign on January 25 - again days before the Epstein files dropped.\n\nView 5 Images Other guests at the gala included Ed Sheeran (Image: Dave Benett/Getty Images for The)\n\nRoyal expert Jennie Bond previously told the Mirror : “For Eugenie, things are even more complicated because she is such an ardent campaigner against slavery. And yet her father has been involved with a man who trafficked sex slaves – and Andrew has not apologised to those women. I imagine she feels her own integrity is at stake.” It comes after Eugenie was seen for the first time since the arrest of her father, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe mum-of-two was seen dressed down buying coffee with her husband Jack Brooksbank in London's affluent Notting Hill. It is believed she had been on a Swiss skiing holiday when her father was arrested but new images showing her out and about with her husband show she has now come back to the UK.\n\nView 5 Images Andrew with his daughters Eugenie and Beatrice (Image: UK Press via Getty Images)\n\nIn the hours before her father's arrest last Thursday, Eugenie is claimed to have been seen enjoying a half-term trip in the Swiss resort of Gstaad, alongside her husband Jack Brooksbank, their children August, five, and Ernest, who turns three in May, and a group of friends. The children's nanny also joined the family for their snowy getaway.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAs well as enjoying time on the ski runs, the group stopped for a low-key lunch at Restaurant Waldmatte. A fellow diner at the restaurant told Hello! Magazine: \"Eugenie and Jack were with the children, the nanny and a group of friends. They were tucked away in a corner and casually dressed in ski gear and jackets, and Jack was wearing a beanie hat as they both browsed the menu.\"\n\nThey added: \"I was surprised to see her because I thought she would be keeping a low-profile in light of everything that has been going on.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nIt comes after a royal source claimed that both Eugenie and her older sister Princess Beatrice are “in a state” over their father’s arrest. The princesses have not commented publicly on his arrest and the ongoing allegations from the Epstein files - but privately are said to be trying their hardest \"to put a brave face on it\"."

Yet, not everyone is on the energy price cap, and those who are can still make savings - here's what you should know.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTaking to Instagram on February 25, a British Gas expert said: \"The price cap has changed today. What does that mean for me? From April 1, your bills could change. The price cap determines the maximum amount that we can charge per unit of energy that you use.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n\"If you're on a standard variable rate, your rates are going down. To make things simple, I put the average savings on screen. If you're on a standard variable tariff, you could still save more money by switching to a fixed price tariff. You can easily go into your account and switch tariffs.\n\n\"You can do this online, you can do it in the app, or you can call us. We'll just be able to tell you exactly what tariff you're on now and whether you'd be able to save by switching to another tariff.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAlthough Ofgem has provided a general estimate of what 'typical' households might expect to pay, the precise amount depends on factors such as your location, meter type, and chosen payment method.\n\nBiomedical expert explains if diet can ward off colds, flu and illness READ MORE :\n\nThe changes won't apply to everyone either, but they generally cover those on a default tariff who pay for their electricity and gas through standard credit, Direct Debit, prepayment meter, or Economy 7 meter.\n\nCommenting on the changes earlier this week, Tim Jarvis, Director General, Markets, at Ofgem, also said: \"Today’s announcement will be welcome news for many households. Wholesale energy prices have fallen in recent months, and we’re investing in our network to safeguard the future energy system. The main driver of today’s reduction is the change to policy costs announced by the Chancellor in the budget.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Our focus at Ofgem remains on bearing down on the costs within our control, and unlocking the investment needed to support the transition to a more stable energy system over the longer term.\n\nView 2 Images An expert at British Gas shared their thoughts on the price cap on Instagram this week (stock image) (Image: Peter Dazeley, Getty Images)\n\n\"We’re also seeing encouraging signs of greater engagement and competition, with switching increasing by almost 20% year on year. More households are choosing time‑of‑use tariffs that offer cheaper off‑peak rates, and suppliers are offering a wider range of products, including deals with savings at evenings or weekends.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"The price cap protects households from overpaying for energy, but it’s a safety net. Last year, consumers on fixed deals paid around £115 less than the cap on average, so we’d encourage people to speak to their supplier about the options available and consider whether a different tariff or payment method could help bring their bills down further.\"\n\nThe UK Government also previously announced, in the Autumn Budget, its commitment to reduce energy bills by around £150 on average from April, in response to cost-of-living pressures.\n\nThe statement, released in November, reads: \"Families across the UK are feeling the squeeze of still too high inflation. The Budget delivers a set of measures to remove around £150 of costs on average from household energy bills from April next year.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"Energy costs will be reduced by the ending of the Energy Company Obligation, which is currently funded through bills, and through the government funding 75 per cent of the domestic cost of the legacy Renewables Obligation for three years. This is on top of extending the £150 Warm Home Discount to a further three million of the poorest households.\"\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

            "content": "A murderer who left his partner to die with more than 100 injuries after feeding her vodka and ice lollies while trapped in his house has been jailed.\n\nTony Devenport, 57, was handed a life sentence and ordered to serve a minimum term of 22 years after Chester Crown Court heard that 41-year-old Stephanie Blundell had extensive bruising across her face and body.\n\nMs Blundell was found dead lying on a mattress by her father Philip Blundell last July at the home she shared with Devenport in Canal Street, Chester.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Passing sentence on Devenport on Friday, Mrs Justice Steyn told the defendant he had murdered his “compassionate, kind-hearted and courageous” partner of two years.\n\nThe judge said: “Stephanie Blundell died on the morning of July 20 2025 as a result of fierce, repeated and sustained assaults inflicted by you over the preceding day or two.\n\n\"Her father had the most terrible experience a parent can face of visiting her shortly after midday on that Sunday, only to discover that his beloved daughter lay dead, with the marks of the severe beatings you had meted out abundantly clear.”\n\nThe judge added: “She always saw the good in people, including you, never giving up on them. She had an enormous capacity to love and a bright smile that could light up a room.”\n\nMs Blundell’s father told the court in an impact statement that discovering his daughter will “stay with me for the rest of my life”. He added: “The thought that she died alone in pain with nobody to comfort her haunts me every day.”\n\nThe court heard when Devenport met Ms Blundell, she had been suffering with an alcohol addiction for years, but the couple had been in a period of sobriety until they took a trip to Slovakia in May last year when they started to drink “heavily”.\n\nDevenport was controlling and coercive towards Ms Blundell, and although they had lived together for nearly two years, she did not have a key to their house and he kept her bank card in his wallet, the court heard.\n\n“When intoxicated, you were abusive, aggressive and violent towards her on occasions prior to her death”, the judge said. Devenport was arrested on suspicion of assaulting Ms Blundell 10 days before she died but breached his bail conditions “within minutes” by calling her phone and she “never left” his house again after he called a taxi to pick her up.\n\nBetween July 10 and 20, Ms Blundell had “no means of contacting anyone” and was bed-bound, while Devenport bought more than 12 litres of vodka and 72 cans of beer. The judge said that evidence showed Devenport strangled Ms Blundell twice in the day or two before her death and beat her causing significant injuries to her brain.\n\nMrs Justice Steyn said Ms Blundell, who had acute pancreatitis and alcoholic ketoacidosis, was “bound to be pleading with you for help” in the days before her death, but he only gave her alcohol and ice lollies. She told the defendant: “As a result of your actions, Stephanie would have been in pain and fear and you kept her there, offering little but vodka.”\n\nShe died from multiple injuries inflicted upon her, exacerbated by the effects of chronic alcoholism, a post-mortem examination found. In a statement released after the sentencing, Ms Blundell’s family said: “Steph was, without question, one of the most radiant souls you could ever hope to meet.\n\n“She was kind-hearted, quick-witted and effortlessly stylish. Her warmth and compassion have been evident throughout this trial and that brings us some comfort that her true loving nature has been seen by so many.”\n\nDetective Inspector Andrea Price, from Cheshire Constabulary’s Major Investigation Team, said: “Stephanie was loved and cherished amongst family and friends, and although today marks the day her killer is brought to justice, I want Stephanie to be the one who we remember.\n\n“While no sentence can ever bring Stephanie back, I hope today’s result provides her loved ones with some comfort in knowing that Devenport has now been held accountable for what he has done.”"

Canada, we own you little bro.\"\n\nTkachuk is captain of the Ottawa Senators and after playing in the Canadian team's first NHL game since the Olympics, he said: \"Well, it's clearly fake, because it's not my voice, not my lips moving.\n\n\"I'm not in control of any of those accounts,\" he added. \"I know that those words would never come out of my mouth, so I can't do anything about it.\n\n\"It's not what I was saying. I would never say that. It's not who I am. So I guess I don't like that video.\"\n\nThe White House has been contacted for a response.\n\nSeveral of Tkachuk's team-mates have also apologised for laughing during a congratulatory call from Donald Trump, when the US president said he \"probably would be impeached\" if he did not invite the gold-winning women's team as well as the men to his State of the Union address .\n\nWhile the women's captain Hilary Knight said Trump's joke was \"distasteful\", she added that \"the guys were in a tough spot\" and there was a \"genuine level of support and respect\" between the two US teams.\n\nTkachuk's brother Matthew Tkachuk, who plays for the Florida Panthers, said the teams were \"so close\" at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\n\"We watched other events together, we went and supported,\" he said. \"We love the women's team and the women's team loved us, and we're so proud that we had a clean sweep of gold medals.\"\n\nUS team-mate Jake Sanderson said the laughter had been \"a bit of a mistake\" that \"got blown out of proportion a little bit\", while reserve goaltender Jeremy Swayman said \"we should've reacted differently\" and Charlie McAvoy added it was \"not reflective of how we feel\"."

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

            "content": "Frank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure.

Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "Opta supercomputer reveals the favourite to win the Champions League - as one Premier League club has a slim ONE per cent chance of glory after knock-out stage draw\n\nThe Opta supercomputer has confirmed that Arsenal remain the favourites to claim their maiden Champions League trophy after the final draw for the knockout stages of the competition took place on Friday morning.\n\nMikel Arteta's side - who are still Premier League frontrunners after navigating a challenging winter spell - are in contention for an unprecedented quadruple this season after a run of consecutive near-misses in recent years.\n\nWhile chasing the league remains a priority for many Gunners fans after successive second-place finishes, the chance to gain major European silverware for the first time is a tempting motivation for the squad as they enter the business end of the season.\n\nAnd following Friday's draw, chances of making the final in Budapest appear to have only intensified, after the north London team were drawn against Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nShould they progress, their Blue pathway would see them then meet either Bodo/Glimt or Sporting Lisbon in the quarter-finals.\n\nTheir semi-final opponent could be one of the winners of either Newcastle versus Barcelona, or Atletico Madrid's meeting with Tottenham.\n\nArsenal remain on-track to break new ground at Europe's top table at the end of the season\n\nConveniently, the last 10 winners of the Champions League - Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid - are on the other 'Silver' pathway.\n\nDespite being drawn amongst a pack with a stronger European pedigree however, Bayern Munich are the closest contenders to spoil Arsenal's path, with Opta grading their 14.28 per cent chance of lifting the trophy second to the Gunners' 27.40 per cent chance.\n\nFans of the English game will be pleased to note that four of the top six clubs with the highest chance of claiming glory in Hungary are from the Premier League with Liverpool and Manchester City - who play Galatasaray and Real Madrid in the round of 16 respectively - the third and fourth-likeliest to win the Champions League.\n\nCHAMPION LEAGUE PREDICTIONS Arsenal - 27.40 per cent chance Bayern Munich - 14.28 per cent chance Liverpool - 12.83 per cent chance Man City - 10.79 per cent chance Barcelona - 7.72 per cent chance Chelsea - 6.86 per cent chance Newcastle - 4.66 per cent chance Paris Saint-Germain - 4.64 per cent chance Real Madrid - 2.78 per cent chance Sporting Lisbon - 2.73 per cent chance Atletico Madrid - 2.00 per cent chance Tottenham - 1.22 per cent chance\n\nLiverpool, who would then play the winner of Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, have a 12.83 per cent chance, narrowly edging Man City, who have a 10.79 per cent chance.\n\nChelsea round out the cohort, with a significantly smaller 6.86 per cent chance, but the Blues will be confident heading into their match-up with the title-holders having beaten them roundly in the Club World Cup final last July.\n\nNewcastle just miss out on making the top six with their 4.66 per cent chance of winning the trophy, having navigated their way through a one-sided play-off match-up with Azerbaijan side Qarabag.\n\nThe remaining Premier League team still in play in Europe's top club competition, Tottenham, have a slender 1.22 per cent chance.\n\nIgor Tudor's injury-ravaged squad will likely throw full focus onto avoiding relegation one season on from winning the Europa League, with Atletico - who have a 2.00 per cent chance of winning the trophy - the favourites to make it into the quarter-finals.\n\nArsenal romped through the league phase to finish top of the table in the new-look model, with Liverpool, Man City, and Chelsea also qualifying automatically.\n\n\n\nOf the favourites for the title, only PSG were forced to endure a more arduous route to the round of 16, sneaking a win over two legs against Ligue 1 rivals Monaco 5-4 on aggregate."

It is understood that he moved forwards into the shaft without realising the car wasn't there.\n\nPavan is said to have sustained multiple injuries, revealing on Friday that he has had shoulder and back surgery, and a former coach has said he feels 'lucky to be alive.'\n\n'I would like to say a big thank you for all the kind words and wishes I have received over the last 48 hours,' Pavan said in a statement released by the DP World Tour. 'I had surgery on my shoulder and my back on Wednesday evening and I am currently recovering in hospital.\n\n'I now have a lot of rehab and hard work ahead of me, but the care I have received so far from the Mediclinic hospital staff has been incredible, as has the support from the DP World Tour, the Sunshine Tour and all their staff here in Stellenbosch.

            "content": "Barcelona Champions League winner explains heartbreaking reasons behind him working in a clothes store - after shocking fans with drastic life change\n\nFormer Barcelona defender Jeremy Mathieu has explained the painful reasons behind him working in a French sport shop just six years after retiring.\n\nThe 42-year-old was once one of his country's finest centre-backs and helped the Catalan club to two LaLiga titles, two Spanish Cups and European glory during a successful career.\n\nBut Mathieu's life is drastically different now to the one he lived as a top footballer.\n\nLast year, fans were shocked to see him working at Intersport, a major chain of sport shops in his homeland, as a manager in their football department in a branch between Aix-en-Provence and Marseille.\n\nA photograph of the ex-Barcelona defender wearing company uniform and pictured with customers was shared online, prompting hordes of fans to visit the shop to see him.\n\nMathieu reportedly earned £100,000-a-week at Barcelona, so it was a surprise to see him working a normal job after hanging up his boots.\n\nFormer Barcelona defender Jeremy Mathieu (centre) now works as a shop assistant in France\n\nBut he has now spoken to beIN Sports about how he has struggled in his life after football, alluding to financial difficulties and admitting his mental health deteriorated.\n\nMathieu said: 'If I'm working at Intersport, it's because something's going on that's causing me a lot of problems.\n\n'I can only say that I'm in the middle of a lawsuit. I will not do it forever. It was to have a social life.'\n\nThe Frenchman has also been battling depression and said it is something he has not 'fully' recovered from.\n\nA former team-mate of Mathieu, Loïc Loval-Landré, was able to help him find the job to get him out of the house and in a social environment.\n\nMathieu revealed: 'He knew I wanted to leave the house for a bit, I had been doing nothing for a while. We were chatting, and he told me there was a vacant position.'\n\nHe called time on his career after a nasty knee injury while playing for Sporting Lisbon at the age of 36 in 2020.\n\nMathieu came off the bench during Barcelona's Champions League final triumph against Juventus in 2015, helping his side to a 3-1 victory which confirmed an iconic Treble under former manager Luis Enrique.\n\nMathieu, pictured with Luis Suarez, also won two LaLiga titles during his three years at Barca\n\nAlthough he was primarily used as back-up for first team centre-halves Javier Mascherano and Gerard Pique, the Frenchman's versatility and experience was valued hugely by Enrique, who often used him as cover for Jordi Alba at left-back too.\n\nWhen asked about his time at the club, he reflected that his abiding memory was of Lionel Messi's genius.\n\n'Messi was incredible. In training, you couldn’t do anything. I think I was a better free-kick taker,' he added with a smile.\n\n\n\nDespite winning the majority of his honours at Barcelona, Mathieu played much of his career at fellow LaLiga outfit Valencia — where he made 177 appearances in all competitions."

He quickly dropped to the ice as teammate Dylan Cozens dropped gloves with Edvinsson.\n\nBoth players were sent to the box, as was Tkachuk, who got a 10-minute misconduct after trying to confront Edvinsson.\n\nTkachuk and Edvinsson continued chirping at each other from their respective penalty boxes as they both gestured to the replay being played on the scoreboard.\n\nDetroit ultimately won in overtime on a goal from Tkachuk's Team USA teammate, Dylan Larkin.\n\nSimon Edvinsson catches Brady Tkachuk with an interference and Brady's own stick hits him in the face in the process 🫣\n\n\n\nDylan Cozens came to the defence of his captain to drop the mitts 👊 pic.twitter.com/7ifkNJcsiD — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) February 27, 2026\n\nFacing the visiting Detroit Red Wings in Canada's capital on Thursday, Tkachuk was on the receiving end of a brutal blindside hit from 6ft6 Swedish defenseman Simon Edvinsson\n\nHead athletic therapist Domenic Nicoletta of the Ottawa Senators assists Brady Tkachuk\n\nSimon Edvinsson of the Detroit Red Wings fights Dylan Cozens after the hit on Tkachuk\n\nSenators spokespeople did not respond to the Daily Mail's request for an update on Tkachuk.\n\nThursday's loss came after Tkachuk criticized the White House over an AI social media video.\n\nAfter winning gold against the rival Canadians, Tkachuk and 19 other members of Team USA visited Trump at the White House before watching State of the Union speech on Tuesday night.\n\nBut since then, the White House released a misleading AI clip on TikTok in which Tkachuk appeared to criticize Canadians.\n\n'They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple-syrup-eating f***s a lesson,' Tkachuk said in the altered clip which had more than 11 million views on TikTok.\n\nTkachuk responded to the clip ahead of Thursday's game.\n\n'Well, it's clearly fake, because it's not my voice, not my lips moving,' Tkachuk said Thursday. 'I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. So, I can't do anything about it.'\n\nUSA hockey star Brady Tkachuk has fumed over an AI-edited video posted by the White House\n\nWhen asked if he enjoyed the video, he added: 'It's not my voice. It's not what I was saying.\n\n'I would never say that. That's not who I am, so I guess I don't like that video because that would never come out of my mouth and never had that thought.'\n\nTrump also sparked controversy after footage of his phone call with the victorious men's team surfaced on social media.\n\nWhile congratulating them on winning gold, the President joked that he was also 'going to have to bring the women's team' to Washington after they also beat Canada in the final.\n\nTrump then added that he 'probably would be impeached' if he didn't extend the invitation to America's female hockey champions.\n\nThe women's team subsequently turned down Trump's invitation due to 'scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games.'\n\nAnd Tkachuk said he understood why they could have felt insulted by his locker-room joke, which some have labeled misogynistic.\n\n'I mean, I get it,' he said before detailing the positive relationship between the men's and women's teams. 'We support them, they support us. You can't control what other people say. It was fun being around them, seeing how they play and the excellence around them.\n\n'If I see one of them, we'll talk about the excitement of what we can control, which is to be gold medalists.'\n\nTkachuk was also accused by some of shouting 'Close the northern border!' during the congratulatory call with Trump, but he stressed: 'It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.'\n\nDuring his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Trump announced that the USA women's team will still be visiting the White House at a later date despite rejecting his first invitation.\n\n'They beat a fantastic Canadian team in overtime, as everybody saw. As did the American women who will soon be coming to the White House,' he told Congress."

It won't be Tottenham.\n\nArsenal could be lifting the Champions League at the end of the season after their dream draw\n\nBodo/Glimt have beaten Manchester City on their own patch and knocked out last season's finalists Inter Milan over two legs. But excitement should be through the roof in London Colney this morning.\n\nThe snap reaction to the draw made for fascinating viewing across the continent.\n\nThere was a sense of devilment in France after PSG drew Chelsea, who they lost to in the Club World Cup final over the summer, with daily sports newspaper L'Equipe running the headline: 'The time for revenge'.\n\nAcross in Spain, with three teams all drawn against English opposition, the reaction was markedly mixed.\n\nFrustration in one half of Madrid as Real Madrid, for the 10th and 11th time in five seasons, take on Manchester City in a 'scalding' draw. On the other side of the City, Atletico Madrid supporters rejoiced at getting a visit from 'Dr Tottenham'.\n\nFor Barcelona, who drew Newcastle United, it was little more than a shrug of the shoulders for what they see as the 'least tough' draw.\n\nIvan Rakitic pulls out Arsenal's name on the ideal side of the draw for Mikel Arteta's men\n\nWhat this draw did do was pave a path for the Ballon d'Or contenders and in a season where Champions League and the World Cup will hold the most weight - domestic records never seem to interest voters in these cycles - the stars are aligning for the likes of Declan Rice and Harry Kane.\n\nFor Kane, he has the difficult path, needing to go through Atalanta, then either Real Madrid or Manchester City, just to book a semi-final with potentially defending champions PSG.\n\nFor Rice, this may be his greatest ever opportunity with a Premier League title, Champions League title, and a World Cup all still in his sights.\n\nFor both to meet in the final in Budapest, with all the marbles pushed to the middle of the table as they both chase their first ever Champions League title, may have seemed a somewhat remote prospect. Not any more. The stars have aligned.\n\nNATHAN'S UCL PREDICTION\n\nLast-16:\n\nPSG v Chelsea - PSG win\n\nGalatasaray v Liverpool - Liverpool win\n\nReal Madrid v Man City - Man City win\n\nAtalanta v Bayern Munich - Bayern Munich win\n\nNewcastle Utd v Barcelona - Barcelona win\n\nAtletico Madrid v Tottenham Hotspur - Atletico Madrid win\n\nBodo/Glimt v Sporting Lisbon - Bodo/Glimt win\n\nBayer Leverkusen v Arsenal - Arsenal win\n\nQuarter-finals:\n\nPSG v Liverpool - PSG win\n\nMan City v Bayern Munich - Bayern Munich win\n\nBarcelona v Atletico Madrid - Atletico Madrid win\n\nBodo/Glimt v Arsenal - Arsenal win\n\nSemi-finals:\n\nPSG v Bayern Munich - Bayern Munich win\n\nAtletico Madrid v Arsenal - Arsenal win\n\nFinal:\n\nBayern Munich v Arsenal - Bayern Munich win"

            "content": "As they climbed the metal staircase behind the Main Stand at Kenilworth Road, a Luton supporter’s spectacles slipped from the top of her head and clanged against the steel.\n\n‘Excuse me, you dropped your glasses,’ said the gentleman behind her, who stooped to collect and return them. ‘Could have done you a favour,’ he added with a grin. ‘You don’t want to watch this, clearly.’\n\nI shuffled up the steps beside them to join 3,500 Luton fans for their EFL Trophy quarter-final against Plymouth on Tuesday to get a feeling for the fan frustration that, just three days earlier, led to manager Jack Wilshere being restrained by his own players amid a furious confrontation with a supporter.\n\nOn Saturday, two years to the day since Luton led at Anfield in the Premier League, they conceded a stoppage-time equaliser to struggling Burton Albion that left the Hatters six points adrift of the League One play-offs and a toxic divide between the club and its fans reached boiling point.\n\nAs the team made their way towards the tunnel, with boos and foul language ringing in their ears, Wilshere first held back his own captain Kal Naismith before turning towards a fan at the front of the stand. Videos later plastered over social media showed Wilshere appearing to say ‘shut your f***ing mouth’ before being led away down the tunnel.\n\nMultiple witnesses have told Daily Mail Sport that the fan directed personal abuse at Wilshere. One source described it as ‘unrepeatable, vicious and obscene’ while another called it ‘something you would never say in the street’. At least one member of club staff took it upon themselves to call Wilshere early the next morning to check in on him.\n\nLuton Town manager Jack Wilshere had to be restrained by his own players amid a furious confrontation with a supporter\n\nMultiple witnesses have told Daily Mail Sport that the fan directed personal abuse at Wilshere. One source described it as ‘unrepeatable, vicious and obscene’\n\nYou know things have gone wrong somewhere when a fan is throwing abuse at a young coach who started his playing career at Luton aged eight, grew up a few miles down the road, and returned to train with the club before hanging up his boots.\n\nSo, why such anger? Luton are unbeaten in 11 home league games and, if they win their game in hand on Huddersfield, would be three points off the play-offs. Their victory over Plymouth, having been reinstated into the competition after Swindon Town fielded two ineligible players against them, has them a home win against Northampton Town next week from Wembley.\n\nFor a start, supporters are struggling to embrace Wilshere’s style of play. The Arsene Wenger disciple wants his team to get it down and pass it, as his Arsenal Under 18s did to great effect, but this is a club that reached its heights on fast-paced blood and thunder under Rob Edwards.\n\nJust 97 seconds had passed against Burton when midfielder George Saville passed back to centre half Mads Andersen and the first boos sounded. And on Tuesday as Luton fumbled at the back under pressure from Plymouth’s front line, a furious cry of ‘Get it out! It’s tippy-tappy AGAIN!’ echoed from the back of the Main Stand.\n\nWilshere has talked about forging an identity, and a desire not to 'pass the ball around the back just to pass it around the back’, but six away defeats on the spin and unsuccessfully sitting on their narrow lead against Burton pushed them to tipping point.\n\n‘My message to them is point their anger towards me,’ said Wilshere after a loss to Wigan in the previous game. ‘I'm their manager, I make the decisions.’ So, they did.\n\nClub sources insist Saturday’s incident was a one-off. Wilshere has been happy to speak with fans after games about their frustrations, as he did after a draw at Leyton Orient, but on this occasion felt he had no choice but to react to personal abuse.\n\nLuton’s issues lie much deeper than Wilshere. He’s the third manager in less than a year for a club that has suffered back-to-back relegations, the second of which came on the final day of last season when they shipped five to West Brom and went down on goal difference.\n\nLuton’s issues lie much deeper than Wilshere. He’s the third manager in less than a year for a club that has suffered back-to-back relegations\n\nLuton are unbeaten in 11 home league games and, if they win their game in hand, would be three points off the play-offs\n\nLEAGUE ONE PLAY-OFF RACE Team Pl W D L GD Pts 1 Cardiff 33 21 6 6 28 69 2 Lincoln 33 20 8 5 28 68 3 Bolton 34 15 13 6 12 58 4 Bradford 33 17 7 9 6 58 5 Stockport 33 16 8 9 5 56 6 Huddersfield 34 15 7 12 10 52 7 Reading 33 12 12 9 5 48 8 Stevenage 32 13 9 10 1 48 9 Wycombe 33 12 11 10 10 47 10 LUTON 33 13 7 13 2 46\n\n‘In many ways, Jack is just caught in the crossfire of it all,’ Kevin Harper of the Luton Supporters' Trust tells Daily Mail Sport.\n\n‘Some of his decision-making has been questionable and some of the football we’ve played has been hard to watch. But Jack isn’t the root of the problem.\n\n‘We’ve gone from the Premier League to 10th in League One in 18 months and there is an awful lack of communication from those above as to why this happened.\n\n'We don’t get relegated twice without making errors, certainly not with the financial windfalls from the Premier League. The fans just feel like they’re being taken a little for granted.’\n\nChief executive Gary Sweet insisted in September after a poor start under Matt Bloomfield that reaching the play-offs was the ‘absolute minimum’ and automatic promotion still the target... yet hired a young, inexperienced coach a month later in Wilshere.\n\nThey considered Leyton Orient boss Richie Wellens, a more experienced manager, but plumped for Wilshere after being impressed with his ‘energy’, ‘ambition’ and ‘passion’ across four interviews.\n\nSo, while Wilshere’s project clearly needs time, the club is telling fans to demand instant results in another breath. And when you’re at a club that has gone from non-League to the very top and back down again so quickly, it can be hard to readjust your expectations when faced with the reality.\n\nClub insiders talk of a much-needed culture change. One source described Luton as an ‘oil tanker’ that needs turning around. There’s been a huge overhaul of players, so much so that five of the 12 players on the club’s 2026 calendar are now out on loan, but too many of the arrivals failed to hit the ground running.\n\nLuton considered more experienced managers but plumped for Wilshere after being impressed with his ‘energy’, ‘ambition’ and ‘passion’ across four interviews\n\nWhile Wilshere’s project clearly needs time, the club is telling fans to demand instant results in another breath\n\nAnother source remarked that the squad was previously full of players who thought they were ‘too good for the Championship after a half-decent Premier League season’.\n\nLuton are set to move into a new 25,000 stadium at Power Court for the 2028-29 season yet there’s feeling among the fans that the club have prioritised that much-needed development over the football (despite having the biggest budget in League One).\n\nBehind the scenes, Wilshere has made a start on turning the tanker around. Insiders say the atmosphere at the training ground has improved greatly since his arrival, with players sticking around to play pool and darts after sessions when in recent years they couldn’t wait to get out the door.\n\nWhen staff called Wilshere the morning after his confrontation, he was already at the training ground. He slept some nights on a bed in his office. His players’ phones ping late into the night with his WhatsApp messages. Staff have asked Wilshere, half-jokingly, if he was seeing his family enough.\n\nHe's ordered striker Elijah Adebayo, out with a long-term knee injury, to report to his office once a week as Wilshere knows only too well the importance of being kept involved when you’re on the sidelines. The night after the Plymouth game, he gave a lecture at the University of Bedfordshire.\n\nAll of this means little to fans, of course, if that work ethic still leads to performances like Burton.\n\n‘Luton see the football team very much as part of the town,’ adds Harper. ‘We’re a hard-working town and all we expect on a Saturday afternoon is that our team works really hard. In the last three league games, that wasn’t the case.’\n\nWilshere’s tenure has already shown how quickly things can change. He lost his first game to Mansfield Town but then won four on the spin, including a victory at then-leaders Stockport County when the fans sang his name.\n\nThere’s feeling among the fans that the club have prioritised the new 25,000-seat stadium project at Power Court over the football\n\nWilshere lost his first game to Mansfield Town but then won four on the spin, including victory at leaders Stockport County when the fans sang his name\n\nThey cheered the team off after a brilliant home win against Bradford this month, their best performance of the season, before their recent ugly run.\n\nBy the end of Tuesday night, the mood had lifted a touch again. A more dominant, attacking performance over Plymouth, albeit one requiring a late Jordan Clark penalty to win it after a calamitous error while, you guessed it, playing out from the back gifted the visitors an equaliser.\n\nThe last 18 months have hurt the bond between club and fanbase and now, at the heart of it, is a young coach trying to stitch it back together his way.\n\nWilshere once asked Mikel Arteta when he knew he was ready to take his first job in management. Arteta replied: ‘You just have to jump in and swim as hard as you can.’"

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nWe're still a few days away from NFL free agency, but teams are already thinking about which new players they want to add to their rosters. The franchise tag deadline comes on March 3, and free agency begins on March 11, although the negotiation window opens two days earlier. Not every team will make a lot of moves, but every roster usually picks up at least one important veteran. Who represents the best match for each of the 32 teams?\n\nBelow, I've suggested one free agent signing for each team. I set myself a couple of rules for this exercise: only one free agent for each team, and only one team for each free agent. I also didn't assign any player to return to his current team, even on the franchise tag. For example, I didn't include quarterback Daniel Jones (expected to be re-signed by the Colts).\n\nAt the end, I've also included a list of additional free agents, as certainly some of these teams will sign multiple big-name free agents. Let's get started with the Bills.\n\nJump to:\n\nARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN\n\nCLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND\n\nJAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN\n\nNE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF\n\nSEA | TB | TEN | WSH\n\nTop remaining free agents\n\nAFC EAST\n\nWR Mike Evans (TB)\n\nBuffalo needs a No. 1 option for quarterback Josh Allen, and Evans is still a talented \"X\" receiver. He has the size -- standing at 6-foot-5, 231 pounds -- and ball skills to win contested catches. Allen could also trust Evans on third down; in 2024, he had a team-high 220 yards on third down for the Bucs.\n\nThere are doubts about Evans, however, since he will be turning 33 in August and missed 10 games in 2025 due to a broken collarbone and a hamstring injury. But he is only one year removed from a 1,000-yard season with 11 touchdowns.\n\nTE Isaiah Likely (BAL)\n\nThe Dolphins' top three tight ends from last season are all free agents (Greg Dulcich, Darren Waller and Julian Hill), and they could use an upgrade at the position anyway. Waller had six touchdowns in his return from retirement, but he played only nine games due to hip and pectoral injuries.\n\nEnter Likely, who is ready to start as a No. 1 tight end after spending a few years as TE2 behind Mark Andrews in Baltimore. Last season was a bit of an off year for Likely, who had only one touchdown and dropped to 19th among tight ends in the ESPN receiver scores. But he ranked sixth in 2023 and third in 2024, with 400 yards in each of those seasons. He should be able to shine in a Miami offense that doesn't need to feed a lot of other receivers after it released Tyreek Hill and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine.\n\nEdge Jaelan Phillips (PHI)\n\nThe Patriots' two biggest needs this offseason are edge rusher and offensive line. On the O-line, they will likely depend on the development of young players like Will Campbell and Jared Wilson. But the edge is a good place to bring in a veteran.\n\nPhillips had two sacks and 27 pressures after he was traded to the Eagles from Miami at midseason. His 12.4% pass rush win rate ranked 24th among qualifying edge rushers. Phillips could replace free agent K'Lavon Chaisson and/or make a good partner for Harold Landry III.\n\nQB Malik Willis (GB)\n\nYes, it was a small sample size with just one start and four total games played, but Willis had a phenomenal 93.1 QBR for the Packers in 2025. And he had an impressive 77.3 QBR in two starts the season before.\n\nWillis is going to sign somewhere to start, and the Jets need a new quarterback. Justin Fields didn't work out, and Fernando Mendoza seems to be the only QB prospect worthy of the first-round pick in April. It's unlikely Mendoza falls past Las Vegas at No. 1 overall.\n\nplay 1:21 The teams Ben Solak expects to be in on Malik Willis Ben Solak joins Rich Eisen to break down the interest he expects for free agent quarterback Malik Willis.\n\nAFC NORTH\n\nC Connor McGovern (BUF)\n\nThe Ravens are going to need a replacement at center if Tyler Linderbaum leaves town. Why not the underrated 28-year-old McGovern, who quietly had one of the top seasons for a center in 2025? His 97.2% pass block win rate last season matched Linderbaum for second place behind Kansas City's Creed Humphrey. And McGovern's 72.6% run block win rate ranked third among all centers.\n\nEdge Odafe Oweh (LAC)\n\nWith Trey Hendrickson probably on his way out of Cincinnati, the Bengals need an edge rusher. And with the seventh-most cap space this offseason (per Roster Management System), they're in position to rain money down on a player still in his prime.\n\nOweh finally broke out after the Ravens traded him to the Chargers last season, with 7.5 sacks in the final 12 games and two forced fumbles in Los Angeles' playoff loss to the Patriots. The only question with the 27-year-old is whether he'll be comfortable playing with his hand in the dirt in Cincinnati after a few years as an outside linebacker in 3-4 schemes.\n\nWR Rashid Shaheed (SEA)\n\nThere's more to the return game than just having a fast return man. The blocking matters. Still, the addition of Shaheed would be a big step forward for a Browns special teams unit that I had ranked 32nd on punt return value and 28th on kick return value through my special teams DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average) in 2025.\n\nShaheed would also be a strong downfield receiver for a unit that desperately needs improvement. Last season, starting for the Saints and then the reigning Super Bowl champions, he had seven games (including playoffs) with at least 50 receiving yards. No Browns receiver eclipsed Shaheed's 687 receiving yards in 2025.\n\nS Jaquan Brisker (CHI)\n\nLast season's safeties in Pittsburgh are free agents with the exception of DeShon Elliott and, if you want to consider him a safety, Jalen Ramsey. That's why the Steelers need to attack this packed safety free agent class.\n\nBrisker can play both deep or in the box, and he's a hard-hitting safety who will fit the Steelers' defensive personality. He missed 12 games in the 2024 season due to a concussion, but he had at least 90 combined tackles in each of his three healthy NFL seasons. Over his career, Brisker has recorded seven sacks, four interceptions and four forced fumbles.\n\nAFC SOUTH\n\nC Tyler Linderbaum (BAL)\n\nIncumbent Jake Andrews ranked last among qualifying centers with 92.4% pass block win rate, so this is a position where the Texans need to take a big swing. Bringing over Linderbaum, who ranked second at center with a 97.2% pass block win rate, would really help solidify the offense and keep the Texans as a Super Bowl contender in 2026.\n\nEdge Bradley Chubb (MIA)\n\nThe Colts ranked just 30th in pass rush win rate (29.1%) last season, and three of their top four pass rushers are hitting free agency. So, this is a good time to bring in a veteran. The Dolphins cut Chubb to clear money off their salary cap, but he is still just 30 years old. He had 8.5 sacks last season with 36 pressures.\n\nCB Riq Woolen (SEA)\n\nWide receiver/cornerback Travis Hunter is expected to be back at the start of 2026, but the Jaguars still need another CB starter on the outside if Montaric Brown and Greg Newsome II leave in free agency.\n\nWoolen has stirred some controversy in Seattle and was benched briefly a couple of times last season due to mistakes. But he still ranked 12th in the league in my coverage DVOA metric. He's also a larger (6-foot-4, 210 pounds), more physical corner who could cover receivers who might be too big for the slight-framed Hunter.\n\nBreaking news from Adam Schefter Download the ESPN app and enable Adam Schefter's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here.\n\nEdge K'Lavon Chaisson (NE)\n\nTennessee would have been the perfect landing spot for George Pickens, as it desperately needs a No. 1 option for quarterback Cam Ward. But since Pickens is expected to be franchise-tagged by the Cowboys, let's further strengthen the Titans' pass rush with Chaisson.\n\nTennessee was ranked a surprising 15th in pass rush win rate (37.3%) last season, but Arden Key and Jihad Ward are both free agents. Chaisson blossomed over the past two seasons with the Raiders and then the Patriots. In 2025, he had 7.5 sacks, 32 pressures and an above-average pass rush win rate of 12.9%. The Titans could put him on the strong side across from Oluwafemi Oladejo.\n\nAFC WEST\n\nTE Cade Otton (TB)\n\nTight end is a clear need for the Broncos, so why not sign a bigger name such as David Njoku? Because the Broncos already have a receiving-first tight end in Evan Engram, and they need a No. 1 tight end who is also a strong run blocker. That's Otton. He's also useful as a receiver when needed, with 1,172 receiving yards and five touchdowns over the past two seasons.\n\nRB Kenneth Walker III (SEA)\n\nThe Chiefs need not just a running back, but a running back who can also serve as a receiving outlet for Patrick Mahomes. Walker had more than 1,000 rushing yards last season and added 31 catches for 282 yards -- an impressive 9.1 yards per reception average.\n\nHis ability to generate explosive plays could be a valuable part of lifting the Chiefs' offense back to the top of the league.\n\nplay 2:05 Will Kenneth Walker III still be with the Seahawks next season? The \"Get Up\" crew debates whether the Seahawks should do all they can to keep Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker III.\n\nLB Quay Walker (GB)\n\nThe Raiders could use playmakers all across their defense, and both of last season's starting linebackers are free agents. Walker had 128 combined tackles with the Packers last season and has sideline-to-sideline speed to track down running backs. He can be used as a blitzer as well. The Raiders would just need to make sure their other linebacker is strong in coverage, as that's a weakness for Walker.\n\nG Isaac Seumalo (PIT)\n\nThe Chargers will get tackles Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt back next season, but they still need big help on the interior offensive line. Left guard Zion Johnson, now a free agent, was near the bottom of the league in pass block win rate (87.4%) last season. Center Bradley Bozeman also announced his retirement on Feb. 23.\n\nOn the other hand, the veteran Seumalo was second among 65 qualifying guards with a 97.3% pass rush win rate and fourth with a 76.9% run block win rate. This would be a huge step toward making the Chargers a serious Super Bowl contender.\n\nNFC EAST\n\nLB Devin Lloyd (JAX)\n\nThe Cowboys had one of the worst defenses in NFL history in 2025, according to my DVOA metric, and they are in desperate need of playmakers. So why not bring in Lloyd? He is a solid starting linebacker who had five interceptions and 1.5 sacks last season.\n\nCB Eric Stokes (LV)\n\nCornerbacks are a tough choice in free agency because they are so inconsistent from season to season. Stokes was one of the worst cornerbacks in the league in 2024, but he transformed into one of the league's best in 2025 with 53 total tackles and five passes defensed.\n\nIt's safe to say that we don't know what version of Stokes we'll see in 2026. But this is a clear position of need for the Giants, who ranked 17th in yards allowed per completion last season (10.9). They can take a chance that Stokes is closer to his 2025 play.\n\nEdge Boye Mafe (SEA)\n\nThe Eagles could use more help on the edge to rotate with Nolan Smith Jr. and Jalyx Hunt, and Mafe had an outstanding season for the Super Bowl champions in 2025.\n\nAlthough Mafe had only two sacks, he added 33 pressures. His 18.7% pass rush win rate was eighth among edge rushers and his 11.4% pressure rate was 17th. Mafe is quick and still in his prime, turning 28 in late November.\n\nEdge Trey Hendrickson (CIN)\n\nFor the No. 1 free agent, we're looking for three things. First, a team with a gaping hole at the edge rusher position. Second, a team with a lot of cap space. Third, a legitimate playoff contender.\n\nThe Commanders definitely hit that first qualifier, as three of their top four edges are free agents. They also hit the second qualifier with the sixth-most cap space, per Roster Management System. And you might not think of them as a legitimate playoff contender, but they are only one season removed from appearing in the NFC Championship Game.\n\nI think coach Dan Quinn will need to try his hardest to convince Hendrickson to come in and help improve the struggling Washington pass rush.\n\nNFC NORTH\n\nS Kam Curl (LAR)\n\nBoth Jaquan Brisker and Kevin Byard III are free agents, so even if one of them returns, the Bears will need help at the safety position. Curl can play either deep or in the box, depending on what Chicago needs and which of their veterans is re-signed in free agency.\n\nCurl recorded two interceptions and five passes defensed in 2025, and he was tied for fifth with 79 solo tackles.\n\nEdge Khalil Mack (LAC)\n\nThe Lions' top need is finding pass-rush help for Aidan Hutchinson. So why not aim for an established veteran at that position? Despite sitting out five games in 2025 because of an elbow injury, Mack still finished with 5.5 sacks and 28 pressures.\n\nDetroit isn't swimming in cap space, but it should be able to convince Mack to take a pay cut so he can chase a Super Bowl ring. Mack's former Chargers teammate Joey Bosa would also fit the bill if he doesn't return to Buffalo.\n\nLB Nakobe Dean (PHI)\n\nThe Packers are probably going to let linebacker Quay Walker leave after they declined his fifth-year option, which means they need an option to play next to Edgerrin Cooper. Dean is still only 25 years old and arguably stronger than Walker in pass coverage. Dean had four sacks, two forced fumbles and 55 total tackles last season.\n\nS Bryan Cook (KC)\n\nCook, a rangy safety, would be perfect playing deep in coordinator Brian Flores' zone schemes. Cook had a career-high 85 tackles in 2025 and is still only 27 years old. The Vikings were 30th in DVOA against deep passes (16 or more air yards), while the Chiefs were 15th. Cook would provide an immediate improvement in that area for Minnesota.\n\nNFC SOUTH\n\nDL John Franklin-Myers (DEN)\n\nThe Falcons are one of the teams that will need a 5-technique defensive end, with both David Onyemata and Kentavius Street hitting free agency. Franklin-Myers had a pass rush win rate of 10.1% last season, which ranked him eighth among interior defensive linemen. He also had 7.5 sacks and was strong against the run; his average run tackle came after a gain of just 1.6 yards.\n\nLB Kaden Elliss (ATL)\n\nThe Panthers could use another inside linebacker to play next to Trevin Wallace, and Elliss had over 100 tackles in each of the past three seasons. He also might be the best blitzing inside linebacker in the league right now, which would give defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero a very interesting option to juice up their pass rush.\n\nAs an added bonus, signing Elliss would take away from a division rival. Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich said that replacing Elliss would \"take more than one human being.\"\n\nWR Alec Pierce (IND)\n\nThe Saints ranked 31st in pass plays that gained at least 20 yards last season (5.6%). So let's give second-year quarterback Tyler Shough a great deep threat who would help their offense stretch the field.\n\nPierce had his first 1,000-yard season on only 47 catches, averaging 21.3 yards per reception. The season before, it was 22.3 yards per reception. That deep efficiency helped him rank fourth among all wide receivers in my DYAR (defense-adjusted yards above replacement) metric in 2025.\n\nplay 0:42 What is Alec Pierce's fantasy outlook for 2026? Matt Bowen breaks down the importance of Alec Pierce's free agency destination for his fantasy value next season.\n\nLB Alex Anzalone (DET)\n\nThe time might have finally come for 36-year-old Lavonte David to leave the Buccaneers, which opens a spot for a veteran in the middle of Tampa Bay's defense. Anzalone is strong against the run and had 2.5 sacks and eight passes defensed for Detroit last season.\n\nNFC WEST\n\nOT Braden Smith (IND)\n\nHere's the team with the biggest need for a right tackle, as both Jonah Williams and Kelvin Beachum were low in pass block win rate last season and are going to be free agents. Smith has been steady for the Colts, ranking 34th out of 68 qualifying players in pass block win rate last season (90.6%).\n\nCB Jaylen Watson (KC)\n\nThe Rams are going to have some changes in the secondary next season. Cornerbacks Cobie Durant and Ahkello Witherspoon are free agents, as is nickelback Roger McCreary, who barely played after he was picked up from Tennessee at midseason. Darious Williams is still on the roster but could use a change of scenery.\n\nWatson is a talented corner with the size (6-foot-2, 197 pounds) to press and the awareness to play zone coverage. He had a phenomenal coverage DVOA in six games in 2024, then was above average (40th out of 98 qualifying) in a full season in 2025.\n\nG Joel Bitonio (CLE)\n\nWould the 49ers be willing to put 34-year-old Bitonio next to 37-year-old Trent Williams (assuming the Niners and Williams can work out his contract situation) on the left side of their offensive line? There is an opening here, and a chance for Bitonio to finally go after a Super Bowl ring with a real contender.\n\nHe ranked third among all guards with a 96.4% pass block win rate last season, and his run block win rate of 72.3% was above average. Alijah Vera-Tucker would also be an interesting signing for the 49ers if they wanted to go younger at left guard instead.\n\nWR Jauan Jennings (SF)\n\nThis signing would achieve a couple of goals for the Seahawks. It would give them a receiver to replace Rashid Shaheed if he leaves in free agency. Furthermore, Jennings is a strong run blocker and the Seahawks still want to be a run-first offense.\n\nNew offensive coordinator Brian Fleury is familiar with Jennings from his time in San Francisco, and adding Jennings would bring the benefit of taking away from an important division rival. Jennings had nine touchdowns last season but was even better in 2024, when he ranked 12th in ESPN's receiver scores.\n\nTop remaining free agents not assigned to a team:"

(1:12)\n\nSchottenheimer expects Pickens to be a Cowboy for a 'long time to come' (1:12)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFRISCO, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys will do what has been expected on Friday, placing the franchise tag on wide receiver George Pickens to secure his rights at least through 2026, sources told ESPN.\n\nThe franchise tag guarantees Pickens around $28 million in 2026, but working out a long-term deal remains a possibility.\n\nThe Cowboys met with Pickens' representatives on Thursday at the NFL scouting combine. The talks were described as more general than in-depth.\n\nEarlier in the week, executive vice president Stephen Jones said the Cowboys were \"leaning\" toward using the tag on Pickens. Asked if Pickens could be a Cowboy for the long term on Thursday, coach Brian Schottenheimer said, \"I hope so.\"\n\nPickens' first season with the Cowboys could not have gone better.\n\nAcquired along with a 2027 sixth-round pick from the Pittsburgh Steelers for a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round selection, Pickens put up career highs in catches (93), yards (1,429) and touchdowns (nine) while playing every game, being named to the Pro Bowl for the first time and earning second-team All-Pro honors.\n\nPickens, 24, had five games with more than 100 yards receiving, including two that came when CeeDee Lamb was out of the lineup because of a high ankle sprain. Pickens set a franchise record with five games of at least 130 yards receiving and a touchdown catch.\n\nHis 13 catches of at least 25 yards and 73 first-down receptions ranked in the top five in the NFL.\n\nHe and Dak Prescott had an instant chemistry in their first season, much like Prescott developed with Lamb and former Pro Bowler Amari Cooper.\n\nKeeping Pickens on a long-term deal could be dicey.\n\nThe Cowboys signed Lamb to an extension in 2024 that pays him $34 million annually and included $100 million in guaranteed money. While the Cowboys could match or even exceed Lamb's numbers, they might be reluctant to do so for long-term cap issues and how they want to build their roster over the next few seasons.\n\nThey already have the highest-paid player, Prescott ($60 million), the highest-paid interior offensive lineman, Tyler Smith ($23.4 million), and the third-highest-paid receiver (Lamb). If they sign Pro Bowl kicker Brandon Aubrey, a restricted free agent, to an extension, he would likely be the highest paid at his position.\n\nAnd the Cowboys have work to do on a defense that allowed the most points in franchise history in 2025 (511).\n\nThe last player the Cowboys signed on a first-time franchise tag to a multiyear deal before the July 15 deadline was Dez Bryant in 2015. The Cowboys signed defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence (2019) and Prescott (2021) to extensions after they placed the tag on them the second time.\n\nThis is the 11th time the Cowboys have used the franchise tag, and Pickens is the eighth different player. Anthony Spencer, Lawrence and Prescott were tagged twice. Since 2020, the Cowboys have used the tag every year but 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe last two times they used the tag came in 2022 and 2023 on tight end Dalton Schultz and running back Tony Pollard, who ultimately left as free agents the following season.\n\nAdding further spice to contract negotiations is the history between the team and one of Pickens' agents, David Mulugheta, who also represents pass rusher Micah Parsons.\n\nLast year, Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he and Parsons reached an agreement on a deal that would have made Parsons the highest-paid defensive player in the NFL. When Mulugheta balked at the agreement, talks between the sides cooled and never really rekindled.\n\nParsons did not take part in the offseason program and went through a hold-in during training camp, attending meetings while in Oxnard, California, but he did not practice.\n\nA week before the 2025 season began, Parsons was traded to the Green Bay Packers for two first-round picks, and he signed a four-year, $188 million deal that included $120 million guaranteed.\n\nSpeaking on \"First Take\" after the Parsons trade in September, Mulugheta said talks regarding a potential Pickens deal would not be impacted by what happened last summer. Asked late in the season if he would talk directly with Jones on a contract, Pickens said he would let his agent do the deal.\n\nTheoretically, Pickens could follow the similar offseason and training camp path that Parsons chose last summer if the sides are not able to work out a long-term extension."

            "content": "Louis Riddick raves about why he thinks Ty Simpson has earned a spot as a top-15 pick in the 2026 NFL draft. (0:57)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Former Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson said Friday at the NFL combine that he is prepared to show NFL talent evaluators that he is a \"franchise quarterback.''\n\nSimpson is the No. 25 player overall on ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr.'s Big Board and the No. 2 quarterback behind Indiana's Fernando Mendoza (the No. 1 player overall). Simpson was asked at the combine Friday about his readiness to be an NFL starter. He said he has conveyed his confidence in his abilities to team personnel during the sit-down interviews in Indianapolis.\n\n\"First off, I think I'm ready, I'm a franchise quarterback,'' Simpson said. \"Alabama prepares you the most for the NFL ... The Alabama locker room is as close to an NFL locker room as you can get.''\n\nSimpson said he is healthy after battling some nagging injuries down the stretch this past season, including to his lower back and elbow as well as a fractured rib. He plans to throw Saturday during the on-field workout for quarterbacks. Mendoza is not expected to throw Saturday, so Simpson will be Kiper's highest-ranked quarterback to participate in the combine workout.\n\n\"It's why I decided to throw and why I'm excited about it,'' Simpson said of his health.\n\nHe also addressed his significant weight loss toward the end of the season -- he went from about 210 pounds to just over 190 pounds due to what some in the league have said was a case of gastritis -- and outlined his pre-combine regimen to be prepared for the combine and the draft.\n\n\"Lot of eating, lot of three meals, four meals a day,'' Simpson said of his combine prep. \"Lot of shakes, just getting in a routine of getting up in the morning, eating, drinking chocolate milk, eating lunch, eating the right meal, adding a shake to that, dinner, eating, adding a salad, just sticking to that.''\n\nHe was a one-year starter for the Crimson Tide (11-4) and finished with 3,567 yards passing with 28 touchdowns and five interceptions. But Simpson had 21 of his touchdown passes without an interception over his first eight games of the season and struggled some, including with the injuries. over the second half of the season as well as in the postseason with seven touchdowns to go with the five interceptions over the last six games.\n\nSome scouts have pointed to some struggles in the SEC championship game, a 28-7 loss to Georgia when Simpson was 19-of-39 passing as well as a 38-3 loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff when Simpson was 12-of-16 for 67 yards.\n\nBut Simpson said Friday he has met with most teams who have needs at quarterback, including the Steelers, Arizona Cardinals and New York Jets. And when asked about the second half of last season, he has been direct in his responses with scouts and coaches.\n\nOn his meeting with the Steelers, Simpson said \"I love Coach [Mike] McCarthy, I love the Steelers.'' He added he hasn't paid much attention to player rankings or quarterback rankings as the draft approaches.\n\n\"It matters what happens April 24th and 25th,'' Simpson said. \"Knowing no matter where I'm projected, where I go, they're going to get the best Ty Simpson.''"

(2:04)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Presumptive first overall pick Fernando Mendoza is eager about the prospect of being mentored by future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nDuring his formal interview with the Las Vegas Raiders this week in Indianapolis, Mendoza said he spoke briefly on the phone with Brady, who is a minority owner of the Raiders. The former Indiana quarterback characterized the interaction as \"very special\" and hoped to meet Brady in person should he be drafted by Las Vegas in April.\n\n\"I mean, who hasn't admired Tom Brady?\" Mendoza said Friday morning. \"That opportunity would be fantastic. Tom Brady, I believe, was the greatest quarterback of all time by a wide margin and to be able to have the opportunity to be mentored by him, it would mean so much. And especially to learn, and I'm all about learning. So from day one, I got to learn a lot. It's going to be a long journey. And to potentially have a mentor like that, it'd be pretty impressive and pretty meaningful.\"\n\nWhile Mendoza is a heavy favorite to be selected first overall, he downplayed any guarantee of being selected by the Raiders, who own the top pick in the draft after finishing 3-14 last season.\n\n\"Well, the pick has not been selected yet,\" Mendoza said. \"Whatever team drafts me, I'm extremely grateful, Whether it's the No. 1 pick or the last pick in the draft, I'd be blessed and honored to be drafted by any team and give them my all.\"\n\nMendoza came away impressed by his interactions with the Raiders staff. During the 20-minute session, coaches went over specific plays from Mendoza's college career before having the Heisman trophy winner draw plays on the white board.\n\n\"It was a fantastic interview,\" Mendoza said. \"The coaching staff was in there. We went over some of my previous plays, drew some plays on the board. I thought it was a great meeting, and I know they have the prospective No. 1 pick, but anything can happen in the draft. I'm just excited for the opportunity. Whatever team drafts me, I'm just going to give everything I have to them.\"\n\nMendoza led Indiana to its first national championship in program history during an undefeated season in 2025. He was named on 95.16% of all Heisman Trophy ballots, which is tied with Marcus Mariota for the second highest in the award's history."

(0:18)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Charlotte's Kon Knueppel reached yet another milestone in a remarkable rookie season for the No. 4 pick out of Duke.\n\nThe Hornets swingman broke Keegan Murray's NBA rookie record for 3-pointers, making his 207th on Thursday night against the Indiana Pacers. Knueppel connected on five 3s in the first half and then broke the record in the third quarter off an assist from Sion James, his former college teammate with the Blue Devils.\n\nHe finished with 28 points in the 133-109 win, with his 8 3s (on 12 attempts) tying his career high and landing just one shy of tying the NBA rookie record. He leads the NBA with 209 3s.\n\n\"It's really just about making the right basketball play,\" Knueppel said after the win. \"My teammates are setting good screens and setting me up in good spots. The coaches as well. I'm just out there looking to make the right play for my team.\"\n\nIt took Murray 80 games in 2022-23 to establish the record -- and Knueppel just 59 to surpass it. He said he did not realize the magnitude of the shot that set the mark.\n\n\"Honestly, I thought I needed seven,\" Knueppel said.\n\nGolden State's Stephen Curry holds the single-season NBA record with 402 3s.\n\nKnueppel is shooting 44.2% from beyond the arc, making him a contender for NBA Rookie of the Year along with his former college teammate and roommate Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 pick of the Dallas Mavericks. He has also helped propel the long-suffering Hornets into playoff contention; Charlotte has not made the playoffs since the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"It's what elevates our whole culture when you have a guy that's that good, but that humble, no ego -- it becomes contagious throughout your whole organization,\" Hornets coach Charles Lee told CGTN Sports Scene after Knueppel eclipsed 200 3s on Tuesday night.\n\nKnueppel has been a perfect fit in second-year coach Lee's offense alongside playmaker LaMelo Ball by finding open spots on the court -- a skill he attributes to playing in his father's men's league against taller competition beginning as an eighth grader growing up in Milwaukee.\n\nKnueppel has thrived as a catch-and-shoot player with 93% of his 3s this season coming off assists entering Thursday night, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nHe has turned heads across the league with his high shooting percentage.\n\nCurry, the NBA's career leader in 3s, made 166 on 380 attempts as a rookie with the Warriors in 80 games in 2009-10. Knueppel has now attempted 473 3s.\n\n\"He can obviously shoot the ball at a high level,\" Curry said after a recent game against the Hornets. \"You can't really leave him open at all as he has such a quick release and shoots with confidence. And his playmaking is very underrated. His game just suits the NBA style, whether it's fast-paced or a slowed-down possession game.\"\n\nKnueppel surpassed Donovan Mitchell, who is third on the list of 3s made by a rookie, in a loss to the Cavaliers on Feb. 20.\n\nMitchell joked that he heard about it after the game from Cavs teammate Tyrese Proctor, who played with Knueppel at Duke.\n\n\"He's talented,\" Mitchell said of Knueppel. \"For him to be a rookie and be able to go out there and make it look effortless. ... We know he can shoot the ball, right? But I think him getting to the midrange and play-develop in the small pick-and-roll that is something I think is really unique about his game is being able to do that and create advantages for himself.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting with him and Coop for rookie of the year.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Raphael Beinamwin\n\nThe Black Stars have qualified for the FIFA World Cup 2026. In boardrooms across Ghana, a familiar instinct is already surfacing: increase the budget.\n\n\n\nBut as we look toward 2026, it is worth confronting a more uncomfortable reality. World Cup cycles are not budget events. They are behavioural events. Large cultural moments do not increase the total supply of attention.\n\nThey redistribute it, concentrate it, and raise the threshold for breaking through.\n\nIf a brand’s response is simply to buy more reach, it is planning for a normal quarter inside an abnormal moment. In that context, the traditional media buy ceases to be a competitive advantage. What replaces it is an attention stress test: a measure of whether a brand understands how people actually behave when the nation is consumed by one event.\n\nGhana: A High-Compression Ecosystem\n\nGhana is often described as an “emerging” market, but that framing is outdated. We operate in a highly saturated, mobile-first, multi-screen media environment:\n\n34.45 million population, with 26.3 million internet users\n\nOver 74% internet penetration\n\n141 television stations and more than 480 radio stations\n\nRoughly 74% of radio consumption now happens via mobile devices\n\nWhen a national moment enters a system like this, the media does not expand outward. It compresses. The number of channels increases, but the available attention does not. The result is not reach scarcity, but relevance scarcity.\n\nIn these moments, adding more volume does not improve outcomes. It accelerates filtering. Brands are not ignored because they are unseen; they are ignored because they are indistinguishable.\n\nThe Dual-Theatre Economy: Corporate and Mass Audiences\n\nThe 2026 World Cup introduces an additional layer of complexity through North American time zones. Consider Ghana’s match against England on Tuesday, June 23. Kickoff is scheduled for 8:00 PM GMT, but the behavioral event begins much earlier.\n\nBy early afternoon, professionals will start recalibrating their workdays. Many will leave offices as early as 3:00 PM to avoid gridlock. This creates an early traffic surge where mobile radio and social platforms become the primary points of engagement.\n\nAt the same time, a second audience forms. A significant number of professionals choose to remain in the office and wait out traffic. Corporate spaces temporarily become informal fan zones, supported by high-speed internet, desktop screens, and second monitors.\n\nThe most valuable audience of the day lives inside this overlap. If a brand is not designed for the 2:00 PM to 8:00 PM pre-match window, and not built to reach both the mobile commuter and the discreet desktop viewer, it misses the most affluent and influential segment of the population.\n\nThe Third Half: The Emotional Aftermath\n\nIn Ghana, the match does not end at the final whistle. The period immediately after the game is often where engagement peaks.\n\nThe two hours following a match see a sharp rise in conversation intensity. Radio phone-ins turn into emotional debriefs. WhatsApp groups fill with analysis, arguments, and predictions. Social platforms accelerate with memes, clips, and reframed narratives.\n\nThis is the phase where meaning is assigned. A win produces a national uplift that extends beyond the pitch. A loss creates a collective need to process disappointment. Brands that understand this phase can align with the emotional state of the country. Brands that exit at full time surrender the most resonant part of the journey to competitors.\n\nA Nation Operating on Multiple Frequencies\n\nEven within a single household, consumption during World Cup moments is fragmented. One viewer may be focused on television for visuals, while simultaneously relying on radio for emotional, vernacular commentary. Younger audiences often experience the match primarily through social platforms, participating as creators and commentators rather than passive viewers.\n\nThis is not fragmented attention in the usual sense. It is layered attention. People are deeply engaged, but across different channels and with different expectations.\n\nDuring Black Stars matches, the tolerance for interruption is extremely low. Audiences retain very little. They remember the result, the key moments, and the brands that felt culturally aligned rather than commercially inserted.\n\nArchitecture Over Activity\n\nSuccess in this environment requires a shift from activity-led planning to attention architecture.\n\nThis means designing for how people gather, wait, commute, argue, celebrate, and decompress. It means enabling the rituals rather than interrupting them.\n\nFor the office worker avoiding traffic, this may involve facilitating shared experiences. For post-match commentators on radio or social platforms, it may mean providing tools, data, or spaces that amplify their voices.\n\nThe question is no longer where to place ads, but where to be structurally useful.\n\nThe Legitimacy Window\n\nWorld Cup 2026 presents a rare legitimacy window. Performance marketing captures existing demand. Legitimacy creates future preference.\n\nThe brands that emerge stronger will not be those with the largest budgets, but those with the clearest understanding of how a nation moves between desks, traffic, screens, radios, and shared emotional moments.\n\nThe strategic question is simple. Are you allocating spend, or are you engineering for synchronised national attention?\n\nOne is media buying.\n\nThe other is leadership.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "IMF\n\nIn the wake of the International Monetary Fund’s recent upward revision of its regional economic forecast, a clearer picture is emerging of the structural forces shaping Africa's 2026 trajectory. While the headline figures suggest a robust recovery, a deeper analysis reveals that this momentum is increasingly dependent on the success of internal fiscal reforms and the strategic navigation of shifting global trade alliances.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has adjusted its economic projections for sub-Saharan Africa upward, marking a 0.2 percentage point increase from previous baseline estimates. The organisation now expects the region to see a 4.6 per cent expansion in 2026. This shift reflects a growing confidence in the continent’s ability to navigate global volatility and decouple from slower growth patterns seen in other emerging markets.\n\nMacroeconomic Stabilisation and Reform Success\n\nThis upward trajectory is not merely a statistical rebound but the direct byproduct of aggressive fiscal tightening across the continent's largest hubs. Recent policy shifts in several major African economies are driving this positive momentum. IMF Director of Communications Julie Kozack noted that these adjustments are proving effective. “What we’ve seen in Sub-Saharan Africa is that the growth outlook has been improving. Growth has been revised up to 4.6% in 2026, and this has been supported by some of the macroeconomic stabilisation and reform efforts in key economies,” she said. These reforms often involve painful but necessary austerity measures that are finally beginning to anchor local currencies amid a cooling global inflationary cycle.\n\nGhana and Reform-Driven Economies\n\nGhana is positioned as a primary beneficiary of this trend following the successful completion of its fifth review under the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility in late 2025, which unlocked an immediate $385 million (approx. GH₵4.08 billion) disbursement. The country has implemented aggressive fiscal and monetary reforms to stabilise its currency and curb inflation, which has notably returned to single digits for the first time in years. These efforts have restored investor confidence and improved the national debt trajectory. As the host of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat, Ghana is uniquely positioned to leverage this stability to become the primary gateway for intra-continental trade.\n\nAfrica Among the World Fastest Growing Nations\n\nThe continent is increasingly becoming a global engine for growth at a time when major economies like China face structural decelerations. Africa currently hosts a significant portion of the world's most dynamic markets. Kozack emphasised this during a recent briefing. She stated that nine out of the twenty fastest-growing countries this year are in Africa. This highlights the region's rising importance in the global trade landscape, even as it navigates the February 2026 U.S. reauthorization of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which was extended only through December 31, 2026. This short-term extension is further strengthened by the deepening of AfCFTA integration, which aims to harmonise digital trade protocols and lower cross-border costs for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).\n\nChallenges for Oil Exporting Countries\n\nDespite the overall optimism, certain sectors face significant headwinds. A projected surplus in global oil supply is expected to keep prices low throughout 2026. This creates a difficult environment for major exporters like Nigeria and Angola. These nations must manage shrinking foreign reserves and potential budget shortfalls as commodity revenues decline. The divergence underscores the urgent need for resource-rich states to diversify away from crude oil dependency and pivot toward critical minerals like copper and lithium, which are seeing sustained demand. The AfCFTA offers a critical safety net here, allowing these nations to pivot their exports toward a growing internal African market of 1.3 billion people.\n\nPersistent Pressures in Conflict-Affected States\n\nThe economic recovery remains inconsistent across different borders. While some nations thrive, others struggle with internal instability. “We do see a bit of a divergent picture across Africa with some very fast-growing and dynamic economies,” Kozack added. Nations facing active conflict continue to deal with humanitarian crises and stalled infrastructure development. In these areas, the \"growth\" remains a statistical abstraction that has yet to improve the daily lives of the most vulnerable populations, as income per capita gains stay stagnant at approximately one per cent.\n\nStructural Vulnerabilities and External Shocks\n\nThe IMF continues to warn that the path forward is not without risk. High debt levels and declining international aid pose threats to many developing nations. External shocks, such as shifts in global trade policy or sudden climate events, could still disrupt the current growth path. Policymakers must now also account for the 10 per cent uniform U.S. import duty under Section 122, which took effect on February 24, 2026. African leaders are encouraged to use this period of growth to build stronger fiscal buffers to mitigate the impact of rising sovereign yields and shifting trade dynamics.\n\nUltimately, the IMF’s upgraded forecast for 2026 serves as a validation of current reforms and a call for deeper integration. The full implementation of the AfCFTA could potentially lift 30 million people out of extreme poverty. However, the IMF remains clear that sustained structural resilience is the only way to ensure these gains are not erased by the next global cycle. For sub-Saharan Africa, the challenge is no longer just about reaching 4.6 per cent. The true test lies in staying there.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Gianni Infantino has been Fifa president since 2016.\n\nSoccer fans around the world are facing extreme sticker shock. Ticket prices for the 2026 FIFA World Cup have surged to record levels on resale platforms ahead of the June 11 kickoff. This dramatic escalation on secondary markets has sparked concerns over accessibility. With the competition just months away, critics fear the rising costs will undermine market equity across North America.\n\nThe demand is particularly sharp for the opening match in Mexico City between Mexico and South Africa. The highest ticket for this match is currently priced at $5,324 (GH₵76,133), a steep climb from its original face value of $895 (GH₵12,798).\n\nSky-High Premiums for the New Jersey Final\n\nThe financial barrier to entry for the championship match has reached staggering proportions. A three-seat category for the final on July 19 at East Rutherford, New Jersey, costs $143,750 (GH₵2,055,625), representing a price tag 41 times more than its original value of $3,450 (GH₵49,335).\n\nEven those looking for the most basic entry into the stadium will face high costs. The cheapest available ticket for the final on the resale site was listed at $9,775 (GH₵139,782).\n\nFinancial Hurdles for Ghana and African Supporters\n\nFor Ghanaian fans and the wider African contingent, these figures represent a nearly insurmountable barrier. With the Cedi-to-Dollar exchange rate remaining a critical factor, even a \"cheap\" $140 general release ticket requires an investment of roughly GH₵2,000, excluding flights and visas.\n\nThe surge on resale platforms essentially shuts the door on average supporters wishing to follow the Black Stars. Analysts warn that the 2026 edition risk becoming the most \"exclusive\" World Cup in history, potentially leaving the vibrant stands usually filled by African drums and cheering sections noticeably thinner.\n\nGlobal Demand Overwhelms Official Supply\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino addressed the supply-and-demand crisis at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He noted that the sheer volume of interest forced the governing body to implement a draw system to allocate tickets.\n\n“In 100, almost 100, years of World Cup history, FIFA sold around 50 million tickets in total,\" Infantino said. \"Now, for this World Cup in four weeks (on sale), we have the request for 1,000 years of World Cups at once. This is unique. It’s incredible.”\n\nLegal Gaps in Host Nation Resale Markets\n\nThe disparity in pricing is fueled by a lack of consistent regulation across host nations. The resale market is unregulated in the United States and Canada. In Mexico, reselling a ticket above face value is prohibited, but only when the ticket is purchased in Mexico using the local currency. This creates a loophole for international buyers and sellers operating in US Dollars.\n\nFIFA Marketplace and Profit Margins\n\nThe surge in prices is expected to lead to a lot of disappointed fans being driven to resale sites where tickets are being listed for multiples of their face value. Even on official channels, the numbers are jarring. On FIFA's own resale marketplace, a ticket for the final was being listed for as much as $230,000 (GH₵2,530,000) this week. While FIFA does not resell tickets or set prices on the platform, it can cash in for a second time by taking a 30% cut from any sale.\n\nPublic Backlash and FIFA Defense\n\nThe pricing strategy has faced fierce criticism from supporters globally. There was an outcry last month when FIFA announced its latest general release of tickets priced from $140 (GH₵1,540) to $8,680 (GH₵95,480).\n\nAddressing the criticism, FIFA defends its pricing model, saying it “reflects the existing market practice for major entertainment and sporting events within our hosts' daily, soccer included.” With the draw approaching, Infantino warned that prices will likely continue their upward trajectory on resale platforms.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Prof Bismark Agbemble\n\nAfrica's educational landscape has long been a double-edged sword: a beacon of hope for millions aspiring to better lives, yet a factory churning out graduates ill-equipped for the realities of the job market.\n\nOver decades, systems across the continent, including in Ghana, have prioritized theoretical knowledge over practical skills, resulting in a surge of job seekers rather than innovators and entrepreneurs.\n\nThis mismatch has fueled rampant unemployment, social unrest, and economic stagnation. As African nations grapple with burgeoning youth populations, the need for reform is urgent. Recent data underscores the crisis: in Sub-Saharan Africa, the youth unemployment rate stood at 8.9% in 2023, a figure that masks deeper vulnerabilities in individual countries.\n\nIn Ghana, the challenge is particularly acute. The country produces approximately 300,000 graduates annually, but nearly 60% struggle to find stable employment, contributing to a youth unemployment rate of 32% among those aged 15-24 in 2025.\n\nOverall, unemployment eased to 13.1% by the end of 2024, yet the figure for youth aged 15-35 averaged 22.5%, with seven in ten unemployed individuals falling into this demographic.This has led to over 1.3 million unemployed graduates, exacerbating poverty and underutilization of human capital.\n\nThe structural nature of the issue is evident public sector jobs absorb less than 10% of new graduates, while informal and underemployed work inflates the true scale of the problem.\n\nNigeria, Africa's most populous nation, faces a similar predicament, though official figures paint a somewhat rosier picture amid discrepancies in reporting. The unemployment rate among those with post-secondary education was 9.0% in the first quarter of 2024, while youth unemployment (ages 15-24) stood at 8.4%.\n\nHowever, broader analyses suggest the crisis is more severe, with youth unemployment rates nearing 50% in 2025, driven by a mismatch between academic training and market demands for technical and vocational skills.Despite an overall unemployment rate of around 5.3%, millions of graduates remain trapped in underemployment or informal sectors, highlighting the failure of education to align with economic needs.\n\nEast Africa echoes these woes. In Uganda, graduate unemployment hovers at 15.2%, with the overall rate at 12.3% and youth unemployment at 16.7%. Alarmingly, 50.9% of young people aged 18-30 are neither in employment, education, nor training (NEET), a statistic that signals lost potential and social risks.\n\nKenya's situation is even more dire, with youth unemployment (ages 15-34) estimated at 67% five times the national average of 12.7%. Over 1.6 million individuals aged 20-29 are jobless, and many recent graduates cycling through unpaid internships or casual work. The rate stands at 20%, underscoring barriers to workforce entry.\n\nFurther north, Egypt offers a mixed but cautionary tale. The overall unemployment rate dropped to 6.2% in the fourth quarter of 2025, averaging 6.25% for the year the lowest in nearly a decade.Yet, educated youth bear the brunt: 45% of the unemployed are university graduates, and 82.1% hold intermediate or higher qualifications.This points to a profound skills gap, where advanced degrees do not translate to employability, with unemployment among those with advanced education at 14.18% in 2023.\n\nThese statistics reveal a systemic failure: African education systems, inherited from colonial eras and slow to adapt, emphasize rote learning over entrepreneurship, digital literacy, and vocational training. The result? A continent rich in human resources but poor in job creation, where governments shoulder the impossible burden of absorbing graduates into shrinking formal sectors.\n\nYet, hope emerges from visionary leaders challenging this status quo. Professor Bismark Agbemble, newly appointed President of the American Institute of Universities (AIU), draws from his extensive experience in the American educational system to advocate for a paradigm shift. He identifies a glaring divide between the knowledge African graduates acquire and the practical job skills demanded by employers.\n\nProf. Agbemble urges African governments and institutions to prioritize \"Job Ready\" skills, infused with what he terms PHD principle, honesty, and discipline. This approach, he argues, can transform students into ethical, resilient professionals capable of navigating real-world challenges.\n\nEchoing this sentiment, Dr Stephen Amoah, Member of Parliament for Nhyiaeso in Ghana's Ashanti Region, has called for embedding entrepreneurship in curricula from junior high school through university, making it a core subject.\n\nBy fostering critical thinking, risk-taking, and innovation, the MP believes students will evolve into job creators, alleviating the pressure on governments to provide scarce formal jobs. Such reforms could address the high graduate turnover amid low employment absorption seen across the continent.\n\nEnter AIU as a timely innovator. Established in 2025 as an E-Learning institution, AIU is dedicated to accessible, high-quality, higher education with a focus on leadership, entrepreneurship, and digital mastery. Set to open for global admissions in August 2026, it offers scholarships to 100 students whose financial hurdles have impeded their education.\n\nBy empowering these individuals to contribute to Africa's growth and beyond, AIU embodies the bridge between theory and practice that Prof Agbemble envisions. Its curriculum aligns with market needs, potentially serving as a model for reforming traditional systems.\n\nThe time for half-measures is over. African leaders must heed these calls, investing in curricula that blend academics with vocational training, digital skills, and entrepreneurial mindsets. Partnerships with institutions like AIU could catalyze change, turn the tide on unemployment, and unlock the continent's entrepreneurial potential.\n\nFailure to act risks a generation adrift; success could herald an era of self-reliant prosperity. Africa's future depends on educating not just minds but also creators.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "“KNUST, UENR and partners close industry skills gap for students”\n\nEfforts to strengthen renewable energy education in Ghana are progressing as academia and industry partners move to address two persistent challenges.\n\nThe challenges are financial barriers facing brilliant but disadvantaged students and the growing mismatch between university training and industry needs.\n\nCoordinator of the project and lead author of the book: ‘Empowering Ghana’s Engineering Future,’ Professor William Oduro, says the initiative is designed not only to reform training but also to create a support system for students who struggle to finance their education.\n\n“We’ve noticed in all the universities in this country and Africa that there are very disadvantaged and vulnerable students. We felt we could sell this book so we could take care of brilliant but disadvantaged students that don’t have the resources to continue,” he explained.\n\nAccording to him, proceeds from the book will be channeled into an institutional support scheme to assist needy students, particularly those pursuing renewable energy programmes that require significant practical training.\n\n“The money we will get out of the book will go into coffers that will take care of students who don’t have the money to take care of themselves in the university. The university has a system and the money is going to go there, and there will be a management for that,” he said.\n\nProfessor Oduro noted that while tuition for some specialised programmes averages about 11,000 dollars per student, the real financial burden comes from the practical components of renewable energy training.\n\n“Government takes a lot. But when it comes to practical renewable energy where they can do hands-on work, in terms of travel and pilot projects, it is a lot of money. If you multiply 11,000 dollars by 10, even that is 110,000 dollars,” he added.\n\nBeyond financial constraints, project leaders say a deeper structural problem exists within engineering education and there is a disconnect between what students learn and what employers expect.\n\nProfessor Samuel Gyamfi, Director of the Regional Centre for Energy and Environmental Sustainability at the University of Energy and Natural Resources (UENR), said the initiative was informed by concerns that graduates were leaving university without the competencies required in the renewable energy sector.\n\n“The book basically is about the disconnect between the competencies that are needed in industry and the graduate outcomes that we normally produce from the universities,” he said.\n\nHe explained that the team conducted detailed assessments to identify the specific skills demanded by industry and compared them with existing university curricula.\n\n“We saw that there was a bit of a gap between the competencies that are required and then the training that we give to our students. And then we assessed the gap between these two and looked at how we could bridge it,” he noted.\n\nThe findings led to a series of reforms, including industry visits in Ghana and Germany, faculty capacity building, curriculum reviews, and the introduction of modern teaching approaches supported by digital tools.\n\nThrough collaboration between KNUST, UENR and Germany’s Technische Universität Berlin, the project has strengthened industry–academia linkages and introduced practical, problem-based training to better prepare graduates for the energy transition.\n\nSupported by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and renewable energy industry partners, the initiative aims to serve as a model for professional engineering education in Ghana and across Africa.\n\nProject leaders believe that addressing both financial barriers and skills gaps is critical to building a workforce capable of driving Ghana’s renewable energy ambitions.\n\nAs demand grows for clean energy solutions, they say investing in hands-on training and supporting talented but vulnerable students will be key to ensuring that no capable future engineer is left behind.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Unless you are referring the person,” he said.\n\nMr Akandoh adviced while addressing a staff durbar at the Upper East Regional Hospital in Bolgatanga as part of a one-day working visit to the region to follow up on newly posted doctors and to assess healthcare delivery at the hospital, which serves as the major referral centre for the region.\n\n“You know what is happening in the public domain; we have set up a committee chaired by Professor Agyeman Badu Akosa. I can assure you, I will implement the findings to the letter,” he emphasised.\n\nThe Minister, who is also the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Juaboso Constituency in the Western North Region, told staff that even if they must treat patients on the floor to save lives, they should do their best.\n\n“It doesn’t mean you can save every life but do your best under the circumstances. However, to the extent that you do not even want to see the patient, that is not professional,” he said.\n\nPrior to the durbar, Mr Akandoh visited the Emergency Department (ED), where he observed that patients were sometimes kept in the department for more than 24 hours. “Once you stabilise patients, move them to the wards,” he directed.\n\n“It is better to move stable patients to the wards and create emergency beds to receive new cases. I agree that we do not have all the equipment, and we are all thinking about solutions. But let us pay attention to the critical cases first. Can you imagine a stabilised person staying at the Emergency Department because there is no bed on the wards, and then an emergency case arrives and the person dies? Is that good management?”\n\n“I am not blaming hospitals for not having all the equipment, but between the two options, which one will you opt for?” Mr. Akandoh quizzed the staff.\n\nAccording to him, even if stable patients from the ED must be managed on the floors of the wards to create space for incoming emergency cases, that remains the better option.\n\nDr Braimah Baba Abubakari, the Regional Director of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), briefed the Minister on service delivery, noting that the region comprises 15 districts with a population of approximately 1.42 million.\n\nHe stated that there are eight public hospitals, of which seven were GHS facilities and one Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG) facility with additional 17 private hospitals, 45 private clinics, and 79 health centres.\n\nDr Abubakari added that there were 529 functional Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) zones with 262 compounds.\n\nHe said that the region currently has 105 doctors, with 59 stationed at the regional hospital including four newly posted. “The remaining 14 districts are served by 46 doctors.\n\n“Out of 27 doctors posted to the region, only seven showed up; two went to the Northern Region, and five remained. Four at the regional hospital and one at the Paga hospital,” he added.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Why is an inflation of 23% good? In any event, who took it to 54%? They did monumental damage to the Ghanaian economy and then reluctantly went to the IMF in an ambulance when they were limping,” he said.\n\nThe Minister described the IMF intervention under the former administration as a reluctant measure, noting that key fiscal benchmarks were missed, including primary balance and deficit targets.\n\n“They missed some of the key targets and benchmarks that the IMF set. They missed their targets on a primary balance, they missed their targets on deficits and other such indicators. So the economy we inherited was not good,” he said.\n\nHe highlighted the economic indicators at the time, noting that the US dollar exchange rate stood at around GH¢15 per dollar, inflation was 23%, and national debt exceeded GH¢700 billion.\n\n“There was no indicator that you could say was in good shape,” he said.\n\nMr Kwakye Ofosu emphasised that the current administration’s adherence to fiscal discipline has stabilised the economy and delivered tangible improvements to the lives of ordinary Ghanaians.\n\n“We have come in, adhered to the principles of fiscal discipline which they lacked — that was the fundamental problem they faced. We have improved upon the situation and it has led to a situation where those improvements have translated into the lives of the people of Ghana,” he stated.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

He therefore advised fans to comport themselves and adhere to guidelines in order to safeguard this status.\n\n\n\n'We need our best players to stay fit ahead of 2026 World Cup' - John Paintsil\n\n\n\n“Mr Speaker, supporters and others interested in going to support their team will have to submit visa requests to the American Embassy. We are being told that we must ensure that supporters who travel return on their visas. It has taken a lot of work to restore Ghana's 5-year non-immigrant visas and remove us from the ban list. It is my hope that this event will not send thousands of Ghanaians to America and put us back on the ban list,” he said.\n\n\n\nPresident Mahama also urged the Black Queens to improve their performance at the 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) after placing third in the previous edition.\n\n\n\n“Mr Speaker, the Black Queens will compete at the 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, building on their bronze medal finish in Morocco,” he noted.\n\n\n\nHe also expressed optimism about Ghana’s participation in upcoming competitions, including the Youth Olympic Games and the 2026 Commonwealth Games, hoping for success from the athletes.\n\n\n\n“At the youth level, Ghana will participate in the 2026 Youth Olympic Games in Dakar with a multidisciplinary team aimed at strengthening long-term elite pathways.

Dr. Lawrence Tetteh, Dr. Jemima Nunoo and other members\n\nSource: Ghana Energy Awards\n\nThe Ghana Energy Awards has officially launched activities marking its 10th Anniversary Edition with a high-level courtesy call on the Ministry of Energy and Green Transition, setting the tone for a landmark year for the prestigious industry recognition scheme.\n\nThe delegation, led by the Chief Executive Officer of the Awards Secretariat, Ing. Henry Teinor, and the Chairman of the Awarding Panel, Kwame Jantuah, Esq. Other members of the delegation included Dr. Lawrence Tetteh and Dr. Jemima Nunoo.\n\n\n\nThe broader Awarding Panel also includes H.E. Dr. Kwame Ampofo, Ghana's Ambassador to the Republic of Hungary, and Prof. Felix Asante, Pro Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ghana, in charge of Research, Innovation and Development.\n\n\n\nThe team was received by the Deputy Minister of Energy and Green Transition, Hon. Richard Gyan-Mensah, on behalf of the Minister, Hon. Dr. John Abdulai Jinapor.\n\n\n\nThe meeting, held at the Ministry in Accra, marks the first in a series of activities lined up to commemorate the 10th Anniversary of the Awards, which, since 2017, has recognised excellence and innovation across Ghana’s energy value chain.\n\n\n\nAmong key items discussed was the formal presentation of the Site Visitation Report from the 9th Ghana Energy Awards, alongside deliberations on the theme selection and roadmap for the 10th Edition. The delegation also used the occasion to exchange perspectives with the Ministry on strategic priorities for 2026 and areas for collaboration.\n\nIndependent Assessment to Support Oversight\n\n\n\nPresenting the Site Visitation Report, Chairman of the Awarding Panel, Kwame Jantuah, Esq., underscored the importance of the exercise as an independent technical assessment of selected project sites visited during last year’s awards process.\n\n\n\n“The Site Visitation Report provides an independent, expert assessment of operational sites and projects reviewed by the Panel,” Jantuah said. “We believe this document can serve as a useful reference point to support policy refinement and strengthen the Ministry’s oversight responsibilities across the sector.”\n\n\n\nHe noted that the Awards’ structured evaluation process, including site visits and technical reviews, reinforces credibility and provides actionable insights for both regulators and operators.\n\n\n\nCommitment to Excellence\n\nChief Executive Officer of the Awards Secretariat, Ing. Henry Teinor, reiterated the scheme’s commitment to promoting excellence and strengthening the sector’s long-term development.\n\n\n\n“As we mark our 10th Anniversary, we remain committed to championing operational excellence, innovation and good governance within Ghana’s energy sector,” Ing. Teinor said. “This anniversary is a renewed pledge to support the advancement of the sector in alignment with national priorities.”\n\n\n\nHe described the courtesy call as the formal opener to a broader calendar of anniversary activities, which will include stakeholder engagements, policy dialogues and commemorative events leading up to the awards ceremony later in the year.\n\n\n\nMinistry Reaffirms Strategic Priorities\n\n\n\nDeputy Minister Richard Gyan-Mensah commended the execution of the 9th Edition of the Awards and welcomed the roadmap shared for the 10th Anniversary.\n\n“The Ministry acknowledges the strategic role the Ghana Energy Awards continues to play in highlighting performance and encouraging healthy competition within the sector,” he said. “The 9th Edition was well executed, and with the roadmap presented, we expect an even more impactful 10th Anniversary celebration.”\n\n\n\nHe reiterated the Ministry’s openness to collaborative initiatives that align with the government’s broader energy vision.\n\n\n\n“We remain open to partnerships that help advance the government’s objectives for the sector and inspire industry players to give their best, champion excellence and pursue innovation,” the Deputy Minister said.\n\n\n\nOutlining the Ministry’s key objectives for 2026, Gyan-Mensah disclosed that the government is working “around the clock” to ensure Ghana achieves a 90% electricity access rate by the end of the year.\n\n\n\nHe further highlighted Ghana’s recent ratification of a $2 billion agreement extending the Jubilee and TEN oil field licences to 2040. The deal, approved in February 2026 and involving Tullow Oil, Kosmos Energy, PetroSA and the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), secures investment for up to 20 new wells aimed at boosting production. It also increases GNPC’s stake by 10% from 2036 and is expected to enhance the domestic gas supply for power generation.\n\nThe Deputy Minister added that Ghana has reached an agreement with Nigeria to increase gas supply to support power generation, while discussions are ongoing regarding the country’s nuclear energy pathway, including whether to pursue small modular reactors or large-scale nuclear facilities.\n\n\n\nHe also disclosed renewed efforts to ensure malfunctioning streetlights are fixed nationwide to improve public lighting and safety.\n\n\n\nA Landmark Year Ahead\n\n\n\nThe 10th Ghana Energy Awards is expected to reflect a decade of recognising industry leadership and impact. Further details on anniversary activities, stakeholder engagements and the official theme for the 10th Edition will be announced in the coming weeks."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

Why am I being prevented?”\n\nAnother man, Ali Nawas, 58, told the news agency that he and his wife had travelled for more than an hour from Nablus in the occupied West Bank, only for his wife to be turned back at the Qalandiya checkpoint, despite her having a permit.\n\n“I was forced to return with her. How could she go back to Nablus alone?” he said."

The military is required to formally notify the FAA anytime it takes any counter-drone action inside US airspace.\n\nThe earlier laser firing did not hit a target. It was carried out by the CBP near Fort Bliss, about 80km (50 miles) to the northwest, prompting the FAA to shut down air traffic at El Paso airport and the surrounding area. This time, the closure was smaller and commercial flights were not affected.\n\nUS Representative Rick Larsen and two other top Democrats on the House Transportation and Infrastructure and Homeland Security committees said they were stunned when they were officially notified.\n\n“Our heads are exploding over the news,” the lawmakers said in a joint statement. They criticised the Trump administration for “sidestepping” a bipartisan bill to train drone operators and improve communication among the Pentagon, FAA and Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“Now, we’re seeing the result of its incompetence,” they said.\n\nGovernment defends use of anti-drone laser\n\nThe Pentagon, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Customs and Border Protection issued a statement saying the military used a “counter-unmanned aircraft system … to mitigate a seemingly threatening unmanned aerial system operating within military airspace”.\n\n\n\nThe statement added that the incident “took place far away from populated areas and there were no commercial aircraft in the vicinity. These agencies will continue to work on increased cooperation and communication to prevent such incidents in the future.\n\n“At President Trump’s direction, the Department of War, FAA, and Customs and Border Patrol are working together in an unprecedented fashion to mitigate drone threats by Mexican cartels and foreign terrorist organisations at the US-Mexico Border,” the statement said. “The bottom line is the Trump Administration is doing more to secure the border and crack down on cartels than any administration in history.”\n\nSecond Texas airspace shut down this month\n\nThe El Paso shutdown two weeks ago lasted only a few hours, but it raised alarm and led to several flight cancellations in the city of nearly 700,000 people not far from the Mexican border.\n\nIn that case, CBP deployed an anti-drone laser near Fort Bliss without coordinating with the FAA, which then decided to close El Paso airspace to ensure commercial air safety, according to sources familiar with what happened who were not authorised to discuss it.\n\nAfterwards, members of Congress said it appeared to be another example of government dysfunction, with different agencies failing to coordinate.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he was planning to brief members of Congress sometime this week about what happened. He said at an unrelated news conference last Friday that it was not a mistake for the FAA to close the airspace over El Paso and that he does not think a communication issue caused the problems.\n\nLawmaker demands an investigation\n\nDemocratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, the ranking member on the Senate’s Aviation Subcommittee, said this incident demands independent investigations.\n\n“The Trump administration’s incompetence continues to cause chaos in our skies,” Duckworth said.\n\nThe investigation into last year’s midair collision near Washington, DC, between an airliner and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people highlighted how the FAA and Pentagon were not always working well together.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board said the FAA and the Army did not share safety data on the alarming number of close calls around Reagan National Airport and failed to address the risks."

            "content": "Kyiv, Ukraine – Posters advertising “The Azov school of landscape design” can be seen inside subway cars and on billboards in Kyiv.\n\nBut instead of a smiling gardener surrounded by blossoming trees and flowers, the poster depicts a bearded, smiling soldier with the Azov Corps walking away from a howitzer that spews out a shell to “design” the landscape on the Russian side.\n\nAs Ukrainian soldiers keep getting killed and wounded along the crescent-shaped, 1,250-kilometre (777-mile) long front line, Kyiv faces a dire shortage of servicemen.\n\nIndividual military units compete for potential recruits and lure them with catchy slogans, witty campaigns, text messages and social media posts that promise thorough training that reduces the risk of getting killed or jobs behind the front line.\n\nMany Ukrainian men of fighting age – 25 to 60 – who cannot refuse the draft choose to join them. Otherwise, they could be rounded up by “conscription patrols” and undergo perfunctory training to end up as storm-troopers – a role which comes with a high risk of death.\n\n“There’s zero training. They don’t care that I won’t survive the very first attack,” Tymofey, a 36-year-old office worker who was forcibly conscripted last year but broke out of two training centres, told Al Jazeera.\n\nHundreds of thousands of men dodge the draft, pay bribes to flee abroad or illegally cross into European nations amid corruption and coercion on the part of conscription officers, as documented by government officials, media and rights groups.\n\n\n\nIn the first year after Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion, men of all ages volunteered in droves, standing for hours outside conscription offices and even travelling to other parts of Ukraine to find a less crowded conscription office that would enlist them.\n\n“The first wave very massive, they were motivated,” a senior serviceman told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut volunteers are rare these days. The average age of conscripts has risen to above 40, and their fitness levels have dropped.\n\n“We get what is left of what is left,” he said of the new recruits in his military unit – adding that infantrymen are “hardest to recruit”.\n\n“They can and will be trained, but there’s a matter of condition. A man in his 50s with a white-collar job and several chronic diseases is not exactly fit,” he said.\n\nAzov’s hiring spree\n\nWhile recruitment campaigns are very visible, the hiring process is largely non-transparent.\n\nMost of the applications should be filled online, and only prospective candidates are invited to recruitment offices whose locations are not disclosed because Russia targets them with drones, missiles or attacks by people recruited via messaging apps or the dark web.\n\nAnd when it comes to picking the cream of the crop, Azov, now known as the First National Guard Corps, and its offshoot, The Third Storm Brigade, reign supreme.\n\nApart from the “school of landscape design,” Azov has billboards and online s offering sarcastically named “courses” in “content making,” “event management” and “cross-fit”.\n\nAzov has, for years, been one of Ukraine’s most outspoken military units, and its servicemen were dubbed “300 Spartans” for their months-long defence of the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol in early 2022 that ended only when top brass ordered them to surrender.\n\nSome 700 of Azov fighters are still behind bars in Russia, facing torture and starvation, according to swapped servicemen and Ukrainian officials.\n\nThey have become the bogeymen of the Kremlin propaganda machine that calls them “neo-Nazis” and claims they “terrorise” civilians and stage their killings to blame Russian “liberators”.\n\nAzov had far-right origins, but the current leadership claims to have cleaned up the brigade, denying any links with “extremist” groups. Al Jazeera is unable to independently verify these claims.\n\nThe publicity and halo of martyrdom have raised Azov’s domestic profile.\n\n\n\nAnd what its recruiters offer is a “soldier-centred” approach that takes into account each potential serviceman’s background, shape, medical history and military experience – or lack thereof.\n\n“We are building a system centred around a soldier, because a soldier is not a resource, it’s the basis of the whole system,” a senior Azov recruiter who identified himself by his call sign, Tara, told Al Jazeera in one of Azov’s open spaces in central Kyiv.\n\nThe open space is a far cry from average Ukrainian conscription centres usually located in gloom, claustrophobic Soviet-era buildings with drafty corridors and creaky floors.\n\nIt has a cafeteria with a menu most hipsters would find palatable, and a shop with trendy T-shirts, hoodies and souvenirs.\n\n“A nation that doesn’t stand up for its heroes kneels before the enemy,” a handwritten sign on a wall reads.\n\nTara said that aspiring Azov servicemen undergo tests and interviews – and choose a job “with the highest efficiency\n\n“We, for our part, guarantee that [the recruits] will serve in the exact position for which they have been approved.”\n\nAll of Azov’s recruiters are battle-tested servicemen, said Tara, who volunteered to join nascent Azov in 2014.\n\nWith a tidy moustache and at the towering height of six feet, five inches (1.95 metres) tall, he took part in Azov’s transformation from ragtag volunteer crews of football fans and nationalists who were instrumental in repelling the onslaught of Russia-backed separatists in southeastern Ukraine, into a primary military unit.\n\nMeanwhile, smaller, less outspoken units can barely find enough recruits to replenish their losses.\n\n“We ask around, we tell friends, we say that we can make sure they get trained properly, but it’s never enough,” Oleh, a senior officer with a military unit stationed in eastern Ukraine, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAnd some are adamant that Ukraine should introduce a system of compulsory and universal military service.\n\n“All privileges must be cancelled, all men of fighting age should undergo training and be ready for service. Otherwise, we’ll keep on losing ground,” retired Lieutenant-General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera."

            "content": "Pakistan has accused Afghanistan of becoming ‘a colony of India’ but India’s relations with Kabul predate the Taliban.\n\nPakistan has accused Afghanistan’s Taliban of serving as a “proxy” for India, amid escalating hostilities between Islamabad and Kabul.\n\nJust hours after Pakistan bombed locations in Kabul early on Friday, Pakistan’s Minister of Defence Khawaja Asif wrote on X that after NATO forces withdrew from Afghanistan in July 2021, “it was expected that peace would prevail in Afghanistan and that the Taliban would focus on the interests of the Afghan people and regional stability”.\n\n“However, the Taliban turned Afghanistan into a colony of India,” he wrote and accused the Taliban of “exporting terrorism”.\n\n“Pakistan made every effort, both directly and through friendly countries, to keep the situation stable. It carried out extensive diplomacy. However, the Taliban became a proxy of India,” he alleged as he declared an “open war” with Afghanistan.\n\nThis is not the first time that Asif has brought India into tensions with Afghanistan.\n\nLast October, he alleged: “India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul.”\n\nSo far, Asif has presented no evidence to back his claims and the Taliban has rejected accusations that it is being influenced by India.\n\nBut India has condemned the Pakistani military’s recent actions in Afghanistan, adding to Islamabad’s growing discernment that its nuclear rival and the Taliban are edging closer.\n\nEarlier this week, after the Pakistani military carried out air raids inside Afghanistan on Sunday, India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement that New Delhi “strongly condemns Pakistan’s airstrikes on Afghan territory that have resulted in civilian casualties, including women and children, during the holy month of Ramadan”.\n\n\n\nAfter Friday morning’s flare-up between Pakistan and Afghanistan, India’s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal again said New Delhi “strongly” condemned Pakistan’s air strikes and also noted that they took place on a Friday during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\n“It is another attempt by Pakistan to externalise its internal failures,” Jaiswal said in a statement on X.\n\nHas India’s influence in Afghanistan grown under the Taliban and what is India’s endgame with Afghanistan?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nHow have relations between India and the Taliban evolved?\n\nWhen the Taliban first rose to power in Afghanistan in 1996, India adopted a hostile policy towards the group and did not recognise its assumption of power. India also shunned all diplomatic relations with the Taliban.\n\nAt the time, New Delhi viewed the Taliban as a proxy for Pakistan’s intelligence agencies. Pakistan, together with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, were the only three countries to have also recognised the Taliban administration at that point.\n\nThen, in 2001, India supported the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, which toppled the Taliban administration. India then reopened its embassy in Kabul and embraced the new government led by Hamid Karzai. The Taliban, in response, attacked Indian embassies and consulates in Afghanistan. In 2008, at least 58 people were killed when the Taliban bombed India’s embassy in Kabul.\n\nIn 2021, after the Taliban returned to power, India closed its embassy in Afghanistan once again and also did not officially recognise the Taliban as the government of the country.\n\nBut a year later, as relations between Pakistan and the Taliban deteriorated over armed groups which Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of harbouring, India began engaging with the Taliban.\n\nIn 2022, India sent a team of “technical experts” to run its mission in Kabul and officially reopened its embassy in the Afghan capital last October. New Delhi also allowed the Taliban to operate Afghanistan consulates in the Indian cities of Mumbai and Hyderabad.\n\nOver the past two years, officials from New Delhi and Afghanistan have also held meetings abroad, in Kabul and in New Delhi.\n\nIn January last year, the Taliban administration’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi met India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThen, in October 2025, he visited New Delhi and met Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.\n\nAfter this meeting, Muttaqi told journalists that Kabul “has always sought good relations with India” and, in a joint statement, Afghanistan and India pledged to have “close communication and continue regular engagement”.\n\nBesides beefing up diplomatic ties, India has also offered humanitarian support to Afghanistan under the Taliban’s rule.\n\n\n\nAfter a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck northern Afghanistan in November last year, India shipped food, medicine and vaccines, and Jaishankar was also among the first foreign ministers to call Muttaqi and offer his support. Since last December, India has also approved and implemented several healthcare infrastructure projects in Afghanistan, according to a December 2025 report by the country’s press information bureau.\n\nPraveen Donthi, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera that the costs of avoiding engagement with the Taliban in the past have compelled the Indian government to adopt strategic pragmatism towards the Afghan leadership this time.\n\n“New Delhi does not want to disregard this relationship on ideological grounds or create strategic space for India’s main strategic rivals, Pakistan and China, in its neighbourhood,” he said.\n\nRaghav Sharma, professor and director at the Centre for Afghanistan Studies at the OP Jindal Global University in India, added that the current engagement also stems from New Delhi’s pragmatic realisation that the Taliban is now in charge in Afghanistan and that there is no meaningful opposition.\n\n“States engage in order to protect and further their interests. While there is little by way of ideological convergence, there are areas of strategic convergence, which is what has pushed India to engage with the Taliban, some of their unpalatable policies notwithstanding,” he said.\n\nIs this a new stance towards Afghanistan?\n\nNo. India’s growing influence and engagement with Afghanistan began well before the Taliban returned to power in August 2021.\n\nBetween December 2001 and September 2014, during the US presence in Afghanistan, New Delhi was a strong supporter of the Karzai government, and then of his successor, Ashraf Ghani’s government, which was in power from September 2014 until August 2021, when the US withdrew from the country.\n\nIn October 2011, under Karzai, India and Afghanistan renewed ties by signing an agreement to form a strategic partnership. New Delhi also pledged to support Afghanistan in the face of foreign troops in the nation as a part of this agreement.\n\nUnder both Karzai and his successor, Ghani, India invested more than $3bn in humanitarian aid and reconstruction work in Afghanistan. This included reconstruction projects like schools and hospitals, and also a new National Assembly building in Kabul, which was inaugurated in December 2015 when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Afghanistan for the first time.\n\nIndia’s Border Road Organisation (BRO) also assisted Afghanistan in the development of infrastructure projects like the 218km Zaranj-Delaram highway in 2009 under Karzai’s government.\n\nUnder Ghani, New Delhi undertook building the Salma Dam project to help with irrigating Afghanistan. In June 2016, when Modi visited Afghanistan once again, he inaugurated this $290m dam project. In May 2016, Iran, India and Afghanistan also signed a trilateral trade and transit agreement on the Chabahar port.\n\nDuring this period – 2001-2021 – Pakistan’s unease with New Delhi and Kabul’s new partnership grew.\n\n\n\nIn October 2011, after signing a strategic agreement with India, Karzai had assured Islamabad that while “India is a great friend, Pakistan is a twin brother”.\n\nBut Karzai was critical of Pakistan’s support for the Taliban. In his last speech as president of Afghanistan in Kabul in September 2014, he stated that he believed most of the Taliban leadership lived in Pakistan.\n\nIn a 2011 report by a Washington, DC-based think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Amer Latif, former director for South Asian affairs in the US Ofﬁce of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, noted that Karzai was walking a “fine line between criticising Pakistan’s activities while also referring to Pakistan as Afghanistan’s ‘twin brother’.”\n\n“It is in this context that Karzai appears to be looking to solidify long-term partnerships with countries that will aid his stabilisation efforts,” he said, referring to Karzai’s visit to India and his efforts to improve relations with the subcontinent.\n\nWhen Ghani rose to power in September 2014, he tried to reset ties with Pakistan and also visited the country in November that year. But his efforts did not result in improved ties due to border disputes with Pakistan continuing until his administration was overthrown by the Taliban in August 2021.\n\nSo why has India maintained ties with Afghanistan under the Taliban?\n\nInitially, when the Taliban returned to power in 2021 following the withdrawal of the US, political analysts largely expected Pakistan to lead the way in recognising the Taliban administration as the official government of Afghanistan, improving bilateral relations which had turned icy under Karzai and Ghani.\n\nBut relations turned hostile, with Pakistan repeatedly accusing the Taliban of allowing anti-Pakistan armed groups like the Pakistan Taliban (TTP) to operate from Afghan soil. The Taliban denies this.\n\nThen, the deportation of tens of thousands of Afghan refugees by Pakistan in recent years further strained ties between the two neighbours.\n\nIndia has ultimately taken a pragmatic approach to the Taliban in order to maintain the good relations it built with Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021, and has somewhat leveraged poor relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan to cement these.\n\n“With Pakistan’s increasingly strained relations with Afghanistan, the logic of ‘enemy’s enemy’ is acting as a glue between Kabul and New Delhi,” International Crisis Group’s Donthi said.\n\nHe added that despite the fact that India’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government opposes Islamist organisations, “the strategic necessity to counter Pakistan has led it to engage with the Taliban proactively”.\n\nIndia and Pakistan are nuclear-armed rivals which engaged in a four-day conflict in May 2025 after armed rebels killed Indian tourists in Pahalgam, a popular tourist spot in Indian-administered Kashmir, last April. New Delhi accused Pakistan of supporting rebel fighters, a charge Pakistan strongly denied.\n\nFor its part, Afghanistan took the opportunity to strongly condemn the Pahalgam attack and the Indian Ministry of External Affairs expressed “deep appreciation” to the Taliban for its “strong condemnation of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam … as well as for the sincere condolences”.\n\nIndia has also condemned Pakistani military action in Afghanistan and has provided aid to thousands of Afghan refugees displaced from Pakistan.\n\nSo what is India’s endgame in Afghanistan?\n\nSharma, the OP Jindal Global University professor, said India wants to ensure that Pakistan and China, whose influence has grown in South Asia in recent years, “do not have a free run”, as “there is a divergence of interest on Afghanistan” with both Pakistan and its ally, China.\n\n\n\n“There are security interests New Delhi is keen to further and protect for which engagement [with the Taliban] is the only option,” he added.\n\nAnil Trigunayat, a former Indian diplomat, noted that while Afghanistan and Pakistan relations have their own dynamic, currently the Taliban leadership, even if not a monolith, refuses to play to the tunes of the Pakistan military and its intelligence agency.\n\n“Hence they [Pakistan] accuse Indian complicity in Taliban actions in Pakistan,” he said.\n\nBut the Taliban, he said, “understands and appreciates India’s intent, policies and [humanitarian] contributions”, making its leaders keen to continue collaboration with New Delhi."

The Thursday incident reportedly led the Federal Aviation Administration to close the airspace where the military fired the anti-drone laser.\n\nThis marks the second time this month that officials closed airspace near the US-Mexico border due to an incident involving an anti-drone laser. On February 11th, officials closed airspace around the El Paso International Airport for hours after the CBP fired an anti-drone laser without coordinating with the FAA, The New York Times reported at the time. Though Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement that the FAA and Department of War moved to “address a cartel drone incursion,” it reportedly turned out to be a party balloon.\n\nNow, the FAA, CBP, and the Pentagon tell Reuters that the military “employed counter-unmanned aircraft system authorities to mitigate a seemingly threatening unmanned aerial system operating within military airspace,” adding that the incident “took place far away from populated areas and there were no commercial aircraft in the vicinity.” This most recent incident reportedly led to a smaller airspace closure and was also done without approval from the FAA, the Times reports.\n\nIn a joint statement, Reps. Bennie Thompson (D-MS), André Carson (D-IN), and Rick Larsen (D-WA) — the top Democrats on committees overseeing homeland security, aviation, and transportation — expressed outrage over the incident. “We said MONTHS ago that the White House’s decision to sidestep a bipartisan, tri-committee bill to appropriately train C-UAS [Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems] operators and address the lack of coordination between the Pentagon, DHS and the FAA was a short-sighted idea,” the statement says. “Now, we’re seeing the result of its incompetence.”"

It’s a single image but a notable one showing protagonist Kratos and his son Atreus. The characters are played by Ryan Hurst and Callum Vinson, respectively, and they look relatively close to their video game counterparts.\n\nThere aren’t a lot of other details about the show just yet, but this is Amazon’s official description:\n\nThe God of War series storyline follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human.\n\nThat sounds a lot like the recent soft reboot of the franchise, which started with 2018’s God of War and continued through Ragnarök in 2022. For the Amazon series, Ronald D. Moore, best-known for his work on For All Mankind and Battlestar Galactica, will serve as showrunner. The rest of the cast includes: Mandy Patinkin (Odin), Ed Skrein (Baldur), Max Parker (Heimdall), Ólafur Darri Ólafsson (Thor), Teresa Palmer (Sif), Alastair Duncan (Mimir), Jeff Gulka (Sindri), and Danny Woodburn (Brok).\n\nWhile production is underway on the God of War series, there’s no word on when it might start streaming.\n\nWhile Amazon appears to be stepping back from making games, it’s been pushing hard on adaptations for Prime Video. In addition to God of War, there’s Fallout, which just wrapped up season 2, and an upcoming Tomb Raider show starring Sophie Turner."

The S26 lines come with some useful new things — particularly the Privacy Display on the S26 Ultra, which looks like an extremely cool bit of tech and a really useful new feature — and a lot of iterative year-over-year changes. The new camera features, on the other hand, are neither of those things. They’re something worse. Something scarier.\n\nVerge subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free Vergecast wherever you get your podcasts. Head here. Not a subscriber? You can sign up here.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, Nilay and David discuss the new phones, then dive into the ways in which the S26’s AI camera features seem to be clearly designed to change the whole idea of what happens when you try to take a picture. For that matter, it’s not even clear that what you’re taking is a “picture” anymore. We’ve been talking about the “What is a photo?” apocalypse for some time, and the S26 feels like a crossing of a line. All in the service of some cupcakes.\n\nAfter that, the hosts turn to the big shakeup inside the Xbox team. With Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond out, and Asha Sharma in, it’s time to wonder what happened to the Xbox, and whether Sharma or anyone can fix it. Microsoft’s gaming problems have been around for years and are the result of a string of bad bets and bad decisions. What would it take to get back on course, and is “back on course” even possible anymore?\n\nFinally, in the lightning round, we do another round of Brendan Carr is a Dummy, debate a truly astonishing chart, check in on OpenAI’s infrastructure spending, and decide once and for all whether Claude is alive. Or, at least, whether Anthropic thinks so.\n\nIf you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, first on the new Samsung devices:\n\nAnd in Xbox news:\n\nAnd in the lightning round:"

The games will launch in 2027 and are exclusive for the Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo also shared a trailer showcasing a new trio of starter pokémon — Browt, Pombon, and Gecua — and a number of different environments you’ll be able to explore as you play through the games.\n\nIn addition to establishing that Wind and Waves takes place in an island setting, the trailer really highlights how much more detailed and complex the games’ environments are compared to past titles like Scarlet / Violet and Legends: Z-A. It seems like you’ll be able to explore dense jungles, caves full of magma, and beneath the ocean all while encountering wild pokémon. In a press release, Nintendo said that Wind and Waves will be open-world games, and the company also noted that Brazilian Portuguese will officially be supported as a selectable language.\n\n2027 is still a ways out from now, but Winds and Waves’ definitely seems like it’s going to be worth the wait. And with Pokopia about to drop next week, there’s going to be plenty to keep Pokémon fans busy in the meantime."

            "content": "This is Optimizer, a weekly newsletter sent every Friday from Verge senior reviewer Victoria Song that dissects and discusses the latest gizmos and potions that swear they’re going to change your life. Opt in for Optimizer here.\n\nIn 2017, I was at rock bottom. My dad’s health was rapidly failing; my relationship with my mom was on the rocks. I was in a not-so-great place in my career. My undiagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome was wreaking havoc on my health. I was already in a dark place when a situationship broke my heart, my roommate notified me they were moving out, and I received a surprise $5,000 vet bill for my dog. Stressed, depressed, and a hot mess, I stopped eating.\n\nPhysically, I wanted to eat. Mentally, I simply couldn’t. A week into my involuntary fast, my therapist suggested meal replacement drinks until we could work out a solution. For six weeks, I forced myself to drink two chocolate Ensures a day until I managed to start piecing my life back together. It was a miserable, terrifying time, in which I lost 20 percent of my body weight.\n\nI was recently transported back to that time thanks to a Huel ad. If you’re unaware, Huel is a wellness brand that sells meal replacement drinks, powders, supplements, instant meals, and daily greens. It’s probably best known for its powders and ready-made shakes, but this particular ad is for its daily greens drink. A manicured hand snaps open a can as wistful violins play over a series of text: Just went through a breakup. Is getting married next month. Just lost their job. Just need a break from the world. Looking for community. Just got a promotion. Just surviving the day. The caption reads, “No matter the moment, Daily Greens are ready to drink,” punctuated by a green heart emoji.\n\nIt just so happens that when I took a look at AG1’s science-washed marketing in a recent Optimizer, several readers requested I do the same for Huel. The two products are similar. Both aim to make up for a perceived lack of nutrients in an ordinary person’s diet. Both employ fit celebrities and influencers as spokespersons. AG1 has Hugh Jackman and Andrew Huberman, while Huel’s site boasts actor Idris Elba, former Yankee Alex Rodriguez, and Steven Bartlett from the Diary of a CEO podcast. Whereas AG1 leaned on dubious terms like “clinically backed,” Huel uses framing like “nutritionally complete” and “scientifically supported.” And while AG1 is clearly a greens supplement, Huel lives in a grayer area between greens supplements, protein powders, meal replacement, and ready-made food. Buzzy phrases like “nutrient-dense,” “superfoods,” “plant-based,” and “sustainable” also make appearances.\n\nPerusing Huel’s marketing, the meal replacement narrative is what sticks out the most. “Huel is an ally on my busiest days,” reads Bartlett’s testimonial. “I always have a couple in the fridge at home — it’s my go-to when I realize I haven’t eaten,” reads another from Premier League Hall of Famer Gary Neville. Other ideas that frequently pop up: no prep, no need to buy food, cost efficiency, and staying healthy while on the go. It’s the solution “for your most inconvenient meal,” and “everything your body needs.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve seen a tech- and wellness-adjacent meal replacement pitch. Remember Soylent? But the science behind meal replacement is more complicated than just packing nutrients into a bottle.\n\nFor starters, meal replacement supplements are not meant to replace food entirely. Even if a shake contains all the essential vitamins, minerals, and proteins, supplemental forms aren’t necessarily the same as what you’d get from eating whole foods. According to Stanford Medicine, absorption is generally better when those same micronutrients come from foods. Heat processing for shelf stability can also reduce potency. Since supplements aren’t regulated, evaluating sourcing, purity, and dosage can be hard without independent testing. (Huel does provide quality control information on its site, and says it’s received NSF International certification for its Black Edition product.)\n\nWhat does ‘nutritionally complete’ actually mean?\n\nTake the Black Edition of its ready-made drink: Huel says you get 7g of fiber from flaxseed, chicory, and corn. That sounds great on the surface. Most people don’t get the daily recommended 25 to 38g of fiber, 7g is high for this kind of product, and Huel includes both soluble and insoluble forms. But scientists have found that not all dietary fiber supplements are created equal. Chicory root fiber, or inulin, is often controversial as, in some people, it can cause gastrointestinal distress, inflammation, and potentially liver damage if taken in excess. In a diverse diet, you’d be getting even more forms of soluble and insoluble fiber, so some inulin might not be a problem. But if you’re prone to gas, bloating, or have irritable bowel syndrome? Heavily relying on Huel’s limited fiber sources might not be your best option.\n\nIn 2022, Huel commissioned a peer-reviewed study in Frontiers in Nutrition. In it, Huel recruited 20 participants to subsist on Huel — and only Huel — for four weeks. Good news: They didn’t die. Some micronutrient levels improved, compared to one monitored week of eating regularly. Other micronutrient levels didn’t improve. Many lost weight, reduced their BMI and waist circumference, and lost visceral fat (the bad kind).\n\nThe thing is, the study’s primary conclusion is that subsisting for four weeks on Huel won’t negatively impact your micronutrient levels. The study’s researchers also note that the weight loss and reduced BMI, waist circumference, and visceral fat were likely due to the fact that the participants consistently could not meet calorie requirements while on a Huel-only diet. It’s less that Huel was “healthy” than participants found it hard to eat a lot of Huel, and were thus in a prolonged calorie deficit.\n\nOn its site, Huel caveats that it doesn’t advocate only eating its product, but says this study “pretty conclusively” shows its product is “healthy.” But a single study in a clinical setting — which doesn’t reflect real-life use — and a limited sample size is far from conclusive. In 2024, a meta-analysis in Nutrients of 6,770 adults found that “daily and weekly [meal replacement] consumption were associated with higher risks of all-cause mortality.”\n\nI bought Huel’s ready-to-drink Black Edition in chocolate for research. It cost me roughly $18 at Target for a box of four bottles. I’ve been sipping one over the course of writing this newsletter and I cannot lie: I am on the struggle bus. After two hours of writing and researching, I still have over a quarter of the 500ml bottle left.\n\nIt tastes a bit like wet chalk. After it slithers down my gullet, there’s a distinct aftertaste in my mouth that reminds me of my time drinking chocolate Ensure. Taste is subjective, but I’m inclined to believe that the pants of Huel’s wellness influencer partners are aflame. On that marketing front, I give Huel a D.\n\nIn other areas, however, Huel is far from the worst wellness brand I’ve seen. Its study was a little silly and I don’t love that it’s framed as “conclusive.” However, on its website summarizing the study, it does disclose some of the study’s drawbacks and flaws. (It does so with a slightly positive spin, but I’ll take that information over artfully omitting it entirely.)\n\nIt has science pages for each of its individual products, which give a breakdown of each ingredient included, the reasoning behind including it, and reference links to outside studies supporting those decisions. For example, on the science site for its Black Edition powder, it breaks down why it chose peas and brown rice for protein. It explains it chose two sources because plant protein doesn’t always include all nine essential amino acids required from your diet. When it claims protein is more satiating than other macronutrients, it cites this study. Most people will not click each link, and I only had the patience to click through roughly 20 percent. Some were relatively old but well cited; others were less convincing. But, compared to other wellness brands I’ve reviewed, I appreciated that the studies were clearly labeled as references and not as Huel’s own research.\n\nCooking isn’t always fun, but it took me five hours to choke down this ‘ultimate meal in a bottle.’\n\nHuel’s biggest fault is perhaps playing fast and loose with phrasing like “nutritionally complete” and videos that suggest this is a much more convenient alternative to cooking — and that that convenience is a good thing. (Never mind that most dieticians will tell you whole food sources of nutrients are better for you.) Like Soylent, that plays into tech-adjacent productivity narratives, where somehow taking the time and effort to eat a well-balanced meal is a burden. Subtly placing that next to claims of “sustainable” “plant-based food,” and a convincing “$2.65 per meal” badge for its powder? It’s not a huge jump for someone to think, “Wow, I can be healthy, not have to cook, save money, and eat something that’s not too bad for the planet?”\n\nHuel has gotten into hot water for misleading advertising. Remember how I mentioned podcaster Steven Bartlett’s glowing testimonial earlier? Multiple ads were banned by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority because he failed to disclose that, at the time, he was a director and investor at Huel. The ASA also banned Huel ads claiming that using it as a healthy meal replacement could lead to lower food bills. Huel claimed a month’s worth was only £50. The agency found that was only true if you ate Huel once a day, and the true cost was £350.\n\nThere are some truths baked into Huel’s marketing. Meal prepping does suck. Sometimes you are too busy, and grabbing a bottle of Huel — as blah as it is — is likely cheaper, and potentially more nutrient dense, than junk food. Sometimes, meal replacement or supplementation is appropriate — especially in cases where you might not be able to eat solid food, like after a surgery or while managing a chronic illness.\n\nTake it from me, someone who did need meal replacement as an intervention at one point in my life. At no point did that process bring relief or joy. I was far from my optimal self. While I did get complimented for my dramatic weight loss, I was physically so weak that I barely had enough energy to crawl out of bed, let alone work a demanding job. Whatever savings I had from not buying food, it wasn’t worth it. At the end of the day, something like Huel is best thought of as a temporary, occasional “lesser of two evils.” That’s not the same thing as healthy.\n\nPhotography by Victoria Song / The Verge"

The two companies will be collaborating on custom models intended to power “customer-facing applications” like Alexa.\n\nIt will also make AWS a third-party provider of OpenAI Frontier, its enterprise-facing platform for building, deploying, and managing AI agents that will run on Amazon’s Trainium chips. Amazon is investing just $15 billion up front, with the additional $35 billion being delivered as certain milestones are met. Rumors have indicated that, like its deal with Microsoft, those milestones include mentions of reaching AGI.\n\nOpenAI went out of its way to reiterate its commitment to its partnership with Microsoft. But a reworking of the deal between the two companies is what has allowed OpenAI to pursue the partnership with Amazon, as Microsoft has also reached farther afield and begun working with Anthropic.\n\nIn the midst of all this, the company is rumored to be launching a smart speaker in early 2027, striking content deals with Disney, and fending off growing competition from the likes of Anthropic and Google. It’s also potentially working towards an IPO, as CEO Sam Altman told CNBC that, “We are open to going public at the right time.”"

            "content": "Just months after Netflix struck a deal to acquire the Warner Bros. studio, HBO, HBO Max, and Warner Games, the streaming giant has backed out of the arrangement, declining to raise its offer beyond Paramount’s “best and final” bid.\n\nIt’s just the latest twist in the acquisition saga, which started with a bidding war that reportedly also involved Apple, Amazon, and Comcast. Once Netflix and Warner Bros. came to an agreement on December 5th, Paramount tried to force its way into the deal, announcing a hostile bid worth $108.4 billion in cash. Unlike Netflix’s deal, Paramount’s includes an acquisition of all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its cable networks.\n\nBut after several rejections, Paramount persistently upped its bid. It eventually came back with an all-cash offer at $31 per share and promised to cover the $7 billion regulatory termination fee if its deal with WBD doesn’t close, along with the $2.87 billion termination fee it must pay Netflix for abandoning its deal. Warner Bros. Discovery determined that the deal is “superior,” leading Netflix to walk away, saying it’s “no longer financially attractive.”"

            "content": "is a senior reviewer covering TVs and audio. He has over 20 years experience in AV, and has previously been on staff at Digital Trends and Reviewed.\n\nSince I saw the TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV at a pre-CES event in December, I’ve been eager to get a close look at it in my living room. At first glance, the TV impressed me enough that I named it the best TV of CES 2026.\n\nFrom the moment I completed Google TV setup and started watching the TCL X11L I was amazed. I could immediately tell it’s the brightest TV I’ve had in my home, but it was the color vibrancy that I found most impressive. The colors we’re all most familiar with — skin tones, the sky, green grass and trees — all look as close to realistic as I’ve seen on a TV. And with the color vibrancy it looks staggeringly good.\n\nIt’s a flagship TV unlike any other that TCL has made, with vibrant colors and incredible blooming control. It competes with flagships from all the major TV manufacturers — including the Sony Bravia 9, LG G5, and Samsung S95F — and it gets brighter than any of them. But it’s also expensive, with the 75-inch model I tested going for $7,000, and the 85- and 98-inch versions for $8,000 and $10,000, respectively. And with a bunch of RGB LED TVs on the way this year, for likely comparable prices, you might want to wait before committing to the X11L.\n\nWhile the TV industry leans into RGB LED — and TCL is too, on other TVs — TCL’s flagship instead uses an evolution of mini-LED technology. The X11L uses blue LEDs for its backlight with super quantum dots (hence the SQD) and an upgraded color filter that together provide the widest gamut coverage we’ve ever seen from a mini-LED TV. Both technologies should have similar light output and color performance, although the individual red, green, and blue LED backlights of RGB LEDs could deliver more accurate colors — or they could have visible color crosstalk issues. We won’t know until RGB LED TVs are more readily available. What we do know is that mini-LED is a proven technology, and that TCL has made significant improvements to its performance with the X11L.\n\nIt also has a higher-end design than previous TCL TVs, with a solid metal frame and uniform thickness across the chassis that’s just about an inch deep. It uses a B&O audio system, including front-firing speakers along the bottom of the TV that deliver clear dialogue and, with the built-in subwoofers, surprisingly deep and booming bass. (The system can also be expanded with TCL’s Z100 FlexConnect speakers, which I’ll be testing soon.)\n\nTCL X11L specs Display type: Mini LED with super quantum dots Backlight: Blue LEDs HDR formats: Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10, HLG OS: Google TV HDMI inputs: 4 x HDMI 2.1 (one with eARC/ARC) Audio support: Dolby Atmos, DTS Virtual X Gaming features: 4K/144Hz, VRR (up to 288Hz), ALLM, FreeSync Premium Pro Sizes available (inches): 75, 85, 98\n\nFilmmaker mode is, as usual, the most accurate according to my testing. Grayscale performance is the best I’ve seen from TCL, with the only perceptible issue being that it crushes black a bit. With default settings, the TCL tracks a little under the EOTF curve (meaning as the gray approaches white, it isn’t quite as bright as it should be). When I increased the brightness from the default 50 to 70, it tracked the EOTF almost perfectly and still tracked grayscale very well, apart from the small near black issue, which was still a little too dim. It’s not quite as accurate as the LG G5 OLED, but it’s comparable to the Sony Bravia 9. And even in Filmmaker, the TCL can get significantly brighter than either.\n\nDefault Filmmaker mode isn’t the brightest of the modes available, with a 10 percent window peaking at 2,789 nits, but the X11L can easily get brighter. With my Konica Minolta LS-100 luminance meter (which is more reliable over 6,000 nits than either my colorimeter and spectrophotometer) I measured just over 8,800 nits from a 5 percent window in Filmmaker with brightness at 100, local contrast at high, and peak brightness set to boost. By comparison, the mini-LED TCL QM9K hit 5,844 nits, and the brightest OLED of last year, the LG G5, topped out at 2,340 nits, both also in Filmmaker mode.\n\nWith the highest peak brightness I’ve ever measured, the X11L certainly does light the lights.\n\nWhile it’s great that the TV can hit that, especially in its most accurate color mode, for the vast majority of people and their living rooms it isn’t necessary. For most of my viewing I set the brightness at 70, local contrast at medium, and peak brightness at high. If I had the light off, I sometimes turned the brightness down further because the extra brightness wasn’t necessary for the situation.\n\nChanging the brightness is quicker than on any other TV because TCL added brightness buttons (and a picture mode button) to the side of the remote. It’s something probably most appreciated by reviewers and display nerds like myself, but I can’t overstate my joy when I first saw the buttons. Otherwise it’s just like last year’s TCL TV remote, including an input select button, a mic for voice commands, and a settings button, and it’s backlit.\n\nThe backlit remote is similar to last year’s, with useful buttons including input select, and… …new brightness and picture mode select buttons on the side of the remote are the best addition since remote backlighting.\n\nI know a lot of TV reviewers, and some of them told me Movie mode is more accurate than Filmmaker on their samples, so I went back and did some more testing. And while Movie mode is brighter at its default settings, it wasn’t as accurate in my testing. But while comparing the two modes, I did notice that as the day went on, the red channel of the grayscale became slightly less accurate.\n\nI re-ran my normal barrage of tests first thing in the morning, and they were close to the very accurate measurements when I first set up the TV. I then left the TV on the Olympics for four hours before re-measuring with the same tests, and sure enough, the red channel measurements in the grayscale test were lower than they were in the morning. Now, while the change shows up in testing, the difference is minor and happens over the course of hours. It’s not something I noticed during my time watching the TV. Still, if you’re considering a $7,000 TV, this feels like something you might want to know about.\n\nHow I test TVs I set up each TV in my living room on my home theater credenza. I stream movies and shows through the TV’s apps, play discs on a Magnetar UDP900 MkII 4K Blu-Ray player (including the Spears & Munsil Ultra HD Benchmark disc) and movies from a Kaleidescape Strato V player, and play games on my Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. This is done at different times of the day and under different lighting conditions, with curtains open, with lamps and overhead lights on, or with blackout curtains up to keep the room dark. While I am a certified ISF Level 3 calibrator, I do not calibrate the TVs before measurement, as the overwhelming majority of TV owners don’t bother. So it’s important to know how well the TVs perform out of the box, with minor tweaks in the menu anyone can do. For measurement, I use Portrait Displays’ Calman color calibration software, a Murideo 8K Seven pattern generator, an X-rite i1 Pro 3 spectrophotometer, Portrait Displays’ C6 HDR5000 colorimeter, a Konica Minolta LS-100 luminance meter, and Leo Bodnar 4K lag tester.\n\nOn the contrary, everything I watched on the X11L during my time with it was spectacular. The fire and explosions during the desert chase in Mad Max: Fury Road look dazzling. The lush green trees of Rivendell are inviting and realistic. And the blooming control is by far the best I’ve seen from a mini LED, even better than last year’s TCL flagship, the QM9K. There’s a sharp separation between bright elements that are right next to black. It’s still not at the level that OLED can achieve with its pixel-level control, but its performance is closer than it’s ever been.\n\nThe X11L arrived at my home the Friday before the Super Bowl, and I used it to watch a bunch of events during the Winter Olympics. Through all of it, the TV has handled the fast motion extremely well. Sports picture mode adds motion compensation and some clarity settings — noise reduction, super resolution, and sharpness — but is far too blue for my tastes. Instead, I left it in Filmmaker mode and turned on some of those settings while watching sports, which is easy to do in the Picture Settings menu. Motion compensation at low was enough to make a football pass or triple lutz smooth without looking artificial, although bumping it up to medium was too much. The noise reduction and super resolution settings improved 1080p broadcast TV signals by upscaling the image and cleaning up unwanted artifacts. I wouldn’t put the processing at the same level as Sony, but it’s definitely better than I’ve seen from TCL before.\n\nGoogle OS on the X11L also runs smoothly. The apps I used regularly — HBO Max, Prime Video, Peacock, and Netflix — all booted up quickly, and navigation was snappy. The X11L is also an excellent gaming TV, handling motion well and supporting high frame rates from consoles and PC. I spent time on the road in Forza Horizon 5 and F1 24 on both my Xbox Series X and my PC and never experienced screen tearing or smearing. I also never had any issue with input lag.\n\nThe X11L uses Google TV as its operating system, which runs quickly and smoothly. The X11L has front-facing B&O speakers behind a grille that runs the length of the TV. Colors on the TCL are absolutely stunning, and images look incredibly realistic.\n\nWith every TV manufacturer hyping RGB LED TVs this year — and TCL itself releasing an RGB LED TV this year — it may seem like a gamble to stick with mini LED for its flagship, even if it does push the technology forward. We won’t know for sure until the bevy of RGB LED TVs is released if the claims of their color accuracy and brightness will prove true with actual content, not just carefully curated demo screens.\n\nBut maybe the fact that TCL’s choice of mini-LED for the X11L is a hint that RGB LED isn’t quite ready to overtake mini LED — if it ever does. We also don’t know how the X11L will compare to the pricing of 2026 RGB LED TVs. Last year’s 100-inch Hisense UX is currently available for $13,000 (down from $20,000), which is still considerably higher than the $10,000 TCL is asking for the 98-inch X11L.\n\nBased on my experience with it over the past couple weeks, though, the TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV is poised to be the best TV of the year. At the very least, what TCL has been able to achieve by pushing mini-LED technology forward is incredibly impressive.\n\nEven though it’s an incredible TV to watch, it’s hard to recommend someone go out and buy the X11L right now, especially since we don’t yet know how it will stack up to RGB LED. Historically, TCL TV prices come down quite a bit as the year goes on. The 85-inch X11K from last year, which started at $10,000, can now be found for $3,500, so there’s a good chance we’ll see the same with the X11L. If it manages to get within $1,000 of the Bravia 9 or LG G5, the X11L is worth it.\n\nPhotography by John Higgins / The Verge"

Now the agency has replaced its top acting leader, a CISA spokesperson tells TechCrunch.\n\nThe move to replace Madhu Gottumukkala as the acting director of CISA, an agency under the Department of Homeland Security that oversees cybersecurity and technical protection across the federal government, comes after a tumultuous year serving as the agency’s top boss.\n\nGottumukkala struggled to lead the agency during his tenure as acting director and caused security headaches, including the uploading of sensitive government documents to ChatGPT, according to reports. Staffing at the agency was slashed by one-third. Gottumukkala also reportedly failed a counterintelligence polygraph he took in order to view classified documents, and suspended several career officials in response, including the agency’s then-chief security officer.\n\nBefore being nominated to CISA as deputy director, Gottumukkala was chief technology officer of South Dakota under then-governor and current Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.\n\nABC News was first to report Gottumukkala’s departure.\n\nIn a statement shared with TechCrunch on Friday, CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy claimed Gottumukkala had done a “remarkable job.” McCarthy told TechCrunch that Nick Andersen will replace Gottumukkala as CISA’s new acting director, and that Gottumukkala has been moved to a new position as director of strategic implementation in the Department of Homeland Security, which houses CISA.\n\nPrior to his appointment as acting director to lead CISA, Andersen previously served as the agency’s top official overseeing its cybersecurity division.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Ron Wyden last year blocked Plankey’s nomination until the agency agreed to release an unclassified report allegedly describing cybersecurity flaws at phone and telecommunication giants. Wyden demanded the report’s release in the wake of hundreds of hacks targeting U.S. and international phone and internet providers by the China-backed hacking group known as Salt Typhoon. The Senate has yet to schedule Plankey’s nomination hearing.\n\nNextgov reported Thursday that CISA lost another top senior official, Bob Costello, the agency’s chief information officer tasked with overseeing the agency’s IT systems and data policies. The news outlet reported Gottumukkala tried to transfer Costello but was blocked by unnamed political appointees.\n\nCISA’s spokesperson McCarthy did not address Costello’s departure when asked by TechCrunch, but did not dispute the report."

Similar to the streaming giant’s Music and Podcast Charts, the Audiobook Charts will be updated weekly and highlight the top audiobooks overall and by genre. These rankings are based on listening behavior and engagement on the streaming service, the company says.\n\nThe new charts are accessible to both free and paying users within the audiobooks hub. You can find them by tapping the search button in the app and selecting the “Audiobooks” tile to enter the hub. Then, you need to scroll down to the “Dive deeper” section to find the charts.\n\nThe move marks Spotify’s latest investment in the audiobooks space, following its official support of the format in 2022.\n\nSince then, Spotify has continued investing in audiobooks with additional features like the recently-launched “Page Match” tool, which lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook, and “Audiobook Recaps,” which are short audio summaries to catch you up on what you’ve already read so far.\n\nSpotify says the new Audiobook Charts will benefit both readers and authors by giving listeners a trusted way to discover popular titles, while also creating new opportunities for authors and the publishing industry to reach wider audiences.\n\n“As we’ve proven with Music and Podcasts Charts, when content is easier to access, discover, and enjoy, the demand grows,” said Duncan Bruce, Spotify’s Director of Audiobook Partnerships and Licensing, in a blog post. “We are delighted to now bring that to audiobooks, to help provide even more ways for users, publishers, and authors to discover what’s trending on Spotify, and make books more connected with culture in real time.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that Spotify isn’t only interested in audiobooks, as the streaming giant also recently ventured into physical book sales. Spotify announced earlier this month that users in the U.S. and the U.K. will soon be able to purchase physical copies of books directly within the app through a partnership with Bookshop.org."

Other investors include Peak XV Partners, Info Edge Ventures, and Dharana Capital, alongside angel investors such as Vijay Shekhar Sharma of Paytm, Kunal Shah of CRED, Nithin Kamath and Nikhil Kamath of Zerodha, as well as current and former Eternal executives including Akshant Goyal, Aditya Mangla, Kunal Swarup, Akriti Chopra, and Rahul Ganjoo.\n\nGoyal stepped down as chief executive of Zomato and its parent, Eternal, in January, handing the role to Albinder Dhindsa, who leads the quick-commerce unit Blinkit. The move marked a major transition for Goyal after nearly two decades at the helm of the food delivery company he co-founded in 2008.\n\nTemple is one of the clearest expressions yet of that shift. The startup is focused on building a high-performance wearable for elite athletes, an area Goyal has described as ripe for deeper technological innovation.\n\nDuring a January conversation with podcaster Raj Shamani, Goyal described Temple’s wearable as a sensor designed to sit on the wearer’s temple and continuously track cerebral blood flow.\n\nIn a separate post on X earlier Friday, he said Temple aims to build what he called “the ultimate wearable for elite performance athletes,” claiming the device would measure metrics that existing wearables cannot. He also outlined an expansive hiring push spanning embedded systems, computational neuroscience, and brain–computer interface engineering.\n\nWe're recruiting at @temple.\n\n\n\nAt Temple, we are building the ultimate wearable for elite performance athletes. A device that measures what no other wearable in the world measures, with a level of precision that doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\nTo build it, we need people who are obsessive… pic.twitter.com/iCHaMUwdEw — Deepinder Goyal (@deepigoyal) February 27, 2026\n\nThe startup is entering an increasingly crowded and well-funded wearables market, where companies such as Whoop, Oura, and Garmin have spent years refining devices that track sleep, recovery, and athletic performance. Whether Temple can meaningfully differentiate its technology remains an open question.\n\nThe push into Temple is part of a broader shift in Goyal’s investment focus. In October 2025, he said he had committed $25 million of his own capital to another new venture, Continue Research, which is exploring ways to extend human lifespan. He is also a co-founder of aviation startup LAT Aerospace, which recently expanded into defense technology with the acquisition of early-stage firm Sharang Shakti.\n\nGoyal built his reputation at Zomato, which he co-founded with Pankaj Chaddah and spent nearly two decades building into one of India’s largest food delivery platforms before stepping down as chief executive earlier this year.\n\nChaddah exited the company in 2018, as Zomato continued to consolidate its position through acquisitions, including the purchase of Uber Eats’ India business in 2020 and grocery delivery platform Blinkit — then known as Grofers — for $568 million in 2022.\n\nBefore Temple, Goyal had also backed health and fitness startups, including Ultrahuman, an India-based wearable maker that competes with Oura’s smart ring, underscoring his growing focus on performance and health technology.\n\nGoyal declined to comment further on Temple."

            "content": "OpenAI has raised $110 billion in private funding, the company announced Friday morning, commencing one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The new funding consists of a $50 billion investment from Amazon as well as $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, against a $730 billion pre-money valuation.\n\nNotably, the round remains open, and OpenAI expects more investors to join as it proceeds.\n\n“We are entering a new phase where frontier AI moves from research into daily use at global scale,” OpenAI said. “Leadership will be defined by who can scale infrastructure fast enough to meet demand, and turn that capacity into products people rely on.”\n\nAs part of the investment, OpenAI is launching significant infrastructure partnerships with both Amazon and Nvidia. As in previous rounds, it is likely that a significant portion of the dollar amount comes in the form of services rather than cash, although the precise split was not disclosed.\n\nThe company’s previous round closed in March 2025, raising $40 billion against a $300 billion valuation. At the time, it was the largest private funding round on record.\n\nAs part of its Amazon partnership, OpenAI plans to develop a new “stateful runtime environment” where OpenAI models will run on Amazon’s Bedrock platform. The company will also expand its previously announced AWS partnership, which committed $38 billion in compute services, by $100 billion. OpenAI has committed to consuming at least 2GW of AWS Tranium compute as part of the deal, and also plans to build custom models to support Amazon consumer products.\n\n“We have lots of developers and companies eager to run services powered by OpenAI models on AWS,” said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a statement, “and our unique collaboration with OpenAI to provide stateful runtime environments will change what’s possible for customers building AI apps and agents.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

OpenAI’s announcement confirms the funding split, but says only that the additional $35 billion will arrive “in the coming months when certain conditions are met.”\n\nOpenAI gave fewer details on the Nvidia partnership, but said it had committed to using “3GW of dedicated inference capacity and 2GW of training on Vera Rubin systems” as part of the deal.\n\nNvidia’s participation in the round has been the subject of intense speculation, particularly as reports of a $100 billion investment in September gave way to reports of a smaller investment in the months that followed.\n\nIn January, Huang dismissed the idea that Nvidia was backing away from OpenAI, saying, “we will invest a great deal of money. I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible.”"

            "content": "A rise in the need for computers and data centers to power AI is causing a massive shortage of RAM, driving memory prices sharply higher. Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest single-year dip in more than a decade. Hours after IDC published its report, another analyst firm, Counterpoint, made a similar prediction and said the market will dip by 12% this year.\n\nEarlier this year, IDC reported that manufacturers shipped 1.26 billion devices in 2025. The firm predicts that figure will drop to just 1.12 billion this year.\n\n“The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping the long‑term TAM [total addressable market], the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, in a statement.\n\nImage Credits:IDC\n\nPopal said that because of memory shortage, the average retail price of a smartphone is expected to rise by 14%.\n\n“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, smartphone ASP [average selling price] is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she added.\n\nPopal also noted that rising component costs could make the sub-$100 smartphone “permanently uneconomical,” pricing out phone makers that manufacture devices at that price point.\n\nThe firm said that, because of this trend, shipments in the Middle East and Africa will drop more than 20% year-over-year. China and the broader Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan) will also see declines of 10.5% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Lower-end smartphones are likely to be affected the most, especially as LPDDR4 supply is shrinking faster than expected. OEMs are already responding with launch delays, streamlined portfolios, and specification trade-offs. We have also observed 10% to 20% price increases across some Android OEM portfolios in January 2026,” Principal Analyst Yang Wang said.\n\nImage Credits: Counterpoint\n\nThe firm also predicted that pricing volatility amid handsets will also drive the second-hand devices market up.\n\nEarlier this year, Nothing co-founder and CEO Carl Pei also warned that smartphones will cost more in 2026 as memory costs for smartphones rise. “Brands now face a simple choice: raise prices by 30% or more in some cases, or downgrade specs. The ‘more specs for less money’ model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.\n\n“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei added."

            "content": "After years of appeals, Google has finally received conditional approval to export high-precision geographic information out of South Korea, a move that opens the door to let the company provide proper Google Maps services in the country, such as walking and real-time driving directions.\n\nThe move reverses a long-standing policy on data restrictions that had essentially made Google Maps and Apple Maps non-functional in the country. Google has so far provided maps services in South Korea using high-resolution, 1:5,000 scale map data, but without the ability to export that data to its servers, the company couldn’t offer features like turn-by-turn navigation or detailed listings for businesses.\n\nSouth Korea has resisted Google’s appeals since 2011, arguing that the company’s precise satellite maps could endanger national security by exposing sensitive military sites when combined with commercial imagery and online data. Given that South Korea remains technically at war with North Korea, the government is cautious about exposing such locations, and had until now demanded Google set up a data center in the country and obscure sensitive locations.\n\nThe green light comes with strict rules designed to protect sensitive military and infrastructure sites. The South Korean government will verify compliance before any data leaves the country; any images of South Korean territory used in Google Maps and Google Earth must comply with national security regulations; and historical imagery in Google Earth and Street View must obscure sensitive military sites. Google is also required to either remove or limit coordinate data for South Korean locations, and only essential data for navigation and routing can be exported.\n\nThe government also requires all data processing to be done on servers operated by Google’s local partners. Sensitive topographic and military data remain off-limits, and any updates to military or security sites must be carried out promptly on domestic servers at the government’s request.\n\nGoogle did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe move will no doubt send ripples through Korea’s domestic maps market, which has seen local navigation apps such as Naver Map, T Map, and Kakao Map thrive in the relative absence of providers like Google or Apple.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The government is urging Google to help grow South Korea’s geospatial industry so that exporting the data benefits not just the tech giant, but also domestic innovation and economic growth.\n\nGoogle has not yet said if it would set up a data center in South Korea. The company operates an array of data centers in Asia, including in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and Malaysia.\n\nThe government also outlined new measures to handle potential security incidents related to the export of high-resolution maps. The ministry said it would work with Google to set up a “security incident prevention and response framework” to manage potential risks before any data leaves the country. For situations involving imminent threats to national security, a technical “red button” mechanism will be implemented, allowing for rapid emergency response.\n\nIn addition, South Korea will require a local officer to be stationed in-country to maintain constant communication with the government and ensure smooth handling of any security incidents."

            "content": "Ultrahuman on Friday unveiled a new smart ring with longer battery life and a redesigned form factor, as the Bengaluru-based wearable maker seeks to revive its U.S. business that was disrupted last year by a patent dispute with rival Oura.\n\nThe Ring Pro, Ultrahuman’s third-generation smart ring, offers up to 15 days of battery life — compared with four to six days on the Ring Air — and is priced at $479. It will be available for pre-orders globally, excluding the U.S., with shipments beginning in March.\n\nUltrahuman’s U.S. business was disrupted in October 2025 after the U.S. International Trade Commission — a federal agency that handles trade disputes — ruled in Oura’s favor in a patent dispute. The ruling prevented the startup from importing new ring inventory into the country, although existing retail stock continued to be sold. The blow was significant. The U.S. accounted for about 45% of Ultrahuman’s roughly 700,000 daily active users worldwide, according to co-founder and CEO Mohit Kumar.\n\nIn August 2025, Ultrahuman also filed a separate patent infringement case against Oura in the Delhi High Court, where the matter remains pending.\n\nMeanwhile, to work around Oura’s patent, Ultrahuman developed the Ring Pro with a new design, Kumar told TechCrunch, adding that the device has been submitted to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance. U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance to confirm it can legally be imported into the country.\n\nDespite the U.S. disruption, Ultrahuman is currently operating at an annualized revenue run rate of about $150 million, Kumar said. It reported $64 million in operating revenue in the financial year ended March 2025. The startup remains profitable after tax, although margins are expected to narrow due to litigation costs, tariffs, and the redesign effort, he added.\n\nAlongside the new ring, Ultrahuman introduced Jade, a real-time “biointelligence” system that analyzes user health data across its devices and services to generate personalized insights and recommendations.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The device can store up to 250 days of health data and weighs about 5% to 6% more than the Ring Air, launched in July 2023 at $349.\n\nUltrahuman has also introduced a Pro Charger with up to 45 days of battery life to support on-the-go charging and enable faster updates and diagnostics through direct case connectivity. The charger also supports wireless charging via Qi, the same standard used by most modern smartphones.\n\nUltrahuman’s Pro Charger Image Credits:Ultrahuman\n\nWomen account for about 68% of Ultrahuman’s user base, up from roughly 65% a year earlier, Kumar said, reflecting strong adoption of the startup’s women’s health features.\n\nUltrahuman also offers subscription-based services across its broader health platform, including a coaching and recovery program called PowerPlugs, the Blood Vision metabolic panel, Ultrahuman Home, and a continuous glucose monitoring offering. Subscriptions contribute about 16% of Ultrahuman’s revenue, while Blood Vision accounts for roughly 5% to 6% of the business, Kumar said.\n\nUltrahuman’s key growth markets include the UK, Canada, Australia, and India, Kumar told TechCrunch, with the latter contributing about 8% to 9% of overall revenue after recent investments in local customer support.\n\nGlobal smart ring shipments grew nearly 80% year-over-year in 2025, driven by demand for compact wearables with advanced sleep tracking and longer battery life, said Anshika Jain, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. Oura continues to lead with more than two-thirds of the market, while Ultrahuman holds the second position.\n\nJain added that future leaders in the category will be defined by sensor accuracy, AI-driven insights, and seamless ecosystem integration.\n\nSeparate IDC data showed global smart ring shipments rising about 30% year over year in Q3 2025 to nearly 1 million units, driven in part by demand for screenless fitness trackers, said Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India. Ultrahuman captured roughly 25% of the market during the period, per IDC.\n\nFounded in 2019, Ultrahuman has raised about $55 million to date and counts Alpha Wave Incubation, Blume Ventures, Steadview Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners among its investors.\n\nUltrahuman, Kumar said, is building additional production capacity to support demand for the Ring Pro over the coming months."

            "content": "Before last week the name Alap Shah didn’t ring a bell for many people. The 45-year-old financial analyst and tech entrepreneur had spent the past two decades working in relative obscurity. Then last weekend he coauthored a blog with the research firm Citrini titled “The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis.” It was a “thought exercise” about the impacts of artificial intelligence, and it predicted that in June of that year, AI would jack up unemployment past 10 percent and force the Dow down, down, down. Writing in a confident, Nostradamic tone—as if auditioning for starring roles in the next Michael Lewis book—the authors painted a picture of a flywheel in reverse: AI agents take jobs from workers, people spend less, and struggling corporations conduct layoffs on top of layoffs.\n\nThere wasn’t much in it that hadn’t been previously heard, or speculated about. Tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have already estimated that half the entry level white collar jobs will soon be gone, and earlier this year, Anthropic’s release of new agentic tools spurred a Wall Street selloff. Nonetheless the report hit with the force of the blizzard blowing through lower Manhattan. When the closing chimes sounded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow was down 800 points. The name Alap Shah was now ringing bells.\n\nThe achievement is less impressive than it seems. Wall Street, like the rest of us, is in a persistent state of anxiety about AI, and it doesn’t take much to trigger a mini-panic. Financial markets don’t necessarily map to reality, but the jitters reflect a wider disquiet. The AI future is in a William Gibson zone—it’s here, but unevenly distributed—and the news from those already living in the agent-packed, AI code-writing universe is both exciting and unsettling. Emphasis on unsettling.\n\nNo one—no one!—knows exactly how AI will impact the economy, but clearly it will be significant. Right now stocks are soaring, so it seems to make sense to keep the party going. But then along comes the latest doom manifesto, or a paper indicating that a traditional business sector might be threatened by AI, and suddenly money managers are reminded that the biggest issue of our time is totally unresolved. Case in point: earlier this month, a tiny company (valuation under $6 million) that had previously sold karaoke machines pivoted to AI-powered shipping logistics and put out a report saying that it had discovered some efficiencies in loading semi-trucks. That was enough to erase billions of dollars from the share prices of several major logistics companies, none of which had karaoke experience.\n\nAfter it did its job on Wall Street, the Citrini report came under considerable fire. Critics climbed over each other to proclaim its flimsiness. For one thing, they pointed out, AI has had very little discernable impact on the economy so far. Others cited the long history of resilience after technological upheavals. A mocking response by the respected trading firm Citadel Securities read, “For AI to produce a sustained negative demand shock, the economy must see a material acceleration in adoption, experience near-total labor substitution, no fiscal response, negligible investment absorption, and unconstrained scaling of compute.”\n\nThe most withering critiques disputed the report’s contention that much of the economy involves non-productive “rent-seeking” by middlemen and market makers, taking advantage of the laziness of the general population. When everyone has a few dozen AI agents working on their behalf, writes Shah, consumers will be able to effortlessly find the best goods for the best prices. Apps will be rendered unnecessary—just type what you want into the LLM and an army of agents will do everything for you. The “poster child” for this phenomenon, Shah says, is DoorDash. Instead of being limited to the restaurants on the app, consumers will send out AI agents to find their ideal meal options, contracting directly with restaurants and delivery people—no apps needed. Zero friction! The DoorDashes of the world are avocado toast!"

In my opinion, Aventon has made the least ebikey bike on the ebike market, which provides the most fun I’ve yet had riding an electrically powered bicycle. (Sorry, I couldn’t in good conscience write “ebike” in that sentence a third time.)\n\nThe Soltera 3 is a class 1 electric bike, meaning it has a top speed of 20 miles per hour. (Motor-assisted, of course. Your legs combined with a downhill can get this thing going a whole lot faster.) It also lacks any sort of throttle control. However, the bike's pedal assist is super responsive and offers immediate aid with the slightest bit of rider input.\n\nIt has a claimed range of up to 70 miles—though, given how hilly my area is and how much assistance I typically use on an ebike, I got closer to 50 on a full charge—and takes less than two hours to charge its integrated battery from flat to full.\n\nCarbon Belt\n\nPhotograph: Michael Venutolo-Mantovani\n\nOK, now that all of the spec sheet info is out of the way, we can talk about the coolest part of the Soltera 3: It has a carbon belt in place of a chain."

            "content": "The new wave of AI-powered technologies have almost entirely taken over the apps and digital services we use every day, from photo editors to fitness trackers. There's even a notable AI app available for podcasts too. It’s called Huxe.\n\nAt the core of Huxe is a daily brief, a sort of personal productivity podcast tailored to your tastes and requirements, generated from the sources you pick. Connect up your calendar and email account, and every morning you get a quick audio summary to get you set for the day. The idea is that a 15-minute audio podcast can replace the much longer amount of time you'd otherwise spend trying to figure out what's happening with your inbox and your schedule.\n\nThe audio emphasis of Huxe is no surprise, as the team behind the app previously worked on Google NotebookLM, a research tool that has its own podcast-style Audio Overviews feature. Huxe is similar, but it draws information from your emails and calendar entries.\n\nThere's more to Huxe as well, including audio deep dives on any topic of your choice, as well as news summaries. The app is completely free to use right now, and you can sign up through the apps for Android or iOS.\n\nGetting Started\n\n***01-interests.jpg\n\nRegistering interests with Huxe.\n\n(David Nield)\n\nTo start taking advantage of Huxe’s personalized audio production powers, you need to tell it a little bit about yourself. As you work through the setup process, which includes supplying an email address and your name, you'll be prompted to connect your email and calendar accounts. (Google and Outlook accounts are both supported.)\n\nYou'll also be asked to choose a few topics that you're interested in from a list, generated by what's in your inbox and on your schedule—click Edit to make changes, and Add to add interests that Huxe hasn't picked up on yet. You can specify pretty much any topic you like, and Huxe will understand what you mean.\n\nWhen you get into the app proper, you are introduced to what are called livecasts, which are like radio stations for AI-generated speech content: For me, these livecasts have titles such as Big Tech Roundup, Today in AI, and Product Drops, which gives you some idea of what to expect. You can also get audio summaries about specific companies, such as Apple and Meta in my case.\n\n***02-deepcast.jpg\n\nDeepCasts can be created with a single text prompt.\n\n(David Nield)\n\nUsing the menu button in the top right corner, you can change your account settings and edit your interests, as well as change the voices used for the hosts of your daily brief. Via the + (plus) button in the lower right corner, you're able to generate a DeepCast (a deep dive) on the topic of your choosing, as well as your own live stations.\n\nI tried to get the app to give me a DeepCast on the history of the band R.E.M., and it produced a relatively insightful and perfectly accurate (if a little generic) 15-minute clip in just a few seconds. As with the Audio Overviews in NotebookLM, you get two AI characters talking to each other about the subject at hand, podcast-style.\n\nAs always with any app that connects to your email and calendar, you're trusting the developer to handle your data responsibly. The full Huxe privacy policy is here, and while there's obviously a lot of data recorded—which is what makes the daily briefing and the other features work—the company says it won't use any personally identifiable email or calendar data to train its AI models. According to the privacy policy, there’s still a possibility some of your data is being shared with third-party LLM and voice synthesis partners—each of which have their privacy policies—that help Huxe make your podcasts. So take a hard look at what sorts of sensitive things are in your email inbox and your calendar before handing over permissions.\n\nYour Daily Briefing\n\n***03-brief.jpg\n\nThe daily brief combines emails, news, and appointments.\n\n(David Nield)\n\nYou can wait for Huxe to deliver a briefing every morning (you'll get a notification when it's ready), or you can generate one right away by tapping the play button in the center of the app's home screen. These briefings typically include a summary of what's in your inbox, the latest news relevant to your interests, and the next events on your calendar."

            "content": "Blood pressure is simultaneously the least exciting yet one of the most important vital signs that a fitness tracker can measure. Unlike a pedometer or sports watch, it’s not going to incentivize you to get active. Unlike a continuous glucose monitor, it’s not going to help you lose weight. A gigantic blood pressure cuff isn’t exactly a gorgeous or enticing accessory to wear. In fact, getting your arm squeezed so tight can be downright claustrophobic.\n\nBut there’s a reason why blood pressure is one of the first tests you get at the doctor’s office. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is one of the top killers in the United States. It can result in conditions like heart attacks or strokes. There are usually no symptoms; hypertension is called “the silent killer” for a reason. Nearly one in three people worldwide has it. And unlike diseases like cancer, we already have simple, readily available tools to treat it, like exercise and reducing the amount of salt that you eat.\n\nLast year, a few fitness trackers debuted hypertension notifications in their suite of features—most notably, the Apple Watch. Unlike the Apple Watch, the Aktiia Hilo band does not merely notify you when you have signs of hypertension. It monitors your blood pressure up to 25 times a day, 24 hours a day. Aktiia reached out to me for testing when it launched; WIRED is the first in the United States to test it. This device could change many lives for the better when it goes on sale in the US later this year. (It's available now in some countries.)\n\nLight and Sound\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nThe Aktiia Hilo comes in two parts—the slim, cuffless band you wear every day and a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuff you use to calibrate the device every month or so. Both have to be connected to the Hilo app (iOS, Android). Once both are connected, the app will remind you to abstain from alcohol, caffeine, and exercise for at least 30 minutes beforehand and to sit and relax with your back supported for at least five minutes."

            "content": "When Netflix dropped the first season of Love Is Blind in February 2020, it offered a reprieve from the washboard abs that normally seem like a casting requirement for reality TV shows.\n\nThe premise—that couples get engaged “sight unseen” after talking to each other through pods, then, following a big reveal, decide if they want to get married—featured just the right amount of mess. Who can forget Jessica allowing her dog to sip wine or an insulted Carlton throwing his fiancee's engagement ring into a pool? Meanwhile Lauren and Cameron's unvarnished conversations highlighted the awkwardness that sometimes accompanies interracial dating.\n\nIt was a reality show, but it seemed like a format that could actually allow people to fall in love without getting bogged down in superficial distractions and expectations. Maybe.\n\nNow in its 10th season, Love Is Blind is a cornerstone of Netflix’s reality TV cinematic universe. But while each cycle brings us standout women who earnestly buy into the show’s original conceit, it’s getting tougher to find any men to root for.\n\nWith the latest US season featuring Chris Fusco, who voluntarily compares himself to Andrew Tate and derides a fellow male cast member for being “submissive,” and Alex Henderson, a Trump-loving crypto bro with an ever-shifting backstory, increasingly the men of Love Is Blind seem to have been plucked straight from the manosphere.\n\nSeason after season, the women on the show (and viewers at home) are subjected to men who make shallow, body-shaming comments, struggle with anger and emotional regulation, and sometimes appear uncomfortable with their partner’s success.\n\nWhile race still comes up, it’s often in a superficial and offensive way. Contestants either find themselves struggling with the fact that their match is a person of color, or dealing with unaddressed internalized racism that downplays their own worth while prioritizing whiteness in a partner—a worthwhile topic that deserves far more nuance or a therapist’s involvement.\n\nBroadly, Love Is Blind seems to be pushing conservative ideals—trad wives, divorce shaming, and big families even when contestants clearly aren’t enthusiastic about the idea of having kids.\n\nKinetic Content, which produces Love Is Blind, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen 28-year-old Emma Betsinger of the current Ohio season discusses the scars on her arms—a result of surgeries due to her birthmarks—with podmate Steven Sunday, a 32-year-old who works in finance, he grills her about how she lost her virginity instead of asking thoughtful questions. Betsinger’s health issues have made her hesitant to have children, but instead of taking her at her word, the men she dates stress that she would make a great mother.\n\nThen there’s fast-talking Henderson, 31, who, despite not having a job besides the day trading he claims to do, expects his fiancée Ashley Carpenter, a 34-year-old claims manager, to pack up and move to either Arizona or Florida, her possible promotion be damned. Carpenter’s dad, a MAGA “patriarch,” barely lets his wife speak during the family’s meeting with Henderson and later touts his own daughter’s attractiveness as being “dyn-o-mite.”\n\nAt a time when women are outpacing men in obtaining college degrees and are narrowing the pay gap in some cities, some of the guys in Love Is Blind’s recent seasons also seem to react poorly to having high-achieving partners.\n\nLast year in Denver, Jordan Keltner couldn’t seem to move past his insecurities around fiancée Megan Walerius’ wealth, ultimately leading to their breakup after he said he was too “tired” to have conversations with her after work or keep up with her rich-person hobbies. This season, Fusco, a 33-year-old account executive, gets a tour of his doctor fiancée Jessica Barrett's multi-bedroom Ohio home and later demeans her for not going to pilates every day. “I don't care if she’s a neurosurgeon or if she’s a goddamn $100-million trust fund,\" he says, while complaining about their lack of sexual chemistry before spending a chunk of time trying to convince already-engaged contestant Bri McNess that she needs a “dominant” man like him."

            "content": "In late December, the 21st to be exact, my friends Amos and Clara called me 17 times. On December 22 it was eight times. The calls were short—sometimes only 30 to 45 seconds, and they usually arrived when I was doing something important: working, grocery shopping, napping. “Hi Anna,” one or both of them would say. “Hi!” I’d respond. Sometimes I worried that I sounded too eager, or like I was just sitting around waiting for their call. Sometimes I felt a little pathetic.\n\nIf anyone else called me that often I’d block their number. But Amos is 6 years old, and Clara is 9, and what happened is that on December 20, for Hanukkah, the siblings got the gift of a newly released, extremely old-school kids’ phone. And for the next week or so, the two of them couldn’t stop calling. And I, for one, couldn’t stop picking up.\n\nCalled the Tin Can, the phone came out last April and has since sold more than 100,000 units without much paid advertising. It’s basically a “dumb phone” that makes and receives calls over a Wi-Fi network—a landline without the line. It has no screen, not even a tiny one to show who’s calling; its surface has only buttons, a receiver, and a speaker. The product is marketed to parents who want to encourage their children to communicate without giving them access to web browsers and social media. (One user on X suggested, jokingly, that children start writing chain letters next.)\n\nThe standard Tin Can, which comes in four colorways and costs $100, looks like a candy-colored soup can. A “retro” model called The Flashback appears nearly identical to an old-school cradle phone and also retails at $100. Calls between Tin Cans are free, but the company charges $10 a month for users to call outside the Tin Can network. Parents get to set the rules—they add numbers to an approved caller list, and only calls to and from those numbers go through, and only in preset time frames, say, between 8 am and 8 pm. Parents can also monitor call logs. Call it spying with the implied consent of the spied upon; an electronic surveillance state in miniature.\n\nSome parents have tried to solve the problem of intrusive screens by buying their kids smartwatches; others opt for typical dumb phones. But these products are more about letting adults keep tabs on where their kids are at any given moment. The Tin Can is more about getting kids to focus on using their voices to communicate.\n\nAnd that’s about it. Tin Cans don’t show you missed calls or support text messaging. In an era in which most everyone is being nudged toward addictive, screen-based, endless-scroll engagement, giving kids the opportunity to get lost in conversation can seem incredibly appealing to parents."

Each panel on the helmet has 12 red lights (120 total), which are on a spectrum of 620 to 660 nanometers (nm). The 620-nm red light helps improve scalp health by promoting circulation, and the 660-nm red light penetrates deeper, reaching through the epidermis and dermis to the hypodermis, where it stimulates growth and repair at the follicle root. According to CurrentBody, you only need to use the device for 10 minutes a day, and you’ll see results within 12 weeks.\n\nMy hair grows famously slow. I got a pixie cut in the spring of 2011, and my hair did not touch my shoulders until the end of 2013. My hair is also super fine. It tangles easily and often breaks off (my ends are chronically dry and split). After 12 weeks, I didn’t notice a huge difference in length (and I got a haircut halfway through testing), but I did notice that my hair seemed to be sprouting new follicles along my scalp and sideburn area in particular. I started to see small baby hairs along my hairline that I had never seen before. My stylist commented that my hair felt thicker, and I noticed less breakage and hair caught in bristles when brushing. My balding roommate also tested it (although not daily like me) and said that his hair felt thicker and that there was new growth around the scalp.\n\nThe helmet comes in two sizes: medium for a skull circumference of 21.3 to 23.2 inches, or large, for 23.3 to 25 inches. (I opted for medium, and it was too large for my head size.) The device sits on a base and is charged via a USB-C cord. It takes about three hours to fully charge, and it stays on a single charge for about a week. The device is powered on by the press of the single button located under the charging port. The circular earmuffs protect sensitive ears with a cushy, removable faux leather cloth, and they can be adjusted several inches up or down to ensure a comfortable fit. The screen on the right earmuff indicates the time left in the treatment session, and the helmet automatically turns off when the 10 minutes are up. You can also connect the device to Bluetooth and play any type of music or video while wearing it, because God forbid I be left alone with my thoughts for 10 minutes a day. Just make sure your hair is clean and dry before use.\n\nMy only complaints are that the ear covers aren’t the easiest to adjust while wearing and would oftentimes pull out my hair while I removed or adjusted the helmet. Nevertheless, this is the best red light therapy for hair growth. Just you wait, I’ll look like Fabio on the cover of a romance novel by next year. See full review here. —Molly Higgins"

            "content": "Congressional Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee say they’ve identified more than $20.9 billion in consumer losses tied to identity theft connected to four major breaches involving data broker firms. The estimate was released Friday in a minority report stemming from a months-long inquiry into data broker practices launched by United States senator Maggie Hassan.\n\nHassan, a New Hampshire Democrat and the JEC’s ranking member, sent investigative requests to five major data brokers—Comscore, Findem, IQVIA Digital, Telesign, and 6Sense Insights—in August after an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, copublished by WIRED, found some data brokers were hiding opt-out tools from Google and other search engines using “no index” instructions that tell web crawlers not to list the page.\n\nScammers are shown to use the kind of sensitive data that companies like these hold—including identifiers like dates of birth, addresses, and even Social Security numbers—to target victims with personalized fraud.\n\nFour of the companies took steps after Hassan’s outreach to improve access to opt-out options, including by removing the “no index” code, adding more prominent links, and posting guidance on exercising privacy rights.\n\nFindem, however, did not respond to Hassan or to committee staff follow-up, and staff said the company has not removed the “no index” code from its page. WIRED’s calls to Findem on Thursday went unanswered.\n\nThe report says Findem’s “failure to respond” to the lawmakers’ inquiries raises “serious, broad questions about its responsiveness to opt-out requests and commitment to data privacy,” adding that its own mandatory disclosures from 2024 show the company “did not process 80 percent of privacy requests from consumers and other parties,” citing “insufficient data.”\n\nIQVIA, 6sense, and Comscore did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Telesign routes press inquiries through an online form that requires reporters to consent to receiving marketing communications, which was not used for that reason; instead, a company email address that appeared in previously leaked breach data was tried.\n\nThe Markup/CalMatters investigation found that dozens of California-registered data brokers were using the “no index” code and other so-called dark patterns that make opt-out and deletion pages harder to find. “In doing so,” the JEC minority report says, “the companies made it more difficult for people to protect their information from scammers.”\n\nComscore told the committee it reviewed its website after receiving Hassan’s request and found that its “Data Subject Rights” page—which directs users to separate forms for submitting opt-out requests—contained a “no index” code. The company said it traced the code, which it removed, back to an earlier version of the page created in 2003. The report says the company could not determine why it was added, but suggested it was “not intended to prevent consumer access.”\n\nTelesign confirmed that its opt-out form, hosted on a “Privacy Request” page, was not appearing in search results at the time of the Markup/CalMatters reporting; it attributed the issue to a third-party SEO tool that restricts visibility by default, and says it has now enabled indexing and added a footer link to the form.\n\nJEC staff say Telesign’s approach still directs consumers to look beyond its main site and, even where links exist, they’re often buried on pages users wouldn’t reasonably think to check—including privacy notice pages exceeding 9,000 words.\n\n6sense disputed that its main “Privacy Center” was hidden, but acknowledged that its “Privacy Policy” page—which links to opt-out tools—previously carried “no index” code, adding that it removed the code after the Markup/CalMatters report. 6sense was the only company to report using third-party audits to assess both the visibility of opt-out options and whether the requests are being successfully processed, the report says."

The digital crumbs we leave in our online footsteps are abundant, and maintaining any semblance of privacy on the internet is a continuous challenge.\n\nThe natural response to such an alarming lack of privacy is to put up walls, retreat into a shell and try to become anonymous. It’s that reflex that many VPNs build their marketing around, peddling inflated claims about how their product can make you completely anonymous online. But complete online anonymity is a myth.\n\nTo be fair, not all VPN companies are pushing this false narrative -- CNET’s picks for the best VPNs are all very clear about what their services can and can’t do.

CyberGhost/Screenshot by CNET\n\nTo be fair, CyberGhost does mention in an FAQ section tucked away at the bottom of its home page that “no VPN service can make you 100% anonymous online,” but the messaging from the company is nonetheless confusing and avoidable.\n\nThis isn’t just a case of harmless exaggerated marketing -- it’s reckless. Using a VPN while under the impression that it’s a silver bullet for online anonymity can put you in a bad spot, even if you have nothing to hide. If you use a social media platform to share sensitive information online with someone, or if you’re an investigative journalist in a region whose government practices oppressive digital surveillance, you’ll still be at risk, even with a VPN.\n\nYou can’t simply throw good judgment and all other basic privacy principles out the window just because you think your VPN gives you an all-encompassing invisibility cloak on the internet whenever you switch it on. It’s time to dial back the hyperbole and be clear about how a VPN can and can’t protect you online, starting with why all this talk about data matters.\n\nYour information is out there, and almost everyone wants it\n\nWhether used by governments to spy on citizens and adversaries or by companies like Google and Meta to profit off of user data, the internet has been an incredibly efficient surveillance tool for decades. It was only after former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013 that the public really began to grasp the extent of the online surveillance and internet privacy issues in general came more to the forefront.\n\nA few years later, the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 helped illustrate not only the vast amount of data Big Tech was collecting without our consent, but also how outside companies were piggybacking off of that data collection for their own purposes.\n\nWhenever you’re logged in to a service like Google, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, X, Amazon or Netflix, all of your activity on those platforms can be tracked by the companies and linked directly back to you. Data related to the search terms you enter, links you click on, videos you watch, items you purchase, ads you interact with and content you share are all collected and used to create a detailed profile on your interests and online habits.\n\nAdditionally, personal information such as your name, username, address, payment data and email address, along with unique identifiers like your IP address, browser type, device type and operating system can all be tracked.\n\nYour internet provider can track things like your web browsing history, location, app usage and metadata. Fitness and financial apps can collect sensitive health and financial data. Websites use cookies and device fingerprinting, and social media platforms use pixels to track your activity across the web.\n\nThat information can be collected and sold to data brokers, who further treat your personal information like valuable currency.\n\nData privacy legislation like Europe’s GDPR and California’s CCPA help people take more control over how their data is collected and processed, but these laws can only do so much. Surveillance capitalism is so ingrained into how Big Tech operates that having our actions online tracked in one way or another is becoming increasingly unavoidable. With all the ways in which we’re being tracked, online anonymity is only possible if you don’t go online at all.\n\nA VPN can help boost your privacy, but there are many limitations\n\nWith a VPN, you can give your privacy a boost and put a small dent into the scope of data collected on you when you go online. A VPN encrypts your online traffic while routing it through a secure server in a remote location that you choose. This process achieves two objectives critical to improving your privacy: It hides your internet activity from your internet provider, network administrator, government and other online snoops, and it changes your actual IP address to that of the VPN server you connect through.\n\nGetty Images/Zooey Liao/CNET\n\nThis way, you can keep your online activity hidden from certain key entities while also preventing the sites and services you use from detecting your actual physical location and tracking you based on your IP address. VPNs are great for protecting your privacy, limiting certain kinds of tracking and data collection, evading firewalls at work or school and spoofing your IP address and location to bypass georestrictions.\n\nThat’s a useful set of features, but there are still plenty of ways for data to get through your VPN.\n\nSome VPNs include ad and tracker blockers, along with surface level malware and phishing protection features, but (other than Windscribe’s anti-fingerprinting feature) most VPNs cannot guard against tracking through browser fingerprinting. Your browser fingerprint can expose information like your time zone, screen resolution, browser type, operating system, extensions, language preferences and IP address. All of this information taken together can be used by advertisers to build detailed profiles on internet users, governments to surveil citizens and even cybercriminals to commit identity theft.\n\nA VPN can’t help hide your identity when you purchase something from Amazon or when you use services like Google or Facebook. These platforms all know it’s you when you interact with them while logged in and are still collecting hoards of data related to your activity whether or not you’re connected to a VPN.\n\nA VPN can’t protect you if you download malware or enter your sensitive information into a phishing site. Privacy protections don’t prevent you from downloading malware or sending your personal information to cybercriminals. Some antivirus services can protect you against these risks, but a VPN won’t.\n\nAnd you’re not anonymous to the VPN itself when using its services because you’re essentially swapping the visibility into your online activity from your internet provider to your VPN provider. That’s fine if your VPN has an audited no-logs policy and runs on RAM-only or full-disk encrypted servers to serve as an extra layer of protection. But there are too many VPNs, especially free services, that put user data at risk or otherwise misuse it.\n\nYet none of this stops some VPN providers from saying that VPNs can make you totally anonymous online.\n\nIn reality, VPNs are just a small piece of the much greater online privacy and security puzzle. VPNs like Mullvad and Windscribe let you sign up and use their services without supplying any personal information whatsoever -- which is about as close as you can get to anonymity with a VPN. Other providers like Proton, NordVPN, ExpressVPN and Surfshark offer additional privacy and security services on top of a VPN that you can bundle under a single subscription, which can help you better round out your cybersecurity toolkit.\n\nOther tools for boosting your privacy online\n\nEveryday citizens simply looking to boost their online protections should be fine with a VPN, password manager and antivirus. But if you’re an activist, lawyer, whistleblower, investigative journalist or anyone else with critical privacy needs, there’s a lot more you should do to protect yourself and become as anonymous as possible online.\n\nA great first step is to go with a vetted VPN provider with an audited no-logs policy and make sure to enable the appropriate settings for optimal privacy. On top of that, I recommend leveraging the following tools if you want to be as anonymous as possible online:\n\nTor: Uses “onion routing”\n\nTails operating system: A secure operating system from the Tor Project that you download to a USB stick that runs independently of your computer’s operating system. It boots fresh each time you start it up and wipes all data automatically when you shut it down.\n\nAdblocker: A browser extension like Privacy Badger or Ghostery can help you block ads and trackers from following you around the web.\n\nEncrypted messaging services Signal can help keep your messages private by encrypting the contents.\n\nSignal can help keep your messages private by encrypting the contents. Proton Mail: An encrypted email service from Proton that’s free of trackers and uses end-to-end, zero-access encryption so that only you can access the contents of your emails.\n\nPrivacy-focused browsers: Certain browsers like the Mullvad Browser or Brave can help automatically block ads and trackers and fight against fingerprinting. The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Cover Your Tracks tool can also give you a detailed look into your specific browser fingerprint and reveal exactly how unique it is.\n\nPrivate search engines: Tools like DuckDuckGo or Brave Search are solid private alternatives to the tracking and data collection employed by the likes of Google or Bing.\n\nMore ways to protect your privacy\n\nIn addition to using the tools listed above, I recommend taking the following actions if you’re serious about minimizing your digital footprint and staying as private as possible online:\n\nLimit your social media use and reliance on Google services: Big Tech is a data-hungry machine\n\nCreate burner accounts: Whether it’s an email address\n\nPay in cash or crypto: Credit cards, PayPal, Venmo and personal checks all leave a trail back to you. Cash and crypto do not.\n\nBe careful of what you download: Don’t download random files from unsolicited emails. Be on the lookout for signs of phishing scams\n\nShore up your device’s privacy settings: Make sure app permissions are set to only what the apps need to function. Enable device encryption and set a strong passcode. Disable ad tracking and location services.\n\nBe careful with public Wi-Fi: Only connect to secure Wi-Fi hotspots and use a VPN for extra protection.\n\nRegularly clear your browser cookies and cache improve performance and free up storage space\n\nWhile neither a VPN nor any single privacy or security tool can guarantee you anonymity, a well-rounded cybersecurity toolkit, some strategic actions and a little bit of common sense can go a long way toward protecting your privacy."

            "content": "Pokemon Winds and Waves, the first mainline games in the series to come to the Nintendo Switch 2, were launched on Friday, the franchise's 30th anniversary, on a special Pokemon Presents livestream. They will be released in 2027 exclusively on the Switch 2.\n\nFollowing the precedent set by Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, the new games seem to be set in a fully explorable open world. The new playable region is scattered across multiple islands, with wide swaths of ocean between them.\n\nThe distinct split between water and land harkens back to cherished gameplay mechanics from generation-3 Pokemon games Ruby and Sapphire, which were released in 2002.\n\nAs tradition dictates, we got our first look at the three new starter Pokemon, which are powerful pals that serve as the player's first partner in an unfamiliar new place.\n\nThe grass-type starter, Browt, is a chickadee with a head that's bulbous enough to invoke the Brain. The water-type, Gecqua, is a quadrupedal gecko with a cool attitude. And the fire-type starter, Pombon, is a super cute orange kitty with a mane that eclipses its body. (I suspect Pombon will quickly become a fan favorite.)\n\nFan-favorite Pokemon from previous games were also shown off. So far, we can confirm that Pikachu, Tympole, Wailord, Tropius, Carnivine and Frillish are in the cast of monsters to be caught in the next mainline Pokemon games, among other older creatures. Many of the returning Pokemon seem to fit into the island theme, residing in volcanic caves, marshy swamps and underwater coves.\n\nIt's been four years since the last mainline Pokemon games -- Pokemon Scarlet and Violet -- were released for the Nintendo Switch.\n\nWhile those games were lauded by some fans for their open world and more freeform approach to telling a Pokemon story, they were held back by poor performance and game-breaking bugs on Nintendo's first hybrid console. Nintendo will hope that Pokemon Winds and Waves -- games built for, and exclusive to, the more powerful Switch 2 hardware -- will fare better when it comes to in-game performance.\n\nPokemon Winds and Waves may be the first traditional Pokemon games for the Switch 2, but they aren't the first ventures into the world of pocket monsters in recent years.\n\nThe recently released Pokemon Legends: Z-A introduced a whole new battling system, moving away from the turn-based mechanics the franchise has been known for since 1996. Pokemon Pokopia, an Animal Crossing-style game that will be released next month, is also primed to bring pocket monsters to cozy gaming spaces.\n\nBoth games will tide fans over until they can dive into the watery world of Pokemon Winds and Waves next year."

            "content": "Nintendo sure does love teasing us with Game Boy things. First, a collectible Lego Game Boy model last year that almost looked like a real Game Boy (but wasn't). Now, for the 30th anniversary of Pokemon, Nintendo and the Pokemon Group are selling a collectible music player that looks like a tiny Game Boy and plays authentic original Pokemon Red/Blue songs on swappable cartridges, one per song. The Game Boy Jukebox is being sold on the Pokemon Center site later today, for a price that hasn't yet been listed.\n\nThis level of absurdity is standard issue for Nintendo: Just in the last 18 months we've had Alarmo, a talking Super Mario flower and a Virtual Boy recreation. This new collectible is so tempting precisely because it looks like a little, even more pocketable Game Boy. Except it isn't a Game Boy at all. It's just a music player. Even the dot-matrix \"screen\" is fake -- it's just an overlay that the cartridges display when they're slotted in.\n\nThe music this thing plays is Game Boy-accurate, down to the little boot-up ping. It just makes my skin itch for a new Game Boy (that isn't one already made by several other companies).\n\nBut come on. Make a real Game Boy collectible, with actual preloaded games on it. You know you want to, Nintendo. It's only a matter of time.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're desperate for all 45 Pokemon Red and Blue songs on a little Game Boy music player, now's your chance."

            "content": "This morning saw the start of the annual celebration of all things Pokemon. Pokemon Day is chock-full of free goodies and exciting game reveals for creature-collecting fans across the world, and this stream didn't disappoint.\n\nWhile the beginning of the February Pokemon Presents focused primarily on the plethora of pocket monster mobile games, like Pokemon Go and Pokemon TCG Pocket, we also learned about quite a few new games. The presentation culminated in the reveal of Pokemon Winds and Waves, the gen 10 mainline games (and the first Pokemon games to be developed exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2).\n\nHere's everything The Pokemon Company announced for 2026 and beyond during its first Pokemon Presents stream of the year. Whether you're looking to relive old games for the first time or dive into a brand-new generation of pocket monsters, there's something for every Pokemon fan to get excited about right now.\n\nBrowt, Pombon and Gecqua are the newest partner Pokemon. The Pokemon Company/Screenshot by CNET\n\nPokemon Winds and Waves\n\nThe first mainline Pokemon games developed exclusively for the Switch 2 have been revealed. Pokemon Winds and Waves are the gen 10 Pokemon games, and they take place in a new region full of volcanic crags, murky swamplands and lots of water.\n\nWe got our first look at the partner Pokemon Browt, Pombon and Gecqua, but no other new Pokemon made their debut in this trailer. Keep your eyes peeled for additional information about new pocket monster species and box art legendaries in the coming months.\n\nPokemon Winds and Waves will be released in 2027. Expect IGN to score these ones 7.8/10.\n\nDifferent generational mechanics clash in Pokemon Champions. Nintendo\n\nPokemon Champions gets a release date... sort of\n\nPokemon Champions, the competitive battling game that was revealed during the July 2025 Pokemon Presents, made a notable appearance in the latest stream. While we still don't know the exact date Pokemon Champions will become publicly available, we know it will be released for the Switch and Switch 2 sometime during April. The game will also come out on mobile devices later this year.\n\nPokemon Champions aims to standardize competitive Pokemon battling by unifying gimmicks from all nine generations of mainline Pokemon games -- including Mega evolutions, Dynamax Pokemon and Terastallization -- into one format. Players will be able to transfer their favorite Pokemon from the mainline games to Pokemon Champions in order to battle one another, with cross-platform play supported between Switch and mobile devices.\n\nI could've sworn that this shadow Lugia was intimidating in 2005. The Pokemon Company/Screenshot by CNET\n\nPokemon XD: Gale of Darkness for Switch 2\n\nIt's an oldie but a goodie. Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, the game that introduced the awe-inspiring corrupted Lugia back in 2005, will be released exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 Online + Expansion Pack subscribers in March. Gale of Darkness is fondly remembered as a challenging title with plenty of fan-favorite shadow Pokemon forms, so it'll be good to have this nostalgic classic on the current generation of Nintendo hardware.\n\nA Pokemon music collection in Game Boy form? Yes. Nintendo\n\nGame Boy Jukebox featuring music from Pokemon Red and Blue\n\nThe Game Boy Advance is back. Well, not really, but a very small jukebox taking the shape of the fan-favorite handheld console will be released today. This initial Game Boy Jukebox collection comes with 45 different cartridges -- each one plays a classic chiptune song from Pokemon Red and Blue, the original gen one Pokemon games from 30 years ago.\n\nI think 45 different cartridges is a little bit overkill, but it's certainly authentic to the old console experience. It remains to be seen if more classic GBA games will get their own chiptune cartridges to use with the Game Boy Jukebox. There are no pricing details for the device yet.\n\nLegendary Pokemon cards from previous runs are likely to return in a new legacy expansion set. The Pokemon Company/Screenshot by CNET\n\nA mysterious new TCG collection\n\nThe scalping will continue until morale improves. The next TCG collection (which was teased but not named during the Pokemon Presents stream) is designed to celebrate 30 years of Pokemon's legacy.\n\nSeveral cards from different generations of the Pokemon TCG were shown off, revamped and revitalized to receive play in 2026. Notable inclusions were Pikachu and Charizard from the original base set, Palkia, Darkrai and Azelf from the Diamond and Pearl sets and the Pikachu and Zekrom tag team card from 2019. This mystery set seems to be bringing back the greatest hits -- assuming you're able to find packs in stores anywhere around you.\n\nHow to watch the Pokemon Day presentation video\n\nThe Pokemon Company is responsible for the Pokemon Presents livestreams, so the livestream aired on its YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Instagram accounts. If you want to watch the VOD and catch up on all of the latest Pokemon news for yourself, we've embedded The Pokemon Company's video of every announcement up above.so you can view the announcement on any of its social media channels."

Bloomberg reports that Apple is working on a touchscreen MacBook Pro with OLED screen to be released by the end of 2026.\n\nIt's a product I never expected to see anytime soon. For the past 15 years, Apple executives have publicly dismissed the idea of putting touchscreens on a MacBook, saying it would be uncomfortable to operate. Steve Jobs told a crowd at an Apple event that the company did \"tons of user testing\" on putting touchscreens on MacBooks and decided against it because, he said, \"It doesn't work. It's ergonomically terrible.\"\n\nWatch this: New Touchscreen MacBook Details Emerge, Plus What to Expect at Apple's Big Event 05:19\n\nWhile previewing Mac OS X Lion in 2010, Jobs explained the main issue was comfort, saying, \"After a short period of time you start to fatigue, and after an extended period of time your arm wants to fall off.\"\n\nSo if Bloomberg's reporting is correct, certainly someone at Apple believes differently now. But before we cry out how this isn't what Steve Jobs wanted, let's not forget that Jobs did say Apple did \"tons\" of user testing. It was something the company has been curious about. Maybe in the past 15 years, something changed.\n\nIn this week's episode of One More Thing, embedded above, I go over the details from the Bloomberg report on how it might function. MacOS reportedly would only reveal touch menus when a finger hits the screen, helping it just complement the typical point-and-click interface. Certainly this could avoid criticism Microsoft faced by overhauling its OS in the Windows 8 launch when it moved to a hybrid interface, alienating longtime users.\n\nThis rumored device is for the end of the year, but Apple may have plenty of other gadgets to play with in the next week. Tim Cook teased that the company will be announcing new products starting on Monday. The company is expected to release a new iPhone 17e, along with updated models of the iPad and Mac lineup -- maybe as many as five different products.\n\nApple is holding an invitation-only experience on Wednesday March 4 in New York City, and I'll be there to cover whatever happens and will give my first impressions and full report for what one more thing (or many things) will have folks buzzing.\n\nFor more One More Thing, subscribe to our YouTube page to catch Bridget Carey breaking down the latest Apple news and issues every Friday."

            "content": "Finding an inexpensive, quality inkjet printer isn't a challenge. But getting affordable replacement ink is another matter entirely.\n\nYou might be shocked to learn that replacement ink cartridges can cost as much as the printer itself, if not more. It's because printers are often sold at a loss, with the company expecting to make its profit on the ink.\n\nThis strategy, also known as the \"razor-and-blades model,\" is common in consumer goods, including printers, coffee makers (the ones that use disposable pods) and its namesake, shaving razors.\n\nPrinter manufacturers, however, claim there are several reasons why ink costs so much, beyond revenue. Here are the main reasons why printer ink is so expensive.\n\nThe razor blade business\n\nThe razor-and-blade business model provides a continued revenue stream for printer-makers after a customer buys the hardware. It also locks that customer into an ecosystem. Just as some razor handles are compatible with only a specific blade, printers support only certain inkjet or toner cartridges.\n\nManufacturers typically offer different printer models, but they likely use different cartridges that aren't interchangeable. The cartridges also aren't refillable by design. While it may seem manipulative, this business model is legal and common practice. It also keeps prices high due to a lack of competition.\n\nIt's all proprietary (aka intellectual property)\n\nThanasi/Getty\n\nAnother way consumers are locked into a closed ecosystem is that many ink and toner cartridges contain chipsets that communicate with the printer, such as the amount of ink or toner left, so the printer can estimate how many pages it can print. They also verify whether the cartridge is authentic (i.e., from the printer manufacturer) or has been refilled. In either case, the printer could reject the cartridge.\n\nWhile some third-party suppliers have found ways around this, printer cartridges are proprietary, the intellectual property of the original manufacturer. Customers are usually limited in replacement options other than buying from their printer's original equipment manufacturer.\n\nThis isn't about the cost of research and manufacturing, or at least, not just about that. Printer-makers claim that their technology ensures consumers get the best print quality from their ink or toner, as well as proper performance and accurate color or monochrome prints.\n\nFor example, inkjet printer ink is formulated to flow smoothly through the tiny printhead nozzles, while laser printer toner powder must be heated and applied evenly. That ink or toner also has to dry quickly on paper without smudging, which is another key reason. The official cartridges also include security features that manufacturers claim protect against malware.\n\nSo, although cartridges look simple on the outside, their embedded technology adds to manufacturing costs. Companies say this helps ensure high print quality, but consumer advocacy groups say it is designed to keep out competition while shifting the cost to users.\n\nIf you print often, expect to spend more on consumables\n\nGettyimages/Photoplus magazine\n\nObviously, the more ink or toner used, the sooner replenishment is needed. This is especially the case with inkjet printers, as cartridges often contain a low yield of ink (between 150 to 300 pages). And, if the printer uses multiple cartridges, those costs add up quickly. If you run out of one color, you might not even be able to print black-and-white documents.\n\nWorse, new inkjet printers include \"starter ink cartridges\" that offer even lower yields. Laser printer toner cartridges also require replacing, but they tend to have higher yields than their inkjet counterparts.\n\nAlso, if you don't print often, the ink in the cartridges can dry out, requiring replacement before you can print anything.\n\nHow to reduce printer ink costs\n\nEpson/CNET\n\nThere's no way around it: Inkjet printers need ink, which will eventually run out. But there are a few ways to save some money.\n\nHigh-yield cartridges\n\nSome printers support high-yield ink or toner cartridges, which double the output of standard options. They cost a bit more, but you may be able to reduce the frequency of ink replacements. They also might be cheaper per page printed.\n\nRefillable ink\n\nRefillable inkjet printers, also known as supertank printers, have gained popularity. As the name suggests, a user pours ink into tanks built into the printer, much like refilling a soap bottle. Refillable inks are cheaper than ink cartridges and offer a much higher yield. (They also produce less waste in general.) However, the printers themselves are more expensive to purchase upfront.\n\nHP\n\nSubscription programs\n\nHP offers its Instant Ink program, which automatically ships you a replacement when ink runs low (the printer sends this info to HP when connected to Wi-Fi). Starting at $1.79 a month, HP sends new high-yield cartridges only when needed and recycles your old cartridges to reduce e-waste. HP says Instant Ink offers a savings of up to 50% when compared to buying off the shelf, and most Wi-Fi-enabled HP printers support the program.\n\nEpson launched a new service called ReadyPrint, where, for a monthly fee (starting at $15), you get a printer and unlimited refillable ink. ReadyPrint is available only on select models.\n\nPrint in draft mode and limit color\n\nOftentimes, lower-quality draft mode is more than sufficient for most print jobs. This can help increase page yields. Nearly all inkjet printers can output in color, but that doesn't mean you should. Make sure you disable color in your print settings and enable it only when needed.\n\nConsider a laser printer\n\nLaser toner cartridge. Getty Images/Smith Collection\n\nEvaluate the amount and type of printing you plan to do. If it's mostly black-and-white documents, it may be more economical to invest in a laser printer, since toner offers higher yields and doesn't dry out between infrequent uses.\n\nThen, if you need to occasionally print color or photos, print them professionally at FedEx, pharmacies like CVS and any number of local or online photo print shops. In the long run, this might be cheaper than owning your own color printer if you don't print regularly.\n\nThird-party supplies\n\nThird-party ink supplies can offer significant savings, but printer manufacturers have strongly fought against this option. They've even implemented measures to prevent their use. However, it's not illegal for consumers to use third-party inks. Before you choose this option, know that the savings may come at the cost of print quality, and some third-party inks could damage the hardware.\n\nWhile using third-party ink won't void the warranty, the printer manufacturer may not cover repairs or replacements if third-party supplies are found to be the source of damage. It's best to choose a reputable retailer or service known for high-quality third-party inks, and that will stand behind them."

            "content": "If you thought sponge colors were just for aesthetic appeal, you'd only be partly correct. The bright pink, yellow, blue and green hues they come in signal how and when to use them.\n\nUse the wrong sponge on the wrong surface, and you could end up with some hopelessly scratched appliances or damaged cookware. It took me 40 years to stumble upon this information, and it explains the unsightly scratches dotting my stovetop and fridge.\n\nThis guide is to help you avoid a similar fate.\n\nSponges are color-coded for reason. Robin Mosley/CNET\n\nLearning to decode these colors can also help prevent cross-contamination. Designating certain sponges for cleaning up bacterial messes, such as poultry spills, will keep that dangerous stuff from seeping into something untoward.\n\nHere's how to pick a sponge based on color and protect your fragile home appliances and kitchen surfaces.\n\nGreen\n\nIntended use: An all-purpose workhorse\n\nGreen sponges are tough and versatile -- too tough for stainless-steel appliances. Scotch-Brite\n\nThese scouring pads are the workhorse of the home cleaning world: multipurpose, dependable and ready to tackle just about anything.\n\nOften designated for general cleaning and dishwashing, they offer enough scrubbing power to remove midrange residue but can also handle tougher stains or even outdoor cleaning tasks. Basically, if you're not sure which sponge to grab, green means go.\n\nThey're too rough for glass, stainless steel and other sensitive surfaces, but for caked-on cast iron and a filthy fridge, nothing works quite as well.\n\nYellow:\n\nIntended use: Medium coarseness for sensitive surfaces\n\nYellow sponges are meant for more sensitive surfaces, including nonstick cookware. Mr. Scrub\n\nYellow sponges are right in the middle -- not too rough, not too soft but often overlooked. They represent a step down in abrasiveness from green. They are suitable for cleaning more delicate surfaces, such as glassware, countertops and kitchen sinks, which require careful treatment to avoid scratches but still develop significant stains and buildup.\n\nBlue\n\nIntended use: A softy for glass and stainless steel\n\nA blue sponge will coddle your most delicate wares. Lavex\n\nWhen you're dealing with delicate surfaces, reach for a blue sponge. It's the least abrasive option and is ideal for very delicate surfaces such as glass or stainless steel, where a scratch-free shine is the goal. Blue is basically the spa day of sponges -- gentle, calming and leaves everything looking refreshed.\n\nRed and pink\n\nIntended use: High-risk areas and bacterial messes\n\nReserve red sponges for bacterial mess. The Home Depot\n\nThese colors are typically reserved for the danger zones, such as cleaning tougher, baked-on food or areas that pose a higher bacterial risk, like the sink where you just rinsed raw chicken (you know, your kitchen's version of a crime scene).\n\nTheir color is less an indication of their coarseness than a visual reminder to never, ever use them on clean tableware, unless you enjoy living dangerously.\n\nAnd because they're often employed in hazardous jobs, you may want to stock up on a bundle and simply toss them more often than their counterparts in alternative colors.\n\nBlack:\n\nIntended use: Heavy-duty scrubbing\n\nJetz Scrubz\n\nThese highly abrasive, heavy-duty sponges are for serious scrubbing of stubborn, baked-on stains on tough surfaces. You might not go through them as often as the others, but for certain gnarly cleaning jobs, only the bristly black sponge will suffice.\n\nHow color-coding sponges reduces the risk of contamination\n\nUsing sponges strategically will reduce wear on kitchen surfaces. SimpleImages/Getty\n\nA systematic approach to kitchen hygiene often involves color-coding cleaning tools to ensure proper organization and cleanliness. This simple, visual system ensures a sponge used only for heavily soiled areas (or biohazard jobs) is never mistakenly used on clean glassware, silverware or plates. Because trust us, your guests will notice.\n\nBy establishing and following this clear color-coded system, you can reduce the spread of germs, keep your kitchen safer and ensure that your most delicate items are treated with the gentlest care. Plus, you'll finally have a legitimate reason to own a rainbow of colorful sponges.\n\nFor more cleaning tips, see a former custodian's tips for cleaning the bathroom like a pro and discover which all-purpose cleaner fared the best in our testing."

If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nOne of the most significant improvements to TV picture quality has been the introduction of OLED technology. An OLED TV can create perfect black levels with infinite contrast, as well as excellent color and great motion control. It's a technology that lends itself well to sports, gaming on consoles or watching HDR TV shows and movies. I have tested the latest OLED TVs side-by-side in the CNET TV lab, including brands such as LG, Sony, Samsung and Panasonic. These are the models I recommend.\n\n\n\nThe best OLED TV\n\nThe best OLED TV for most users is the Samsung S90F TV as it's got both picture quality and affordability in equal measure, especially now that prices have come down. That said, the LG C5 is also an excellent TV at a similar price, and as a result you should buy whichever of the two models is cheapest at the time.\n\nIf you can spend more and want the best possible picture quality that you can get, then it's a choice between the LG G5 and the Samsung S95F. The LG TV is the most color accurate TV I tested in 2025 and the winner of a CNET Labs Award, while the Samsung is excellent in both the dark and in bright rooms.\n\nTy Pendlebury/CNET Photo Gallery 1/1 Ty Pendlebury/CNET Best OLED TV value of 2026 Samsung S90F 8.6 /10 SCORE It's a close call between the Samsung S90F and LG C5, as always at this level, but given the Samsung S90F is slightly better and around the same money it's the one to choose. The Samsung has similar picture quality to its more-expensive S95F sibling and that's the best reason to buy it. The Samsung also has most of the features you need including 4K/120Hz gaming support, HDR 10+ and onboard streaming. While the TV doesn't have Dolby Vision, the differences between HDR10+ and Dolby's HDR format are subtle at best. ...

Overhead lights and windows can wreak havoc on your picture, and it's not always feasible to close the curtains or turn the lights off. The Samsung S95F is the best TV I've seen to effectively ban reflections, and the fact that it gives excellent picture quality as well makes it the ultimate TV for the movies or gaming fan who likes to watch during the day. ...

It's neck-and-neck with the S95F for picture quality in terms of contrast and color, though the LG is demonstrably more accurate, with the best color accuracy score of the past year. Plus, the G5 is a blast to game on. I still like the S95F a little better, and that's mainly because of Samsung's reflection deterrence. ... Show more Get it now $1,877 at Amazon Learn more LG G5 review\n\nRecent updates Feb. 26, 2025: Added CNET Labs Award to LG G5 and updated pricing. Dec. 11, 2025: Added the Samsung S90F as the best value pick, and removed the 2024 LG C4. Oct. 2, 2025: Updated the list with new TVs including the Samsung S95F and the LG G5, plus added more information on my testing process.\n\nI also tested Panasonic Z95A: It boasts excellent picture quality, thanks to OLED, and it also includes a dedicated speaker system. It's being replaced by the Z95B but it's still available in some stores. Read my hands-on of the Panasonic Z95B. LG C5: While the LG G5 is a huge leap from the model that came before it, the C5 is more incremental. That said, it is still an improvement and if it's the same price as the C4 then get this instead. See my full review of the LG C5.\n\nFactors to consider when choosing an OLED TV Carly Marsh/CNET Screen size: OLEDs are available in sizes from 42 inches to 97 inches, and there are probably even bigger TVs coming in the future. One of the best pieces of advice I can give is, if you can afford it, always buy a TV one size bigger than you think you need. While 65 inches is the norm right now, TVs will keep getting bigger year after year, and you might consider buying a 77-inch to prevent an upgrade in the near future. However, if you're buying for a bedroom or a game room, then you could look at TVs 55 inches or less. Consider older models: At the affordable end of OLED, the yearly model updates aren't as dramatic when compared with the flagships. For TVs like the LG B5 or even C5, for instance, it makes sense to compare prices on last year's model and get whichever is cheapest. In the meantime, as we progress into the new year you're going to see the prices of 2025 models continue to drop. HDR formats: While it's not completely necessary, compatibility with Dolby Vision is a plus. Of course, Samsung doesn't support the Dolby format and instead offers its own version it calls HDR10 plus, and this is gaining in popularity. In the end, though, almost every 4K TV supports HDR 10, and this will work just fine. Gaming: If you're a gamer then having gaming-enhancing features is a bonus, and these includes a dedicated gaming mode (for turning off processing and reducing lag), 120Hz or higher support and even gaming apps such as Xbox Game Pass, Amazon Luna and Steam Link. Operating system: With the introduction of the Philips Roku TV, you have a choice of all of the best smart TV interfaces on OLED televisions. Whether it's Google TV, Fire TV or one of the manufacturer-specific systems, opting for a popular smart TV interface gives you the most choice with apps and on-demand content."
