            "content": "NEYMAR has reignited a feud with an old rival after scoring twice against Vasco da Gama and being ‘headbutted.’\n\nThe Santos ace bagged both goals in a 2-1 win on Thursday night but that was overshadowed by his celebration and the fallout.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeymar, 34, put his side ahead in the 25th minute before heading to the corner flag to dance like fellow Brazilian Vinicius Jr, who was racially abused by Benfica fans last week.\n\nVinicius also claimed that Benfica player Gianluca Prestianni had issued a racist slur during the game, bringing the match to a temporary halt and causing controversy in the football world.\n\nAfter Neymar offered a gesture of support to Vini with his own samba jig, Vasco’s Thiago Mendes escalated matters.\n\nThe former Lyon midfielder confronted Neymar before kick-off and put his head towards the attacker.\n\n\n\nWith the referee already close by to try and stop matters from going any further, he had a perfect view of the incident as Neymar belatedly fell to the ground.\n\nHe appeared to have been headbutted, although contact looked minimal on replays.\n\nNeymar went down to the ground clutching his face but both players were shown a yellow card.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, the former Paris Saint-Germain forward hadn’t forgotten a previous coming together with Mendes.\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nHe said: “It’s always him who wants to play tough.\n\n“With all due respect, he’s an idiot.\n\n“He’s already injured me once at PSG. Let’s see if he’s man enough to injure me again.”\n\n\n\nMendes left Neymar sidelined for over a month in December 2020 after a shocking tackle that saw him sent off whilst playing for Lyon.\n\nPSG would lose the game 1-0 with Mendes seeing red in stoppage time and Neymar needing stretching off.\n\nNow coming head-to-head (literally) again, the bad blood remains.\n\nMendes responded to Neymar’s comments, saying: “I only asked for a little respect.\n\n“He told our supporters to be quiet during his celebration, and he demanded respect from me.\n\n\n\n“Today, everything revolved around Neymar.\n\n“The referee only blew his whistle for him. At no point did he blow it for us.”\n\nAfter the ankle injury over five years ago, Neymar’s dad wrote on Instagram: “F***… how much longer?\n\n“We have spoken about this so much, we have so underlined the excess of violence.\n\n“We are not taking the necessary measures throughout the entire match, during which Neymar was the victim of a dozen fouls, always violent ones.\n\n\n\n“This encourages these type of players and attitudes.”\n\nMendes and his family received death threats after suggestions that Neymar had broken his ankle.\n\nThe injury was not as bad as first feared but the bad blood certainly appears to remain.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nNeymar has only recently returned from yet another lay-off after needing knee surgery.\n\nHe kept Santos up at the end of last season after a fraught relegation battle."

Identifying and learning from your mistakes is crucial, of course.\n\n“But given my position as a forward, I’m bound to make mistakes because I’m always trying.\n\n\n\n“My job is to always go for an assist or take a shot on goal.”\n\nHerrera next resumed, declaring: “It reached a point where things just got out of hand.\n\n“Compared to everyone else on the team, it seemed like the coach was being way stricter with him.\n\n“Eventually, I think all the criticism ended up undermining Angel’s confidence.”\n\nDi Maria summed things up by adding: “I had sold more jerseys than anyone else upon my arrival to the Premier League, so I was finding myself under a lot of pressure. Really, that year was s***.”"

            "content": "DREAM TEAM managers should think carefully about who to nominate as their captain for Gameweek 26.\n\nWith every club scheduled to play twice, there will be lots of points on offer and a smartly-selected skipper could make all the difference.\n\n\n\nWith that in mind, let’s analyse the strongest candidates.\n\n\n\nAs the runaway points leader and most popular player in the game, Erling Haaland (£7.2m) is always the first port of call.\n\nManchester City’s No9 has an appealing double header of Leeds (a) and Nottingham Forest (h), two teams fighting for survival.\n\nA trip to Elland Road is a potential banana skin but Dream Team bosses will be expecting healthy returns from Pep Guardiola’s favourites this Gameweek.\n\nHaaland has racked up 341 points via 29 goals and seven assists — obscene numbers.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that Antoine Semenyo (£4.9m) has outscored the Norway poacher since the pair became team-mates in January.\n\nThe ex-Bournemouth averages 10.7 points-per-Gameweek since his move to the Etihad in a fruitful run that has features five goals and three assists.\n\nBetting against Haaland requires a certain degree of courage but there is enough evidence to justify captaining Semenyo at this stage of the campaign.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, Liverpool’s double of West Ham (h) and Wolves (a) is similarly enticing.\n\nThe Reds’ upcoming opponents have conceded 100 league goals between them this season and so Hugo Ekitike (£4.5m) has to be worthy of serious consideration.\n\nThe Frenchman hasn’t earned many points in his last four outings but he remains the club’s top scorer this campaign with 14 goals.\n\nThat being said, Dominik Szoboszlai (£5.5m) is Liverpool’s best performer in terms of points and that’s what really matters at the end of the day.\n\nIn fact, only the aforementioned Haaland has more points to his name after 25 Gameweeks.\n\n\n\nA rare double header for Manchester United brings their top stars into the captaincy conversation.\n\nBruno Fernandes (£6.6m) boasts a mighty points-per-game average of 7.3 (only bettered by Haaland) and so it would reasonable to expect a satisfying double-digit haul from him in Gameweek 26.\n\nThe Red Devils are due to host Crystal Palace on Sunday in what is a favourable match-up on current form.\n\nThe Eagles may still be feeling the effects of Thursday night’s Conference League play-off second leg against Zrinjski.\n\n\n\nMichael Carrick’s troops will then travel to St James’ Park to take on Newcastle on Wednesday night, a tougher prospect but nothing to be overly cautious of given the Magpies have lost four of their last five league games.\n\nScore Predictor Play Score Predictor with Dream Team this season Free to play\n\nEvery correct prediction earns you one entry into the end-of-season £10,000 prize draw\n\nPlay in Mini Leagues against your mates\n\nPLAY NOW!\n\nIf Fernandes doesn’t catch the imagine then perhaps Bryan Mbeumo (£5.8m) fits the bill better.\n\nFinally, Igor Thiago (£3.6m) deserves a mention ahead of Brentford’s trips to Burnley and Bournemouth.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe Bees’ No9 has scored 18 goals this season with all but one coming in the league.\n\nAlthough he’s slowed down in the last month or so with just one goal in his last six outings."

Make no mistake, the ‘Premflix’ TV channel is coming to you, sooner or later.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt might be as early as 2029, when the current £6.7billion domestic deal with Sky Sports and TNT Sports comes to an end. But whenever ‘Premflix’ hits our screens, one of the first questions that will be asked is … what took them so long?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe streaming arrangement with Singapore company StarHub means all 380 games will be shown live on a special channel, Premier League +. The channel will also have magazine content.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPremier League slammed over Man City 115 charges verdict delay as La Liga chief lets rip READ MORE :\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

It allows us to look differently in the future,” Richard Masters, the Premier League’s chief executive, told the FT Live Business of Football summit.\n\nAnd it does not take a leap of imagination to envisage how ‘differently’ televised Premier League football in the United Kingdom will look in the not-too-distant future. The organisation’s own streaming service might run alongside a TV deal with Sky, or whoever, but you can be almost certain of one thing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWe will not go into the next decade with an arrangement that means not every Premier League game is available to watch as it happens. The Americans who own Premier League clubs will surely see to that.\n\nView 4 Images The Premier League's current domestic TV deal is up for renewal in 2029 (Image: George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nView 4 Images Sky Sports is the main broadcaster of the Premier League but can only show a limited number of matches live (Image: PA)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFundamentally, it is an insult to the passion and commitment of fans of clubs throughout the entire football pyramid to suggest they would not go and support their team if Bournemouth v Brentford was being shown on the telly at the same time. And with respect to those two teams, it would, generally, be Bournemouth v Brentford, or sides of a similar ilk.\n\nThe big TV guns - Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal - are needed for prime time as it stands right now. You can see a point in the future when they never play at 3pm on a Saturday. It would be another mighty blow to the tradition and history of football on these shores but since when has that been a concern of Premier League club owners?\n\nView 4 Images Richard Masters has given no indication of the 3pm blackout being up for discussion (Image: Sky Sports/NBC Sports)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThey are, as a rule, successful business people and, whether you like it or not, they have a product that is in phenomenal demand at home and abroad. For elements of that product to be unavailable to watch live is a glaring anomaly in 21st century sports broadcasting.\n\nAnd don’t worry about the clubs in the Championship, in Leagues One and Two, in the National League and in all the leagues below. Their loyalty will not even be remotely tested by Bournemouth v Brentford on Premflix at 3pm on a Saturday.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

After netting twice against Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby, Gyokeres has reached 15 goals and two assists across all competitions.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA hat-trick at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, or three goal contributions, would trigger the milestone, although it would require an exceptional display. The most goals Gyokeres has contributed in a single fixture this season are two.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGyokeres has, however, achieved this six times this term, one of which was against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg.\n\nGyokeres netted Arsenal's second and teed up Martin Zubimendi for their third in the 3-2 away victory.\n\nThat marked the first match he found the back of the net and provided an assist for a team-mate's goal.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe only other instance arrived a fortnight later, during another 3-2 triumph, this time against Kairat in their final fixture of the Champions League's league phase.\n\nFOLLOW OUR ARSENAL FB PAGE! Latest Gunners news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nSunday's victory over Spurs marked his fourth double, with the others arriving against Atletico Madrid, Leeds United and Sunderland. Gyokeres' strikes, however, will cost Arsenal no more than £874,000 additional funds, as there is only one further instalment linked to his scoring should the forward manage to reach 40 goals and assists.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAppearances, though, are an element Arsenal have already needed to supplement the initial sum they paid Sporting. They are reported to have paid out £1.1million after Gyokeres made his 20th appearance that lasted at least a complete half - 45 minutes - which was the 3-2 triumph over Bournemouth.\n\nSporting will continue to collect that sum after every 20 appearances that satisfy the minutes-based requirements, up to No. 80.\n\nAt that stage, they will have banked £4.4million in total from their former frontman representing Arsenal.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Viktor Gyokeres has scored 15 goals so far this season for Arsenal (Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)\n\nGyokeres has reached 30 following the north London derby, so another payment could materialise before the conclusion of this campaign if he remains fully fit.\n\nSporting will also be anticipating the £874,000 they are owed from the Gunners upon securing next season's Champions League qualification. They are set to collect that figure each time Arsenal qualify, until it totals £3.5million, for a sum of four instalments.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nBy the close of the season, Gyokeres could set Arsenal back a total of £3.5m in additional fees, inclusive of the clauses he's already activated.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Rashford, currently on loan at the Spanish giants from Manchester United, is pushing for a permanent transfer, while Kane's club future remains uncertain, with his Bayern Munich contract set to expire in just over a year.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe prospect of both England internationals ending up in Catalonia isn't out of the question, leaving Barcelona boss Hansi Flick with some big decisions to make in terms of squad planning this summer.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRashford has made it clear that he wants to stay at Barcelona beyond the end of the season - and he looks increasingly likely to get his wish. The La Liga giants have reportedly pledged to pay the £26million buyout clause in Rashford's contract, a figure United are unwilling to reduce .\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOver recent months, the two clubs have explored terms to make a permanent deal possible, following Rashford's impressive start in Spain.

We'll see what happens next summer.\n\n\"I'm adapting very well to the club and the city. From the moment I arrived I felt that everyone welcomed me very well.

However, a permanent move to Barcelona now looks most likely.\n\nAs for Kane, his long-term future is increasingly unclear. By the end of the season, he will have just 12 months remaining on his Bayern contract - the same situation that forced Tottenham to sell the striker in 2023, to avoid losing him for free a year later.\n\nBarcelona have emerged as a potential destination for the England captain, particularly with star striker Robert Lewandowski approaching his 38th birthday and the end of his Camp Nou contract, which expires at the end of the season. The Poland international is still scoring goals, but Barcelona are now facing a 'stick or twist' moment regarding his future.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Harry Kane's Bayern contract expires in 2027 (Image: Leonhard Simon/Getty Images)\n\nIf Barcelona allow Lewandowski's contract to expire, they will need a proven, ready-made replacement - and Kane fits the profile perfectly, having consistently scored goals in both England and Germany.\n\nHowever, if a deal for Kane cannot be secured this summer, the club might consider offering Lewandowski a last-minute contract extension. After all, Kane recently downplayed speculation about a move, insisting he is \"very happy\" in Bavaria.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I haven't heard anything about it,\" Kane said when asked about links to Barca. \"My father and brother handle everything, but they haven't said anything to me. As I've already said, I'm very happy here at Bayern. I'm focused on this season and my time at Bayern. I take it as a compliment.\"\n\nView 4 Images Barcelona need to find a strong replacement for Robert Lewandowski if the Pole leaves this summer (Image: Fadel SENNA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nKane has been in sensational form this season, netting an incredible 43 goals in 36 games. Talks over a contract extension are reportedly ongoing, but if Bayern falter, Barcelona could move in to snap the 32-year-old up.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nA move to the Camp Nou would make Kane just the third Englishman to play for the Blaugrana in the last century. Rashford became the second earlier this season, following Gary Lineker, who scored 52 goals in 138 appearances between 1986 and 1989.\n\nBeyond Kane, Barcelona are also linked with Atletico Madrid forward Julian Alvarez. The former Manchester City star, who scored 29 goals in all competitions last season, is reportedly open to a move. However, prying him away from Atleti will be costly, with reports suggesting it could take a bid exceeding £80m to convince the Madrid club to sell."

After he netted two and set up the third in a 3-2 victory over Arsenal in the Premier League just three days later, people really saw his potential.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt was at this point that Carrick offered the young Rashford some sound but firm advice.

            "content": "Cheltenham Festival 2026 VIP tickets still available but with 'limited availability'\n\nCheltenham Festival 2026 VIP and hospitality tickets are in high demand as the four-day racing event nears.\n\nView 2 Images The Cheltenham Festival is almost upon us\n\nThe Cheltenham Festival 2026 is fast approaching and tickets are flying off the shelves. Between March 10 and March 13, thousands of racing enthusiasts will flock to the legendary Cheltenham Racecourse.\n\nFor those wanting to splash out, VIP and hospitality packages remain on sale, featuring complimentary food and beverages alongside outstanding views of the racing. These premium experiences are available through Seat Unique, though only 'limited availability' remains.\n\nPackages can still be secured for every day of the four-day meeting, including Champion Day, Ladies Day, St Patrick's Thursday and Gold Cup Day. General admission passes are also on sale via The Jockey Club, with various ticketing options available across all four days of racing, reports the Manchester Evening News.\n\nHere are the details for VIP and hospitality Cheltenham Festival tickets:\n\nVIP and hospitality packages for the Cheltenham Festival remain on offer through Seat Unique. Priced at £799 per person, racegoers can experience an all-inclusive day in the Champions Club Restaurant, featuring a four-course dining experience and complimentary bar service until the final race begins.\n\nThe package also grants access to a viewing box with spectacular panoramic views of the course, plus a Club badge allowing unrestricted access across the entire venue. Champions Club Restaurant availability is 'limited', with only days two and three currently bookable.\n\nCheltenham Festival 2026 VIP and hospitality tickets from £799 Seat Unique Buy tickets here Product Description Seat Unique provides a range of VIP and hospitality ticket options for all four days of Cheltenham Festival.\n\nDay three of Cheltenham (St Patrick's Thursday) currently offers the widest selection of tickets, with costs starting at £799 for the Champions Club Restaurant and rising to £1,179 for the Chez Roux Restaurant. The latter features Michelin-starred chef Michel Roux Jr. and provides a four-course fine-dining menu alongside canapés and a Moët champagne reception.\n\nAdditional hospitality packages for day three include the Final Fence Restaurant (£1,019), featuring a four-course grand buffet situated in the centre of The Village – adjacent to the Guinness Village – with views overlooking the final fence horses clear before charging up the hill towards the Winning Post. Those attending the Four Eighty Restaurant (£1,069) will be treated to a cocktail reception, three-course lunch, complimentary bar and club access throughout the festival.\n\nNumerous tickets remain available each day for The Alan Brazil and Ray Parlour Suite, a course-facing hospitality suite presented by the football legends. Costs vary from £1,099 to £1,249 based on the day selected, which also features a club enclosure admission badge, VIP hostess service and a celebrity tipster.\n\nView 2 Images All the action beings on March 10 (Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe day begins with a buck's fizz reception before a four-course meal, afternoon tea, and a complimentary bar. A celebrity tipster will be available to offer expert guidance, whilst all the racing will be broadcast live on TV and guests can take advantage of other perks including complimentary car parking and a free racecard and newspaper.\n\nCheltenham Festival 2026 general admission\n\nThe Jockey Club is the official supplier of general admission tickets, with entry-level access starting from £54 per person for the Best Mate Enclosure. Reserved seating in the Guinness Grandstand begins at £130, with the venue boasting 'one of the best views' in racing.\n\nViagogo and resale tickets Sites such as viagogo, Stubhub, and Vivid Seats allow fans to buy resale tickets from other fans. However, it is important to note that ticket conditions often prohibit resale after initial purchase. Those tickets may not be valid for admittance to gigs. Fans intending to buy tickets for live events through resale websites should check the ticket terms and conditions, to confirm whether resale is prohibited, before they buy. Ticket terms and conditions can be checked with the original seller, such as Ticketmaster or Live Nation. If resale is prohibited, tickets bought second-hand could be voided and admission to the event refused.\n\nTickets for Cheltenham can also be purchased through resale platforms such as viagogo and StubHub, though some are currently listed above face value once booking fees are taken into account. That said, bargain hunters may strike lucky as sellers drop their prices closer to the event.\n\nCheltenham Festival 2026 full race schedule\n\nDay 1: Champion Day – Tuesday, March 10\n\n1.20pm – The Sky Bet Supreme Novices’ Hurdle (Grade 1)\n\n2.00pm – The Singer Arkle Novices’ Chase (Grade 1)\n\n2.40pm – The McCoys Contracts Juvenile Handicap Hurdle (Premier Handicap)\n\n3.20pm – The Ultima Handicap Chase (Premier Handicap)\n\n4.00pm – The Unibet Champion Hurdle (Grade 1)\n\n4.40pm – The TrustATrader Plate Handicap Chase (Premier Handicap)\n\n5.20pm – The Princess Royal National Hunt Novices’ Handicap Chase\n\nDay 2: Ladies Day – Wednesday, March 11\n\n1.20pm – The Turners Novices’ Hurdle (Grade 1)\n\n2.00pm – The Brown Advisory Novices’ Chase (Grade 1)\n\n2.40pm – The Coral Cup Handicap Hurdle (Premier Handicap)\n\n3.20pm – The Glenfarclas Cross Country Handicap Chase\n\n4.00pm – The BetMGM Queen Mother Champion Chase (Grade 1)\n\n4.40pm – The Debenhams Johnny Henderson Grand Annual Handicap Chase (Premier Handicap)\n\n5.20pm – The Weatherbys Champion Bumper (Grade 1)\n\nDay 3: St Patrick’s Thursday – Thursday, March 12\n\n1.20pm – The Ryanair Mares’ Novices’ Hurdle (Grade 2)\n\n2.00pm – The Jack Richards Novices’ Limited Handicap Chase (Grade 2)\n\n2.40pm – The Close Brothers Mares’ Hurdle (Grade 1)\n\n3.20pm – The Paddy Power Stayers' Hurdle (Grade 1)\n\n4.00pm – The Ryanair Chase (Grade 1)\n\n4.40pm – The Pertemps Network Final Handicap Hurdle (Premier Handicap)\n\n5.20pm – The Rosconn Group Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Amateur Jockeys’ Handicap Chase\n\nArticle continues below\n\nDay 4: Gold Cup Day – Friday, March 13"

He kept on nicely when winning at Kempton last time and must have a strong chance despite another 3lb rise.\n\nFerrous was successful in this race last year under same pilot Tom Marquand. That was off a 10lb lower mark however and he will need to be at his best if he is to follow up. An excellent fourth behind subsequent winner Diligent Harry in the Kachy Stakes showed he is in rude health though.\n\nThe best of the rest may be Kevin Philippart de Foy's Lakers. He finished an excellent third from a wide draw in a strong race at Southwell and must be respected if in similar mood.\n\n3.00 Newbury - Miami Magic headlines strong novices' chase\n\nMiami Magic tops a quality line-up for the OLBG 'Chasing Excellence' Novices' Chase at Newbury.\n\nStuart Edmunds' stable star impressed when getting off the mark at the third time of asking at Cheltenham on his penultimate run. He struggled to land a blow in the Scilly Isles Novices' Chase at Sandown but given he did not jump with the same fluency, he should appreciate the drop down in class and is taken to concede the penalty under Charlie Hammond.\n\nWyenot has been a consistent performer for the Henry Daly team and has undergone a wind operation having disappointed at Bangor. Providing that is a success, she could bounce back and rates next best.\n\nThat's Nice, Elysian Knight and Thank You Ma'am complete the quintet.\n\n2.12 Lingfield - In-form Henrythenate and Mr Juggles clash\n\nAn ultra-competitive renewal of the Betmgm Awc 3 Year Old Trial Handicap where in-form pair Henrythenate and Mr Juggles headline.\n\nHenrythenate made it two wins from two for new trainer Stuart Williams when comfortably winning over five furlongs at Wolverhampton 15 days ago and he looks the type to go in again as he steps up in trip to six furlongs.\n\nMick Appleby's Mr Juggles was well-backed when making a winning handicap debut at Southwell earlier this month and he warrants plenty of respect under a 7lb penalty.\n\nOthers with each-way chances are Star Of Albion and Saffron Dandy, while Horace Wallace makes appeal on his first handicap start.\n\nBest of the rest\n\n3.45 Lingfield - AW Marathon Trial - Last year's winner Roaring Legend involved. Enemy another to note.\n\n4.20 Lingfield - AW Middle Distance Trial - Duke's Command fancied for Marquand. Lord Melbourne too.\n\n4.53 Lingfield - AW Mile Trial - Superposition among 10 runners.\n\n2.42 Lingfield - AW Fillies & Mares Trial - Bridget's View tops a field of 11.\n\n3.35 Newbury - Taunton winner Talk To The Man catches the eye for Paul Nicholls.\n\n4.08 Newbury - Fair handicap chase where Carbon Man and Daytime Dreaming feature.\n\n2.30 Newbury - Lady Cecilia is a potential improver for Lucy Wadham.\n\n6.15 Wolverhampton - Charlie Appleby and Conor Planas team up with well-bred Starglow. He is related to Romantic Style.\n\n5.45 Wolverhampton - Benacre and Maximising have claims.\n\n12.25 Chantilly - Vatican will be popular.\n\n1.00 Chantilly - Keep an eye on Turbulante."

George has got the team around him. Kimi [Antonelli] will be stronger this year in the other car, but George is completely out of Lewis [Hamilton]'s shadow there, he's the king of the castle at Mercedes-Benz.\n\n\"He did all those years at Williams and then he went to Mercedes when they just stopped dominating, so he's done the hard yards.\n\n\"I think he's got the experience, he's got the car control, and I think he will command the respect in the team to help drive what's going to be an incredibly changeable year.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Craig Slater and Martin Brundle review and rank all the F1 teams after pre-season testing\n\nSpeaking during an appearance on Sky Sports News, Brundle added: \"I think his team-mate Kimi Antonelli will have a great season as well, but George has got all the confidence he needs to win races and to go and win a championship, if it's available to him.\n\n\"We questioned that with Lando [Norris] last year, and Oscar [Piastri] too, whether they would wilt under pressure from Max [Verstappen], and they didn't.\n\n\"I think George is in a very good place.\"\n\nAsked how Russell would handle any increased intra-Mercedes challenge from team-mate Kimi Antonelli, the 19-year-old Italian entering his second year of F1, Brundle added: \"Remember, [Russell] grew up in Lewis Hamilton's shadow at Mercedes, and he handled that, and eventually in the final year they were team-mates, he beat Lewis clearly.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Russell admits his two starts in Bahrain have been 'worse' than his worst-ever start in Formula 1\n\n\"So, I have no doubts about him whatsoever. They're all world-class drivers in F1, you've got to beat them somehow.\n\n\"I think George has got so much experience now despite not being 30 yet, that I don't think anything will distract him if he's got a championship-winning car.\"\n\n'No clear favourite' - Brundle expects open 'big-four' battle\n\nWhile Mercedes may be favourites for both titles heading into the 24-race campaign, Brundle believes they will face a challenge from all three of their established rivals on the evidence of the three winter tests.\n\n\"I see Ferrari being strong, I see both Ferrari drivers being strong,\" said Brundle.\n\n\"I think both McLaren drivers will be strong as well. Oscar will come back on a mission after what he learned last year; Lando, I don't think I've ever seen him yet not with that big grin on his face so far this year, he's just got that comfort now.\n\n\"The Red Bull looks really strong, and we know how Max's car control, which you'll need with these cars, will be incredible.\n\n\"So, for me, there's not a clear favourite.\"\n\nWatch every race of the 2026 Formula 1 season live on Sky Sports, starting with the Australian Grand Prix from March 6-8.

The Egypt international has won the Golden Boot four times since arriving at Anfield in 2017, the latest in last season’s title-winning campaign but has gone nine league matches without finding the net. It’s his worst run in the English top flight but Slot said while the criticism was to be expected because of the 33-year-old’s high standards it was not a cause for a concern as it was a problem afflicting all his forwards. “He set his own standards and those are so high and the moment he doesn’t score for a few games people are immediately surprised – that is the biggest compliment he can get,” said Slot. “With data you can use it to your advantage or disadvantage but not to use the FA Cup game – if we play a Premier League side - you could argue if that is fair. “Three games ago he had an assist and a goal against a very good Premier League team in Brighton so that is the reality and then you can change data and say he did not score in nine Premier League games. We are used to Mo scoring a lot of goals and at this moment in time that is maybe the biggest difference in his performance and game time. But we also know this has happened before, I don’t know if it happened nine games in a row but I’ve had these questions earlier if he didn’t score for three or five but I know in the end he always starts scoring again. He is not our only attacker at this moment in time that doesn’t score as much as we are used to.” [Press Association] Share\n\n1h ago 05.24 EST Football Association news: Kevin Thelwell has been appointed the FA’s Elite Coach Developer, tasked with supporting the progression of elite homegrown coaches.

Arne Slot has opened his pre-match presser by telling reporters that Florian Wirtz will not be fit for the game and there’s no confirmed time frame on the German’s return. Wirtz missed Liverpool’s somewhat fortuitous win against Nottingham Forest last weekend after being forced to pull out during the warm-up. “I don’t expect Florian to be available,” he says. “It’s a disappointment. Every time a player is not available is a disappointment, it’s something that I didn’t expect after last week. At this moment time, I don’t know [when he will return]. Usually when I say that, I do know and I don’t want to share. But this time, I honestly don’t know. “It’s a big accomplishment for Wirtz to stay fit for such a long time because he had to make a step up from where he played to the Premier League and Liverpool. It tells a lot about his mentality and work rate that he has stayed fit for so long. It is a disappointment for him and for us, because he has played really, really well lately” Slot also reveals that Jeremie Frimpong will be available for tomorrow’s match after being sidelined since the end of January.

            "content": "Liverpool had the highest wage bill in the Premier League when winning their 20th league title last season, the club’s latest set of accounts have revealed.\n\nLiverpool’s wage bill increased by £42m to £428m in the year ending 31 May 2025, when a Premier League title triumph in Arne Slot’s debut season as head coach and a return to the Champions League increased revenue to a record £703m. The club’s wages-to-revenue ratio stood at a healthy 61%. It was the biggest wage bill in the division, ahead of Manchester City on £408m.\n\nCommercial revenue increased by £15m to £323m and matchday revenue by £14m to £116m. The figures contributed to an increase of £89m in revenue for the highest-ranked Premier League club in the Deloitte Football Money League. But the rise in wages, which pushed administrative costs up by £57m to £657m, resulted in a relatively modest post-tax profit of £8m. Liverpool had a £57m loss in 2023-24 after failing to qualify for the Champions League.\n\n“We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it,” said Liverpool’s chief financial officer, Jenny Beacham. “The 2024-25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men’s team winning our 20th league title.\n\n“The club does face significant cost challenges, including rises in administrative, staffing and operational costs, alongside the need for us to compete at the highest level of the game, across our men and women’s teams.”\n\nLiverpool’s latest set of published accounts do not include last summer’s record spend of almost £450m on new players, including the British record signing of Alexander Isak for £125m from Newcastle. Slot said recently that failure to qualify for the Champions League would be unacceptable for Liverpool this season and the competition “does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run”."

            "content": "Nottingham Forest have appointed a new director of performance, Tottenham’s former head of medicine and sports science Geoff Scott, amid concerns that injury problems have exacerbated their struggle to avoid relegation.\n\nScott spent 20 years at Tottenham until leaving two years ago after a clash with the then manager, Ange Postecoglou, who was in charge of Forest for eight matches this season.\n\nVítor Pereira was this month appointed Forest’s fourth manager of a turbulent campaign, and his side are two points above the bottom three before Sunday’s trip to Brighton.\n\nForest’s struggles have not been helped by injuries, with 19 players ruled out at some stage, one of the worst records in the Premier League. Only Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal have had more injuries, and those clubs have deeper squads.\n\nScott will take charge of an overhauled medical department, with the existing head of medical, Dr Prithish Narayan, understood to be leaving to return to work for the NHS.\n\nScott left Tottenham at the start of last season as part of a major restructure of Postecoglou’s backroom team, which led to the appointment of Adam Brett from Brighton as Spurs’ director of performance services. It was widely reported at the time that Scott had clashed with Postecoglou over the players’ workload and management of their recovery, with Tottenham declining to comment.\n\nTottenham’s squad has been devastated by injuries for the last two seasons under Postecoglou and Thomas Frank, with the club experiencing 41 injuries last season leading to 1,553 days out, the second-highest total in the Premier League after Brighton."

            "content": "Two months ago, Aston Villa were just three points off top spot in the Premier League. They were on a run of 12 wins in 14 games that included victories against Manchester City and Arsenal. Their run of eight consecutive wins in the league was their best since they won 10 in a row in 1910. You wouldn’t have blamed Villa fans for daring to dream about lifting their first league title since 1981.\n\nBut success breeds expectation, and expectation carries its own cruel weight. Arsenal tore Villa apart in a 4-1 win in late December and victories have been hard to come by in the new year – they have only won three of their last nine league games. Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea are still below them in the table but the gap is narrowing. With games against United and Chelsea coming in March, the top-three spot Villa have occupied since they beat Wolves in late November suddenly looks in jeopardy. So does their place in the Champions League next season.\n\nThey salvaged a point against Leeds on Saturday courtesy of a scrambled 88th-minute finish from Tammy Abraham, but the 1-1 draw at Villa Park did little to disguise the deeper issues. Unai Emery’s side looked anxious and lacked inspiration for long periods of the game. A slow start left them chasing the game and, not for the first time this season, they relied on a set-piece goal to bail them out of trouble. “It’s a good point,” said a clearly relieved Emery. Daniel Farke’s reaction was telling. “It’s crazy that you can come here as a newly promoted side – to one of the title contenders, one of the best teams in this country and in Europe – and you are slightly disappointed with just one point.”\n\nThe tension from the fans in Villa Park mirrored the hesitancy on the pitch – a rarity in what has been one of Europe’s most difficult venues to visit in recent years. Villa lost just one home game in the league last season and were on a run of eight straight wins at Villa Park this season before their current slump. And yet they were just minutes away from their fourth defeat in their last six home games in all competitions. For a side that has thrived on controlled possession, high-quality chance creation and adaptability, they looked one-dimensional and mistake-prone.\n\nVilla are lacking a creative pulse and their strikers are suffering. They have scored just one goal from open play in their last five matches. Injuries have had a large part to play in this. Three of their first-choice midfielders – Boubacar Kamara, Youri Tielemans and John McGinn – are out injured.\n\nTielemans and McGinn have set up 50 chances for teammates this season (only Morgan Rogers has been more creative) so it’s no surprise to see Villa struggle for goals. Without the physicality and control of their absent midfielders, Villa’s buildup play has been fractured and mistakes have crept in. Their replacements, Douglas Luiz and Amadou Onana, were injured earlier in the season and lack the match fitness required to complete games.\n\nView image in fullscreen Aston Villa have missed John McGinn, their captain, during his injury layoff. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nThe good news for Villa fans is that they have battled back from similar setbacks in the recent past. They failed to score a goal or win a point from their first four league matches this season yet were fighting for the title by Christmas.\n\nAnd they had to show plenty of character the last time they qualified for the Champions League, in the 2023–24 season. They were challenging for the title at Christmas, having lost just two of their first 18 games. But they struggled in the second half of the campaign, lost seven matches and found them themselves grinding out results. That team held on and finished fourth, booking their place in Europe’s top competition for the first time since the 1982-83 season.\n\nVilla are showing similar grit this season. After Abraham’s last-gasp equaliser against Leeds, Villa have won 19 points from losing positions – more than any other side in the division. They also have the third best defensive record, having conceded just 28 goals in 27 games. And they have one of the most experienced and shrewdest managers in Europe.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering that the Premier League is unusually competitive this season. The longest current winning streak in the league is just three matches (Manchester City). All of the top teams – even leaders Arsenal – have gone through periods when they have dug in. Villa’s resilience could prove decisive. Their recent draws against Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Leeds might feel like missed opportunities, but those points may prove crucial come May.\n\nMarch will be a season-defining month for Villa. Their recent form is patchy and their performances have been far from eye-catching. Fluidity in possession has given way to forced passes, and dominance has often been replaced by moments of desperation. But there remains a steel to this side that cannot be ignored. And, crucially given their upcoming games against their fellow Champions League chasers, they have a nice habit of beating the top sides. They have already beaten Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea in the league this season. There are plenty of reasons to go into the run-in with optimism.\n\nThis is an article by WhoScored"

            "content": "1 Emery seeks to end Wolves duck\n\nUnai Emery has seen most things in this game but he has never won at Wolves. In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on direct rivals. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season. Will Unwin\n\nBournemouth v Sunderland, Saturday 12.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Back in business: Granit Xhaka looks set to give Sunderland a timely boost. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea, where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in matchday chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) as they sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL interpreters will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here. Andy Hunter\n\nLiverpool v West Ham, Saturday 3pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Liverpool fans sing You’ll Never Walk Alone before kick-off at Anfield. Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images\n\n5 Centre stage for Gordon against old club\n\nNewcastle may be in the last 16 of the Champions League but they are also 11th in the Premier League, two places and one point behind Saturday’s visitors to St James’ Park, Everton. “We’ve raised our game at times in the Champions League, there’s no denying that,” says Eddie Howe. “But we want to get into Europe every season and we’re desperate to get our Premier League form back on track. We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left-winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German, who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire on Saturday. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track after a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croat’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and, considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance. WU\n\nFulham v Tottenham, Sunday 2pm\n\nView image in fullscreen João Palhinha (left) battles with Leandro Trossard during an uncomfortable afternoon in the north London derby. Photograph: Ian Walton/AP\n\n9 Amad to make way for Sesko?\n\nFor Michael Carrick to find a fall guy for Benjamin Sesko, who is seeking a first start under him, the interim manager need look no further than Amad Diallo. The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third goal in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes after the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

United said in a November 2024 filing they were paying Sporting £10m to hire Amorim to replace Erik ten Hag, whose exit was costing £10.4m.\n\nThe combined changes around Amorim’s appointment could cost United £36.3m.

            "content": "For 67 minutes, Nottingham Forest were at risk of matching an unwanted record. At that point Fenerbahce were 2-0 up and full of belief that they could achieve the miracle their head coach, Domenico Tedesco, had been manifesting since their 3-0 first-leg defeat in Istanbul.\n\nOnly one team in the history of European club competitions have lost the first leg of a tie by a three-goal margin at home and advanced in the second. Up in the directors’ box, Evangelos Marinakis, more than an interested party on that occasion, presumably had flashbacks of Olympiakos suffering a 4-1 home defeat by Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Conference League two years ago, only to triumph 6-1 in Serbia in the second leg.\n\nKerem Akturkoglu scored twice to fuel Fenerbahce’s hopes, his second from the penalty spot almost immediately after the half-time restart, but the Forest substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi struck midway through the second half to extinguish the visitors’ dreams. Forest will learn on Friday whether they will face Midtjylland or Real Betis, both of whom they played in the league phase and could not beat, in the last 16. Fenerbahce’s hopes of reaching the Europa League showpiece in May, across town in Besiktas Stadium, are over.\n\nThe way this game was set up, an early Fenerbahce goal was always going to shift the dynamic of the tie and the Turkish side got one when Akturkoglu applied the finishing touch to a counterattack. Vítor Pereira acknowledged the worst mistake Forest could make was to assume their place in the last 16 was secure and his much-changed side were disjointed and sloppy. “It was a thriller – with suspense,” Pereira said. “We had to suffer.”\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate. Agencies Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nIt was a long first half from a Forest perspective. The flares thrown on to the pitch by the Fenerbahce supporters within 30 seconds of kick-off paused the game for a couple of minutes. Murillo, who opened the scoring in style in Turkey, was uncomfortable and erratic after being shunted across to left-back, with fellow Brazilians Morato and Jair Cunha doing little to inspire confidence at centre-back. Luckily, Stefan Ortega, one of five Forest players to keep their spots, was alert in goal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elliot Anderson shoots narrowly wide against Fenerbahce in the first half. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nForest were in an awkward spot from the moment Dorgeles Nene released Sidiki Cherif down the right channel in the 22nd minute and suddenly it was two v two. Cherif squared the ball for Akturkoglu and, while Neco Williams got a touch after sliding in desperation, the Forest full-back then lost his footing and now the Fenerbahce forward just had Ortega to beat. Pereira scratched his head as the away end went ballistic.\n\nPereira attempted to stem the bleeding with a quadruple half-time substitution, introducing Hudson-Odoi, Ola Aina, Igor Jesus and Ibrahim Sangaré. Yet just 25 seconds after the restart, the Italian referee, Maurizio Mariani, pointed to the penalty spot after Akturkoglu collapsed in the box. Jair Cunha appeared to make little contact with the Fenerbahce striker but was deemed to have tripped Akturkoglu, who made the most of a clumsy challenge and stepped up from 12 yards to beat Ortega.\n\nThe changes lifted Forest but Pereira was always going to rest players with Sunday’s trip to Brighton their fourth game in 11 days. “We need to go there with fuel,” said the Forest head coach. “When you change half of the team it is not easy to keep the level. I didn’t expect a fantastic game after changing so many players. After we conceded the first goal, we lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at the same time but we needed to do it because the game came into a dangerous situation for us.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Fenerbahce fans threw flares on to the pitch and delayed the first half. Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPA\n\nAfter the penalty, Fenerbahce raced the ball back to the centre circle. Game on? Forest were faced with exactly the kind of scenario they must have dreaded, though the fear seemed to galvanise them. Jair Cunha and Nicolás Domínguez both fired shots at goal and Williams sent a swerving effort wide.\n\nForest commanded greater control and Pereira cut a relieved figure as his side re-established a two-goal aggregate buffer, a pair of substitutes combining to devastating effect. Aina chipped the ball towards the back post where Hudson-Odoi controlled brilliantly, twisted past Nelson Semedo, a half-time arrival himself, and prodded his shot into the far corner.\n\nPereira punched the air with both fists and the underlying tensions evaporated. Forest, for so long fraught with nerves, could finally rejoice. “We lost the chance to qualify at home in Kadikoy,” Tedesco said. “They most probably over-performed in our stadium and we underperformed. We leave the competition with our heads held high.”"

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final European fixture as a manager. He created such wonderful memories for Celtic’s support in this domain during his first tenure that departing with a smile felt appropriate. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts. “The evening is nothing to do with me,” said O’Neill with needless self-deprecation.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal inside 30 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered unexpected cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half – the hosts had 24 attempts at goal – but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that is worthy of huge credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have delivered a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite either set of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday at the start of a spell that will define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart had managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ragged and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe only goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. “I got carried away with myself,” O’Neill said later. “I thought ‘we are going to do this here’.”\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate. Agencies Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nSebastian Hoeness used the interval to replace Jamie Leweling with Chris Führich. The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm clash. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident been as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were only 25 minutes from that maiden win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly cancelled for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious as Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement albeit the officials had ushered him back on to the pitch. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "A MUM-of-three who disappeared without a trace in 2001 has been arrested just days after she was found alive and living a secret new life.\n\nMichelle Hundley Smith, now 62, was taken into custody in North Carolina on an outstanding warrant dating back to the year she vanished.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decades-old warrant stems from a drunk driving charge filed on November 11, 2001 – just weeks before she disappeared.\n\nAuthorities say she failed to appear in court in December 2001, and the warrant remained active for nearly 25 years.\n\nShe was arrested on Wednesday, posted a $2,000 bond and is scheduled to appear in court there on March 26.\n\nSmith’s arrest comes days after detectives tracked her down last Thursday at rural North Carolina community following a tip.\n\n\n\nDeputies said she was found “alive and well” and at her request, her exact whereabouts were not released.\n\nNeighbors said she had “been here for years and years” and mostly kept to herself.\n\nAuthorities say she left her husband and three children just before Christmas in 2001 and never contacted them again.\n\nSmith was 38 when she left her home in Eden, NC, on December 9, 2001.\n\n\n\nShe had told her family she was heading to a Kmart in Martinsville, Virginia, for Christmas shopping, but never returned.\n\nHer forest green 1995 Pontiac Trans Sport van was never recovered.\n\nFor nearly a quarter century, her disappearance haunted her family and baffled investigators.\n\nAuthorities said Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page told investigators Smith left of her own accord, citing “domestic issues.”\n\nBut Sheriff Page later told Fox News the sheriff’s office had no prior domestic violence reports on file.\n\n\n\nDistrict Attorney Katy Gregg, who serves Caswell and Rockingham counties, said her office will not pursue charges related to Smith’s disappearance.\n\n“I support their decision,” Gregg said after meeting with investigators.\n\nIn interviews after resurfacing, Smith claimed she had no idea her family had spent decades searching for her.\n\nShe told the Daily Mail: “I know that I made the news, but I honestly 100% never knew that I was loved or wanted.\n\n“When I left, the mental state I was in, I thought it was my only choice.\n\n\n\n“I was just not in the mental state to stay. My children were not abandoned, they were left with their father to care for them.”\n\nSmith added that she has reconnected with her middle daughter, Amanda.\n\n“She has forgiven me and she has said I’m human like anybody else is,” Smith said.\n\n\n\nThe mum said learning of the years-long search left her devastated.\n\n“I honestly believed I didn’t matter,” she said.\n\n“When I found out, it broke me. That’s why I’m trying to rebuild something with her, because what she did, shows how much I really was loved.”\n\nShe insisted she never saw missing person flyers, billboards or news reports, adding: “If I’d had any idea, I would have already called them and let them know I was ok.\n\n“I didn’t have to go back if I didn’t want to. I could have just let my kids know I was ok.\n\n\n\n“I would have never put them through that, I thought leaving them was better for them.”\n\nNew details have also emerged about the troubled months before she vanished.\n\nSmith had reportedly struggled with alcohol abuse and had been fired from a veterinary practice for “drinking on the job,” according to her daughter Amanda in a 2018 interview on The Vanished Podcast.\n\n“My dad didn’t like the fact that my mom hid her drinking,” Amanda said.\n\n“I knew about it, and I was the only one and I felt, you know, I was young and I felt obligated not to say anything to betray my mom.”\n\n\n\nCourt records show Smith had been arrested for driving under the influence just one month before she vanished.\n\nAuthorities say her failure to appear in court triggered the warrant that remained active for decades.\n\nSheriff Page has said it was not unusual for Smith to leave home for periods of time, which reportedly explains why she was not officially reported missing until New Year’s Eve 2001 – more than three weeks after she disappeared.\n\nIn a separate 2024 post before her mother was located, Amanda wrote: “All I do know is that you left a hole in people’s hearts!”\n\nSmith’s sister, brothers and extended family have also expressed relief she is alive.\n\n\n\nHer brothers told the Daily Mail: “We want Michele to know that we are so glad she is alive, we love her, we are not mad at her, all is forgiven.”\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nSmith’s mother died in November after spending nearly 25 years searching for answers.\n\nThe district attorney’s office has said it is conducting a full review of the case."

The complainant advised Smith to walk away.\n\n“Ellis intercepted angrily, squared up to the complainant, gesturing for her to fight.\n\n\n\n“Ellis punched her to the face, after which Smith took hold of the complainant and dragged her to the ground.\n\n“Both defendants repeatedly punched and kicked the complainant, who lost consciousness.”\n\nThe court heard the violence continued even after the woman fell unconscious and others became involved.\n\nThe victim’s nasal bones and septum were fractured and required manipulation in hospital.\n\nShe said in an impact statement she feared for her life at the time and changed from someone who was “bubbly and outgoing to now scared of big crowds and loud noises”.\n\n\n\nEllis and Smith both admitted assault and affray.\n\nThe mum, who has 103 convictions on her record, also admitted assaulting an emergency worker on that same night and assaulting two emergency workers during an unrelated confrontation.\n\nMark Harrison, defending Ellis, told the court the women had been out at a meal in Durham for the defendant’s hen party and had “enjoyed their day”.\n\nMr Harrison said Ellis has “no recollection” of insulting her daughter.\n\nHe added: “Her recollection is someone was making reference to the necklace she was wearing and had thought they had wanted it, had told her she couldn’t possibly have afforded to purchase it.\n\n\n\n“It was a gift from her then fiancé, now husband.”\n\nMr Harrison said Ellis accepted using “completely unacceptable violence” but that violence was then directed at her, she was left with an eye injury which bled profusely and her necklace was taken from her.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nMatthew Purves, defending Smith, said the day should have been a “joyous event” and the daughter drank more alcohol than she was used to.\n\nThe court heard both women are remorseful for what happened."

I was still moving forward.\n\n“Then I felt blood running down my face, and everything went dark.”\n\n\n\nShe was rushed to hospital, where doctors discovered a devastating injury.\n\nThe puncture wound stretched all the way to the back orbital bone of her eye.\n\nSurgeons worked desperately to save the eye with a series of operations – Shelby received more than 30 stitches deep inside her eye and stents in her tear ducts.\n\nBut the damage was done, and two months after the accident, doctors delivered the news that would change Shelby’s life forever: her eye could not be saved.\n\nIt had to be removed, and the snowboarder underwent one last surgery on April 29, 2021.\n\n\n\nRecalling the life-changing operation, she said: “At the time, it felt like the decision was made for me.”\n\n“Looking back, that was a blessing. I didn’t have to carry the weight of choosing.”\n\n\n\nShelby then faced the slow and frustrating process of learning to live with vision in only one eye, which left her exhausted, dizzy and struggling with depth perception.\n\nEveryday tasks which had been so simple before, like driving, suddenly required patience and retraining.\n\nThe emotional impact of losing an eye was also profound.\n\nShe said: “The hardest part was accepting that I was missing a part of myself I was born with.\n\n“I realised life can change suddenly and severely without warning.”\n\n\n\nShelby felt isolated by the loss of her eye, at a time she needed connection most, and began to share her experience on Instagram.\n\nOver time, she grew a social media community connecting people who might otherwise have faced eye loss alone.\n\nShelby even began developing adhesive eye patches designed for people navigating eye loss and prosthetics, drawing on her own experience of struggling to find comfortable, high-quality eye coverings after surgery.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nReflecting on the accident, she said: “That moment could have been the end of my story.\n\n“Instead, it became the start of a life with deeper purpose.”"

Those reports were all-but confirmed this week as the teenager was front-and-centre at the North's party congress on February 26.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAlso at the conference was Kim Yo Jong, who joined her brother during the week-long Ninth Congress of the Workers’ Party as she accepted a glittering new role.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBritain almost on WWIII 'frontline' says Armed Forces Minister READ MORE :\n\nView 4 Images Kim Yo Jong has been seen for the first time since she was sidestepped as successor (Image: KCNA)\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

She has been a major figure on the North's political frontlines since her brother ascended to the country's top spot following their father's 2011 death.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nExperts have said the promotion, which came with a new portrait offering the latest glimpse at dictator Kim's sister, was significant and allows the dictator to deepen his control across the government.\n\nView 4 Images Kim Jong-Un has reportedly decided his daughter with lead the nation (Image: KCNA VIA KNS/AFP via Getty Image)\n\nAt the same time, it keeps Kim, who is said to enjoy major support from within the country's military, happy. According to North Korean defector and scholar Ahn Chan-il, she is one of few people who brutal Kim \"can trust and rely on\". She told the AFP news agency: \"Kim Yo Jong is one of the very few people that Kim Jong Un can trust and rely on.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nKim has previously served in a host of high-profile roles, including as deputy department director at the propaganda wing. Ju Ae, meanwhile, has just started making her political opinions heard, suggesting she is being \"trained\" for the top spot.\n\nView 4 Images North Korea held its ninth congress this year (Image: KCNA VIA KNS/AFP via Getty Image)\n\nSpeaking after the NIS announcement earlier this month, South Korean lawmaker Lee Seong-kwen said she was at the stage of \"successor designation\". He said: \"As Kim Ju Ae has shown her presence at various events, including the founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army and her visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, and signs have been detected of her voicing her opinion on certain state policies, the NIS believes she has now entered the stage of being designated as successor.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nShe appeared alongside her dad wearing matching jackets this week in a further sign that she is being groomed for the role. Ju Ae, according to intelligence, is Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju's only child - although the NIS believes the dictator has an older, unacknowledged son."

One of the properties was an empty cottage which was being renovated while the worst affected belonged to a family, who were out at the time.\n\nOne neighbour Sam Lawrence-Lewis, 32, said: \"I was alerted to it by a lorry driver who had noticed an electric cable had come down. I went out to try and establish the cause and saw that this huge landslide had damaged two of the houses nearby. I called the emergency services right away and police and fire crews came out and sealed off the area.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Luckily, she and her family were out at the time, which is just as well as it did quite a bit of damage. It has taken off the end of her house and left part of her back call all mangled and twisted.\n\n\"We had a landslide a few years ago so there is always the concern. But we fear the cause in this could have been contributed to the new owner of the cottage clearing loads of trees along the bank. They haven't lived there since they bought the property around six months ago at auction.\n\n\"They did a bit of work but then believe they ran into some planning permission issues so it had been a bit of an eyesore ever since. It wouldn't have been so bad if that got destroyed but I feel for my neighbour as her home had been badly damaged.\"\n\nOne of the homeowners Suzanne told the BBC she felt \"lucky\" her family were out at the time. She added: \"Every time I come out here I end up crying.\"\n\nSuzanne said a lorry driver was the first to notice an electrical cable was down and alerted neighbours, who called emergency services. She added: \"They secured the property as best they could to keep things safe and that's been it really since Friday.\n\n\"We're just trying to make sense of a new normal for us as a family and where we go from here, because obviously it's going to be a really long time to put this right.\"\n\nAnother resident, who did not want to be named, added: \"I thought there had been an earthquake. There was a landslide previously there before but this one was worse. It's a miracle nobody was hurt or killed. It could have been disastrous.\"\n\nHerefordshire Council said it was awaiting the results of a survey of the rock face to see if the road adjacent to the properties could safely reopen."

The common parasite can survive up to two weeks on contaminated surfaces and children can get infected again even after being treated.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThreadworms, also known as pinworms, are tiny white parasitic worms that live in the large intestine and rectum. It’s a highly contagious parasite that is passed when a person ingests threadworm eggs, which can be picked up on contaminated surfaces, bedding or hands.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThere are five key symptoms of threadworms, some of which may only be noticeable at night or after your child has gone to the bathroom. The most common symptom is intensely itchy skin around the anus, particularly at night.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOther threadworm symptoms include, according to the NHS:\n\nIrritability or waking up during the night\n\nweight loss\n\nwetting the bed\n\nirritated skin around the anus\n\nView 3 Images Pharmacists can advise on treatments (Image: GETTY)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIan Budd, Lead Prescribing Pharmacist at Chemist4U, added: “You might also notice small, white thread-like worms in your child’s stool or around their bottom first thing in the morning.\n\n“You catch threadworms by accidentally swallowing their microscopic eggs. These spread very easily through hand-to-mouth contact after touching contaminated surfaces such as toys, bedding, clothing, or by scratching the itchy area where female worms lay their eggs. This creates a cycle of reinfection, which is why it can spread so quickly within households, nurseries, and schools.”\n\nThe pharmacist warned families that even if only one person has symptoms, they may all need to undergo treatment and practice extreme caution.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe said: “As the eggs can survive on surfaces for up to two weeks, it’s not uncommon for the whole family to require treatment at the same time, even if only one person has symptoms. Alongside medication, strict hygiene measures are essential to break the cycle of infection.”\n\nThe infection can be treated by pharmacists without a GP appointment. Budd explained they’ll usually point people towards medications like Ovex and Vermox which contain medendazole, an antiparasitic medication.\n\nHe urged parents to stick to the treatment protocol and follow some key advice to avoid getting more infections in the household: “These treatments work by killing the worms, although they do not kill the eggs, which is why a second dose is often needed after two weeks.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“In addition to treatment, families should ensure that they are washing their hands thoroughly and regularly, keeping fingernails short, changing underwear and bedding daily for at least two weeks, and cleaning household surfaces frequently.”\n\nSome other ways to stop a threadworm infection from spreading include washing hands frequently, having a strict morning hygeine routine including washing the anal area to remove eggs laid overnight.\n\nView 3 Images Children can get threadworms again after being treated (Image: GETTY)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe added: “Change and wash clothing and bedding daily. Underwear, pyjamas, bed linen, and towels should be washed on a hot cycle for at least two weeks to help remove lingering eggs.\n\n“Keep fingernails short and discourage scratching. Eggs can collect under fingernails and easily transfer to the mouth or other surfaces. Wearing close-fitting underwear at night can also help reduce scratching during sleep.\n\n“With prompt treatment and consistent hygiene measures, threadworm can usually be cleared effectively within a few weeks.”\n\nArticle continues below\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Take our poll and have your say\n\nThe disastrous result for Labour in Gorton and Denton will pile huge pressure on Keir Starmer, whose critics will demand a move to the left to counter the threat of the buoyant Green Party\n\nView 2 Images The brutal defeat will pile further pressure on Keir Starmer (Image: Getty Images)\n\nLabour's brutal defeat in Gorton and Denton will set up weeks of soul-searching at the top of the party.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe handsome majority the Green Party's Hannah Spencer won in a previously safe seat will has been dubbed a wake up call for the leadership. The warning signs were there - Labour left-wingers have long accused Keir Starmer of focusing too heavily on Nigel Farage, leaving himself vulnerable to the Greens, led by an energetic Zack Polanski.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe latest setback will really sting. If the Greens can take Gorton and Denton, dozens of seats up and down the country are vulnerable. Mr Starmer's critics argue the only way to counter that is with a swing to the left.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFormer deputy PM Angela Rayner - tipped as a future leader - warned that things cannot go on as they are. She posted on X: \"This result must be a wake up call. It's time to really listen - and to reflect.\"\n\nAsylum hotel use drops as bombshell migration figures show big changes READ MORE :\n\nAnd she continued: \"If we want to unrig the system, if we want to make the change we were sent into Government to make, we have to be braver. A labour agenda that puts people first.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"That's what all of us across our movement need to rededicate ourselves to this morning.\" And Sharon Graham, leader of trade union Unite, said: \"If Labour needed any further wake-up calls, this is clearly one. Labour need to now ditch the gimmicks and get back to being Labour - not new, not one that plays games, but real Labour.\"\n\nThe question now for Mr Starmer is how he responds to the new threat from the left. Last year the Runcorn and Helsby constituency fell to Reform UK, with divisive Sarah Pochin scraping through by six votes in a by-election.\n\nView 2 Images Unite leader Sharon Graham has called on Labour to change course (Image: Jess Hurd)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat threat remains, so the PM finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place. But Gorton and Denton shows that Labour can no longer rely on progressive voters to rally round a centre-left leadership. And that will worry him.\n\nFire Brigades Union general secretary Steve Wright said: \"Labour's entire strategy of framing politics as 'it's us v Reform' is in tatters after its very first electoral test. If the Government does not change course immediately, it will face heavy losses in the May elections, and at that point the political consequences for Keir Starmer will become unavoidable.\"\n\nIn the wake of the defeat, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander was sent to face the media - vowing the leadership would \"reflect and learn\" from what happened. But she told Today: \"The people of Gordon and Denton have now got an MP who might have well meaning but ultimately misplaced idealism. The world is not a soft and fluffy place at the moment.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nLabour HQ meanwhile remains defiant. A Labour source said: \"The Greens can win a by-election, but they cannot win a general election. George Galloway - who backed the Greens in this by-election - won seats mid-term, only to lose them again. And he certainly never became PM.\n\n\"The Green Party's policies, including legalising all drugs and withdrawing from Nato, are not a serious programme for government.\""

            "content": "Police have issued an update on the condition of Ian Huntley following a prison attack.\n\nThe Soham murderer remains in a serious condition in hospital after having been violently attacked in jail on Thursday morning. Huntley, 52, was airlifted to hospital after he was reportedly knocked unconscious with a metal pole at HMP Frankland - a category A men's prison - in County Durham.\n\nA Durham Constabulary spokesperson said in an update today: \"There has been no change in the 52-year-old man's condition overnight - he remains in hospital in a serious condition.\"\n\nThe top suspect in the attack is Anthony Russell, who reportedly claimed \"I've killed him\" afterwards. It is believed Huntley was working in the segregated wing when he was hit in the head with a metal bar.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as your Preferred Source in your Google search settings.\n\nHuntley, a former school caretaker from Soham, Cambridgeshire, is serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 40 years for murdering 10-year-olds Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in August 2002.\n\nHe was handed two life sentences in December 2003 after being found guilty of both murders and related offences, including attempting to pervert the course of justice.\n\nThe schoolgirls disappeared from their quiet village on August 4, sparking a major search operation. Their bodies were discovered two weeks later in a ditch near an air base in Lakenheath, Suffolk.\n\nDuring his six-week trial, the court heard that Huntley had lured the children to his home, where he killed them.\n\nImage: Shutterstock) Shutterstock)\n\nThe case exposed serious failings in police vetting and child safeguarding. It emerged that Huntley had secured a job working with children despite a series of complaints of rape and other sexual offences having been made against him to police in Humberside, where he had worked earlier. The Soham murders led to sweeping reforms in the way police forces share intelligence.\n\nIt is not the first time Huntley has been attacked at HMP Frankland. In 2010, robber Damien Fowkes slashed his throat with a home-made weapon, leaving him with a seven-inch wound that required 21 stitches.\n\nFowkes asked a prison officer at the time: \"Is he dead? I hope so.\" He described Huntley as a \"notorious child killer, both inside prison and in society in general\".\n\nIt comes after former Lostprophets frontman Ian Watkins died in October after being stabbed in the neck at HMP Wakefield, where he was serving a 29-year sentence for child sexual offences.\n\nThis is a Breaking News story.

The event takes place this Saturday, 28 February, at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nComedian Jack Whitehall is back for his sixth stint as the main host of the BRIT awards whilst Charley Marlowe and Tyler West will front the Red Carpet coverage. Olivia Dean and Lola Young are leading the pack this year with five nominations each, with Sam Fender hot on their heels with four, and fans reckon one artist is poised to dominate proceedings – Olivia.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe 26-year-old Londoner is experiencing a phenomenal year, evolving from a \"best-kept secret\" to an international sensation with chart-topping success on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, she scooped Best New Artist at the 68th Grammy Awards, becoming the first British artist to secure the \"Big Four\" trophy since Dua Lipa in 2019.\n\nView 3 Images Jack Whitehall is back hosting the event (Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nShe was also appointed Record Store Day UK 2026 Ambassador and was recently honoured as Rookie of the Year by Billboard.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDean additionally became the first British solo female artist since Adele to simultaneously hold the UK No. 1 album and single.\n\nHer breakthrough smash \"Man I Need\" conquered the UK charts and peaked at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, whilst she's delivered other massive hits including \"So Easy (To Fall In Love)\" and \"Nice To Each Other\".\n\nDiscussing this year's awards on Reddit, one fan commented: \"It seems like an Olivia Dean sweep is imminent this year.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, another commented: \"Olivia seems to be the frontrunner here but for Album of the Year I can see Lily Allen (critically acclaimed, had a viral moment) and Sam Fender (Mercury Prize winner, Brit Awards love him) winning too.\"\n\nA third remarked: \"I can see it being similar to Raye's year where she [Olivia] sweeps most of the categories.\"\n\nThat said, plenty of observers reckon it could equally be Lily Allen's moment to shine.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I can see Lily Allen snatching a few,\" one person suggested, whilst another dubbed it \"Lily Allen's renaissance\".\n\nView 3 Images Olivia Dean is among the top nominated artists this year (Image: Getty Images)\n\nA third weighed in: \"Genuinely one of the strongest years for British music in a really long time.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"The past few years have relied heavily on one or two acts making waves, whereas this year feels competitive.\n\n\"Predicting big wins for Olivia Dean and Lily Allen. Sam Fender has a lot of momentum behind him after the Mercury Prize win so I wouldn't be shocked if he takes one of the big prizes home either.\"\n\nBeyond the main awards, the late Ozzy Osbourne is set to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award, whilst Noel Gallagher has been crowned Songwriter of the Year. Mark Ronson is also being honoured for Outstanding Contribution to Music.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFurthermore, PinkPantheress becomes the inaugural female recipient of Producer of the Year, and Jacob Alon claims the Critics' Choice award.\n\nThe ceremony will also showcase performances from some stellar artists, including Olivia Dean, alongside Harry Styles, RAYE, Wolf Alice, Sombr and Alex Warren.\n\nThe Brits Awards 2026 will be broadcast live on ITV1 and ITVX in the UK at 8:15PM. In a first, UK fans can also tune in live on YouTube."

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

            "content": "Frank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980. The bout was competitive, but Arguello scored the 11th-round knockout to retain his WBC super featherweight title.\n\nCastillo would lose his next bout, too, dropping a unanimous decision to Mexican legend Salvador Sanchez after leading the first six rounds.\n\nCastillo later lost to Julio Cesar Chavez in 1985 as the iconic boxer scored a sixth-round knockout at the Forum in Los Angeles.\n\nRuben Castillo (L) throws a punch against Julio Cesar Chavez during the fight at the LA Forum\n\nBoxer Ruben 'the Conquistador' Castillo has passed away at 68, according to the World Boxing Council.

'Definitely world championship material in a different era. R.I.P.'\n\nCastillo ultimately served as an announcer alongside legendary play-by-play man, Chick Hearn.\n\n'Ruben and Chick Hearn were gold on Fights From The Fabulous Forum broadcasts,' one fan wrote online. 'Great stuff.'\n\nHe also had a reputation as a positive influence on many young fighters and fans.\n\n'A great man,' his nephew wrote on Facebook. 'Both him and his family were a great part of my childhood. He always gave great advice, would be there when ya needed him. Going to parties at his place, doing golf charity events. He def was the neighborhood Uncle for alot of us.\n\nCastillo later served as an announcer on many WBC fights from the Forum in Los Angeles\n\n'A Family man, Boxer, Charity planner, we lost. Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God. May his wife Cindy, family and friends find comfort with the support of the so many who loved Ruben. Rest in eternal peace.'"

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\n\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

Why? West Ham are unbeaten in four in all competitions and have one of the league’s most in-form players in Crysencio Summerville. They go to Liverpool as underdogs given their opponent’s recent upsurge, but as Burnley showed last month, there is a way to frustrate the Reds and then exploit some of their weaknesses at the back. I fancy West Ham to get a draw at Anfield.\n\n'As for Spurs, I just cannot see them beating any team right now. Fulham have better attacking players and will be buoyed by last week’s win at Sunderland. This might look an easier task for Spurs than some of their recent fixtures, but they are so low on confidence that their slide into the bottom three feels almost inevitable.\n\n'Elsewhere, it feels like Man City and Arsenal will emerge from the weekend as you were, while Manchester United’s good run is almost certain to continue against a Crystal Palace beset with problems on and off the field.'\n\nThink you can do better than Craig this week?\n\nPlay on the web or on our app, whatever you like.

            "content": "Wayne Rooney has revealed that he was once given a neck tie in a Manchester restaurant by Argentine football legend Diego Maradona - after arriving at the hot-spot 'fuming' with Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nThe former Manchester United star was recounting his favourite grounds to play at on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show, and named Real Madrid's Bernabeu as his number one, going on to accompany his choice with a memorable recollection of playing there.\n\n'We got a good result,' Rooney said as he recalled the Red Devils' round-of-16 match against the Spaniards in 2013. 'Danny Welbeck scored a header, I crossed it in for a corner, Welbeck scored and we drew the game 1-1.'\n\nBut despite a strong showing on the road, United's legendary boss Ferguson was unwilling to extend the same role to Rooney in the return fixture.\n\n'He left me on the bench for the return leg. Alex Ferguson pulled me in and told me I was going to be on the bench, which I was fuming with, because I played out of position, I did a job for the team, helped us get a good draw away from home, and we got beat (2-1 on the night).'\n\nMore memorably however was what happened in the aftermath, with Rooney stunning his co-hosts with details about his subsequent trip to Premier League footballer favourite, Chinese restaurant Wing's.\n\nImagine walking into a restaurant in Manchester and Maradona's just standing there 😂 pic.twitter.com/3S7dHk8nxs — BBC Sport (@BBCSport) February 27, 2026\n\nWayne Rooney has recounted the strange circumstances of his 2013 meeting with Diego Maradona at a Manchester restaurant\n\n'It was that evening actually - I went to Wing's restaurant in my tracksuit, and Maradona was in there,' Rooney said.

It was a bit weird, he took his tie off, put it on me, my club tracksuit still on.'\n\nMaradona had been at Old Trafford that evening, but had likely been a regular visitor to the city at the time due to his daughter Giannina being married to Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero.\n\nThe Napoli icon had previously hailed Rooney at the start of his career, sharing 10 years before their meeting that he was a 'special talent that the English should cherish'.\n\n'They don't come along that often, players who can go on and become real world-class stars,' Maradona added prophetically, after watching a 17-year-old Rooney make his international debut at a Euro 2004 qualifier against Macedonia.\n\nRooney in turn idolised the World Cup winner, calling him 'the best' in a poignant tribute to him after his death in 2020.\n\n'Yeah, I've still got it at home,' Rooney said of the tie. 'It was a strange moment, but I was fuming after the game.\n\n'I had gone out fuming, had a few glasses of wine to drown my sorrows. (So) I got something good out of the night at least, I got Maradona's tie.'"

            "content": "Tom Brady is mocked for 'embarrassing' fawning over Gianni Infantino as sycophantic sports stars line up to praise FIFA president after hitting milestone\n\nFootball legends have been mocked for their 'sycophantic' praise of FIFA president Gianni Infantino 10 years on from his election.\n\nThrough their social media channels, FIFA posted fawning tributes to the controversial figurehead from some big names, including Tom Brady.\n\nThe Birmingham City co-owner and NFL icon said: 'I think Gianni is a man of the people and he's always out there celebrating the great parts of the sport. I think he's made great contributions to the world of football.'\n\nBrady's 'man of the people' line riled up a number of supporters, particularly in light of the exorbitant ticket prices at this year's World Cup.\n\nTickets to group games in next year's tournament hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico are three times more expensive than in the previous World Cup.\n\nThe cheapest seats at the final will cost £3,129 and there has been a huge backlash from fans - with Infantino insisting the prices simply reflect 'absolutely crazy' public demand.\n\nFIFA shared a number of tributes to Gianni Infantino, including one from NFL legend, Tom Brady\n\nBrady's praise led to one fan writing: 'That you had to make this montage of sycophancy then publicly post it, says more about Mr Infantino and the world's view of him than you appear to realise.'\n\nAnother posted: 'Tom Brady will literally shill for anyone at this point. Fanatics. Saudi flag football. FIFA. Doesn't matter.\n\n'Now he's calling Gianni Infantino a \"man of the people\" while World Cup tickets cost a mortgage payment and FIFA is wrapped in controversy.'\n\nThat was a sentiment also echoed by the comment: 'His \"man of the people\" Infantino has overseen a ticket price increase so drastic that most Americans won't be able to afford attending a World Cup in their own back yard. Literally would have been cheaper to go to the Euros, flights included.'\n\nOthers labelled the praise 'embarrassing' and a few claimed the FIFA president is worse than his disgraced predecessor, Sepp Blatter.\n\nThe love-in was not just limited to Brady. Francesco Totti was included in the compilation of praise, writing: 'He's an amazing person, a hard worker, someone who always wants to do his best for football. We're talking about a genuine competitive, well-rounded person, someone who is always available, always there for everyone.'\n\nLegendary Spanish defender Carlos Puyol added: 'I think he's doing a great job. He's trying to get football to grow.'\n\nAnd German World Cup winner Lothar Matthäus said: 'You can tell that he's very, very close to football, not only in his head but above all his heart. He's emotionally involved and it's wonderful, of course, that the president of a world association carries this sport in his heart like that.'\n\nInfantino, pictured this week during a trip to Colombia in a personalised hat, has been at the helm for a decade and FIFA's X account posted praise of their leader\n\nInfantino rarely misses an opportunity for self-promotion and the praise of his leadership was posted out to FIFA's 14.9 million followers on X.\n\nIt wasn't just former players gushing over the FIFA president. PSG head honcho Nasser Al-Khelaïfi wrote: 'Our FIFA Club World Cup, that's a huge success for me. Around $2billion in revenue in less than one year, so it was a big success for the clubs and for FIFA.'\n\nInfantino has been a divisive character during his decade in charge. He has been repeatedly criticised for his cozy relationship with US president Donald Trump, especially during the Club World Cup and World Cup draw, during which he awarded him a peace prize.\n\nThis week, Infantino batted down questions around Mexico's ability to co-host the World Cup this summer with cartel violence ripping through the country.\n\nChaos has engulfed Mexico in recent days after the army killed one of the world's most notorious drug lords, Nemesio 'El Mencho' Oseguera Cervantes.\n\nThat sparked a wave of retaliation across the country and forced the country's football federation to postpone a number of games over recent days.\n\nMexico is slated to host 13 games across three cities - Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey - including the curtain raiser in Mexico City on June 11.\n\nFrancesco Totti was another 'FIFA legend' to share a tribute, calling him an 'amazing person'\n\nBut amid fears for fans' safety, Infantino insisted this week that FIFA is 'convinced everything will turn out for the best.'\n\n'I want to say from the outset that we have complete confidence in Mexico, in president [Claudia] Sheinbaum, in the authorities, and we are convinced that everything will turn out for the best.\n\n'From my side and from FIFA's side, I have absolute confidence in Sheinbaum.\n\n\n\n'We are in regular contact with the authorities, and we are, in any case, monitoring the situation. The World Cup is going to be an incredible celebration.'"

'What we couldn't have known then is just how far your joy, combined with your dedication and faith, could take you.\n\n'You have never forgotten your values, faith, or people who have supported you along the way. That means more to us than any goal, trophy, or contract ever could.\n\nBukayo Saka was left unable to speak as he read aloud a letter from his parents after signing a new Arsenal contract\n\n'Remember, success is not measured only in achievements, but in character. Keep smiling Bukayo, enjoy this journey. Keep believing and keep being the example you are to so many young people who look up to you.'\n\nAs he finished reading out the letter on CNN, who had presented it to him, Saka struggled to speak as he was left on the verge of tears.\n\n'Wow,' he managed. 'I don't see my mum and dad speak with me a lot like this.\n\n'I am pretty speechless. It's amazing. I don't know what to say apart from thank you to them. I wouldn't be here without them.\n\n'Their journey is, for me, inspiring. From being in Nigeria to where we are today as a family... the only explanation is God.\n\n'It is not normal. There is a one-in-a-million chance. I am so grateful and this is beautiful'.\n\nHaving won individual plaudits for both Arsenal and England performances, the missing piece in Saka's career to date is silverware.\n\nArteta's Gunners are hunting down a first Premier League title since his promising appointment in 2019, and currently sit four points clear of chasers Manchester City.\n\nThey also remain competitive in all four club competitions this season, with next month's Carabao Cup final against Man City the first opportunity to win a trophy."

            "content": "The release of the latest season of Netflix's Drive to Survive has revealed the poignant moment former Red Bull team principal Christian Horner broke the news of his sacking to his Spice Girl wife Geri Halliwell.\n\nThe long-serving team boss was deposed midway through the 2025 season amid a suspected power struggle at the Thai-Austrian constructor, one year on from his sex texting scandal which set the Formula One world alight.\n\nHorner eventually left the team in July after receiving an £80million package, but while his departure sent shockwaves through the motorsport community, behind-the-scenes insight has revealed that Halliwell had an ominous inkling that her husband's Red Bull days were numbered.\n\nFootage in the docu-series' Red Bull-centric episode showed Horner opening up to his wife at the table in their kitchen's conservatory, with the 52-year-old starting the conversation with a downbeat 'hey darling'.\n\n'All... all done and dusted,' Horner confirmed as he kissed Halliwell on the forehead, before sitting down at the table and accepting a waiting latte.\n\nHalliwell looked visibly emotional as Horner gave her the scant details of his meeting, before asking: 'How do you feel?'\n\nChristian Horner was consoled by his wife Geri Halliwell after his shock Red Bull sacking\n\nThe former Spice Girl looked visibly emotional as her husband recounted how the team swung the axe after 20 years\n\n'How do I feel?' Horner wondered aloud. 'Um... I never imagined to be in this position.\n\n'Of course your immediate reaction when you get delivered a s*** sandwich like that is, like, f*** them. I've had something taken away from me that wasn't my choice, that was very precious to me.\n\n'But you thought it was going to happen. We came back from that Austria race and I remember you sat on the bed one night and went \"Something really bad's gonna happen\".'\n\nHalliwell confirmed that she had said that they were going to 'fire' her husband.\n\nScenes from the episode later showed Halliwell and Horner watching a race on television - a hitherto unusual way of experiencing raceday for the former team principal, who had held his role since 2005.\n\n'You haven't got any of the data here really!' Horner complained. 'Well, normally I would have a whole bunch of noise in my ears. So it's like you're blind.'\n\nHalliwell admitted that she now felt 'a bit sad watching this' as her eyes filled with tears.\n\nHalliwell, 53, was a semi-regular fixture on race weekend alongside her husband, often appearing in the paddock at the start and end of the season as well as at proximate races such as the British Grand Prix.\n\nLater in the episode the couple took the unusual decision to watch a race from their home\n\nThe moment was captured at Horner's luxurious mansion in Oxfordshire by Netflix's cameras\n\nHalliwell and Horner were frequent fixtures in the paddock throughout their relationship\n\nWhen in February 2024, the paddock was stunned by a leaked cache of suggestive messages purporting to be from Horner, Halliwell flew to Bahrain to take her husband's side.\n\nHorner was later accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour by a female member of staff, with an internal investigation led by KCs twice clearing him of wrongdoing. Halliwell supported him throughout.\n\nBack at their Cotswolds home, Halliwell tried to lift the mood by suggesting that Horner might be trying to 'eat his feelings'.\n\nIn improved spirits, the pair later horsed around by their swimming pool, with Horner pretending to be on the brink of throwing Halliwell in, before she admonished him, saying: 'You're such a t**t.'\n\nThe episode also saw Horner explain who he believes is responsible for his sacking, after speculation at the time suggested that star driver Max Verstappen and his father Jos may have played their roles.\n\n'His father has never been my biggest fan,' Horner admitted when asked if it had been the Verstappens who wielded the axe. 'He's been outspoken about me.\n\n'But I don't believe the Verstappens were responsible in any way. I think this was a decision that was made by Oliver Mintzlaff with Helmut (Marko) advising from the sideline.\n\n'Ultimately things changed within the business, the group, the founder died and after Dietrich [Mateschitz's] death I was probably deemed to have too much control.'\n\nIn the months since his sacking, Horner has eyed a return to the sport, sharing last week that he felt he had 'unfinished business in the sport' amid swirling links to rival constructors including Aston Martin.\n\n'But I am not going to come back for just anything,' Horner clarified at the European Motorshow in Dublin. 'I am only going to come back for something that can win.\n\n'I don't want to go back in the paddock unless I have something to do. I miss the sport, I miss the people, I miss the team that I built.'"

Another concert, Billy Joel, was postponed and subsequently cancelled due to the Piano Man’s health concerns.\n\nThere were some unwanted increases in the accounts, notably administrative costs going up by £57m to £657m, mainly due to higher staffing costs.\n\nJenny Beacham, the club’s chief financial officer, said: ‘We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it.\n\n\n\n‘The 2024-25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men’s team winning our 20th league title. The challenge for us is to continue with our growth, through the incredible work that we do in areas such as our partnership portfolio and retail offerings, as well as continuing to diversify our focus to best serve our global fanbase.’"

However, you would struggle to match those wins against a weight-drained opponent with the rewards on offer in a deal that has rocked the sport and caused a rift with his former promoter Eddie Hearn at Matchroom.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAs many do, I feel for Hearn. Boxing is a hard business. You can understand how he feels after supporting Benn during the controversies surrounding his two failed drug tests, and providing the platform and backing for him to relaunch his career.\n\nDenzel Bentley calls for Janibek Alimkhanuly to be stripped of world title READ MORE :\n\nConor Benn announces next fight after splitting from Eddie Hearn READ MORE :\n\nThe money is coming from Saudi Arabia, of course, in the shape of Turki Alalsheikh, the joint owner of Zuffa and chairman of the Saudi government department, the General Entertainment Authority.\n\nZuffa have immediately pitched Benn against Regais Prograis on the Tyson Fury card at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April. The fight is at a catchweight 150 pounds, three pounds above the welterweight limit he is targeting for a world title shot. The division is full of sparkle. Ryan Garcia, who beat Mario Barrios for the WBC crown last week, is Benn’s big target. Devin Haney has re-established himself as another box-office option.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPrograis is not in their class. Josh Taylor beat him up at super lightweight when he was in his prime. At 37, he has not been paired with Benn to win.\n\nView 2 Images Benn's decision to leave Eddie Hearn and Matchroom has sent shockwaves through the industry (Image: Getty Images)\n\nPrograis will stand and fight, and Benn will get him out of there, so it will look good. But the evidence that he can go higher has yet to be established. That said, there is every chance he can win a title but it’s still a hell of a gamble by Zuffa.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBenn is certainly an exciting fighter. He believes in himself absolutely and leaves it all on the pitch. But that does not make him a world champion.\n\nPerhaps that doesn’t matter in an age when Anthony Joshua can make record money fighting Jake Paul. Zuffa will have seen that and are banking on Benn’s capacity to drive eyeballs and thus dollars.\n\nAnd if they can put Benn in a ring with a Garcia or a Haney then there will be few complaints from boxing fans.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n**Follow Barry on X at @‌ClonesCyclone @mcguigan’s_Gym"

            "content": "Kon Knueppel drops in a 3-pointer in the third quarter, setting the record for most 3-pointers made in a season for an NBA rookie. (0:18)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Charlotte's Kon Knueppel reached yet another milestone in a remarkable rookie season for the No. 4 pick out of Duke.\n\nThe Hornets swingman broke Keegan Murray's NBA rookie record for 3-pointers, making his 207th on Thursday night against the Indiana Pacers. Knueppel connected on five 3s in the first half and then broke the record in the third quarter off an assist from Sion James, his former college teammate with the Blue Devils.\n\nHe finished with 28 points in the 133-109 win, with his 8 3s (on 12 attempts) tying his career high and landing just one shy of tying the NBA rookie record. He leads the NBA with 209 3s.\n\n\"It's really just about making the right basketball play,\" Knueppel said after the win. \"My teammates are setting good screens and setting me up in good spots. The coaches as well. I'm just out there looking to make the right play for my team.\"\n\nIt took Murray 80 games in 2022-23 to establish the record -- and Knueppel just 59 to surpass it. He said he did not realize the magnitude of the shot that set the mark.\n\n\"Honestly, I thought I needed seven,\" Knueppel said.\n\nGolden State's Stephen Curry holds the single-season NBA record with 402 3s.\n\nKnueppel is shooting 44.2% from beyond the arc, making him a contender for NBA Rookie of the Year along with his former college teammate and roommate Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 pick of the Dallas Mavericks. He has also helped propel the long-suffering Hornets into playoff contention; Charlotte has not made the playoffs since the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"It's what elevates our whole culture when you have a guy that's that good, but that humble, no ego -- it becomes contagious throughout your whole organization,\" Hornets coach Charles Lee told CGTN Sports Scene after Knueppel eclipsed 200 3s on Tuesday night.\n\nKnueppel has been a perfect fit in second-year coach Lee's offense alongside playmaker LaMelo Ball by finding open spots on the court -- a skill he attributes to playing in his father's men's league against taller competition beginning as an eighth grader growing up in Milwaukee.\n\nKnueppel has thrived as a catch-and-shoot player with 93% of his 3s this season coming off assists entering Thursday night, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nHe has turned heads across the league with his high shooting percentage.\n\nCurry, the NBA's career leader in 3s, made 166 on 380 attempts as a rookie with the Warriors in 80 games in 2009-10. Knueppel has now attempted 473 3s.\n\n\"He can obviously shoot the ball at a high level,\" Curry said after a recent game against the Hornets. \"You can't really leave him open at all as he has such a quick release and shoots with confidence. And his playmaking is very underrated. His game just suits the NBA style, whether it's fast-paced or a slowed-down possession game.\"\n\nKnueppel surpassed Donovan Mitchell, who is third on the list of 3s made by a rookie, in a loss to the Cavaliers on Feb. 20.\n\nMitchell joked that he heard about it after the game from Cavs teammate Tyrese Proctor, who played with Knueppel at Duke.\n\n\"He's talented,\" Mitchell said of Knueppel. \"For him to be a rookie and be able to go out there and make it look effortless. ... We know he can shoot the ball, right? But I think him getting to the midrange and play-develop in the small pick-and-roll that is something I think is really unique about his game is being able to do that and create advantages for himself.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting with him and Coop for rookie of the year.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

His Buckeyes teammate Arvell Reese, the No. 3 player on Kiper's big board, also ran a 4.46 in the 40, tying them for the best times among all players who ran Thursday night.\n\nTo put Styles' vertical jump into context, it was better than Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who at 6-5, 239 pounds, had a 42½-inch vertical jump at the 2007 combine. Styles' jump was also better than current Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori, whose 43-inch jump was the best at the 2025 combine.\n\nStyles' broad jump was also best among all players who took part Thursday, and he was the only player among the defensive linemen and linebackers to top 11 feet.\n\nReese did not do any of the jumps in the workout, but did do position drills.\n\nStyles, who played almost exclusively at middle linebacker for the Buckeyes this past season, said earlier this week that he felt ready to show the league's personnel evaluators what he could do on the field.\n\n\"I think I would say that -- the great defenses you look at, there's at least two or three guys who can play a multitude of roles,'' Styles said. \"Like for example, this year for the Seahawks, Nick Emmanwori was a versatile player, and when you have guys like that on your defense, you're able to do a lot of different things as a coordinator.''"

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nNeymar broke his 2026 goal drought in spectacular fashion Thursday, leading Santos to a 2-1 victory over Vasco da Gama in the fourth round of the Brasileirão.\n\nAfter the match, the former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain star addressed his critics and the mounting pressure regarding a potential return for Brazil at the upcoming men's World Cup.\n\n\"Last week they said I was the worst player in the world. Today I scored two goals, and that's what matters,\" Neymar told SporTV. \"That's football. One day you're no good or you're 'retired'; the next, people say you have to go to the World Cup.\n\n\"I'm dedicating myself and working to get in the best possible shape. This was my third game of the year and only my second full 90 minutes. I felt some cramping at the end, but that's just part of the process.\"\n\nNeymar underwent surgery at the beginning of 2026 and only recently returned to the field for Santos. Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti has said repeatedly that Neymar would be considered for selection for the World Cup if he was fit.\n\nAfter scoring the opening goal in the 25th minute, the Santos No. 10 celebrated by heading to the corner flag to perform the same dance Vinícius Júnior did after scoring in both legs of the Real Madrid's Champions League playoff matchup against Benfica.\n\n\"The little dance [I did] was for Vinicius Jr.,\" Neymar said.\n\n\"I told him, when he scored his first goal in Portugal, they insulted him, were racist towards him and everything else, I told him 'you score a goal and do the same celebration, if I score a goal, I'll do the same'. Vini, it's for you.\"\n\nVasco drew level before halftime, but Neymar scored again in the second half to put the game away for Santos.\n\nThe festive atmosphere for Neymar and Santos fans was briefly interrupted following a heated altercation with Vasco midfielder Thiago Mendes. The friction between Neymar and Mendes dates back to 2020 when a challenge from Mendes resulted in a serious injury for Neymar during a PSG match against Lyon.\n\nNeymar didn't hold back when discussing the confrontation.\n\n\"He always wants to cause trouble and act tough. He already broke me once at PSG, and he threatened me again today. It's always the same with him,\" Neymar said.\n\nThis brace marks Neymar's first goals since December 2025, when he closed out the previous year with a two-goal performance against Juventude."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Division I football rules makers have proposed a one-year trial rule allowing a player disqualified for targeting for the first time to play in his team's next game regardless of which half the penalty was assessed, the NCAA announced Thursday.\n\nCurrently, players disqualified for targeting must sit out the rest of the game and, if the penalty occurs in the second half, sit out the first half of the next game.\n\nUnder the Division I Football Rules Subcommittee's proposal, a player disqualified for targeting a second time during the season would sit out the first half of the next game. A third targeting ejection in the same season would cause the offending player to sit out the entire next game.\n\nTargeting is forcible contact with an opponent's head or neck area in which the offending player often uses the crown of his helmet to make contact or launches his body into the opposing player above the shoulders.\n\nOversight committees for the Bowl Subdivision and Championship Subdivision must approve proposals before they become official. Those committees meet next month.\n\n\"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said A.J. Edds, rules subcommittee chair and vice president of football administration for the Big Ten. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n\nDress code:\n\nThe rules subcommittee proposed that players wear leg coverings from the top of their shoes to the bottom of their pants. Players would have to wear the same covering style and colors for that particular game.\n\nPlayers out of compliance with the rule would have to leave the game for at least one down and correct the issue. A team would receive a warning for the first offense.\n\nIf a team has a second offense under this proposal, the offending team would be given a 5-yard penalty. Any subsequent violations of the rule would result in a 15-yard penalty.\n\n\"The current look of the uniform is clearly not meeting the expectations of the college football community,\" Edds said. \"This will take a collective effort by administrators, coaches and officials to communicate expectations to players and equipment managers. This proposal, we believe, is definitive and gives us a chance for consistent enforcement across Division I football.\"\n\nTexas head coach Steve Sarkisian was amused by the proposal, saying, \"I'm just trying to figure out how we're going to police socks to pants.\"\n\n\"The NFL has that rule and they fine the players when they don't meet their uniform requirements,\" he said. \"Are we hiring uniform police that the NFL does, and they come and they assess every player and they dock them pay and they fine them for when they're suited properly? I would assume instead of worrying about socks to pants, are we going to tuck in our shirts? We've got T-shirts hanging out down to our knees now. There's a lot of things, but for that to come up as being an issue seems kind of odd.\"\n\nFair catch kicks:\n\nUnder a proposal, a team could choose to attempt a fair catch kick after a completed or awarded fair catch. The kick would be a field goal place kick with a holder or a drop kick from the spot where the returner caught the ball. The defense would be at least 10 yards from the spot of the kick.\n\nIf the ensuing kick goes through the uprights, it would be worth three points.\n\nSubcommittee members believe adding the rule would align Division I rules with those in the NFL and high school football. The rarely used play came up in 2024 in the NFL when the Los Angeles Chargers' Cameron Dicker converted from 57 yards against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "content": "Stephen A. Smith says Steelers GM Omar Khan needs to find a quarterback rather than waiting on Aaron Rodgers. (2:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Miami Dolphins ranked first in the NFL Players Association annual report cards, according to survey results obtained by ESPN. The Minnesota Vikings finished second, followed by the Washington Commanders in third.\n\n\"Players consistently describe the organization as 'the best in the NFL,'\" the NFLPA survey wrote about the Dolphins.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished last for the first time in the four-year history of the union's survey. Last year, the Steelers ranked 28th. The Arizona Cardinals finished 31st in the 2026 survey, after a last-place finish in 2025, and the Cleveland Browns finished in 30th, the same as in 2025.\n\nThe NFLPA is not making the report cards public this year after a grievance filed by the NFL, which said the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. Earlier this month, an arbitrator agreed with the league, saying the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses for report cards even if it can't publish them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment.\n\nAn NFL spokesperson also declined to comment, saying that, as in previous years, the league had no knowledge of the survey. The league sent a memo to all teams later Thursday, saying that, as the arbitration hearing showed, the survey results are \"neither reliable nor scientifically valid.\"\n\n\"... We continue to recommend that clubs prioritize feedback and information provided directly by their own players rather than relying on the NFLPA's agenda-driven exercise,\" the league said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by ESPN. \"We further recommend that Clubs refrain from commenting or engaging publicly on the alleged survey and Report Card results.\"\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A-plus to F-minus on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and it was conducted from Nov. 2 to Dec. 11.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" according to the survey.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest-rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" according to the survey. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers' locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers' training room lacks updated recovery technology and \"modalities.\" Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, though the training staff ranked first.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium, \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A-plus to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the survey. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be, according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives, and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

Of those, 12 places are reserved for UEFA qualifying group winners, with the other four coming via the play-offs.\n\nThe 12 group runners-up will be joined by four teams who finished outside the top two of their respective qualifying groups, who were the 'best performers' in the 2024/25 Nations League.\n\nImage: Troy Parrott's stunning hat-trick against Hungary saw the Republic of Ireland secure a shock play-off spot\n\nHere are the final standings from each of the 12 groups:\n\nGroup A: Germany qualified, Slovakia and Northern Ireland into play-offs\n\nGermany qualified, and into play-offs Group B: Switzerland qualified, Kosovo and Sweden into play-offs\n\nSwitzerland qualified, and into play-offs Group C: Scotland qualified, Denmark into play-offs\n\nScotland qualified, into play-offs Group D: France qualified, Ukraine into play-offs\n\nFrance qualified, into play-offs Group E: Spain qualified, Turkey into play-offs\n\nSpain qualified, into play-offs Group F: Portugal qualified, Republic of Ireland into play-offs\n\nPortugal qualified, into play-offs Group G: Netherlands qualified, Poland into play-offs\n\nNetherlands qualified, into play-offs Group H: Austria qualified, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Romania into play-offs\n\nAustria qualified, and into play-offs Group I: Norway qualified, Italy into play-offs\n\nNorway qualified, into play-offs Group J: Belgium qualified, Wales and North Macedonia into play-offs\n\nBelgium qualified, and into play-offs Group K: England qualified, Albania into play-offs\n\nEngland qualified, into play-offs Group L: Croatia qualified, Czech Republic into play-offs\n\nCould every home nation be at the World Cup?\n\nNo!

More often than not, this means the four additional play-off spots are filled by four of the 14 Nations League group winners.\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:"

            "content": "President John Dramani Mahama\n\nPresident John Dramani Mahama has confirmed that the Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) has resumed operations, marking a significant milestone for Ghana’s energy sector.\n\nSpeaking during the 2026 State of the Nation Address in Parliament on Friday, 27 February, President Mahama said the refinery is processing crude oil into petroleum products again following extensive turnaround maintenance.\n\n“I’m pleased to inform this August House that for the first time since 2018, the refinery has commenced processing of crude oil into petroleum products once more,” he told Members of Parliament.\n\nThe President reassured Ghanaians that energy sector reforms remain a priority for his administration and emphasised his commitment to strengthening the sector to deliver reliable, affordable and sustainable energy for the nation.\n\nBackground: TOR’s Return to Operations\n\nThe Tema Oil Refinery had been inactive for several years, with major shutdowns due to maintenance challenges and financial constraints that left it unable to refine crude domestically. However, the refinery successfully resumed crude oil refining in December 2025 after extensive turnaround maintenance on its Crude Distillation Unit (CDU), conducted between August and October 2025 to meet international engineering and safety standards.\n\nFollowing completion of the maintenance work, the National Petroleum Authority (NPA) undertook regulatory inspections and granted clearance for operations to restart on 19 December 2025, allowing refined products to flow into storage for the first time in years.\n\nThe resumption of refining has been welcomed by industry stakeholders and civil society. Groups such as the Institute for Energy Security (IES) and the Legal Green Association (LGA) have praised the return of TOR as a boost to Ghana’s energy security and economic resilience.\n\nManagement says the refinery will operate under a phased approach to stabilise systems and optimise performance, with upgrades — including the installation of a new furnace — expected to progressively restore capacity and strengthen reliability.\n\nThe revival of TOR is widely seen as a strategic step in reducing Ghana’s dependence on imported petroleum products and enhancing the resilience of the downstream petroleum sector.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "President John Dramani Mahama\n\nPresident John Dramani Mahama has declared that the Resetting Ghana Agenda is already delivering results, with the economy stabilising and the country reopening for business.\n\nSpeaking during the 2026 State of the Nation Address in Parliament on Friday, 27 February, President Mahama reflected on the challenges his government inherited.\n\n“When I last came before this House, I spoke candidly about the debt of challenges across all facets of our nation. Mr Speaker, nowhere was this national malaise more evident than in the economic sector,” he said.\n\nInheriting an Economy in Crisis\n\nDescribing the state of the economy at the start of his term, he said:\n\n“We inherited an economy in severe crisis, burdened by unsustainable debts, high inflation, a rapidly depreciating currency, and an escalating cost-of-living crisis that had left our citizens reeling from unimaginable hardship caused by years of general imprudence and reckless economic management.”\n\nAcknowledging the difficulty of recovery, he added:\n\n“I was clear from the outset that recovery would not come easily, but I would stop at nothing to turn this situation around and bring relief to Ghanaians. I promised that, just as we have confronted and overcome crises in the past, I would reset our economy and return us to a path of growth, progress and development.”\n\nTough Decisions for Stability\n\nThe President stressed the need for prudent and decisive action: “Mr Speaker, I told this August House last year that we would have to take tough, prudent, and necessary decisions to restore stability and credibility. Today, I can say with confidence: Ghana is back, it’s working again, and Ghana is open for business. The fundamentals are improving, and the path to sustained acceleration is very clear to everyone.”\n\nHe outlined the government’s approach to fiscal discipline: “From the outset, we resolved to choose discipline over waste, reform over excuses, and stability over speculation. As a responsible government, our first order of business was to halt the economic haemorrhage and restore order to public finances. We tightened expenditure and commitment controls, improved payables reporting, and conducted a comprehensive audit of 2024 commitments to restore credibility and discipline.”\n\nResults and Forward Outlook\n\nPresident Mahama said these measures are already producing results: “Mr Speaker, these measures have begun to deliver some of the most remarkable economic outcomes in decades. As we approach the celebration of our 69th Independence Anniversary, we do so not only with pride in our past but also with renewed hope for our future.”\n\nHe emphasised the broader impact of the Resetting Ghana Agenda: “We are building prosperity through sound policy, responsible governance, and inclusive growth. We are restoring hope by delivering on our promises and proving that good leadership makes a measurable difference in our people’s lives. The Resetting Ghana Agenda is working, the Accra Reset is gaining momentum, and together they are laying the foundation for a stronger, more resilient, and more prosperous Ghana.”\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "In Ghana, whenever a public institution announces overseas travel, two things immediately happen. First, passports begin to sweat with anticipation. Second, citizens begin to calculate.\n\n\n\nThe Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority has reportedly secured approval for selected staff to travel to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany to assist Ghanaians abroad with driver licence registration and renewal. On paper, it sounds like administrative modernisation with a boarding pass. Diaspora service. Global presence. Efficiency at cruising altitude.\n\n\n\nBut in Ghana, the drumbeat of travel always invites a dance of questions.\n\n\n\nNow, let us ask with precision rather than passion. Yes, foreign licences can be used in many of these countries — but typically for a limited period. After that, conversion to a local licence becomes mandatory. Which means the benefit is real, but bounded. It serves short-term visitors and transitional residents, not permanent drivers navigating foreign highways indefinitely.\n\n\n\nAnd that nuance matters. Because if the utility is temporary, then the scale of impact must be measured carefully. Otherwise, symbolism may grow larger than substance — and in Ghana, symbolism travels faster than policy explanation.\n\n\n\nNobody disputes the importance of the diaspora. Remittances have built houses, paid school fees, and kept family WhatsApp groups active. But governance, like fufu, is about timing. You do not serve soup before pounding the cassava properly.\n\n\n\nHere at home, the Ghanaian experience with licensing has improved over the years, yes — but has it achieved such flawless serenity that we can now confidently export personnel? Are all district offices humming like well-tuned engines? Are biometric systems so seamless that customer frustration has retired permanently?\n\n\n\nBecause while domestic licensing systems occasionally cough like an old trotro on a cold morning, DVLA officers may soon be queuing at departure gates to Frankfurt.\n\n\n\nOne must admire ambition. But ambition without sequence can resemble a student applying for international exchange before passing the mock exams.\n\n\n\nThen comes the delicate question — the one whispered in chop bars and typed carefully in group chats: what will be the criteria for selecting staff for this noble overseas assignment? Will it be merit? Performance metrics? Technical expertise? Language proficiency? Transparent internal competition? Or will it be that mysterious Ghanaian qualification known as “familiarity with the corridor”?\n\n\n\nLet us not pretend history has not taught citizens to ask such questions. In our republic, whenever a suitcase appears in a public office, suspicion buys a ticket too.\n\n\n\nTo be fair, this initiative could genuinely ease inconvenience for some Ghanaians abroad. If structured properly, it may strengthen ties and reduce unnecessary travel home. But if communicated poorly, it risks becoming a masterclass in optics without order.\n\n\n\nPublic institutions thrive not only on action but on clarity. If domestic service consistency is still evolving, citizens may reasonably wonder whether we are exporting service before perfecting service.\n\n\n\nAnd what of the economics? Who funds the airfare? Who pays accommodation? Will the fees collected abroad exceed the cost of deployment? Will domestic staffing suffer while officers travel?\n\n\n\nThese are not hostile questions. They are healthy ones.\n\n\n\nModernisation in 2026 is digital before it is aeronautical. Remote biometric systems, embassy-linked processing, secure digital renewals — these are the engines of reform. Flights are visible; infrastructure is transformative.\n\n\n\nThe deeper issue is trust. Ghanaians are not allergic to innovation. They are allergic to ambiguity. If the initiative is strategically sound, then publish the framework. Publish the selection criteria. Publish the cost-benefit projections. Publish the domestic performance benchmarks.\n\n\n\nSunlight is cheaper than damage control.\n\n\n\nBecause when citizens do not see the arithmetic, they invent it. And invented arithmetic rarely flatters the institution involved.\n\n\n\nThis is not an argument against diaspora service. It is an argument for sequencing. Reform must pass inspection before it clears immigration.\n\n\n\nIf domestic systems are stable, say so proudly. If digitisation is complete, demonstrate it boldly. If the programme is revenue-positive, publish the numbers confidently. And if staff selection is purely merit-based, let the process be visible enough that even the most suspicious uncle in the family WhatsApp group nods in reluctant approval.\n\n\n\nIn the Republic of Uncommon Sense, ambition is welcome. But ambition should first sweep the compound before booking the flight.\n\n\n\nUntil then, citizens will continue to ask — politely, hilariously, and persistently — whether this is service delivery… or service departure.\n\n\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

These developments, he said, are gradually strengthening purchasing power and supporting Ghana’s economic recovery.\n\nPresident Mahama reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to sustaining the reforms, stressing that the focus remains on protecting livelihoods, promoting inclusive growth, and ensuring long-term economic resilience.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

All sectors of the Ghanaian economy have witnessed remarkable improvement in our first year in office,” he said.\n\nHe attributed the progress to tighter fiscal management, productivity-enhancing reforms, and measures to restore credibility in economic governance.\n\nHistoric Milestones\n\nHighlighting a landmark achievement, the President announced that Ghana’s economy had surpassed the $100 billion mark for the first time in its history.\n\n“And most importantly, Ghana’s economy has surpassed the 100 billion mark,” he stated.\n\nProjecting future growth, President Mahama suggested that, on current trends, Ghana could soon rank among Africa’s top ten largest economies, signalling renewed confidence in the country’s economic trajectory.\n\nThis first-year performance underscores the government’s focus on stabilising the cedi, strengthening fiscal discipline, and positioning Ghana for sustained growth.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Dr Emmanuel Odame\n\nThe recurring phenomenon popularly described as “No Bed Syndrome” continues to expose fundamental weaknesses in Ghana’s hospital system. It refers to the inability of a patient to obtain prompt hospital admission or emergency care because health facilities report no capacity. While the problem has existed for many years as a structural health-system challenge—driven by shortages of beds, overcrowding, referral inefficiencies, and weak emergency coordination—the term gained national prominence around 2017–2018 following tragic reports of patients dying after being referred from hospital to hospital.\n\nSince then, periodic incidents have reignited public concern, reinforcing the reality that access to emergency care remains uneven and, at times, unpredictable. Recent discussions among clinicians and emergency service personnel have again highlighted persistent gaps in referral coordination, ambulance readiness, and facility capacity.\n\nPublic attention was recently renewed following the death of 29-year-old engineer Charles Amissah, who reportedly died after being referred across facilities in Accra without receiving timely care. The case has triggered widespread outrage and renewed calls for decisive reforms in emergency healthcare delivery.\n\nNational leadership has responded with urgency. The Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, has called for investigations and fresh legislation to confront what he described as needless and unacceptable deaths. The Speaker also expressed support for proposals by Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga urging Parliament to take leadership in resolving the crisis. Parliamentary deliberations have emphasized accountability and the need to prioritize the passage of an emergency care law that guarantees access to life-saving services.\n\nProfessional bodies including the Ghana Medical Association and the Ghana National Ambulance Service have also identified systemic challenges—particularly poor coordination across facilities, ageing ambulance fleets, and limited funding—as contributors to the recurring problem.\n\nEmerging policy responses\n\nSeveral policy responses are currently being advocated:\n\nPassage of comprehensive emergency care legislation\n\nDevelopment of a national monitoring system for bed occupancy and patient flow\n\nContinued infrastructure expansion\n\nStrengthening of referral coordination mechanisms\n\nIncreased financing, workforce development, and regulatory oversight\n\nCollectively, these efforts aim to reduce refusal of emergency patients and improve timely access to care. Yet, the persistence of No Bed Syndrome suggests that incremental reforms alone may not be sufficient.\n\nA deeper structural issue: patient flow, not just bed numbers\n\nA central feature of Ghana’s hospital system is the strong upward referral pattern, where patients frequently move toward higher-level facilities such as teaching and regional hospitals. While clinically appropriate in many cases, this pattern contributes to congestion at tertiary centres while lower-level facilities remain underutilized.\n\nThis raises an important question: should the system also institutionalize downward referral as a deliberate strategy for bed management?\n\nConsider a typical scenario. A patient undergoing major surgery at a teaching hospital may require prolonged inpatient recovery. However, after stabilization, much of this care could potentially be delivered at a district or faith-based facility closer to home, with continued specialist oversight from the tertiary centre through teleconsultation and structured follow-up protocols. Such a model would free beds at referral hospitals while preserving continuity and quality of care.\n\nHospital-at-Home: a redesign opportunity\n\nBeyond downward referral, innovative service delivery models deserve serious consideration. Hospital-at-Home (HaH) programmes have emerged globally as alternatives to traditional inpatient hospitalization, delivering acute care at home through multidisciplinary teams. Evidence from North America, Europe, Australia, and increasingly Asia indicates that Hospital at Hom can reduce costs while maintaining comparable clinical outcomes and high patient satisfaction.\n\nIndeed, hospital bed pressures are not unique to Ghana. Countries across Asia—including Singapore, Malaysia, China, and Japan—have introduced Hospital at Home programmes to address inflow-outflow imbalances in hospitals. A recent quasi-experimental study in Singapore (Ko et al. 2026) reported significantly lower costs per episode and per bed day for Hospital at Home care compared with ward-based care, without differences in mortality.\n\nFor Ghana, the relevance is clear. With rapid population growth and infrastructure expansion struggling to keep pace, system redesign approaches such as Hospital at Home could complement traditional capacity investments.\n\nBeyond reform: embracing health system design\n\nThe legislative initiatives, infrastructure investments, and governance reforms currently under discussion are necessary and commendable. However, the persistence of No Bed Syndrome suggests the need to move beyond reform toward intentional system design.\n\nThe 21st century health system must be built around patient flow optimization, distributed care delivery, digital coordination, and flexible models of hospitalization. Downward referral pathways, remote specialist oversight, and Hospital-at-Home programmes represent not temporary fixes but strategic design responses to structural constraints.\n\nNo Bed Syndrome is ultimately a symptom—not merely of inadequate beds—but of how care is organized, coordinated, and delivered across levels of the system. As Ghana confronts this recurring challenge, the opportunity exists to transform a crisis narrative into a redesign agenda.\n\nThe question is no longer whether reform is needed. It is whether we are prepared to redesign care delivery itself to ensure that no patient is denied timely care because of where a bed happens to be.\n\nDr Emmanuel Odame, Public Health Expert Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital/University Of Ghana Medical School\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Cocoa is a key export commodity for Ghana and Ivory Coast\n\nAtlas Commodities Limited has rejected claims by the Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, that the company operates without its own warehouses, describing the allegation as false and misleading.\n\nIn a press statement dated February 24, 2026, the company said it maintains operational depots in major cocoa-growing areas across the country.\n\n\n\n“Vincent Assafuah’s assertion that Atlas Commodities Ltd. has no warehouses is not true. Atlas has warehouses at cocoa-growing areas in the Ashanti, Eastern, Western, and Central regions,” the statement said.\n\n\n\nThe clarification follows comments made by Assafuah at a press conference on 23 February, where he suggested that Atlas may be operating from facilities belonging to the state-owned Produce Buying Company (PBC), in breach of regulations.\n\n\n\nThe MP also raised concerns over possible conflicts of interest involving Atlas and officials of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), arguing that some private firms may be benefiting from access to state infrastructure.\n\n\n\nHe cited the Regulations and Guidelines for the Internal Marketing of Cocoa, 2015, which require Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs) to operate only in warehouses registered in their own names.\n\n“Warehouses registered under PBC must not be used by another company for storage, grading, sealing, or processing of cocoa,” he stated.\n\n\n\nAtlas, however, maintained that it has operated rented and registered depots in multiple districts since commencing operations in 2018. Its facilities span several communities in the Ashanti, Eastern, Central, and Western South regions, including Effiduase, Kade, Nyakrom, Tarkwa, and Bogoso.\n\n\n\nThe company added that these arrangements are supported by tenancy agreements and are verifiable through records held by the Quality Control Company and COCOBOD.\n\n\n\nAtlas also holds sustainability certifications under the Rainforest Alliance programme, which it said reflects compliance with industry standards.\n\n\n\nThe company acknowledged that it temporarily used a PBC depot in Hohoe in December 2025 but described the move as an isolated, district-level arrangement.\n\nThe facility was made available by the local PBC District Manager while Atlas was setting up operations in the Volta Region to prevent cocoa from being smuggled out of the country.\n\n\n\n“Access to the PBC facilities was granted at the district level within the context of established operational relationships,” the statement noted, adding that borrowed jute sacks had since been replaced.\n\n\n\nWhile Atlas insists it operates independently and in accordance with regulatory requirements, Assafuah maintains that questions remain regarding access to infrastructure and compliance with cocoa marketing rules."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "Latest Epstein files released in January reveal the extent of his relations with some prominent African leaders.\n\nThe latest tranche of documents released by the United States Department of Justice on the convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein has caused an uproar and a slew of resignations by senior officials and businesspeople across the US and Europe.\n\nIn Africa, the more than three million emails, photos, and videos released on January 23 are also causing some aftershocks as they reveal the extent of Epstein’s connections with prominent African figures, though appearing in the Epstein files does not automatically indicate a crime or wrongdoing.\n\nAccording to the documents, Epstein had ties with former South African President Jacob Zuma; Karim Wade, a politician and son of Senegal’s ex-president Abdoulaye Wade; and deceased Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.\n\nThe new files also shed more light on Epstein’s connections to a relative of Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, who appeared to connect the two men. This connection reportedly opened the door for a friend of Epstein’s, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, to propose a mass surveillance system to Ouattara that would work in the West African country. It is unclear if such a system is in place now.\n\nEpstein’s possible fixing role culminated in a formal 2014 security deal between the two countries, although the details of it are scant.\n\nThe revelations, in general, underscore the range of Epstein’s influence on powerful figures across continents.\n\nEpstein, who was first convicted in 2008 on charges of sex trafficking, was found dead by suicide in his prison cell in 2019 while awaiting a trial on sex trafficking charges. His ex-girlfriend and co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted and sentenced in 2021.\n\n\n\nHere’s what we know about the Ivory Coast deal and his ties to Africa’s political elite:\n\nIsrael and Ivory Coast: The context\n\nDiscussions between Ouattara and Barak appeared to start in mid-2012, after the Ivorian president travelled to Jerusalem for talks with Israeli leaders, presumably in hopes of striking a security agreement. Ouattara met Barak, who was then the Israeli defence minister, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nFive days before the trip, on June 12, 2012, exiled military officials linked to the Ivory Coast’s former president had attempted to overthrow Ouattara’s government.\n\nOuattara’s predecessor, Laurent Gbagbo, had refused to hand over power to Ouattara, and a civil war that killed at least 3,000 people ensued. The fighting had only ended about a year before when UN and French forces intervened and arrested Gbagbo.\n\nOuattara’s son, Dramane, and niece, Nina Keita, also met Epstein in New York on the same day, according to the Epstein files. It’s unclear what the parties discussed.\n\nKeita, a former model, was friends with Epstein and travelled regularly on his private jet, according to the documents. She appeared to have connected Epstein with her uncle, as well as other highly placed Ivorian politicians, according to the documents.\n\nThe files showed that on September 12, three months after Epstein met Ouattara’s son, he again met Keita in New York.\n\nHe met Barak immediately after in a private meeting at the Regency Hotel in New York, according to a schedule published in the files. It’s not known what was discussed.\n\nIn November, Drop Site News reported that Epstein referred to a trip to the Ivory Coast, Angola and Senegal in a note to his assistant, but that there are no flight records to confirm the travels.\n\nWhat did Israel propose to Ouattara?\n\nA month after Ouattara’s travel to Jerusalem, an Israeli delegation visited Abidjan.\n\nAt the meetings, Ouattara reportedly asked about Israeli defence systems to overhaul security in his country, according to reporting by Calcalist, an Israeli publication that covered the exchanges at the time.\n\nIn late 2012, Ivorian Interior Minister Hamed Bakayoko travelled to Tel Aviv for a meeting with Barak, where they discussed a cybersecurity deal, Drop Site News found.\n\nThen, in spring 2013, Barak, who had now left office as defence minister, travelled to Abidjan himself to converse with Ouattara in what would be their second meeting.\n\n\n\nBarak presented an expensive security defence plan to the president, Calcalist reported. The $150m proposal encompassed border security, army training, and strategic military consulting, the publication said.\n\nDrop Site News, in an investigation in November, added that the proposal included a mobile and internet surveillance centre, as well as a video monitoring centre.\n\nThe publication cited two sets of documents: an archive of leaked emails released by the Handala hacking group and hosted by nonprofit whistleblower site, Distributed Denial of Secrets, as well as earlier Epstein-linked documents released by the US House Oversight Committee in October 2025.\n\nBarak’s surveillance centre was to be developed by the French-Israeli private security company, MF-Group, which specialises in surveillance systems, and was to be located in Abidjan, Drop Site News reported.\n\nEmail logs showed Epstein introduced Barak to Ouattara’s chief of staff later in September 2013, and planned a meeting in New York where the two men met.\n\nAlthough Ouattara was pleased with the plan, he ultimately did not sign the deal because of the price tag, Calcalist reported.\n\nBarak, in a response to Calcalist at the time, denied that he offered to build the Ivory Coast an intelligence apparatus. “The claims about establishing an intelligence apparatus and price offers are incorrect. These are private conversations, and the public has no interest in them,” he was quoted as saying.\n\nWhat was the final agreement?\n\nAlthough the plan appeared to be rejected, both countries continued to forge friendly ties.\n\nIn June 2014, then-Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman was welcomed in Abidjan on a state visit.\n\nLiberman had travelled to the country along with 50 Israeli businesspeople who were interested in investing in the Ivory Coast.\n\nIn a news release at the time, the Ivorian government said two agreements were signed: “One concerning regular consultations between the two countries and the other on defence and internal security.”\n\nNo details were provided. It is not known if Abidjan is using Israeli surveillance security systems.\n\nNevertheless, the Israeli-Ivorian security relationship has continued, with the latter buying military vessels, aircraft, and armoured tanks from Israeli weapons companies.\n\nIn 2016, a United Nations report found that Israeli firm Troya Tech Defence had sold weapons and night vision goggles to Ivory Coast in 2015, violating a UN arms embargo that was in place at the time.\n\nIn 2018, an investigation into Israeli spyware Pegasus, developed by the NSO Group, revealed that the malware had targeted journalists’ phones in the Ivory Coast. Pegasus, believed to be used by governments, was found to be operating in 45 countries.\n\nIn March 2023, privately owned Israel Shipyards, which builds naval vessels, delivered two offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) to Abidjan.\n\n\n\nCritics of President Ouattara say the Ivory Coast has slid further from democracy under his rule and point to incidents like the Pegasus scandal, among other issues.\n\nDid Epstein and Barak strategise about other African countries?\n\nBarak also tried to leverage the Boko Haram crisis in Nigeria for a security deal, according to Drop Site News, citing the new documents.\n\nEpstein was aware of Barak’s business deals and advised him on doing business in Nigeria between 2013 and 2020, according to email exchanges.\n\nBoth saw the escalating violence in the West African nation not as a humanitarian crisis, but as a business opportunity, the publication found.\n\nIn June 2013, Barak attended a cybersecurity conference in Abuja, which organisers said privately was a pretext to meet Nigeria’s then-President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nIt came after Nigeria awarded Israeli firm, Elbit Systems, a controversial contract to surveil digital communications in the country. Public outrage caused Jonathan to consider cancelling the project, but the government never announced that it was withdrawn.\n\nBarak continued leveraging his access in Nigeria to promote Israeli products and services. In 2015, he facilitated the sale of Israeli biometric surveillance equipment to a private Christian university in Nigeria, Drop Site News found. The university, in a statement, denied the sale.\n\nIn 2020, the World Bank selected Barak’s intelligence firm, Toka, and the Israeli National Cyber Directorate to advise Nigeria on designing its national cyber-infrastructure.\n\nEpstein, meanwhile, also facilitated high-level access for Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, ex-chairman of the Emirati firm DP World. In 2018, Epstein connected bin Sulayem with Jide Zeitlin, then-chair of Nigeria’s sovereign investment fund, for discussions on securing port ownerships in Lagos and Badagry.\n\nBin Sulayem, last March, visited Nigeria and proposed that DP World establish industrial parks at Nigerian ports. The proposal has not been approved.\n\nJacob Zuma\n\nThe new files revealed that Epstein had some relations with former South African President Jacob Zuma, who led the country from 2009 until 2018.\n\nEpstein appeared to arrange a “small dinner” on behalf of Zuma in March 2010 at the Ritz Hotel in London.\n\nIt’s unclear what the purpose of the dinner was, but emails released as part of the Epstein files seemed to show that a Russian model was invited. The model was told her presence would “add some real glamour to the occasion”, according to emails sent by Epstein’s planner, whose name was redacted in the files.\n\nIn a different email, Epstein appeared to share that information with British politician Peter Mandelson, who is now under investigation for his links to Epstein. A host, whose name was redacted “is having dinner for zuma tomorrow night at the ritz„ i have invited a beautiful russina named (redacted) to attend,” he wrote.\n\nIt’s unclear if Mandelson responded.\n\nAfter the dinner appeared to have taken place, one email sender whose name was redacted wrote to Epstein: “(Redacted name) was a delight last night and enchanted all those she met…By the way, Jacob Zuma was much more impressive and engaging than I thought he would be!”\n\nKarim Wade\n\nPolitician and son of Senegal’s ex-President Abdoulaye Wade, Karim Wade’s name appeared 504 times in the released files.\n\n\n\nWade, under his father, was a minister with an open-ended portfolio, and was so powerful that he was nicknamed “minister of heaven and earth”.\n\nHis relationship with Epstein began in 2010, according to an investigation by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which cited the newly released files.\n\nIn an email to an unnamed contact in November of that year, Epstein wrote: “the President of Senegal is sending his son to see me in paris,” the publication noted. Over the years, they planned trips in Africa along with Emirati businessman, bin Sulayem. They also discussed business ideas, the files showed.\n\nIn 2015, after Wade was convicted on corruption charges by a new administration, records show Epstein approaching Norwegian leader of the Council of Europe, Thorborn Jagland, to ask about possibly filing an appeal at the European Court of Human Rights. Wade’s lawyers regularly updated Epstein on efforts to free him, according to OCCRP.\n\nSenegal pardoned Wade in 2016, after which he went into exile in Qatar. Keita, niece to Ivory Coast’s President Ouattara, who appeared to play some role in the efforts to free Wade, texted Epstein: “Thank you for everything you have done for him!!!!”\n\nRobert Mugabe\n\nThe Epstein documents revealed that the sex trafficker planned to meet then-President Mugabe to propose a new currency for Zimbabwe amid that country’s hyperinflation crisis.\n\nIn email exchanges back in 2015, Japanese financier Joi Ito recommended to Epstein that they both approach Mugabe to discuss the currency after the Zimbabwean dollar lost its value. It’s unclear if the meeting ever took place.\n\nReleased along with the emails were FBI documents from 2017, which appeared to show unverified testimony from a “confidential source” who said Epstein was a wealth manager for Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as Mugabe."

            "content": "A United Nations investigative body has warned that South Sudan risks “a return to full-scale war” unless it can urgently put an end to entrenched impunity and widespread abuses amid escalating violence in the world’s youngest country.\n\nThe report by the UN’s Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan (CHRSS), released on Friday at the Human Rights Council session in Geneva, found that civilians were enduring severe abuses including killings and “systematic” sexual violence, arbitrary detention, forced displacement and deprivation amid a deepening humanitarian crisis in one of the world’s most impoverished countries.\n\nIt said “escalating atrocity risks” and the collapse of political safeguards in the country made “urgent preventive action imperative”, calling on regional and international actors to engage with diplomatic pressure, sanctions and enforcing the UN arms embargo until concrete improvements in human rights and accountability are achieved.\n\n“Preventing further mass atrocity crimes, institutional collapse, and the destruction of South Sudan’s fragile transition requires urgent coordinated national, regional and international re-engagement,” the report said.\n\nThe report, drawing on a year of investigations and testimony, blamed the actions of political and military elites – in detaining opposition leaders, eroding power sharing and attempting to change the terms of a 2018 peace agreement – for placing a peace framework in the country under major strain and increasing instability.\n\n\n\nIt noted that the arrest and removal from office of First Vice President Riek Machar last year, and his prosecution for murder, treason and crimes against humanity, had undermined “the core power-sharing guarantees” of the peace agreement, and triggered “political uncertainty and armed clashes on a scale not witnessed” for a decade.\n\nMachar, an ethnic Nuer, was suspended last year as South Sudan’s number two after opposition Nuer White Army fighters overran a military garrison in the town of Nasir.\n\nCivil war broke out in South Sudan in 2013, two years after gaining independence from Sudan, when President Salva Kiir, a member of the Dinka ethnic group, the country’s largest, first dismissed Machar as vice president, accusing him of plotting a coup.\n\nThe report also noted that intensifying military operations had been marked by a “dangerous shift in tactics”, including air strikes on civilian-populated areas.\n\nIt said that the deployment of forces from neighbouring Uganda, a guarantor of the 2018 peace agreement, had “materially strengthened” government forces militarily and “raised credible concerns” of violations of a UN arms embargo.\n\nThe CHRSS report noted that joint aerial bombardments by the Ugandan and South Sudan armies had targeted civilian areas, “predominantly affecting [ethnic] Nuer communities in opposition-affiliated areas”.\n\nSexual violence ‘widespread, systematic’\n\nConflict-related sexual violence remained a “defining and persistent feature” of the crisis, the report found, with survivor testimonies over the past decade showing “widespread and systematic patterns of rape and other forms of sexual violence perpetrated by all armed forces and groups”.\n\nMost women and girls lived “at constant risk of sexual violence,” it said, adding that last year, the threat of such abuse had again “functioned as a strategic instrument of conflict deployed to terrorise civilian populations, drive displacement, and fracture social cohesion”.\n\nThe report said that impunity was entrenched, with senior commanders and political actors rarely held accountable for serious abuses perpetrated on their behalf.\n\nThe report also noted a sharp deterioration in civic space, with journalists, activists and opposition figures facing harassment, surveillance and arbitrary detention, undermining prospects for inclusive political participation and long-term stability.\n\nThe commission urged the government to immediately halt violations by its forces, release those arbitrarily detained and guarantee freedoms of expression, assembly and association.\n\n\n\nIt also called for the urgent establishment of long-delayed transitional justice mechanisms to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed since 2013.\n\nRenewed conflict\n\nAn estimated 400,000 people were killed in the five years of a war waged largely along ethnic lines, before calm was restored with a peace deal in 2018.\n\nBut escalating fighting in recent months has brought renewed fears of a return to civil war.\n\nBeginning in December, a coalition of opposition forces – some loyal to Machar, leader of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM/IO) – seized a string of government outposts in Jonglei state, an opposition stronghold northeast of the capital, Juba that is the homeland of the Nuer ethnic group.\n\nFollowing the territorial losses, South Sudan’s army announced a major military operation against opposition forces in late January, ordering civilians and aid groups to leave areas of Jonglei state, a move that the International Crisis Group said showed the country had “returned to war”.\n\nMillions affected\n\nThe United Nations said earlier this month that an estimated 280,000 people have been displaced by the fighting and air attacks since late December, including more than 235,000 across Jonglei alone, while UNICEF warned last week that more than 450,000 children are at risk of acute malnutrition due to mass displacement and the halting of critical medical services in Jonglei.\n\nNearly 10 million people need life-saving humanitarian assistance across South Sudan, while humanitarian operations have been crippled by attacks and looting, with observers saying both sides in the conflict have prevented assistance from reaching areas where they believe civilians support their opponents.\n\nThe CHRSS report said that civilians had borne the “overwhelming human brunt” of the crisis as conflict, violence, displacement and sexual violence had intensified “an already-dire humanitarian situation”.\n\nLast year, it said, displacement had risen by nearly 40 percent to 3.2 million people, while declining international assistance was disproportionately affecting women and children."

            "content": "Win would provisionally take Barcelona four points ahead of Real Madrid, who host Getafe on Monday night.\n\nWho: Barcelona vs Villarreal\n\nWhat: La Liga\n\nWhere: Camp Nou, Barcelona, Spain\n\nWhen: Saturday, February 28 at 4:15pm (15:15 GMT)\n\nHow to follow: We’ll have all the build-up on Al Jazeera Sport from 12:30 GMT in advance of our live text commentary stream.\n\nBarca welcome high-flying Villarreal to Camp Nou, with the hosts looking to tighten their grip on pole position in La Liga.\n\nA win would provisionally take Barcelona four points ahead of second-placed Real Madrid, who host mid-table Getafe on Monday night.\n\nBarcelona had a mini-wobble earlier this month as they were thrashed 4-0 by Atletico Madrid in the first-leg of their Copa del Rey semifinal before losing 2-1 to Girona, allowing Madrid to briefly occupy top spot.\n\nHowever, Barca bounced back with a 3-0 win over Levante last weekend to steady the ship, while Madrid slipped to a surprise defeat at Osasuna.\n\nThird-placed Villarreal trail Barcelona by 10 points, and their hopes of competing for the title could be rekindled with a surprise victory at Camp Nou.\n\nThe visitors come into the game high on confidence after beating Valencia 2-1 in their last outing and winning three of their last four La Liga matches.\n\nVillarreal have also won their last two away games against Barcelona, so they will have little fear heading into this showdown.\n\nBarca strikers firing blanks as Villarreal visit\n\nBarcelona host Villarreal amid concerns about the form of strikers Robert Lewandowski and Ferran Torres.\n\nFormer Bayern Munich great Lewandowski, 37, has declined rapidly this season as well as enduring some fitness issues, while Torres, 25, is on course for a personal record for goals, but most of them came in a purple patch towards the end of last year.\n\n\n\nThe Catalan giants have obvious problems in defence, as opponents exploit their high line with growing regularity, but last season managed to score enough goals to outweigh their deficiencies in that area as they lifted a domestic treble.\n\nBarca still lead La Liga for goals scored this season, with 67, but they are coming from everywhere – 10 different players have scored two or more, and nobody has more than Torres on 12.\n\nBut Torres has just three goals in his last 15 appearances across all competitions, and his all-round game is lacking, unable to contribute effectively as Barca build up attacks, frequently losing the ball.\n\nLewandowski has five goals in his last 18 games, but seems less mobile than before and a peripheral presence at times.\n\n“With so many matches rotation at striker is natural, and I think Ferran and I can benefit from the current situation,” Lewandowski told Polish magazine Pilka Nozna this week.\n\n“When you play 90 minutes every three days, your whole life is about recovery, now the balance is a little better. I’m tired but I’m not worn out.”\n\nFlick considers deploying Rashford as a striker\n\nBarcelona coach Hansi Flick has not used England international Marcus Rashford much in that position, with the Manchester United loanee more keen on operating from the left.\n\nHowever, with Raphinha fit and firing after an injury absence, Rashford might now view playing as a number nine as his best chance of more minutes.\n\nRashford has been effective for Barca this season, albeit as much in providing assists rather than scoring, laying on 13 goals for his teammates while netting 10 himself in 34 games across all competitions.\n\nWhile other sides took part in the Champions League playoff round, Flick hopes a relatively quiet couple of weeks for his side will have been of huge benefit.\n\n“It’s important that we [had] these two weeks to rest a little bit but also focus on the next match against Villarreal; that will also be a tough match,” said Flick.\n\n“After that, hopefully every three or four days we have a match, so it’s important to have these two weeks.”\n\n‘They’re a brave team that leaves spaces’\n\nVillarreal defender Santiago Mourino said his side were coming to Camp Nou for all three points and highlighted Barcelona’s high line as a weakness they would look to exploit.\n\n“We want to beat Barcelona and close the gap on them. It’s a difficult game. They’ve won all their home games,” Mourino said in a pre-match news conference.\n\n\n\n“Let’s see if we can end their winning streak. We have to play as equals.”\n\nHe added: “They’re a brave team that leaves spaces and we have to take advantage of those chances. We have great strikers and we need to be clinical to win.\n\n“We are one of the best teams in La Liga in open play and on the counterattack. If we are accurate, we can do well.”\n\nHead-to-head\n\nBarcelona and Villarreal have locked horns on 57 occasions. Barcelona won 35 of those games, Villarreal won 12, and 10 matches ended as draws.\n\nVillarreal have won their last two games away at Barca by scoring plenty of goals – recording a 3-2 victory in May 2025 and a 5-3 win in January 2024.\n\nWhat happened the last time these clubs met?\n\nBarcelona wingers Raphinha and Lamine Yamal guided the Catalan giants to a 2-0 win away at 10-man Villarreal in December 2025.\n\nBrazilian international Raphinha won and converted an early penalty before Villarreal’s Renato Veiga was sent off before half-time for a late lunge on Yamal.\n\nLamal slotted home Barca’s second midway through the second half.\n\nBarcelona team news\n\nBarca announced on Thursday that midfielder Frenkie de Jong will be out for up to six weeks with a hamstring issue. Centre-back Andreas Christensen has also been ruled out for a lengthy period with a similar injury.\n\nDefender Gerard Martin will be suspended for accumulating too many yellow cards.\n\nIn some positive news for Barca, midfielder Gavi has resumed training following a serious knee injury that has kept him out of action since August, but he is not expected to feature until sometime in March.\n\nPredicted starting XI:\n\nJoan Garcia (goalkeeper); Kounde, Cubarsi, Eric Garcia, Balde; Bernal, Pedri; Yamal, Fermin, Raphinha; Lewandowski\n\nVillarreal’s team news\n\nPau Cabanes, Logan Costa, Juan Foyth, Willy Kambwala have all been ruled out with injuries, while Gerard Moreno and Pape Gueye face late fitness tests.\n\nPossible starting XI:\n\nLuiz Junior (goalkeeper); Mourino, Navarro, Veiga, Pedraza; Pepe, Comesana, Gueye, Moleiro; Mikautadze, Perez"

            "content": "Progressive Greens win closely watched election in one-time Labour stronghold, while right-wing Reform comes second.\n\nA candidate for the United Kingdom’s left-wing Green Party has comfortably won a closely-watched election for a vacant parliamentary seat, delivering an embarrassing defeat for Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour Party in one of its former strongholds.\n\nResults announced Friday showed the Greens’ Hannah Spencer, a 34-year-old councillor and plumber, had won 40.7 percent of the vote in the by-election in Gorton and Denton, a constituency in Greater Manchester that has been considered a secure Labour seat for almost a century.\n\nIn an outcome that analysts said pointed to the fracturing of the UK’s traditional two-party politics, the hard-right candidate for the populist, anti-immigration Reform finished in second place.\n\nLabour, which had won more than half the vote in Gorton and Denton at the last general election in 2024, finished a bruising third.\n\nThe Green Party has positioned itself as an alternative to Labour, arguing that the governing party has moved away from some of the values it once championed.\n\nThe Greens, and their party leader Zack Polanski, have been vocal in their condemnation of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and their support for Palestinians. Many Labour voters have been infuriated by the government’s ongoing diplomatic support for Israel through the carnage it has wrought in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.\n\nPolitical scientist John Curtice called the result a “seismic moment” that signalled that the “future of British politics looks more uncertain than at any stage” since the end of World War II, the Reuters news agency reported.\n\n\n\nThe result was “clearly disappointing”, said Labour Party chair Anna Turley.\n\nIn her victory speech, Spencer said she felt compelled to call out “politicians and divisive figures who constantly scapegoat and blame our communities for all the problems in society”.\n\nStarmer’s woes continue\n\nThe loss of what had been considered a safe seat, in the country’s biggest electoral test ⁠in nearly a year, adds to the mounting pressure on the embattled Starmer.\n\nThe British leader has faced calls for his resignation amid Labour’s nose-diving popularity and ongoing turmoil, including the arrest of Peter Mandelson, who Starmer had appointed ambassador to the US last year, following revelations surrounding his links to disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nStarmer had personally invested political capital in the outcome by blocking Andy Burnham, the popular Manchester mayor who is widely touted as a potential challenger for the Labour leadership, from standing in the race, and by visiting the constituency before the vote.\n\nDuopoly challenged\n\nSpencer’s victory – the Greens’ first win in a by-election – gives the party its fifth seat in parliament, while the top-polling Reform, which is widely viewed as posing the biggest challenge to the government at the ballot box, has eight.\n\nBoth parties, along with the centrist Liberal Democrats, are polling in double digits, presenting a threat to the traditional Labour-Conservative duopoly in British politics.\n\nNigel Farage, leader of the anti-immigration Reform, claimed on X, without evidence, that the Greens’ win was “a victory for sectarian voting and cheating”, and welcomed forthcoming local elections in May.\n\n“It will be goodbye Starmer and goodbye to the Tory party,” he said.\n\nA Greens spokesperson dismissed Farage’s comments as “an attempt to undermine the democratic result” that was “straight out of the Trump playbook”.\n\nThe contest was triggered after former Labour MP Andrew Gwynne stood down for health reasons."

            "content": "Pakistani defence minister says Pakistan and Afghanistan are now at ‘open war’.\n\nPakistan has launched air strikes on Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, and other cities, as clashes escalate along the two countries’ shared border.\n\nOn Friday, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said Islamabad’s patience had run out with the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan, declaring that the two countries are now at “open war”.\n\nThe declaration came hours after Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah ⁠Mujahid said Afghanistan was carrying out “large-scale offensive operations” against the Pakistani military along the Durand Line, which separates the two countries.\n\nThis follows weeks of fighting along the countries’ shared border, with both sides claiming that dozens of people have been killed.\n\nHostilities are taking place against a backdrop of an escalation in tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities since the latter’s return to power in 2021.\n\nHere is what we know so far:\n\nWhat has happened?\n\nOn Friday, Pakistani officials said Afghan forces had attacked military positions close to the border, prompting Islamabad to launch air strikes on targets inside Afghanistan, including in the capital, Kabul, and in other cities.\n\nThe first Pakistani strike occurred at about 1:50am local time on Friday (21:20 GMT on Thursday), Al Jazeera’s correspondent Nasser Shadid reported, with Afghan forces responding with anti-aircraft fire.\n\n“Our cup of patience has overflowed. Now it is open war between us and you,” Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on X.\n\nWhich areas in Afghanistan have been hit by Pakistan?\n\nPakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar wrote on X that “Afghan Taliban defence targets” had been struck in Kabul, the southeastern Paktia province and southern Kandahar, while Defence Minister Khawaja Asif declared what he described as an “open war” with the Taliban government.\n\n\n\nAfghan government spokesperson Mujahid also confirmed in an X post that these three provinces had been hit.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the attacks had destroyed two brigade bases in Afghanistan, citing two senior Pakistani security officials who spoke to the agency on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nPakistani state media outlet Pakistan TV claimed in a report that the country’s forces had “destroyed” a number of Taliban locations in a few hours.\n\nAccording to the outlet, the locations attacked in Afghanistan included a Taliban brigade headquarters and ammunition depot in Kandahar, as well as Taliban posts in the Wali Khan sector, near the Shawal sector, in the Bajaur sector and in Angoor Adda.\n\nPakistan’s Ministry of Information said it was also targeting Afghan Taliban forces in several districts of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province: Chitral, Khyber, Mohmand, Kurram and Bajaur.\n\nLater on Friday, gunfire and shelling were reported near the key Torkham border crossing between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from Islamabad, and the AFP news agency reported that shelling had been heard near the crossing in the morning.\n\nAFP reported Afghan soldiers were heading towards the frontier.\n\nThe Torkham crossing has remained open for Afghans returning en masse from Pakistan, despite the land border being largely shut since fighting between the neighbours in October.\n\nWhat do we know about casualties?\n\nReports from each side are conflicting.\n\nMosharraf Zaidi, the spokesperson for Pakistan’s prime minister, wrote on X early on Friday that in the attack on Friday morning, 133 Afghan Taliban forces had been killed and more than 200 were wounded.\n\nHe added that 27 Afghan Taliban posts had been destroyed, and nine had been captured. More than 80 “tanks, artillery pieces, and armed personnel carriers have been destroyed”, he wrote.\n\nPakistani news outlet Dawn reported that two Pakistani military personnel had died in the ongoing clashes.\n\nAl Jazeera could not independently verify the casualty figures released by Pakistan.\n\nThe Taliban government, however, said only eight Taliban fighters were killed and 11 were wounded.\n\nAfghanistan said its military had launched its attack on Pakistani military bases and outposts along the border early on Friday in retaliation against Pakistani strikes across the Afghan border on Sunday. It claimed its forces had killed 55 Pakistani soldiers, and captured two military bases and 19 military posts. Pakistan has dismissed this claim.\n\n\n\nFor its part, Pakistan said its air strikes last Sunday killed at least 70 “militants”, a claim dismissed by Mujahid, according to news outlets. Mujahid, instead, wrote on X that the attacks “killed and wounded dozens, including women and children”.\n\nThe provincial director of the Afghan Red Crescent Society in Nangarhar province, Mawlawi Fazl Rahman Fayyaz, said 18 people had been killed and several others were wounded on Sunday.\n\nFormer Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who does not hold an official position but remains an influential political figure, said the country “will defend their beloved homeland with complete unity in all circumstances and will respond to aggression with courage”.\n\n“Pakistan cannot free itself from the violence and bombings – those problems it has created itself – but must change its own policy and choose the path of good neighbourliness, respect, and civilised relations with Afghanistan,” he wrote in an X post on Friday.\n\nWhy are Pakistan and Afghanistan fighting?\n\nThe current flare-up of violence between the two countries is the culmination of months of tension.\n\nIn October 2025, Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed to an immediate ceasefire during talks mediated by Qatar and Turkiye following a week of fierce and deadly clashes along their border.\n\nThe border between Afghanistan and Pakistan is called the Durand Line and spans 2,611km (1,622 miles). Afghanistan does not formally recognise this border, which it argues was an imposed colonial demarcation that illegitimately divided ethnic Pashtun areas between the two countries.\n\nThe neighbours have been embroiled in frequent clashes since the Taliban took over in 2021. Sami Omari, an expert in South and Central Asian security and strategic affairs, told Al Jazeera there have been 75 clashes between Afghan and Pakistani forces since 2021 – the same year that US and NATO forces withdrew from Afghanistan.\n\nIn particular, Pakistan wants the Taliban to rein in armed groups such as the Pakistan Taliban, known by its acronym TTP, which it says Afghanistan is harbouring. The TTP emerged in Pakistan in 2007 and is separate from the Taliban in Afghanistan, but shares deep ideological, social and linguistic ties with the group.\n\nArmed attacks in Pakistan by the TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which operates in the resource-rich Balochistan province, have surged in recent years. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which border Afghanistan, have borne the brunt of the violence.\n\nOn Friday, Pakistan’s former Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said the country has “nothing against the proud and poor citizens of Afghanistan”.\n\n“But it is the Taliban (Afghanistan & Pakistan) who have forced Pakistan into this conflict,” he wrote on X.\n\n“For the sake of innocent civilians on both sides of the border, I hope the Taliban stop with incursions into and terrorism in Pakistan.”\n\nAfghanistan is unlikely to take action against armed groups, however, analysts say. “The Afghan Taliban appear unwilling to seriously crack down on the TTP, partly due to prior affinities between the two groups but also out of fear of TTP militants defecting to its main rival, the Islamic State Khorasan Province,” Pearl Pandya, South Asia senior analyst at the US-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), an independent, impartial conflict monitor, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\n\nPandya added that a serious escalation is “inevitable” if the Taliban in Afghanistan do not crack down on the TTP.\n\nElizabeth Threlkeld, director of the South Asia programme at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera that the latest clashes are not surprising, as they stem from months of “frayed” tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\n“It is significant to the extent that it represents perhaps a shift in strategy,” Threlkeld said, noting the “more aggressive, kinetic attacks” from Pakistan.\n\n“But since then, we’ve seen a couple of terrorist attacks within Pakistan that were quite significant. So, no, I’m not surprised that after those cumulative attacks, that tensions have frayed and things have again gone in this direction, unfortunately.”\n\nArmed warfare between the two nations would not favour Afghanistan, which is ill-equipped to meet Pakistan head on.\n\nThe Afghan Taliban does not have a military that is comparable to Pakistan’s, which is why it is using unconventional methods of attack, Abdul Basit, a scholar at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“They have suicide bombers and kamikaze drones, which I think they will use those in large numbers,” Basit said.\n\nFurthermore, Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder reported, “the Afghans do not have an air force, so the Pakistanis have the upper hand in striking across the border. They’ve attacked Kabul, Kandahar and other places. They say their main targets are ammunition depots and military infrastructure.”\n\n“Does it mean that Pakistani troops are going to cross the border?” he said. “It is very unlikely. However, we cannot rule out continuous exchange of fire across the border, with both sides using heavy artillery.”\n\nHow has the world reacted?\n\n“India strongly condemns Pakistan’s air strikes on Afghan territory that have resulted in civilian casualties, including women and children, during the holy month of Ramadan,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.\n\n“It is another attempt by Pakistan to externalise its internal failures,” he said.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged both sides to adhere to international law, according to a statement delivered by his spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric.\n\nIran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has urged Afghanistan and Pakistan to resolve their differences through dialogue and good neighbourly principles.\n\n“In the blessed month of Ramadan, the month of self-restraint and strengthening solidarity in the world of Islam, it is fitting that Afghanistan and Pakistan manage and resolve their existing differences within the framework of good neighborliness and through the path of dialogue,” Araghchi wrote in an X post.\n\nRussia has urged the warring parties to ⁠halt cross-border attacks ‌immediately and resolve their differences through diplomatic ⁠means, the ⁠RIA news ⁠agency reported on ⁠Friday, ⁠citing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Russia has also offered to mediate."

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nLess than 24 hours before the deadline in an ultimatum issued by the Pentagon, Anthropic has refused the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted access to its AI.\n\nIt’s the culmination of a dramatic exchange of public statements, social media posts, and behind-the-scenes negotiations, coming down to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s desire to renegotiate all AI labs’ current contracts with the military. But Anthropic, so far, has refused to back down from its two current red lines: no mass surveillance of Americans, and no lethal autonomous weapons (or weapons with license to kill targets with no human oversight whatsoever). OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to the new terms, while Anthropic’s refusal had led to CEO Dario Amodei being summoned to the White House this week for a meeting with Hegseth himself, in which the Secretary reportedly issued an ultimatum to the CEO to back down by the end of business day on Friday or else.\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, Amodei wrote, “I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community.”\n\nHe added that the company has “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner” but that in a “narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values” — going on to specifically mention mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons. (Amodei mentioned that “partial autonomous weapons … are vital to the defense of democracy” and that fully autonomous weapons may eventually “prove critical for our national defense,” but that “today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons.” He did not rule out Anthropic acquiescing to the military’s use of fully autonomous weapons in the future but mentioned that they were not ready now.)\n\nThe Pentagon had already reportedly asked major defense contractors to assess their dependence on Anthropic’s Claude, which could be seen as the first step to designating the company a “supply chain risk” — a public threat that the Pentagon had made recently (and a classification usually reserved for threats to national security). The Pentagon was also reportedly considering invoking the Defense Production Act to make Anthropic comply.\n\nAmodei wrote in his statement that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” He also wrote that “should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.”"

Copilot Tasks will provide a report once its work is complete.\n\nYou can call upon Copilot Tasks to do things like organize your subscriptions and cancel the ones you don’t use, as well as turn emails, attachments, and images from your inbox into a slide deck. Some other use cases include having the AI assistant surface urgent emails and draft replies; plan a birthday party from venue to invites; and keep tabs on new apartment listings every Friday, even setting up home tours.\n\nMicrosoft says that Tasks will ask for permission before performing “meaningful actions,” like making a payment or sending a message for you. For now, Copilot Tasks is only available in a research preview with a “small group” of testers. You can join a waitlist for Copilot Tasks from Microsoft’s website."

I asked Samsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the executive in charge of both R&D and operations for Samsung’s mobile business. He says the added thickness of magnets is a bad tradeoff to make, because you’re just going to buy a case anyhow.\n\n“About 80 or 90 percent of people are using a case, and cases with magnets are very popular these days,” he tells me.\n\nSamsung would rather use that extra height to give the phone a larger battery or make it thinner, he says.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Samsung isn’t looking into magnets. “We’re still doing a lot of research to make sure we don’t have any sacrifice inside the phone; when we actually achieve that, we’ll integrate,” he says.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with Choi’s premise. I want extra battery and magnets, and I’m willing to sacrifice thinness to get it. Phones are thin enough already, except for the ones that fold.\n\nAnd if Samsung took charge of the magnets like Apple, and replicated Apple’s standard pattern and strength, maybe the magnet case I use with my Galaxy S25 would properly and firmly hold onto magnetic battery packs without them rotating in place. Since there’s no magnets inside my phone, I’m at the mercy of casemakers.\n\nBut I get it. Why make the tradeoff if someone will pay for a case anyhow? Seems like we need to ask Apple and Google why they chose differently."

            "content": "Ultrahuman on Friday unveiled a new smart ring with longer battery life and a redesigned form factor, as the Bengaluru-based wearable maker seeks to revive its U.S. business that was disrupted last year by a patent dispute with rival Oura.\n\nThe Ring Pro, Ultrahuman’s third-generation smart ring, offers up to 15 days of battery life — compared with four to six days on the Ring Air — and is priced at $479. It will be available for pre-orders globally, excluding the U.S., with shipments beginning in March.\n\nUltrahuman’s U.S. business was disrupted in October 2025 after the U.S. International Trade Commission — a federal agency that handles trade disputes — ruled in Oura’s favor in a patent dispute. The ruling prevented the startup from importing new ring inventory into the country, although existing retail stock continued to be sold. The blow was significant. The U.S. accounted for about 45% of Ultrahuman’s roughly 700,000 daily active users worldwide, according to co-founder and CEO Mohit Kumar.\n\nIn August 2025, Ultrahuman also filed a separate patent infringement case against Oura in the Delhi High Court, where the matter remains pending.\n\nMeanwhile, to work around Oura’s patent, Ultrahuman developed the Ring Pro with a new design, Kumar told TechCrunch, adding that the device has been submitted to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance. U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance to confirm it can legally be imported into the country.\n\nDespite the U.S. disruption, Ultrahuman is currently operating at an annualized revenue run rate of about $150 million, Kumar said. It reported $64 million in operating revenue in the financial year ended March 2025. The startup remains profitable after tax, although margins are expected to narrow due to litigation costs, tariffs, and the redesign effort, he added.\n\nAlongside the new ring, Ultrahuman introduced Jade, a real-time “biointelligence” system that analyzes user health data across its devices and services to generate personalized insights and recommendations.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nKumar said Jade is designed to move beyond retrospective health summaries toward real-time, actionable guidance.\n\nUltrahuman’s Jade AI system Image Credits:Ultrahuman\n\n“Most AI tools today look backward at your data,” he said. “Jade is built to react to your health in real time and surface actions users can take.”\n\nKumar said Jade will be available to all Ultrahuman users, including those using the older Ring Air, and does not currently require a subscription.\n\nThe Ring Pro features a redesigned heart-rate sensing architecture for improved signal quality during sleep and a new dual-core processor to enhance data accuracy and on-device computing. The device can store up to 250 days of health data and weighs about 5% to 6% more than the Ring Air, launched in July 2023 at $349.\n\nUltrahuman has also introduced a Pro Charger with up to 45 days of battery life to support on-the-go charging and enable faster updates and diagnostics through direct case connectivity. The charger also supports wireless charging via Qi, the same standard used by most modern smartphones.\n\nUltrahuman’s Pro Charger Image Credits:Ultrahuman\n\nWomen account for about 68% of Ultrahuman’s user base, up from roughly 65% a year earlier, Kumar said, reflecting strong adoption of the startup’s women’s health features.\n\nUltrahuman also offers subscription-based services across its broader health platform, including a coaching and recovery program called PowerPlugs, the Blood Vision metabolic panel, Ultrahuman Home, and a continuous glucose monitoring offering. Subscriptions contribute about 16% of Ultrahuman’s revenue, while Blood Vision accounts for roughly 5% to 6% of the business, Kumar said.\n\nUltrahuman’s key growth markets include the UK, Canada, Australia, and India, Kumar told TechCrunch, with the latter contributing about 8% to 9% of overall revenue after recent investments in local customer support.\n\nGlobal smart ring shipments grew nearly 80% year-over-year in 2025, driven by demand for compact wearables with advanced sleep tracking and longer battery life, said Anshika Jain, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. Oura continues to lead with more than two-thirds of the market, while Ultrahuman holds the second position.\n\nJain added that future leaders in the category will be defined by sensor accuracy, AI-driven insights, and seamless ecosystem integration.\n\nSeparate IDC data showed global smart ring shipments rising about 30% year over year in Q3 2025 to nearly 1 million units, driven in part by demand for screenless fitness trackers, said Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India. Ultrahuman captured roughly 25% of the market during the period, per IDC.\n\nFounded in 2019, Ultrahuman has raised about $55 million to date and counts Alpha Wave Incubation, Blume Ventures, Steadview Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners among its investors.\n\nUltrahuman, Kumar said, is building additional production capacity to support demand for the Ring Pro over the coming months."

Discovery.\n\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for the legacy studio, and would walk away from the deal.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\n\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\n\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration shelved or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\n\nNetflix had announced its intent to acquire WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks. Paramount’s newest bid, of $31 a share, values WBD at about $111 billion.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Shares in Paramount were up 4.5%."

            "content": "Jack Dorsey has long been an open admirer of Elon Musk. Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey announced that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly half its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.\n\nIt isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\n\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\n\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\n\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said Thursday that he “cannot in good conscience accede to [the Pentagon’s] request” to give the military unrestricted access to its AI systems.\n\n“Anthropic understands that the Department of War, not private companies, makes military decisions,” Amodei wrote in a statement. “However, in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values. Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”\n\nThe two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop. The Pentagon believes it should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.\n\nAmodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday 5:01 p.m. deadline Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. The Department of Defense has attempted to force Amodei’s hand by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding. The DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense.\n\nAmodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”\n\nHe added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”\n\nAnthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.\n\nThe startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.\n\nWith a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round. Form has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook. The company plans to go public next year."

            "content": "Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\n\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nSurprise guests at Prada pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 26, 2026\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\n\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\n\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you."

            "content": "When Netflix dropped the first season of Love Is Blind in February 2020, it offered a reprieve from the washboard abs that normally seem like a casting requirement for reality TV shows.\n\nThe premise—that couples get engaged “sight unseen” after talking to each other through pods, then, following a big reveal, decide if they want to get married—featured just the right amount of mess. Who can forget Jessica allowing her dog to sip wine or an insulted Carlton throwing his fiancee's engagement ring into a pool? Meanwhile Lauren and Cameron's unvarnished conversations highlighted the awkwardness that sometimes accompanies interracial dating.\n\nIt was a reality show, but it seemed like a format that could actually allow people to fall in love without getting bogged down in superficial distractions and expectations. Maybe.\n\nNow in its 10th season, Love Is Blind is a cornerstone of Netflix’s reality TV cinematic universe. But while each cycle brings us standout women who earnestly buy into the show’s original conceit, it’s getting tougher to find any men to root for.\n\nWith the latest US season featuring Chris Fusco, who voluntarily compares himself to Andrew Tate and derides a fellow male cast member for being “submissive,” and Alex Henderson, a Trump-loving crypto bro with an ever-shifting backstory, increasingly the men of Love Is Blind seem to have been plucked straight from the manosphere.\n\nSeason after season, the women on the show (and viewers at home) are subjected to men who make shallow, body-shaming comments, struggle with anger and emotional regulation, and sometimes appear uncomfortable with their partner’s success."

            "content": "In late December, the 21st to be exact, my friends Amos and Clara called me 17 times. On December 22 it was eight times. The calls were short—sometimes only 30 to 45 seconds, and they usually arrived when I was doing something important: working, grocery shopping, napping. “Hi Anna,” one or both of them would say. “Hi!” I’d respond. Sometimes I worried that I sounded too eager, or like I was just sitting around waiting for their call. Sometimes I felt a little pathetic.\n\nIf anyone else called me that often I’d block their number. But Amos is 6 years old, and Clara is 9, and what happened is that on December 20, for Hanukkah, the siblings got the gift of a newly released, extremely old-school kids’ phone. And for the next week or so, the two of them couldn’t stop calling. And I, for one, couldn’t stop picking up.\n\nCalled the Tin Can, the phone came out last April and has since sold more than 100,000 units without much paid advertising. It’s basically a “dumb phone” that makes and receives calls over a Wi-Fi network—a landline without the line. It has no screen, not even a tiny one to show who’s calling; its surface has only buttons, a receiver, and a speaker. The product is marketed to parents who want to encourage their children to communicate without giving them access to web browsers and social media. (One user on X suggested, jokingly, that children start writing chain letters next.)\n\nThe standard Tin Can, which comes in four colorways and costs $100, looks like a candy-colored soup can. A “retro” model called The Flashback appears nearly identical to an old-school cradle phone and also retails at $100. Calls between Tin Cans are free, but the company charges $10 a month for users to call outside the Tin Can network. Parents get to set the rules—they add numbers to an approved caller list, and only calls to and from those numbers go through, and only in preset time frames, say, between 8 am and 8 pm. Parents can also monitor call logs. Call it spying with the implied consent of the spied upon; an electronic surveillance state in miniature.\n\nSome parents have tried to solve the problem of intrusive screens by buying their kids smartwatches; others opt for typical dumb phones. But these products are more about letting adults keep tabs on where their kids are at any given moment. The Tin Can is more about getting kids to focus on using their voices to communicate.\n\nAnd that’s about it. Tin Cans don’t show you missed calls or support text messaging. In an era in which most everyone is being nudged toward addictive, screen-based, endless-scroll engagement, giving kids the opportunity to get lost in conversation can seem incredibly appealing to parents."

Each panel on the helmet has 12 red lights (120 total), which are on a spectrum of 620 to 660 nanometers (nm). The 620-nm red light helps improve scalp health by promoting circulation, and the 660-nm red light penetrates deeper, reaching through the epidermis and dermis to the hypodermis, where it stimulates growth and repair at the follicle root. According to CurrentBody, you only need to use the device for 10 minutes a day, and you’ll see results within 12 weeks.\n\nMy hair grows famously slow. I got a pixie cut in the spring of 2011, and my hair did not touch my shoulders until the end of 2013. My hair is also super fine. It tangles easily and often breaks off (my ends are chronically dry and split). After 12 weeks, I didn’t notice a huge difference in length (and I got a haircut halfway through testing), but I did notice that my hair seemed to be sprouting new follicles along my scalp and sideburn area in particular. I started to see small baby hairs along my hairline that I had never seen before. My stylist commented that my hair felt thicker, and I noticed less breakage and hair caught in bristles when brushing. My balding roommate also tested it (although not daily like me) and said that his hair felt thicker and that there was new growth around the scalp.\n\nThe helmet comes in two sizes: medium for a skull circumference of 21.3 to 23.2 inches, or large, for 23.3 to 25 inches. (I opted for medium, and it was too large for my head size.) The device sits on a base and is charged via a USB-C cord. It takes about three hours to fully charge, and it stays on a single charge for about a week. The device is powered on by the press of the single button located under the charging port. The circular earmuffs protect sensitive ears with a cushy, removable faux leather cloth, and they can be adjusted several inches up or down to ensure a comfortable fit. The screen on the right earmuff indicates the time left in the treatment session, and the helmet automatically turns off when the 10 minutes are up. You can also connect the device to Bluetooth and play any type of music or video while wearing it, because God forbid I be left alone with my thoughts for 10 minutes a day. Just make sure your hair is clean and dry before use.\n\nMy only complaints are that the ear covers aren’t the easiest to adjust while wearing and would oftentimes pull out my hair while I removed or adjusted the helmet. Nevertheless, this is the best red light therapy for hair growth. Just you wait, I’ll look like Fabio on the cover of a romance novel by next year. See full review here. —Molly Higgins"

The estimate was released Friday in a minority report stemming from a months-long inquiry into data broker practices launched by United States senator Maggie Hassan.\n\nHassan, a New Hampshire Democrat and the JEC’s ranking member, sent investigative requests to five major data brokers—Comscore, Findem, IQVIA Digital, Telesign, and 6Sense Insights—in August after an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, copublished by WIRED, found some data brokers were hiding opt-out tools from Google and other search engines using “no index” instructions that tell web crawlers not to list the page.\n\nScammers are shown to use the kind of sensitive data that companies like these hold—including identifiers like dates of birth, addresses, and even Social Security numbers—to target victims with personalized fraud.\n\nFour of the companies took steps after Hassan’s outreach to improve access to opt-out options, including by removing the “no index” code, adding more prominent links, and posting guidance on exercising privacy rights.\n\nFindem, however, did not respond to Hassan or to committee staff follow-up, and staff said the company has not removed the “no index” code from its page. WIRED’s calls to Findem on Thursday went unanswered.\n\nThe report says Findem’s “failure to respond” to the lawmakers’ inquiries raises “serious, broad questions about its responsiveness to opt-out requests and commitment to data privacy,” adding that its own mandatory disclosures from 2024 show the company “did not process 80 percent of privacy requests from consumers and other parties,” citing “insufficient data.”\n\nIQVIA, 6sense, and Comscore did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Telesign routes press inquiries through an online form that requires reporters to consent to receiving marketing communications, which was not used for that reason; instead, a company email address that appeared in previously leaked breach data was tried."

I actually carry around a power bank with me everywhere due to my chaotic, spontaneous lifestyle and refusal to charge my devices when they aren't actively dying. I purchased my favorite from our extensive list of the Best Power Banks, which features hand-tested picks from my fellow WIRED Reviews gadget experts. Several of their (and my) top picks are on sale right now.\n\nSharge Shargeek 170 Power Bank for $110 ($60 off)\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Sharge Shargeek 170 Power Bank $169 $110 (35% off) Amazon\n\nThis is the best-looking power bank we've tried, and the price comes within $10 of the lowest we've tracked. The transparent housing and triangle shape are cool, but the battery also performs well, with a 24,000-mAh capacity, a maximum output of 170 watts, and even a little bit of water resistance. There's a display that'll show you battery life, time remaining until a full charge, and the input or output in watts. The battery itself charges up in a little under an hour, provided you have the right cable and charger, and it can top off three devices simultaneously."

The two phones are largely similar, even rocking the same chipset. The Pixel 10a does come in some new colors, though, like Fog and Lavender, and the phone is slightly thinner, with a less noticeable camera bump. The screen is a little brighter and a little more scratch-resistant, and the device is made with more recycled materials.\n\nHowever, there are some software changes in the 10a compared to the 9a. The Pixel 10a is getting some of the same AI features as you’d find in the Pixel 10, plus support for AirDrop as well. The battery lasts up to 30 hours on a single charge, and the phone will have seven years of software and security updates. We can help you decide which Google Pixel to order, and if you decide on the 10a, these gift card deals are definitely worth it (especially if you were already planning on spending money at Amazon or Best Buy anyway)."

            "content": "Lowe’s Home Improvement grew the old-fashioned way, working its way up from a single, small, family-owned North Carolina general store founded in 1921. But the Lowe’s hardware store empire is plenty big these days. A tool-filled Lowe’s superstore is now about as big as a New York City block. The focus stays mostly on appliances and tools for the home DIYer, more than large building contractors. I like to pop in for grill and griddle tools, or just some propane. But you can also buy a pre-finished door complete with the frame—or the lumber, sanders, routers, and saws you’d use to make your own door, including the hinges and the wood stain. It’s easy to get lost in the endless aisles if you love the smell of plaster and wood dust, but it’s easier to find the best Lowe’s deals on the website. This roundup includes Lowe’s daily deals, a promo code, and Lowe's offer code for 40% off appliances, plus info on the Lowe’s rewards program and military discounts.\n\nQuick Ways to Save at Lowe’s: Text Alerts and Daily Deals\n\nLowe’s wants to be able to tell you about its deals, hoping you’ll be tempted to take advantage of them. If you’re a consistent DIYer, it’s likely worth getting a heads-up on the Lowe’s Deals of the Day, delivered to your phone via text message. This might be anything from drills to snow blowers or lawn mowers, plus the best package deals on appliances, refrigerators, washers, and dryers. Each of these deals is one-day only. If you \n\nJoin the MyLowe’s Rewards Program, Get Maximum Benefits\n\nIf you’re planning on doing some major work this year, or just like to putter around, it’s probably worth picking up a MyLowe’s Rewards Program membership. Each eligible purchase accrues points that’ll pay out in increments of $5 in-store credit at Lowe’s. Like a lot of loyalty programs, you get more benefits if you spend more at the store, including free shipping on all purchases including the small ones, member-only discounts, and point boosters for better discounts.\n\nThere are three tiers of memberships, depending what you buy. One large appliance might already qualify you for the highest tier of rewards, at which point you might as well. These are the three tiers, based on the total cost of what you’ve bought at Lowe’s in the past year. Bronze ($0-$499): $35 minimum for free shipping; 1 point per $1 spent. Silver ($500-$1,999): Free shipping; 1.25 points per $1 spent. Gold ($2,000+): Free shipping; 1.5 points per $1 spent.\n\nFor contractors, there’s a separate MyLowe’s Pro Rewards Program that offers Lowe’s in-store credit in increments of $1 for every 100 points earned. (Points expire in half-yearly increments, on June 30 and December 31.) Benefits include member-only deals, volume discounts, free standard shipping in the contiguous United States, and a 20% paint discount after annual spend of $3,000 or more. Other benefits include analytics and spend reports, online order quoting, and purchase authorization for specified crew members.\n\n10% Military Discount, Plus Free MyLowe’s Silver Status\n\nAll verified active military, veterans, and military spouses are eligible for a 10% discount on full-price items—meaning things don’t have to be on sale to be on sale. This is available through what Lowe’s calls the Everyday Military Discount program. When you enroll, you also get an immediate upgrade to Silver status on the MyLowe’s Rewards program, which means more rewards points earned per dollar, and free shipping on all orders in the contiguous United States.\n\nGet a free Silver status upgrade instantly when you enroll in our Military Discount program and validate through ID.me. MyLowe’s Rewards Silver status members receive free standard shipping (excludes AK and HI) and earn more points per dollar.\n\nSave 5% on Everyday Purchases at Lowe’s\n\nLike a lot of big retailers, Lowe’s also has a store credit card with discounts attached. The MyLowe’s Rewards Credit Card offers 5% off qualified purchases, with a whole bunch of asterisks. Specifically, the discount applies after all other discounts and can’t be combined with other programs like contractor bulk discounts, employee discounts, or military discounts. It also doesn’t work on Weber, Miele, or Kichler products. Scroll to the bottom here, for APR and exceptions. The smart person signs up during a big purchase: When you sign up and get approved, you get 20% off an in-store purchase (up to $100 off).\n\nAnother way to get 5% off on items you need regularly is to set up a Lowe’s subscription. This is good for items ranging from cleaning products, air and water filters, lawn care, pet goods, plumbing, and batteries. Shipping is free, and delivery happens automatically."

The puzzle loves to use last names and even college names that mean other things, to fool you into thinking they are words, not names.\n\n#3: And the opposite is also true. Words like HURTS might seem like a regular word, but it's also the last name of at least one pro athlete."

That helps you hear the words in the context of a phrase. The Connections editors love to group words together that are used in similar phrasing, like ____ Up.\n\n#2: Don't go for the obvious grouping. These editors are smart. Once, they offered SPONGE, BOB, SQUARE and PANTS in the same puzzle. None of those words were in the same category. If you like, hit the \"shuffle\" button to give yourself a different perspective on the words.\n\n#3: Break down any compound words and look for similarities. \"Rushmore\" was once in a puzzle where the connection was that each word started with the name of a rock band."

            "content": "If you drive a car that's newer than 2008, a new study finds your vehicle's tire pressure monitoring system can be used to track you.\n\nA group of researchers at IMDEA Networks Institute -- an English-speaking research organization on data networks based in Madrid -- discovered this privacy risk at the end of a 10-week study in which they collected roughly 6 million wireless signals from over 20,000 cars. Their findings point to a serious hacker threat hiding in the tire sensors of most modern vehicles.\n\nThe TREAD Act of 2000 mandated that modern cars come equipped with TPMS for road safety. The system works by releasing wireless signals through tiny sensors attached to each tire, which communicate each tire's pressure information to the car's electronic control unit. A warning light on the vehicle's dashboard indicates low tire pressure.\n\nInstead of using a camera with a clear line of sight to the car, hackers can hypothetically track it using the wireless signals emitted by the car's tire sensors. That signal is continuously sent out as an unencrypted unique ID number.\n\nBasically, anyone nearby with a cheap radio receiver can pick up the signal and later recognize the same vehicle without ever seeing the license plate.\n\nInformation could help users track drivers\n\n\"Our results show that these tire sensor signals can be used to follow vehicles and learn their movement patterns,\" Domenico Giustiniano, research professor at IMDEA Networks Institute, said in the peer-reviewed report. \"This means a network of inexpensive wireless receivers could quietly monitor the patterns of cars in real-world environments. Such information could reveal daily routines, such as work arrival times or travel habits.\"\n\nThe researchers were able to capture signals from more than 50 meters away from moving cars, through walls and from inside buildings. The tire pressure readings helped reveal the vehicle type, its weight and the driving pattern of the driver. It's a cheap, tough-to-detect, potentially covert tracking method.\n\nWhile this may be a startling discovery, Cooper Quintin, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNET it's not the only privacy threat in your car's computer system.\n\n\"Any method that can be misused to surreptitiously track people's movements without their knowledge is concerning,\" he said. \"But so are all of the technologies in modern cars that intentionally violate drivers' privacy by collecting and sharing data for purposes of advertising, insurance risk assessment, and more. It's sad that drivers have to worry about this, and everyone should learn how to protect themselves whenever possible while manufacturers are pressured to do better.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time a group of researchers has raised the red flag about this sensor system in cars. A 2010 study by researchers at Rutgers University and the University of South Carolina warned of the potential privacy threat hiding in a vehicle's tire pressure system. Sixteen years later, the flaw persists.\n\n\"TPMS was designed for safety, not security,\" said Dr. Yago Lizarribar, one of the study's authors. \"Our findings show the need for manufacturers and regulators to improve protection in future vehicle sensor systems.\"\n\nThe study urges policymakers and car manufacturers to design a more secure and privacy-preserving TPMS for future cars."

            "content": "The projected shortage of memory chips worldwide will have a more serious impact on smartphone sales in 2026 than previously projected, according to new data from International Data Corporation Worldwide. Whereas the company just in November had estimated a drop of between 0.9% and 5.2% (the latter being its \"pessimistic scenario\"), now it sees a 12.9% decline this year, based on its Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.\n\n\"What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,\" Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for Worldwide Client Devices at IDC, said in a statement.\n\nThe hardest-hit companies are expected to be those selling to the lower end of the market, which can't absorb the higher component costs while maintaining profitable margins. As a result, Jeronimo says, many of those players will pass the added costs on to consumers.\n\nThat also includes regional markets like the Middle East and Africa that sell mostly inexpensive smartphones, which could see a steep 20.6% drop year-over-year.\n\nIDC predicts a steep drop in smartphone sales for 2026. IDC\n\nBy contrast, IDC expects Apple and Samsung to be better able to withstand the crisis. \"As smaller and low-end-positioned Android vendors struggle with rising costs, Apple and Samsung could not only weather the storm but potentially expand market share as the competitive landscape tightens,\" said Jeronimo.\n\nMemory has become scarce due to the insatiable demand to feed generative AI. Essentially all of the memory set to be manufactured this year is already earmarked. What started as a demand for graphics processors has expanded to other components. For example, hard drive manufacturer Western Digital announced in early February that it had already sold out of its supply for 2026.\n\n\"We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points,\" said Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC, projecting a 14% rise in the average selling price of smartphones to $523.\n\nPopal expects memory prices to stabilize by the middle of 2027, but doesn't see them coming down to earlier levels. The sub-$100 segment, made up of approximately 171 million devices, will be \"permanently uneconomical,\" she said. \"In short, there is no return to business as usual for vendors and consumers.\""

            "content": "During Nvidia's quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang said that agentic AI has reached \"an inflection point\" and that AI agents are \"solving real problems.\"\n\nThe company's powerful chips have been at the heart of the AI boom over the last few years, especially for use in data centers -- so much so that Nvidia's annual revenue for fiscal 2026 zoomed to $216 billion, up 65% from the previous year.\n\nHuang called Nvidia an AI infrastructure company, a dramatic evolution from the graphics card company it started as.\n\nThe term agentic AI has been floating around for some time, but now the technology is becoming available for real-world use. Unlike chatbots, which stay within their own boundaries to produce text, images or code, AI agents can take specific actions -- for instance, plan and book a vacation -- without a person constantly giving it commands.\n\nIn a live event just hours before Nvidia released its earnings, Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy S26 lineup of phones, devoting a good deal of time to talking about the \"agentic AI experience\" they'll deliver.\n\nDuring Nvidia's call, Huang said that the world has \"awakened to the agentic inflection\" and that it only happened within the last two or three months. He also said he believes the next inflection will be physical AI, a term that describes the embedding of artificial intelligence in machinery, including self-driving cars and robots.\n\nRobots were a notable presence at CES earlier this year, the consumer electronics extravaganza. Companies showed them off doing everything from folding clothes to serving as companions to handling assembly line work.\n\nWe should hear much more about what to expect from Nvidia at its GTC conference in March. It will likely have more to say about its AI-focused Rubin chip, and may also be ready to take the plunge into laptop chip territory."
