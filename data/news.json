Have such a huge advantage in that respect.”\n\n\n\nA third fan said: “French clubs are playing CL on easy mode. Imagine if PL clubs had this treatment. So unfair.”\n\nAnd a fourth angry fan fired back: “But when we say it’s a farmers league they cry lol.”\n\nThe setback is just the latest in Chelsea’s Champions League woes, after being handed a nightmare draw.\n\nIf they manage to beat defending champs PSG, then they will face one of Galatasaray or Liverpool in the quarter-finals.\n\nBut their prospects look even worse if they make it to the semis, with Liam Rosenior‘s men set to come up against one of Real Madrid, Manchester City, Atalanta or Bayern Munich."

There’s absolutely nothing into it. We didn’t even talk about it.”\n\nBut that is contrary to other claims that Arsenal are indeed in the mix to buy Tonali at the end of the season, especially with Newcastle unlikely to be back in the Champions League.\n\nSunSport understands Chelsea are also admirers of Tonali, who moved from AC Milan in 2023 for £55million.\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nManchester United and Manchester City have been credited with plotting a mega-bucks deal for him as well.\n\nJuventus are another linked club but the Daily Mail say a return to Serie A is not viewed by Tonali as attractive.\n\nTonali recently spoke about his love of manager Howe after scoring twice against Aston Villa in a crucial FA Cup win.\n\nHe said: “After the second goal, I came to Eddie because in the past few weeks, people spoke about our relationship.\n\n\n\n“But I work every day with the gaffer, the gaffer works every day with me, and our relationship is perfect.\n\n“It’s not broken and I think this is perfect for the team.\n\n“We try to do the best for this team, every game, because we play a lot of games.\n\n“Every three days, we play, and we have to be concentrated every time in the training ground to do the best for our team.”"

Chelsea were paired against PSG, Liverpool were handed Galatasaray, Arsenal will take on Bayer Leverkusen, Manchester City take on Real Madrid and Tottenham face Atletico Madrid.\n\nNewcastle, the sixth English team, will face Spanish giants Barcelona.\n\nWith the draw now clear, the road to the final is shaping up to be a real rollercoaster ride.\n\n\n\nBut while fans were focusing on the draw itself, it was the identity of the man behind it that really got people talking.\n\nIt wasn’t just any ex-footballer pulling the strings, it was Maniche, the same player who once bossed midfield for top clubs and made a name for himself on the international stage."

The new extended format, which was implemented two years ago, fails to prevent teams who faced off in the initial league phase meeting in the first knockout round.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat means City and Real will meet again just a little over two months since Guardiola's team were victorious at the Bernabeu.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd the former Barcelona head coach has suggested that the competition should tweak the rules to ensure teams who meet in the league phase are kept apart in the last 16.\n\nVAR gets EVEN MORE power as football lawmakers make controversial rule changes READ MORE :\n\n“Yes, it is a little bit weird [to face Real Madrid again],” he said. “Not many times does it happen that the last game of the group stage — Real Madrid v Benfica — is the first draw. It looks different. People will agree or disagree, but it is different.”\n\nWhen he was asked if UEFA should change the rules, Guardiola replied: “Why not? How many times have we played against ­Newcastle this season [the Premier League clubs meet in the FA Cup next weekend, having already contested a two-legged Carabao Cup semi- final]? Hopefully we can play against them in the [Champions League] final!\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Today is different. When I started, it was eight, nine, ten teams, they want to increase a lot with the schedule and calendar. It is a question of adapting. What can we do?”\n\nView 2 Images Manchester City beat Real Madrid at the Bernabeu back in December (Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe teams still alive and kicking in the tournament now know their prospective routes to the final, which will be held at the end of May in Budapest.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut Guardiola refuted claims that Manchester City are on the more challenging side of the draw, saying: “[It] would be so disrespectful [to], for example, Newcastle, Barcelona, top teams, Atletico Madrid or Spurs. So I’m not a fan of that [saying it’s the easier half of the draw].\n\n“The Champions League is so ­difficult. I’m not saying Madrid is not difficult, everybody knows it, but the rest of the teams that you play, I don’t know, you can name me any team, all of them, they have the 'trick'. If you want to go through in this competition right now, you have to win against the best teams, otherwise you don’t deserve it.”\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The International Football Association Board (IFAB) have gone all-in on the video assistant referee, despite continued flashpoints and complaints.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUsing VAR to check corners will be an option for competitions from this summer, while the core VAR protocol has now been widened to cover second yellow cards and cards awarded to the wrong team.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIFAB have also approved a package of measures to counter tactics designed to disrupt the tempo of matches which come into effect this summer. The successful introduction of the eight-second rule for goalkeepers has encouraged IFAB to go further on efforts to stop players slowing the game.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nReferees will be given the power to start a five-second countdown if they feel players are taking too long over throw-ins and dead-ball goal kicks, and substitutions must be completed in no more than 10 seconds, otherwise the substitute must stay off for at least one minute.\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\nThe IFAB also decided at its annual general meeting in Wales on Saturday to enforce a period of at least one minute off the field for any player whose injury forces a stoppage in play.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Premier League has been trialling a 30-second period, but some within the IFAB did not feel this was long enough to serve as a deterrent. Other competitions had tested longer periods, with two minutes trialled at last year’s Arab Cup.\n\nThe aim with all the measures set to be adopted is to maintain the tempo of the game but also to help reduce time to be added on for stoppages, which is a problem from a player welfare perspective, for supporters and for broadcasters’ schedules.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

IFAB also agreed trials be conducted to further assess goalkeeper tactical injury delays and to propose options to deter this behaviour.\n\nLawmakers are adamant VAR checks on corners must not delay the kick being taken and will only be used to spot obvious errors. Corner-kick checks will be an option, rather than a mandatory part of the VAR protocol.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nVARs will also only check incorrectly-awarded second yellow cards. They will not advise referees to issue a second yellow card where one was not shown on the field.\n\nThe IFAB will also hold consultations to develop measures where players leave the field of play as an act of protest against a referee’s decision or team officials instigating such action and where players cover their mouth when confronting opponents during matches.\n\nThe Africa Cup of Nations final was delayed by a walk-off by Senegal, while Benfica midfielder Gianluca Prestianni is alleged to have racially abused Real Madrid winger Vinicius Junior during a Champions League match last week while his mouth was covered by his shirt. UEFA is investigating the incident and Prestianni denies racially abusing Vinicius.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The 51-year-old, who shone in a memorable 6-2 Celtic victory over Rangers in 2000, encountered financial woes after, as he put it, placing too much faith in financial advisers.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Dutch winger, whose career also included stints at English clubs like Fulham and Ipswich Town, now leads a humble life after hopes for a retirement nest egg went up in smoke. He even had a brush with fame during his footballing days, making a cameo appearance in one of Hollywood star Brad Pitt's films, but times have certainly changed.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPetta didn't disclose the exact sum he lost to fraudsters. However, in 2023 he revealed to Dutch publication Algemeen Dagblad that it was 'a lot'.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I thought: when I'm done, I'll have a nice nest egg.

He was based in the UK when he set out to rebuild his life working as a delivery driver for DPD after being forced to find new sources of income after bankruptcy.\n\nHe claims to have earned approximately £200 daily in the delivery role, considerably less than a footballer's salary, also working as a DJ and running a pub during recent years.

Sections of the Brad Pitt film were shot in Glasgow and sharp-eyed audiences spotted him on screen - though, as he remembers, it lasted just 30 seconds and was never likely to bring about a career as an actor.\n\nView 2 Images Bobby Petta spent several years at Celtic (Image: YouTube/SNN Sports)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

The Red Devils have already been linked with a host of potential candidates who could take the job at Old Trafford on a permanent basis.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMichael Carrick was named as United head coach on an interim basis until the end of the season last month, and has enjoyed an impressive spell in charge so far, going unbeaten while winning five of his six matches in the dugout.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnrique, current manager of Paris Saint-Germain, has been linked with potentially taking charge of United in the summer, with several other names also mentioned as potential options.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA report on Catalunya Radio has claimed, though, that Barcelona could consider Enrique as an option to be their next manager.

Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCurrent Barca president Joan Laporta is said to prefer keeping Flick as the current manager, but that could change if a new president is elected.\n\nThis could be a potential blow for United if the rumours are true that Enrique is a potential option to get the job at Old Trafford on a permanent basis.\n\nCarrick could also be a candidate to get the job full-time if he continues his impressive run of form until the end of the season, as well as clinch qualification for the Champions League.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe possibility of United appointing Enrique has already been debated, with former Chelsea coach Jody Morris believing that keeping Carrick would be a better choice.\n\nView 2 Images Luis Enrique won the Champions League last season with PSG (Image: Getty)\n\n\"Carrick has been unbelievable,\" Morris stated on the latest episode of In The Mixer earlier this week. \"I was moaning about Ruben Amorim.

            "content": "VAR's powers have been extended by football's lawmakers.\n\nUsing VAR to check corners will be an option for competitions from this summer, while the core VAR protocol has now been widened to cover second yellow cards.\n\nThe International Football Association Board (IFAB), which sets the laws of football, also approved a package of measures to counter tactics designed to disrupt the tempo of matches, which come into effect this summer.\n\nThe successful introduction of the eight-second rule for goalkeepers has encouraged IFAB to go further on efforts to stop players slowing the game.\n\nReferees will be given the power to start a five-second countdown if they feel players are taking too long over throw-ins and dead-ball goal kicks, and substitutions must be completed in no more than 10 seconds, otherwise the substitute must stay off for at least one minute.\n\nThe IFAB also decided at its annual general meeting in Wales on Saturday to enforce a period of at least one minute off the field for any player whose injury forces a stoppage in play.\n\nThe Premier League has been trialling a 30-second period, but some within the IFAB did not feel this was long enough to serve as a deterrent. Other competitions had tested longer periods, with two minutes trialled at last year's Arab Cup.\n\nThe aim with all the measures set to be adopted is to maintain the tempo of the game but also to help reduce time to be added on for stoppages, which is a problem from a player welfare perspective, for supporters and for broadcasters' schedules.\n\nChanges agreed on Saturday will officially become part of the laws of the game from July 1 but will be adopted at this summer's World Cup which kicks off on June 11.\n\nThe IFAB also agreed trials be conducted to further assess goalkeeper tactical injury delays and to propose options to deter this behaviour.\n\nLawmakers are adamant VAR checks on corners must not delay the kick being taken and will only be used to spot obvious errors. Corner-kick checks will be an option, rather than a mandatory part of the VAR protocol.\n\nVARs will also only check incorrectly-awarded second yellow cards. They will not advise referees to issue a second yellow card where one was not shown on the field.\n\nThe IFAB will also hold consultations to develop measures where players leave the field of play as an act of protest against a referee's decision or team officials instigating such action and where players cover their mouth when confronting opponents during matches.\n\nThe Africa Cup of Nations final was delayed by a walk-off by Senegal, while Benfica midfielder Gianluca Prestianni is alleged to have racially abused Real Madrid winger Vinicius Junior during a Champions League match last week while his mouth was covered by his shirt.\n\nUEFA is investigating the incident and Prestianni denies racially abusing Vinicius."

            "content": "\"Watch yourself now. Enjoy it but you're going to get a lot of media attention; everyone's going to know you. You've gone from no one knowing who you are to a potential superstar...\"\n\nThose were the words Michael Carrick gave Marcus Rashford 10 years ago after his dream start to life at Manchester United.\n\nIn two matches three days apart, a slight, fresh-faced 18-year-old from Wythenshawe saw his life change forever, with four goals that propelled a career into the blinding glare of hopeful superstardom.\n\nThere are fairytales and then there's the story of Rashford's debut. Everything fell into place, the sliding doors moved seamlessly to allow for a career worth over 400 senior United appearances, 68 England caps, along with more than 150 goals for both club and country.\n\nStarting with that Europa League night against Midtjylland before a Premier League classic against Arsenal, Rashford not only lived the dream but became the dream.\n\nRooney out, Martial injured... What next?\n\nThe lore is well-worn. United were in the midst of an injury crisis in forward areas ahead of a crunch round of 32 tie against Midtjylland.\n\nHaving been embarrassed in Denmark, United had to save face at Old Trafford but captain Wayne Rooney was out with an injury. Anthony Martial was next to fall injured, this time minutes before kick off. Then-boss Louis van Gaal had a decision to make with little time to think - but for the Dutch manager it wasn't a difficult one.\n\nImage: Frans Hoek alongside Rashford after his debut against Midtjylland\n\n\"We came back into the locker room, and the assistants were coming up with all kinds of solutions, except for Marcus,\" Frans Hoek, a key part of Van Gaal's coaching staff at the time, reveals to Sky Sports.\n\n\"They were saying, 'Okay, if we do this, then this player can be there and blah blah blah.' The normal discussions that you have when something happens like that.\n\n\"And then, when everybody had said what they had to say, Louis said, 'We don't change anything. Marcus goes in. Marcus deserves it. Marcus is doing a good job. He is improving. He is young and I believe in that.' That was the moment.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Louis van Gaal says Marcus Rashford produced 'a great performance' after scoring twice on his Manchester United debut against FC Midtjylland\n\nVan Gaal was resting his hopes on someone whose only experience in the first team up to that point was a bench appearance at Watford a few months prior.\n\n\"All credit to Louis because he was never afraid to put young players in,\" Hoek adds.\n\n\"He did the same at Ajax, at Barcelona, at Bayern Munich and with the national team. For him, if they are good enough, then they are old enough. It is simple.\n\n\"And he definitely was not afraid to replace people who had certain reputations if he felt it was the best for the team.\n\n\"A coach like Louis does not get influenced. He just has his eyes and his way of thinking. He put in Andres Iniesta, he put in Xavi. He put in so many of them.\n\n\"If you are objective as a coach and not influenced by everything that happens around football, I think you make these kinds of decisions faster.\"\n\n'In the academy, Rashford could do anything he wanted with a football'\n\nFrom the outside, it was a surprise. 'Who on earth is this kid?' Those in the stands uttered amid the late change. But for those closer to Rashford, through his time in the academy, could tell he had been marked early on to impact the first team.\n\nImage: James Weir made his Manchester United debut against Arsenal after Rashford's Premier League debut double\n\n\"He was the guy!\" James Weir, who played with Rashford in the United Academy.\n\n\"He was two years younger and I knew his name, whereas I couldn't name any other person in his age group.\n\n\"I think they can tell technically, and they know when they're going to fill out. He had two older brothers who were quite big as well and tall. So, they probably expected him to grow and fill into his body.\n\n\"But technically, he was pretty superior. The first time I played with him was probably in one of the reserve games, like under-21s or 23s and he was, jumping ahead of people a couple of years above him, just because he was that good.\n\n\"He was always. I remember, even in digs, we'd be playing football with a balloon, and he'd be doing, around the worlds. It's actually harder to do it with a balloon than it is with a normal football.\n\n\"He could do anything he wanted with a football, even doing keepy-ups with a tennis ball. Most people are lucky to do four or five; he's consistently doing it.\"\n\nRecollections of Rashford's first training session with the first team have lived with former team-mate and current Melbourne Victory midfielder, Juan Mata for the past decade.\n\nImage: Rashford in training alongside Juan Mata\n\n\"I have a vivid memory of that day, he was playing on the right wing,\" Mata says.\n\n\"He was quite thin and quick. He was quite shy off the pitch but he was brave on the pitch, and that was nice to see. You could see he was already taking people one against one, going behind. Very quick, very speedy.\n\n\"At the end of the session, I was talking with Ander Herrera and he was telling me, 'did you see this kid? I think he's going to be a great player'.\n\n\"Ander really saw it since the beginning and I remember he told me that day, he's going to bring us a lot and I said, 'Well, wait, it's too early, he only trained with us once'... Ander was not wrong.\"\n\nImage: Man Utd's starting lineup on Rashford's debut\n\nMata set up Rashford's first-ever professional goal, opening the floodgates.\n\n\"You could see how happy he was, his family in the stands, it meant a lot for him,\" Mata recalls.\n\n\"So it was the start of something really nice for him and a very nice start to a good week. I still remember celebrating with him and seeing how this kid from Manchester was fulfilling his dream and it was very nice to see how happy he was and how much he deserved it.\"\n\nThe Arsenal game that followed United's 5-1 win over Midtjylland and it was a special day for the United Academy.\n\nAlongside Rashford's Premier League debut, Timothy Fosu-Mensah earned his first stripes and so did Weir as United beat the Gunners 3-2 at Old Trafford.\n\nWeir recalls LVG dive - 'I thought Wenger had hit him!' Man Utd's win over Arsenal at Old Trafford is also remembered for a bizarre moment from Louis van Gaal on the touchline. The Dutch coach mimicked what he thought was a dive from Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez after a challenge from Herrera. Weir watched on while warming up: \"I just saw all the fans do something, like all this commotion, and then I saw LVG on the floor, so I honestly thought Wenger had hit him. I thought Wenger had dropped him.\"\n\nImage: Louis van Gaal mimics Alexis Sanchez from the touchline\n\nReplacing Herrera in injury time meant that Weir watched from the dugout as Rashford continued to do the remarkable, playing a part in all three goals.\n\n\"I remember when he banged that first goal in, like, you're not surprised, because he has that, you've seen it in training, you've seen it in the academy, you've seen it in the reserves, he's got the quality. I've seen it in the back garden!\n\n\"I remember him being buzzing and obviously, everyone around the club was buzzing for him, because that's what it's about, getting youth team players into the first team.\"\n\n'He was a kid and a man who gave everything to Man Utd' - Mata\n\nRashford didn't slow down from then on. He went on to play an instrumental role as United won the FA Cup that season.\n\nEngland and Roy Hodgson couldn't ignore the prodigy either, as his first call-up and debut goal came three months later. Rashford then earned a spot in the Three Lions squad for the 2016 Euros, where he would make two appearances.\n\nImage: Rashford made his England debut in May 2016\n\nNow, after a difficult spell, before back-to-back loans at Aston Villa and now at Barcelona, Rashford's time at Old Trafford looks to be moving towards a permanent end, with a divorce seemingly the best option for both parties. But there's a consensus that he wrote a beautiful story at United.\n\n\"It's not easy to handle with all the expectations and the pressure at the club like Man Utd but I think people will realise that he was a kid and he was a man who gave everything for the club he supported since he was a kid,\" Mata says.\n\n\"You can see photos of him when he was almost a baby with a Man Utd shirt on. So it meant a lot for him to play for Man Utd. You could see that. I think he gave great moments and great memories for many fans. Of course, there were also some challenging times but I think they made him more mature and a stronger man.\n\n\"Nobody has an easy career. It doesn't matter how successful you have been. There are always challenges and he had that at the club. But he's now in a new chapter. He went to Barcelona, which is one of the best teams in the world and he's performing there. He's showing his level. I'm very happy for him that he's able to try and prove his level in different countries.\"\n\nImage: Rashford smiles during a Barcelona training session at the Nou Camp\n\nHoek, who also has a storied coaching history with Barcelona, shares Mata's sentiment. Rashford has scored 10 goals and assisted 13 in 34 games at Barcelona.\n\n\"Rashford was an easy guy to work with,\" Hoek says.\n\n\"Hardworking and not complaining. Of course, when they start their career, it is different but I have followed his career from United to Barcelona and he is doing some great things there.\n\n\"I think that he has lived up to the expectations that were there at Barcelona. I think it is a fantastic experience for him in that league, away from United, away from the Premier League. I think it has only been very positive for him.\"\n\nImage: Rashford has scored 10 goals and assisted 13 in 34 games at Barcelona\n\nWeir, though, still has hopes that the Rashford story at United has not yet seen its conclusion.\n\n\"I'd love him to win LaLiga this year, the Champions League,\" Weir says\n\n\"Go and do that, and then he's done it. But I'd love him to come back to United.\n\n\"I think he'd look back in when he's 40 and think, I left the chapter of my career there. He is some player. Hopefully, he gets to the World Cup and does well there. Then if United do get Champions League, it's made for him.\n\n\"I think it depends a lot on the manager who comes in at United, but obviously, the club is growing now, for sure, and he's a fantastic player, so he'd definitely add something to that Man United squad.\"\n\nThe beginning was picture-book, a true video-game-like storyline to becoming a superstar. The future of Rashford's career may be uncertain but there will be no forgetting the fresh-faced 18-year-old from Wythenshawe who lived and became the dream."

Senesi goes to ground holding his jaw and replays show he shipped an accidental elbow from Roefs as he tried to get off his line to reach the ball.

Christie slides in to foul him and is booked. Share\n\n10m ago 09.16 EST 88 min: There’s a bit of a scramble in the Sunderland box as Toth picks out Unal, who jinks this way and that but is unable to get a shot away from 10 yards out. That’s some serious last-ditch defending from Sunderland. Share\n\n12m ago 09.15 EST 87 min: Oh dear. Enzo Le Fee and Nilson Angulo try one from off the training ground that probably should have stayed there for another couple of weeks at least. Another promising dead ball situation goes to waste for Sunderland. Share\n\n13m ago 09.14 EST 86 min: Toth is immediately booked for hauling back Geertruida. Sunderland have a free-kick about 35 yards from the Bournemouth goal.

Sunderland substitution: Nilson Angulo comes on for Granit Xhaka, who doesn’t want to leave the pitch but is nursing a sore ankle following that challenge from Tyler Adams.

It was a wonderful assist. Share\n\n32m ago 08.54 EST The goal stands!!!

The American was a red card waiting to happen. Share\n\n38m ago 08.49 EST 60 min: VAR seem to have agreed that while Adams’ challenge was reckless, it was mitigated by the shove he got from Diarra. That seems fair enough although Xhaka begged to differ with the referee once he’d returned to his feet. Share\n\n40m ago 08.47 EST 58 min: Xhaka goes down under a scything challenge from Tyler Adams and repeatedly slaps the turf in pain. Adams is claiming he got a shove in the back from Diarra, which increased the velocity of his challenge. He gets booked and I think he’s lucky not to get a red. That was a nasty challenge and he caught Xhaka’s ankle.

The Senegal international finds himself one on one with Petrovic and forces the Bournemouth goalkeeper into a good save. He should have scored! Share\n\n52m ago 08.34 EST 47 min: Chemsdine Talbi curls a cross into the Bournemouth penalty from the left but his delivery is far too close to Petrovic, who gathers with a minimum of fuss. Share\n\n54m ago 08.33 EST Second half: Bournemouth 0-1 Sunderland 46 min: Play resumes and Bournemouth have made a change, bringing on Evanilson for David Brooks. Share\n\n1h ago 08.21 EST Half-time: Bournemouth 0-1 Sunderland A fairly even match reaches half-time with Sunderland in front courtesy of an Eliezer Mayenda tap-in after excellent work from Dan Ballard and Habib Diarra. Both sides have had decent penalty appeals turned down, with the shout going against Sunderland for a blatant Jimenez shove on Le Fee being the more egregious.

He drills in a low cross from the byline but Kroupi is unable to steer the ball on target from a very tight angle. It’s half-time. Share\n\n1h ago 08.16 EST 45 min: Jimenez sprays the ball wide for Rayan and Bournemouth win a corner. Brooks’ inswinger from the left is headed back towards him by a Sunderland defender. Share\n\n1h ago 08.15 EST 43 min: Bournemouth win a free-kick wide on the left. Truffart curls the ball towards Rayan, who wins the header and sends the ball acrossd the face of goal. It only meets the head of Mayenda and Roefs tidies up. Share\n\n1h ago 08.12 EST 41 min: Enzo Le Fee curls a corner towards the near post, where Alex Scott hoofs it clear. It would be fair to say that Sunderland are not making the most of their set-piece opportunities so far this afternoon. Share\n\n1h ago 08.10 EST 39 min: David Brooks curls a cross from the left into the Sunderland penalty area but is unable to pick out Eli Kroupi, who is beaten by the bounce of the ball at the far post.

I’ve seen them given but they usually aren’t. Share\n\n1h ago 08.07 EST 35 min: Marcus Tavernier curls a free-kick from just outside the penalty area around the outside of the defensive wall and on target. Roefs punches it away. Noah Sadiki was booked for kicking the ball away after Geertruida had fouled Tyler Adams to concede the free-kick. Share\n\n1h ago 08.05 EST 32 min: With the ball at his feet way outside his penalty area, Roefs is pressed hard by Kroupi and both men go to ground. Bournemouth’s players appeal somewhat optimistically for a red card, Sunderland get a free-kick. Share\n\n1h ago 08.01 EST 31 min: Alex Scott pulls a low shot from a just outside the Sunderland penalty area a couple of feet wide of the upright. It was a fairly weak effort, which I think Roefs would have dealt with. Share\n\n1h ago 08.00 EST 29 min: Had Scott managed to beat Roefs with that effort, Bournemouth’s equaliser would have been a near replica of Sunderland’s opener. Share"

            "content": "Arsenal had to expect the jibes from Tottenham and they were not disappointed. Just before kick-off in last Sunday’s north London derby, the Spurs support in the South Stand of their stadium spelled out a giant message in mosaic form. “North Ldn since 1882,” it read.\n\nA clear dig, then, at Arsenal’s south of the river history from the Woolwich days and, as mentioned, very much a part of a rivalry where goading and baiting go hand in hand with the loathing. Arsenal had been similarly provocative before the derby against Spurs at the Emirates Stadium last November, lighting the pre-match scene with a tifo featuring images of various club greats. The most prominent at the top of it? Sol Campbell, of course.\n\nWhat was more surprising – and certainly led to raised eyebrows at Arsenal – was Wolves’ now infamous TikTok post on the Thursday before last. The 80-second clip, uploaded after the 2-2 draw between the clubs the previous night, was a savage take on Arsenal’s “game management”. Or, to put it another way, and as Wolves surely intended, their dark arts and shithousery.\n\nThe social media team at Wolves showed how Gabriel Martinelli taunted the home crowd by flashing up the scoreline on his fingers as Arsenal led 2-1. They highlighted the delay in Arsenal taking a corner as they continued to lead. They mocked Gabriel Magalhães for going down after an apparent head clash before he got back up and carried on.\n\nThere was indignation from the in-house commentators when Leandro Trossard also went to ground after an aerial clash in the 90th minute. In the background, it was easy to make out the chant from the Wolves fans: “Same old Arsenal, always cheating.” There was laughter and the corresponding emojis on the clip when Wolves equalised at the bitter end.\n\nThere was more from elsewhere later in the day. At tea time, Manchester City’s X account piped up with a three-year-old clip of their team playing keep-ball by the corner flag in the dying minutes of a 2-0 home victory over Newcastle. “Seeing out the win,” read the text with a tick emoji above footage of Erling Haaland and Jack Grealish, well, managing the game to a successful conclusion. It was a mickey-take with an obvious target.\n\nThis is where Arsenal find themselves as they prepare for Sunday’s home game against Chelsea – the latest staging post in their draining push for the Premier League title. Their rivals, big and small, are lining up the pot shots, eager to have fun at their expense, to prey on their sensitivities. To drive a particular narrative and make Arsenal prisoners of it.\n\nThe Wolves TikTok clip overlooked a major detail when it came to Trossard. On as a 73rd-minute substitute, the winger was cleaned out by a shoulder barge from Santiago Bueno, who was on a yellow card. Trossard had eyes only for the high ball; the Wolves defender looked directly at him and left a calling card on his opponent’s jaw. A dazed Trossard was forced off after treatment, Arsenal relieved that he avoided injury, and how do you think the club’s doctors felt about essentially being accused of complicity in a plot to run down the clock?\n\nNobody thought about that. They were too busy enjoying the clip, which went viral for the reason that these things always do. It struck a chord. It fed a perception with which opposing fans are seemingly on board. Arsenal as the roughhouse guys – and not only when they are loading men into the six-yard box on corners. The ones that will do whatever it takes to win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Leandro Trossard’s injury at Wolves seemed to invoke opprobrium from the home side. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nArsenal were much better than Spurs. They deserved to beat them, which they did; to clear their heads after the trauma of Wolves. As an aside, it was only this Spurs team. Chelsea ought to be a tougher prospect. Yet Arsenal did get away with one in the 53rd minute as they led 2-1. Would it have been different if Randal Kolo Muani had not been penalised for the slightest of pushes into Gabriel’s back before he shot past David Raya? At the very least, Arsenal would have felt their anxiety levels rise.\n\nGabriel drew the contact to the referee’s attention in theatrical fashion, as he had done at Newcastle last September in a similar situation against Nick Woltemade. That day, the referee said no foul and Woltemade scored. This time, Gabriel got the decision.\n\nWhat did Gabriel do after the game? Did he a) keep his head down and quietly count his blessings? Or b) post a picture to social media of him holding a hand of cards with the four of hearts visible, signifying his team’s four goals? He went for the latter, even tagging the Spurs forward Richarlison. Cue a host of diving memes in the responses. Was goading really the right option given the climate around the club? On the other hand, you have to admire Gabriel’s chutzpah.\n\nMikel Arteta’s response to what we are obliged to call the “outside noise” has been to narrow the focus; to dial up the intensity while also talking up his players and their mindset. The manager has his eyes on the prize and there are a number of points that need to be made, beginning with the feeling towards him and his side in coaching circles.\n\nTowards the end of January, Pep Guardiola described Arsenal as the “best team in the world” and it did not sound like just mind games from the City manager. The Wolves head coach, Rob Edwards, messaged Arteta after last week’s game to say that Arsenal were the best side in the league and there have been others in their positions who have privately expressed the highest admiration for what Arteta is doing. Namely, how Arsenal press, massing men around the ball, cutting off the passing lanes, forcing turnovers. How they dominate in possession, playing on the front foot, creating overloads, moving it quickly. The watchwords are remorselessness and control.\n\nAccording to Opta, Arsenal have had seven yellow cards for time-wasting in the league this season – the same number as Chelsea and behind only Bournemouth and Fulham, who each have eight. They are the seventh-worst offenders for the average time of delays for restarts, taking in set pieces and goal-kicks. They sit behind Sunderland, Brentford, Crystal Palace, Newcastle, Leeds and Burnley on the list in that order.\n\nArteta and his players remain at the centre of a storm, buffeted by ill winds, Chelsea ready to bring the latest of them. If Arsenal hold their nerve, they will have done it the hard way."

            "content": "“I just want to have my name out there to the point where when someone hears it they know instantly who is being talked about,” says the Chelsea full-back Chloe Sarwie. “I want to be that player who can amaze people constantly and that is up there as one of the best.”\n\nYou could be forgiven for viewing this level of confidence as arrogant, but you would be wrong. The talented 17-year-old defender comes across as grounded, intelligent, hard-working and humble, but her edge is a steely belief in her football.\n\nSarwie is speaking to the Guardian shortly before signing her first professional contract, four months after her debut in the 1-1 draw with Twente in the Champions League and three months after her first call-up to the England Under-23s.\n\nSarwie is back with the under‑23s for next month’s games against France and the Netherlands, one of two 17-year-olds considered good enough to compete alongside those vying for a chance in the senior side (the other is Erica Meg Parkinson, who plays her club football in Portugal). Last summer, at 16, she was in the squad that competed at the Under-19 Euros in Poland. “I was taken aback and I didn’t really have any expectations so it was incredible,” she says.\n\n“It’s honestly a really intense environment and every training session everyone just wants to one-up each other. It gets really competitive and just being around that wanting-to-win group was incredible.”\n\nHer Chelsea debut in October, when still 16, came as a surprise. “As soon as I got the nod from Sonia [Bompastor] that I’d be coming on for Sandy [Baltimore] and making my debut, I was just down on the sideline, shocked but pumped and ready to get on the pitch,” says Sarwie, who entered the fray against Twente in the 73rd minute.\n\nShe impressed instantly, playing with an admirable fearlessness. “Honestly, when I stepped on that pitch, I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know how to play, but I was just trying to play my part for the team, fit in and see what I could do. Towards the end of the game, I was being myself a bit more and the more playing time I’m getting, the more I’m able to express myself, but my full self hasn’t come out yet.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Chloe Sarwie (right) made her Chelsea debut in the Champions League draw with Twente last October. Photograph: Chris Lee/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\nChelsea are well equipped at right-back, with two of the world’s best in Lucy Bronze and Ellie Carpenter at their disposal, but at left-back there is a hole. With Baltimore performing well in the position but naturally a more attacking player and Niamh Charles out with an ankle injury, there have been some opportunities for Sarwie, against Crystal Palace in the FA Cup and West Ham and Tottenham in the Women’s Super League.\n\nShould her development continue at its accelerated pace there is also the chance to stake a claim in the senior England squad that has had question marks at left‑back under Sarina Wiegman. London City Lionesses’ Poppy Pattinson is the latest to receive a call-up with an eye on finding a solution to the conundrum.\n\nSarwie was introduced to the Chelsea senior side in pre-season. It was “quite exciting but also quite nerve-racking”, though training and playing with the first team has been hugely beneficial. “It’s a great challenge and I love being challenged and going up against these players, seeing how their level compares to mine and how I can get to that level,” says Sarwie.\n\n“Obviously, Lucy’s at England as well and being able to have that connection is great, even though I’m in one of the lower age groups because, ultimately, I’m learning how I can then progress to that next step and be part of the senior squad. That’s where she can give me tips and show what it takes.”\n\nSarwie began playing football in the park on her own, light on her feet thanks to ballet from the ages of two until eight. “I used to turn up to ballet with muddy tights after playing football and rolling around in the mud for a good hour or two. But ballet had a big impact on my journey as a football player as my dribbling playing style kind of links back to it. Ballet made me light on my feet. I also had to adapt from a ballet mindset, from a solo stage, to a football mindset and a team performance stage.”\n\nIt was in the park where coaches would approach her and tell her she should be playing for a club and eventually she thought: “Why not?” After a season at Millwall, she had trials at Arsenal and Chelsea and had offers from both. “I had to pick Chelsea because it was closer,” she says. “I let my family down on that one because they’re all Arsenal supporters, but oh well.”\n\nShe juggles playing and training with studying for her BTec in engineering and her mum, Jean, who is a teacher at her school, is the force that has enabled her to pursue football. She takes her laptop everywhere, to catch up with coursework, with one day a week spent in the classroom.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie takes a selfie with fans after featuring in the FA Cup against Crystal Palace. Photograph: Sport Press Photo/Alamy\n\nSarwie is having to contend with an influx of information. “It’s mad trying to switch the brain from studying engineering to football and back,” she says. “I’m still taking in everything in relation to the first team. I have all that information coming at me and then I have to go home, switch off and then do my work and it’s all a bit chaotic.”\n\nOn the pitch, there is also a balance to be struck between what is being asked of her and instinct. “Sometimes on the pitch I can be quite hesitant because I’m trying to think about what I should do at that moment instead of what I want to do, because that’s sometimes two different things. The coach wants me to do something but I want to do something else in the moment and it’s about quickly processing which one I should do.\n\n“Every day I’m getting new information coming in and I’m just trying to soak that up but trying to show myself on the pitch and putting those words into actions on the pitch can be quite difficult and it’s going to be like that for a while because of my age.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie practised ballet until the age of eight. ‘It made me light on my feet,’ she says. Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\n“Once I’m on the pitch I just want to be my most relaxed self. Breathing techniques on the pitch really help me stay calm and I’ve been told I look arrogant doing this, but chewing gum on the pitch makes me relax as well.\n\n“I want to be that person that looks in place and calm with the rest of the team, that calms that team down. I don’t want to be nervous when I get the ball, or for them to be nervous when I get the ball, I want to get the ball and to express myself as much as possible with it.”"

            "content": "There’s a good advert right now on the rolling TV sports news channels. It starts with a rush of beeps and plinks and flashing symbols, generating instantly the flat, glazed, hungry quality of the online casino. A well-groomed middle-aged woman is shown sitting in an armchair in a suburban living room. It’s a jarring tonal shift, but we’re still in that same space, betting graphics dancing around her head.\n\nThe middle-aged woman turns to the camera and says: “The games are all different … It never gets boring,” eyes gleaming strangely, hands gripping the struts of her chair. Here is a person who is not just pleased, but uncontrollably energised by the prospect of WowBet.com’s 10bn mildly divergent AI-generated gambling patterns. At this point the words “Sandra Frottwangle, funeral director” appear on the screen.\n\nBy now it’s just an overload of feelings. The first thought is about transgression. Sandra Frottwangle’s job is to curate death. She spends her days managing the nobility of human flesh. She stands at the far edge of existence creating ritual and comfort, a timeless figure, the eternal footman, the director of last things. But she also gets bored easily and prefers stuff with flashing lights.\n\nIs this OK? Would you want Sandra Frottwangle to direct your funeral? Death is repetitive. Mortality is tedious. What if she decides this is all really dull and needs more beeping noises, less weeping and organ music? The ferryman is at the door. He’s unsheathing his scythe. He’s also got 400 free online spins at GambleDick.com.\n\nThe second thought is a rush of tenderness. Yes, Sandra Frottwangle’s life is spent in that liminal space. She stares into the void. She sees the weakness of the flesh, fish-grey monkey-brown. But even here she is still hungry for life, still craving that wild human energy. Eyes gleaming like opals, casino chips circling her head, she looks like one of those renaissance friezes expressing the glory and brevity of human life, the globe, the skull, the bowl of rotting fruit.\n\nOnly now we’re strapped into a velour armchair, drooling down our necks, being force-fed endless brain-shredding content and just wanting to feel something. I … love her. I love Sandra Frottwangle (funeral director). And she’s right. All the games are the same. But we still want the games.\n\nEither all of that stuff, or the people who make daytime TV adverts are bored twentysomething creatives who just thought it would be funny to put the words “funeral director” over shots of an actor pretending to be really into gambling websites. Probably it’s one or the other.\n\nAnd yes, this is supposed to be about the Scottish Premiership title race, which enters its spring ignition phase this weekend, and which is now arguably the most interesting title race in Europe.\n\nEither way Sunday’s Old Firm derby at Ibrox is a genuinely rare thing. For once this is not a title decider. It could be a title eliminator. It could be a step towards neither of Celtic or Rangers winning the league for the first time in 41 years. A draw in Glasgow could leave Hearts six points clear at the top. But by now it is a startling transformation whatever the outcome.\n\nHearts finished 40 points behind Celtic last year. The great clanking hand of Tony Bloom and his big data hive-brain robots has been on site for only eight months. The word “disruption” is usually shorthand for tech bro types in $4,000 Japanese trainers working out new ways to fire people. This is actual, good disruption. A three-way title race isn’t just deeply un-Scotland, it’s deeply un-anywhere these days.\n\nIn the major European leagues only Greece, Denmark and Poland have something this close. The trend is towards stratification, dead air after Christmas, a single basking giant or a two-way chase energetically spun by the broadcasters. Money has made this happen. The Premier League in particular has harvested talent, turning previously robust leagues into clearing houses, exit lounges to the life-altering four-year deal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Hearts have sustained a title challenge and it has provided a welcome alternative to the traditional dominance of Celtic and Rangers. Photograph: Steve Welsh/PA\n\nThis is perhaps partly the case in Scotland. But there is also a sense of useful incompetence in play, accidental competitiveness. The Glasgow clubs have spent decades trying to sustain a place in the roided-up Euro elite, taking it in turns to fall over their feet. Now we have this, a perfect storm of super-smart newcomer and a pair of sleepwalking giants.\n\nThere are other places for proper chapter and verse on whether Hearts can sustain this. The key aspect at this stage is that this title race has taken on a sense of outside life. My own kids follow every Hearts game with a rare sense of urgency, despite being fully TikTok-brained, zombified by reel culture.\n\nIt is, of course, only one season. It could all fall away quite rapidly. But there is also a lesson here, perhaps even a control experiment. Because big football is often boring now. The direction of travel is fewer meaningful matches, a cartel of mega-clubs resting on the ropes, a Champions League group stage that feels like an autumn exhibition tour.\n\nThe idea is out there that younger people will be happy with this, will feast instead on clips, screengrabs, parasocial celebrity worship; that young people are essentially industrialised idiots who have for the first time in all human existence lost the craving for actual narrative.\n\nThe reality is this culture creates a yearning for something else. Marketing people will assume hate clicks, or boredom clicks, or any kind of clicks represent actual value and desire. But young people also like real things.\n\nFinding interest in a competitive football league is a bit like getting into vinyl, or books made from paper, or the revelation, usually via an American man on YouTube who looks as if he keeps a collection of children’s dolls in a shed, that food can actually be made from ingredients.\n\nPerhaps Scottish football has fallen into a less globalist version of how to thrive. Tend to the soil. Build it and they will come. The league has plenty that can be weaponised: deep history, heritage value, the same authenticity that made it so moreish back in the days when Old Firm games were basically catharsis, insanity, people at the edge of their own emotions colliding for 90 minutes.\n\nWhy do sporting leagues roll over so willingly? Why do they turn themselves inside out, shred the basis of their own value – English cricket: we see you – in order to chase those precarious streams of macro-money? What if you just stopped trying to expand outward in every direction? What if the guiding principle is: what will make the thing we have right here in front of us better? Why not go hyper-local?\n\nThere is an argument that Hearts winning would be better for Rangers and Celtic. It energises the league, supercharges the brand, speaks to the desire for sporting tension among those bored by the drift of big football.\n\nWe have replaced a great deal that was valuable with generalised digital noise. In a sense we are all strapped into our armchairs now, craving a place where the games are different, anything with heart and life to distract us from the grey, out there staring into the void with Sandra Frottwangle eyes."

            "content": "1. Title run-in all about ‘little details’ Pep Guardiola has told his Manchester City players their pursuit of honours in the final three months of the season will depend on their “brains and minds”. City, who remain in contention for four trophies, meet title rivals Arsenal in the Carabao Cup final and Newcastle in the fifth-round of the FA Cup next month, as well as Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League. In the Premier League, they are five points behind Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal with a game in hand. City have had no midweek games for two weeks and – after the visit to Leeds on Saturday – Guardiola has given his players Sunday to Tuesday off as he believes the challenge in the defining part of the campaign is more mental than technical. Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more “There are still things that we should train and practise more, but I prioritised rest,” Guardiola said. “With three months left, there are many things that the team have improved in and still some things that the team has to improve, but now it is the little details. “Now it is how it is in your brains and your minds that will make the difference. Maybe for the new players it is new, but we have talked a lot in many meetings for many years that, when you arrive in the last three months, competing in all competitions, everything is here [points to his head].” Jamie Jackson\n\nEddie Howe has urged Anthony Gordon not to be distracted by reports linking him with a summer move to Arsenal amid speculation that the 25-year-old winger will be a target for the title-chasing Gunners. Howe, who is still dealing with the fallout from Alexander Isak’s defection to Liverpool last summer, could do without a repeat of that saga, but the Newcastle manager admits there is little he can do to prevent it. Newcastle face Gordon’s former cub Everton in the Premier League on Saturday and Howe said: “I’m not sure there’s a lot I can do about that. I’ve not seen the story, so it’s news to me. But we’re mid-season, we’re in the middle of some of the biggest games of his career and who knows what’s going to happen internationally with him in the summer as well? “He’s got no time to look left or right, he’s got to be fully focused on straight ahead and the next game and trying to be as good as he can be.” View image in fullscreen Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon is reported to be on Arsenal’s wishlist. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA Gordon, who earlier this month dismissed rumours he was on the way out of the club where he signed a new contract in October 2024, will hope to continue his good run of form to secure a place in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for this summer’s World Cup finals and Howe is hopeful he will not be unsettled by talk over his future. “It comes with the territory of being a top player and playing at this level, that there’s going to be speculation,” said Howe. “You’ve just got to put it out of your brain and you’ve got to focus on the football because as we know with our schedule, there’s so many games, there’s no time for distractions. We have to be fully focused on each match.” PA Media\n\n3. Moyes blames referees for corner ‘dark arts’ David Moyes has claimed corner-kick routines are turning into wrestling contests because referees have ignored “the dark arts” for too long. Moyes’s Everton team were criticised for crowding the Manchester United goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, at several corners during their 1-0 defeat at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Monday. Ahead of Saturday’s game at Newcastle, the Everton manager insisted that went against his gameplan but he, and other managers, would seek any advantage that the laws of the game offer. However, he also believes referees should take a harder line to try to eradicate jostling at set-pieces. “Truthfully, it wasn’t the plan for our corner kicks to end up like that. But I think there’s a bigger issue with it,” Moyes said. “It has been allowed to let go, whether it be blocking of goalkeepers or blocking of defenders, and you get the feeling now that referees really don’t want to get involved in any of it. It is nearly wrestling to an extent, which it shouldn’t be. It should never have got to this situation, but I think it’s been really poor that they’ve not tried to deal with it well enough and stop it. “You are now allowed lots of blocking, for example. In my day, if you blocked someone it would have been a free-kick. But blocking has become a big part of it. Let’s be fair, the best at it – but with style – would be Arsenal: good delivery, good style, but ultimately there’s a lot of dark arts in it such as blocking the goalkeeper from the back or the front, blocking defenders and making it difficult for them to be your key headers of the ball. “It is a big thing in football, but I do think the level of refereeing has let that part of the game drop. And managers, if we see somebody else doing it and not getting punished for it, then we are all on it.” View image in fullscreen More wrestling match than football as Manchester United and Everton players indulge in some dark arts from a corner. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images Ironically, Moyes felt Everton’s approach in the closing stages against United worked against his team. He wanted more variety from Everton’s corners but claimed: “It was very difficult to get the message on.” Moyes admitted: “The plan was not to deliver the corners in the fashion we did the other night. They shouldn’t have been delivered as close to the goalkeeper. They should have been delivered into different areas at different times according to what we had worked on. It became a bit of a wrestling match and I didn’t think it showed enough quality or enough thought.” Andy Hunter\n\n4. Glasner wary of United’s Carrick bounce Oliver Glasner credits Michael Carrick for imbuing Manchester United with a “great spirit” and “clear structure” since his appointment last month. No team has picked up more Premier League points in 2026 than United, with Carrick winning five of his six games in charge since replacing Ruben Amorim. Palace have been a thorn in United’s side in recent years, winning three of their five last encounters, but Glasner expects Carrick’s side to be in fine form on Sunday when the Eagles head to Old Trafford. View image in fullscreen The Crystal Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, steered his team into the last 16 of the Uefa Conference league on Thursday. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA “Of course, when Man United plays at home against Crystal Palace, everybody there is expecting now a win,” said Glasner. “They are a very good team now. They gave a very good balance between, it’s a very experienced team, with really, very experienced Premier League players, and very young players with huge talent. “It’s a good mix they have now, but I think the most important thing for them is they are consistently playing with their team and have a clear structure in the way they are playing. This is what I could see against Everton. They have a great spirit right now. It was really impressive seeing Matheus Cunha celebrating winning a duel in their own box. This, I think, is what Michael Carrick brought into this team.” PA Media"

            "content": "Igor Tudor says his Tottenham players are not fit enough and has questioned their desire to put in the hard yards without the ball.\n\nThe interim head coach has a clearer idea of the problems he faces after two weeks – and there are many of them, including low levels of confidence and the capacity of the younger players to handle the pressure of a relegation battle.\n\nTudor knows there are reasons for the physical issues with the squad stretched by an injury crisis amid a punishing schedule. Although Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso are in contention to return for Sunday’s trip to Fulham, Tottenham will be without eight injured players plus the suspended Cristian Romero.\n\nTudor believes there is only one way out of the situation – an on-the-hoof fitness reboot in training, particularly as the club had no midweek fixture last week or this. The Croat surprised the players by working them extremely hard throughout last week and not tapering off before last Sunday’s home game against Arsenal, which they lost 4-1. As Tudor made plain, it is not a time to pander to player sensibilities.\n\n“Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,” Tudor said. “They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and it made the physical condition of the team drop down. So we need to use this period where we don’t play the games to put some petrol in the engine so the engine starts to work better.\n\n“They are fatigued. To do the pressing high you need to be fit. But [it is] all of them because if someone is not in the right shape there is a problem because someone is coming late [to the press].\n\n“The second thing is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back. If you run up and don’t run back it’s a problem. For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it’s a big question what we can do and what we cannot do.”\n\nTudor was asked about his full-throttle approach from the first training session. “Yes, that’s the only way – running,” he said. “The pitch is 100 yards, it’s long. So you need to run.\n\n“Maybe you have habits to, I don’t know … work a bit less. I put some runs without the ball [into the sessions]. Never players like runs without the ball so we put some runs without balls. But it’s a moment when there is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn’t like. And the best thing is that they understand this. They gave me their availability to do these things.”\n\nTudor is under no illusions about the size of the challenge. It was put to him that the striker, Randal Kolo Muani, had played well against Arsenal. “That’s good, one good thing,” he replied.\n\nWhat Tudor wants to see at Fulham and beyond is players such as Kolo Muani stepping up, accepting the responsibility. “Some players are still young,” he said. “They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to resolve the problems.\n\nView image in fullscreen Randal Kolo Muani scores against Arsenal – Igor Tudor wants him to keep raising his game for Spurs. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\n“If you have too many of these players because of the amount of injuries, who are playing together in the squad, it does create some problems. But it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man. To say: ‘Come on, I’m the guy, give me the ball, I will score.’ Instead of just: ‘What can I do? I’m just here, you know.’\n\n“It’s always how you see the situation. It’s not: ‘I’m just here. We had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play.’ How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy and positive, there is opportunity.”\n\nTudor has not dwelt for long on the derby with Arsenal. “No, no, forget that,” he said. It was never likely to be a game that would define the club’s survival hopes. The same is not true of Fulham – or the home fixture against Crystal Palace next Thursday.\n\n“After the first game, I said if you play against the best team in the world at this moment, it’s not a realistic game to show [whether] we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,” Tudor said. “That’s the truth. They show they can be in some parts of the game. But for long periods we had problems, in defence especially. It’s not easy against them. Let’s see in the next games.”"

The club are not planning to publish their 2024-25 accounts until the end of March.\n\nChelsea, while not contesting the £355m loss, which is based on information they provided to Uefa, insist the headline figure does not reflect the economic reality.\n\nClub sources have disclosed that the record loss reflects non-cash accounting adjustments required by Uefa’s financial sustainability regulations, specifically one-off transactions related to player contract and asset write-offs, and that they are profitable on an operational basis.\n\nChelsea were fined £27m by Uefa last summer for breaching its spending restrictions and ordered to submit to a business plan, but are confident of avoiding another sanction. As part of that settlement agreement Chelsea were permitted to continue running at a substantial loss, as long as it remained in line with “the projected deficit submitted in the business plan”."

            "content": "IRANIAN officials were the main target of the first wave of US-Israeli strikes, Israeli sources said yesterday.\n\nThe mission is focused on “cutting off the head of the snake” in the hope of bringing about longed-for regime change in the oppressed rogue state.\n\n\n\n\n\nRumours of the death of President Pezeshkian swirled as one Israeli source described “very significant” harm to senior figures in the regime and “indications” of direct hits.\n\nSources say Iran’s defence minister Amir Nasirzadeh and Revolutionary Guards commander Mohammed Pakpour may have been killed in the strikes.\n\nDonald Trump’s patience finally ran out after Iran’s fanatical regime continued to block his no-nuke demands.\n\n\n\nThe mullahs issued a pledge not to build a bomb but were still rejecting the US demands to stop enriching uranium used to arm warheads.\n\nAnd they are also refused point blank to make concessions on their ballistic missile arsenal; funding Middle East terror and launching bloody massacres of opposition protesters.\n\nIran’s negotiator, foreign minister Abbas Araghchi refused to deliberate directly with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe “indirect talks” in Geneva involve Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi acting as a go-between, shuttling between the two delegations.\n\n\n\nAlbusaidi said yesterday that talks were progressing in a “constructive spirit,” with negotiators demonstrating “unprecedented openness to new and creative ideas.”\n\nBut a huge gulf remained between the two wides yesterday as the biggest US strike force – which as America’s commander-in-chief finally called “no deal” yesterday.\n\nAn unprecedented squadron of 11 F-22 Raptors – America’s most advanced warplane – were believed to have led the onslaught on Iran’s air defences last night.\n\nThe undetectable radar-dodging jets made up the vanguard of Donald Trump’s campaign.\n\nWar erupted after Israeli officials said they believed a US was “inevitable” on Thursday as talks broke up with no agreement.\n\n\n\nAircraft carriers USS Abraham Lincoln and the USS Gerald R Ford – the most powerful warship on earth – were both in range of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s lair but their role remained unclear.\n\nThe Raptors – providing a vital Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) platform – were the last key component to be deployed before the president gave his attack order.\n\nOfficials said it was the first time F-22s had ever been based on Israeli soil for a combat mission.\n\nThey complete a huge package comprising the two aircraft carrier strike groups with 150-plus aircraft – among 500 warplanes in total – 700 tonnes of munitions plus refuelling tankers.\n\nThree AWACS “eye-in-the-sky” early warning planes are also in position while more spyplanes are already airborne watching over the Strait of Hormuz off the Iranian coast.\n\n\n\nStrikes began at 6am UK time – 9am in Iran – with a blitz on the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nFollow The Sun’s live blog for the latest updates on the US-Israeli attacks on Iran\n\nThe presidential palace was also targeted but the figurehead of the blood-soaked regime was reported to be in hiding in the city of Mashhad.\n\nUnconfirmed rumours also spread through Tehran yesterday that Khamenei’s chief henchman President Masoud Pezeshkian had been killed in the initial wave of attacks.\n\nAn Iranian source told The Sun a family member had called in panic telling how she was sent fleeing as enormous explosions erupted across the city.\n\n\n\nThe source said: “My sister called me from Tehran and said bombing began about an hour ago – she said there were 30 explosions downtown.\n\n“People are saying President Pezeshkian has been been killed but the government is saying nothing.\n\n“The supreme leader was not in Tehran in his office, which is next to the presidential palace.\n\n“My sister was on her way to pick her daughter from school when it started and the internet connection was very bad.”\n\n\n\nMassive explosions were also heard in the cities of Isfahan, Qom Karaj, Kermanshah and Shiraz were as waves of fighter jets roared overhead.\n\nVolleys of cruise missiles were also seen streaking across the sky above Iraq on the way to the targets in western Iran.\n\nBut islamist zealot Khamenei remained defiant and hit back with a string of retaliatory ballistic missile blasts at US bases across the region.\n\nTerrified citizens were seen running in panic in the normally safe haven of Dubai as Iran hit the United Arab Emirates for the first time.\n\nPanic spread as blasts were heard near the Dubai Marina tourist and leisure hub.\n\n\n\nIt comes as…\n\nOne person was reported to have been killed in the UAE state of Abu Dhabi after a volley of missiles were intercepted near the international airport.\n\nRegional strife spread as four US bases were targeted by Iran simultaneously with multiple missile attacks.\n\nMissile and drone interceptions were reported in Jerusalem and sirens wailed across Israel.\n\nPlumes of smoke from strikes and interceptions were seen at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, Al Salem base in Kuwait, Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, and the US Fifth Fleet base in Bahrain.\n\n\n\nKhamenei's web of evil revealed Exclusive, by Katie Davis, Deputy Foreign Editor A CLANDESTINE web of 4,000 shady figures protecting Iran’s evil supreme leader from overthrow has been exposed for the first time. Evil Ali Khamenei has spent decades carving a vast network of stooges to ensure the regime’s tentacles have every aspect of the rogue nation in a chokehold. Known as the Bayt-e Rahbari – or the Bayt – it safeguards the aging Ayatollah’s overarching iron-grip over Iran – and ultimately “coup-proofing” his regime. Since the US and Israel launched an unprecedented 12-day blitz on the Islamic Republic last June, Khamenei, 86, has been increasing invisible in the public eye. But extensive research by United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) today reveals while the West has interpreted this as vulnerability or even a leadership vacuum, it is actually proof of the immense apparatus working in the shadows. Kasra Aarabi, director of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps research at UANI, told The Sun: “Khamenei has created the extensive Bayt apparatus to ‘coup proof’ his regime — and retain absolute control over every aspect of policy in the Islamic Republic. “Khamenei has the Bayt to ensure continuity and the durability of the regime should he be eliminated.” Intricate and covert, the network has tens of thousands of loyal henchmen propping up Khamenei behind the scenes – ready to pull the levers if and when war breaks out. Acting as an insurance policy for if Khamenei is holed up in a bunker or killed – it makes it near-impossible to wipe out his twisted regime without a lengthy, well-executed operation. “The structure he’s created ensures that his elimination will not result in the complete collapse of the regime — despite the fact that Khamenei has personalised every aspect of power in the Islamic Republic,” Kasra added. “It has effectively transformed the supreme leader from an individual into an institution – one that can function regardless of whether Khamenei is hiding or even eliminated.” READ MORE HERE\n\nIt was the most serious against US assets ever launched as it was confirmed America’s vital Fifth Fleet HQ was “subjected to a missile attack”.\n\nThe UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has posted on X, advising UK citizens in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE to seek shelter.\n\nIt said: “Due to reported missile attacks, British nationals in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates should immediately shelter in place.\n\n“Remain indoors in a secure location, avoid all travel and follow instructions from the local authorities.”\n\nIsrael Defence Forces yesterday issued a public warning to all Iranians near military and nuclear sites to run for their lives.\n\n\n\nIts warning said: “To all individuals who are inside or in the vicinity of military weapons production factories and military infrastructure facilities across Iran:\n\n“You are located near weapons and military facilities that are considered dangerous.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“Dear citizens, for your safety and well-being, we urge you to immediately evacuate these areas and remain outside of them until further notice.\n\n“Your presence in these locations puts your lives at risk.”"

            "content": "BBL HORROR I nearly died from same at-home BBL that ‘killed the Lip King’ after I was injected in my KITCHEN… plastic leaked out\n\nA PLAYBOY bunny who almost died after getting the same back-street Brazilian Bum Lift that is feared to have killed the “Lip King” has warned other women: “Don’t do it.”\n\nCover girl Melissa Howe paid £7,200 to get her backside injected while lying on a makeshift bed in her kitchen in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut two days later she said she could feel the “liquid plastic” moving around her body before developing a “weird infected lump” in her hip.\n\nShe spent 10 hours in A&E before surgeons extracted the liquid leaving her with a painful open wound on her bum cheek.\n\nMelissa, 35, who has previously dated footballer Dele Alli and rapper Lil Wayne, told The Sun: “I want to warn other women not to have it done.\n\n“I know there are people desperate for it but they don’t know what the consequences can be.\n\n“I was told I could have died from the infection but the hospital saved me.\n\n“I will never do it again.”\n\n\n\nHer words of warning come a week after self-proclaimed “Lip King” and cosmetic procedure addict Jordan Parke died after a suspected BBL treatment at a hotel in Canary Wharf, east London.\n\nA man and a woman, understood to be a couple, have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.\n\nParke was himself under arrest for manslaughter following the death of mum-of-five Alice Webb, 33, after a BBL op at a private home in Gloucester in 2024.\n\nMelissa, who lives between London and LA, said: “Sadly, the injectors aren’t begging for people to have it done, thousands of women are begging them.\n\nWhat are Brazilian Butt Lifts and why are they so popular? Buttock enlargement surgery – known as a Brazilian butt-lift (BBL) – is used to make the bum look bigger, rounded and lifted. Surgeons transfer fat, inject filler or insert silicone-filled implants. It is the fastest growing cosmetic procedure but also one of the most dangerous, according to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS). Many patients are travelling to the likes of Turkey or seeking out unregistered surgeons in the UK and are not given full information on the risks. BBLs carry the highest risk of all cosmetic surgeries – with more than one death occurring per 4,000 procedures. Due to celebrities undergoing such ops, many women are hoping to emulate their looks. Consultant clinical psychologist Dr Anu Sayal-Bennett, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society, told the BBC: “Despite there being so much about body positivity, there are pressures for women – and men too – to look a certain way.” Many people travel abroad for the procedure because it is cheaper and advertising is “terribly seductive”, combined with the idea of a beach holiday, added Dr Sayal-Bennett.\n\n“They are willing to pay and go blindly into it, and it’s a lot of money.\n\n\n\n“They don’t realise how bad it is and we need to get that message out there.\n\n“I had a woman, a mum-of-three with money, asking me for a number to have it done and I refused to give it to her.\n\n“There are thousands of women who don’t care about the risks and just want it done to get the look.\n\n“But the consequences can be fatal.”\n\nMelissa, who appears in Playboy France next month and last month starred on the cover of FHM magazine in Sweden, has more than 700,000 followers on social media.\n\n\n\nShe added: “A lot of my following are the type of people who would pay money to do it.\n\n“I’m telling them, don’t do it.\n\n“When I went into the hospital the surgeon was like ‘what is this stuff’.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“I was told it was liquid plastic and my body had rejected it.\n\n“The injectors will take your money but the product is garbage.”"

            "content": "DOZENS of Ryanair passengers were left behind at the Spanish island of Lanzarote after severe delays at passport control, it has been reported.\n\nThe flight reportedly departed from César Manrique-Lanzarote Airport for Bristol half empty, leaving around 89 passengers behind.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelays began at the non-Schengen passport control area, where travellers line up to have their passports stamped before boarding the plane.\n\nRunning out of patience, airline staff began removing their suitcases from the jet – which took nearly an hour – and eventually left, newspaper La Voz de Lanzarote reported.\n\nThe flight landed in Bristol 52 minutes late after leaving the passengers on the ground, reports say.\n\nIt is not yet clear what happened to the passengers and how long they were stranded in Lanzarote.\n\nIt’s not the first time passengers have been left at Lanzarote airport.\n\nIn February last year, the arrival of 17 non-EU flights sparked chaos in the airport as they had to stamp their passports on arrival.\n\nPresident of the Chamber of Commerce of Lanzarote and La Graciosa, José Valle, warned last year that the implementation of the EU’s new European Entry/Exit System (EES) could cause “serious collapses” at the airport.\n\nThe full rollout of the bloc’s new border controls is due to come into force on April 10.\n\n\n\nIt is part of a two-pronged approach that the EU is taking to digitalise its borders, which means new travel rules for non-visa nationals visiting the Schengen Area.\n\nThe incident at Lanzarote comes after air transport organisations warned that waiting times may be significantly longer this summer because of the new system.\n\nThey are calling for urgent action to combat “chronic border control understaffing” and “unresolved technology issues”.\n\nSome industry sources suggested that the decision to leave the passengers behind may be linked to Ryanair’s ongoing frustration with Spain over increased airport charges introduced by AENA, the state-controlled airport operator in the country.\n\nBut the budget airline has not formally commented on the incident.\n\n\n\nRyanair is furious about the price hikes, saying: “The statement from AENA’s monopoly on February 25 is astonishing for its inability to understand how to take advantage of Spain’s airport infrastructure to boost traffic, tourism and employment.\n\n“The only reason Ryanair and other airlines are cutting traffic at Spain’s regional airports – which are now empty by more than 70% – is that AENA’s excessive fares are diverting that traffic to more competitive airports elsewhere in Europe.\n\n“That is the economic reality of monopoly prices.\n\n“This summer, Ryanair, which is the number one airline in Spain and Europe, will grow by less than 0.5 per cent at Spanish airports, including major and regional airports.\n\n“At the same time, we will increase our summer traffic by 11 per cent in Morocco, 9 per cent in Italy and 60 per cent in Albania.\n\n\n\n“The reason why we are boosting tourism markets in other countries and not in Spain is simple: access costs in other countries are significantly more competitive, and there the growth in passenger numbers is rewarded with lower rates.”\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe airline already revealed that this year it plans to axe over a million seats to certain Spanish routes, with some routes being cut down, because of the dispute.\n\nThe Sun has contacted Ryanair for a comment."

It was first built by former WW2 army engineer Tom McLean, who purchased the island to develop under his family business in 1962. It was then sold in 1985 to Trans-Australia Airlines, which ceased trading in 2009 before United Petroleum snatched it up for $5.9 million in 2010. The island was hit by a cyclone in 2011, destroying a lot of the original 1960s resort. In July last year, developers asked for a five-year extension to develop a “boutique-style” resort featuring villas, a rock pool and yoga studio. Today, its oceanfront pool lies unused, filled with sand. Dunk Island Australian billionaire Annie Cannon-Brookes has been snapping up property on Dunk Island, which was trashed since cyclones swept through years ago. She has just bought her fourth development to add to her island portfolio. Cannon-Brookes has splashed at least £17.3million so far and even signed a 30-year lease with the Cassowary Coast Regional Council for the public access area at Dunk Island Spit. Her vision is to bring the island back to life, telling realestate.com: “Our goal is to be good custodians of the island, and we are pleased to be making progress”. Keswick Island Keswick Island, just off Mackay, has faced stalled development and restricted public access for years. Developer Oasis Forest Ltd purchased the head lease in 2019 but residents were left fuming after the island was put back on the market. The 517 hectare island features 117 hectares of land lease and 25 hectares of marine lease, along with ownership of the island’s ferry and barge. It’s on the market as a pre-approved development site. Great Keppel Island The 1980s party paradise, Great Keppel (Woppa) Island, off the central Queensland coast, is currently battling a feral goat problem. The resort closed in 2008 – 15 years later the state government rescinded the leases from former Great Keppel Island Resort owners, Tower Holdings for non-payment of fees. In 2025, a tender was awarded to a demolition company to clean up abandoned buildings on Great Keppel Island.\n\nStone Island, a 227-acre private isle, will be the “latest and greatest” of Queensland’s paradises, recently hitting the market for £12million along with pre-approval for a brand new resort.\n\nFor more than 30 years, Stone Island was a private and exclusive sanctuary without any tourist facilities, but it’s now positioned to become the Whitsundays’ first new resort since Hamilton Island in the mid-1980s.\n\n\n\nRichard predicts Stone Island will be the beginning of a new generation of island resorts in Queensland.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIt comes with approved plans to build a new resort in the Whitsundays. This would be the first new resort built there since the 1980s.\n\nIt even has a proposal to host Australia’s first gondola from Bowen mainland onto the island paradise."

            "content": "NOT EASY BEING GREEN Migrant crackdown must go ahead & PM should resist lurching party to left after brutal by-election loss, warns Home Sec\n\nTHE Labour Party must resist a shift to the left following a humiliating defeat in the Gorton and Denton by-election, the Home Secretary will warn.\n\nShabana Mahmood is set to say that the party must push forward with its migration crackdown or face putting its future in jeopardy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter being roundly bested by the Green party, Labour will need to stick to its “centrist” path on migration to counter the “fairytale” of the Green’s open borders the Home Secretary will say.\n\nMahmood and her migration reforms are battling continued demands from senior Labour figures to shift to the left in the wake of the Green’s victory in Manchester.\n\nHer new legislation to completely overhaul Britain’s asylum system is understood to be aimed at blunting the appeal of Reform UK.\n\nIt comes after Mahmood visited Denmark, where a social democratic-led government has drastically reduced the number of asylum applications to the lowest number in 40 years.\n\nThe Danish government has also removed 95% of rejected asylum seekers in a major crackdown.\n\nThe Home Secretary has made little secret of her admiration for the approach.\n\nMahmood is now expected to use a speech next week to face down her party’s demands and call for support for her sweeping migration reforms.\n\nHer party came a humiliating third in a crunch by-election with Reform and the Green Party soundly beating them out.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the disastrous result, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faced down fresh calls for him to quit.\n\nHe vowed to fight on though, and accused the Green Party of “sectarian” politics.\n\nThe Prime Minister pledged to “fight against extremes in politics” on both the left and the right that threatened to “tear our country apart.”\n\nReform leader Nigel Farage accused Muslim voters of cheating in the election through “illegal family voting.”\n\nIn the wake of the defeat, Labour’s deputy prime minister Angela Rayner said the result should be a “wake-up call” for the party.\n\n\n\nShe called for a shift to the left in Labour’s politics, asking her colleagues to “rededicate” themselves to “a Labour agenda that puts people first.”\n\nBut instead of bowing to her left-leaning colleagues the Home Secretary is expected to double down on her divisive immigration policies.\n\nA source told The Times: “The idea that we are losing Muslim voters over immigration is just plain wrong.”\n\n\n\nDenmark’s tough stance on asylum seekers, which Mahmood is understood to have taken inspiration from, began in the mid 2010s when the hard-right Danish People’s Party began to rise in the polls.\n\nMahmood is expected to say the government must cut migration or risk opening the door to the right who would divide communities with the kind of anti-immigration raids seen in the US.\n\nIn her speech next week the Home Secretary is reportedly planning to say Britain will always provide sanctuary to people genuinely fleeing war and danger.\n\nHowever she will also add that the generosity of the asylum system is attracting people from across the world, funding human traffickers and encouraging false asylum claims.\n\nIt is understood she faces a backbench revolt over the plans with Labour split more than ever after the all-important Gorton and Denton by-election.\n\n\n\nMs Mahmood is likely to face opposition in her efforts to emulate the Danish model from at least a few dozen Labour MPs who would see the party move left.\n\nLabour backers of her policies say that without taking any action on migration, the party faces future electoral defeats.\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph this week in Denmark, Mahmood said: “The levels of illegal migration are putting immense strain on our country, and our public services – creating division within communities across the country.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“Illegal migration is undermining the contract between government and its citizens – eroding support for the asylum system entirely.\n\n“But Denmark shows us how to be firm but fair: increasing the removals of illegal migrants that have no right to be in their country while providing refuge to those in genuine need.”"

My family has now left the neighbourhood.\n\n“People across Bahrain – because of how small the country is – heard the blast and the fighter jets. People living as far as 20-30 miles away from the base. I hope it is over for now.”\n\n\n\nIn Iraq, rockets have attacked US forces near Erbil Airport, according to security officials.\n\nJordan’s army said it had downed two ballistic missiles targeting the country – Qatar also reportedly intercepted two Iranian missiles and two further waves of attacks.\n\nIt comes as...\n\nIn the UAE, one person was killed after Emiratis intercepted Iranian missiles, state media reported.\n\n\n\nAnd witnesses heard a loud bang in Abu Dhabi as the UAE confirmed it has closed its airspace.\n\nExplosions have been reported in Dubai – including one near the marina, which is popular with tourists. Sirens have also sounded in Kuwait.\n\nTerrified tourists in Dubai were seen running for cover following the interception of missiles above the city.\n\nAn 11-second video circulating online captures the moment two expanding clouds appear in the clear blue sky over the United Arab Emirates.\n\nHolidaymakers had been relaxing by a pool when the apparent airstrikes were shot down overhead.\n\n\n\nIn the clip, which has amassed more than half a million views, a woman can be heard saying, “Oh my god,” as she swings the camera from the pool back up to the sky, where two plumes of smoke are visible.\n\n“They are bombing it,” she insists.\n\nEarlier, Donald Trump condemned Iran’s “vicious” leadership and its 47-year “campaign of bloodshed and mass murder,” pledging to “raze” the country’s missile industry “to the ground.”\n\nMeanwhile, British tourist Will Bailey said he woke up on his first morning in Dubai to what he described as “what seems like World War Three.”\n\n“Apparently, missiles have just landed in Abu Dhabi, which is about an hour drive from Dubai,” he said in a TikTok video.\n\n\n\n“I was about to go to a beach club and have a nice Saturday afternoon.”\n\nAs they listened to a radio announcement stating that the British embassy was aware of strikes over the UAE, his friend remarked, “We need to get a bottle show, it could be our last one.”\n\n“Go out with a bang literally,” Will responded, before nervously biting his nails as the broadcast confirmed a second wave of missiles had been intercepted.\n\n“What is happening?” he exclaimed, reacting in shock as reports confirmed one fatality in Abu Dhabi during the strikes.\n\n“Someone’s died in Abu Dhabi,” he told his friend. “The phone is shaking as I’m holding my phone up…s**t.”\n\n\n\nIn separate footage shared by @iknowuea, loud booming sounds can be heard as a white plume of smoke forms in the sky following another interception.\n\nAnother video, filmed outside a Brewdog venue in the city, appears to show a second missile being destroyed mid-air.\n\n“F****ng close,” a British voice is heard saying in one clip, as another person adds: “That’s the second one.”\n\nIn another video, a man points his camera at a white streak cutting across the sky and says: “That’s three missiles, over our heads.”\n\nOne voice responds, “Isn’t that cool?” before someone else reacts: “What the f**k”.\n\n\n\nBritish influencer Leah Mai, who relocated from London to Dubai, posted a brief video of the clear sky after an interception.\n\n“Every so often, you get reminded that you live in the Middle East. A place where bombs do actually go off. Mad,” she wrote.\n\nJamie Smith, who had been having drinks by a hotel pool, said he heard “three loud bangs.\n\n“Hotel is delivering complementary ice lollies like all is good,” he added.\n\n“Well the pool and the adjoining pub are very quiet for a Saturday.”\n\n\n\nDennis, from London, filmed himself lying on a beach as a clip of Sophie Ellis-Bexter’s “Murder On The Dancefloor” played in the background.\n\n“Casually at the beach in Dubai whilst Iran just tried bombing the UAE 45 minutes ago,” he wrote.\n\nEighteen-year-old influencer Julis shared footage of herself working on a laptop in a café shortly after she said she had “hear[ing] explosions in Dubai.\n\n“Out of interest, tell me your last words,” she added.\n\n\n\nBlasts were heard in northern Israel after it attacked Iran with strikes that hit near to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s office.\n\nTehran vowed to revenge the attack, before a barrage of missiles fired by Iran at Israel were identified, the Israel Defence Forces said.\n\nIran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard confirmed the strikes, saying that it had launched a “first wave” of drones and missiles targeting Israel.\n\nIt said: “We know the United States as the main factor in today’s aggression, and the Zionist regime is the sponsor of this aggression.\n\n\n\n“We consider all American bases, resources, and interests in the region, space, and land as the legitimate target of the armed forces.”\n\nTyrant Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian were both targeted in the “Epic Fury” attacks, an Israeli official said.\n\n\n\nKhamenei was not in Tehran and had been transferred to a secure location, a source told Reuters.\n\nSeveral senior commanders in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and political officials were killed in the strikes, the source claimed.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Iran an “existential threat” to his country.\n\nHe thanked Trump in a statement: “My brothers and sisters, citizens of Israel, a short time ago, Israel and the United States embarked on an operation to remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran.\n\n“I thank our great friend, President Donald Trump, for his historic leadership.”\n\n\n\nAir raid sirens rang out in Tel Aviv and the Israeli public were told to seek shelter.\n\nAn IDF spokesperson said: “A short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel. Defensive systems are operating to intercept the threat.\n\n“In the past few minutes, the Home Front Command has sent a precautionary directive directly to mobile phones in the relevant areas.\n\n“The public is asked to act responsibly and follow the instructions – they save lives.”\n\n\n\nThe strikes come after Donald Trump confirmed he had pulled the trigger on “major combat operations” against Iran – warning Tehran’s “menacing activities directly endanger the US and our allies”.\n\nIn an eight-minute speech on Truth Social, the US president urged Iranian officials to “lay down your arms” – or “face certain death”.\n\nHe described the attacks as “a noble mission”, saying they were necessary because of Iran’s pursuit of its nuclear programme and long-range missiles that could reach the US.\n\nThe US Department of Defense revealed the strikes on Iran have been named “Operation Epic Fury”.\n\n\n\nThe strikes in Iran are expected to last several days, two US officials told NBC News.\n\nTrump told the Washington Post that his main concern is “freedom” for the Iranian people.\n\nHe added: “I want a safe nation, and that’s what we’re going to have.”\n\nIranian MP Ebrahim Azizi struck a defiant tone in the wake of the incident this morning.\n\n“We warned you!” Azizi wrote in a post on X.\n\n\n\nSeparately, hardline Iranian parliamentarian Alaeddin Boroujerdi said there would be no “red lines” in responding to the attack.\n\n“We had previously announced that we would have no red lines. We hope this action marks the beginning of the end of the Zionist regime,” he said in an interview with state TV.\n\n“Our response will be regret-inducing. We will use all of our capacities. Our rightful and necessary response, especially to the Zionist regime, will be delivered.”\n\nIran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had called counterparts in countries including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Iraq.\n\nHe told them Iran will use “all its defensive and military capabilities under legitimate right of self-defence” to defend itself.\n\n\n\nThe UK did not take part in “Operation Epic Fury”, it is understood, and PM Sir Keir Starmer is expected to chair an emergency Cobra meeting today.\n\nA government spokesperson said the UK does “not want to see further escalation into a wider regional conflict”.\n\nThe statement said: “Our immediate priority is the safety of UK nationals in the region and we will provide them with consular assistance, available 24/7.”\n\n“As part of our longstanding commitments to the security of our allies in the Middle East, we have a range of defensive capabilities in the region, which we have recently bolstered. We stand ready to protect our interests.”\n\n\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) Death toll in US-Israeli strike on girls’ school in southern Iran rises to 40 killed, state-run IRNA news agency reports.\n\nThe US-Israeli blitz on Iran killed students, Iranian state Fars News Agency said.\n\nAn Iranian official said earlier: “In today’s attacks by the Zionist regime on Minab city, a girls’ elementary school was targeted and so far 5 students have been martyred.”\n\nUp to 40 people are now feared to have been killed in the attack on a girls school.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the chaos, all major airlines have axed flights to the region, including to Dubai.\n\nBritish Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, and Wizz Air are among operators who have scrapped flights until further notice.\n\nWizz Air has cancelled all flights to and from Israel, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Amman until March 7.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe airline said: “The airline is closely monitoring developments and remains in ongoing contact with local and international authorities, aviation safety agencies, security authorities, and relevant governmental bodies.”\n\nBritish Airways cancelled all flights to Tel Aviv and Bahrain until Wednesday, also grounding a service due to fly to Amman today."

We reiterate our commitment to regional stability and to the protection of civilian life.\n\n“We condemn Iranian attacks on countries in the region in the strongest terms. Iran must refrain from indiscriminate military strikes. We urge the Iranian leadership to seek a negotiated solution. Ultimately, the Iranian people must be allowed to determine their future.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe attack prompted retaliation from Iran, with missiles reported to have targeted Israel and countries across the Middle East. A Government spokesperson said the UK did not want to see “further escalation into a wider regional conflict” and reiterated Britain’s support for a negotiated solution to Iran’s nuclear ambitions.\n\nAfter the strikes, the Foreign Office warned against all travel to Israel while embassies in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE have advised British nationals to shelter in place.\n\nThe spokesperson added: “Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and that is why we have continually supported efforts to reach a negotiated solution. Our immediate priority is the safety of UK nationals in the region and we will provide them with consular assistance, available 24/7.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSaturday’s attack follows mounting tension in the region, with the US deploying a fleet of warships and aircraft to pressure Tehran. Talks between the US and Iran regarding Tehran’s nuclear programme ended on Thursday without agreement.\n\nOn Saturday, Israeli authorities said the strikes – dubbed Operation Roaring Lion by Israel and Operation Epic Fury by the US – were intended to “thoroughly degrade the Iranian terrorist regime and to remove existential threats to Israel”.\n\nDame Emily Thornberry, chairwoman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said it was “absolutely right” that the UK had not been involved in the strikes.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nShe said: “There is no legal basis for this attack. I fear that we will be hit by the consequences, however. The whole region will be further destabilised, which is dangerous. Whilst the Iranian reaction during the 12-Day War was muted, it is unlikely this time.\n\n“We need to prepare for shipping, oil facilities and military bases with western troops, including British, to be attacked. The Americans and Israelis are embarking on a war that they do not know how it will end, nor are their war aims clear.”"

For his native New York was colder than Reykjavik, the Icelandic capital, where the summit that ended the Cold War took place 40 years ago. He laughs, having left behind him record-breaking snowfall in the Big Apple: \"This is so wild. I have, in fact, just measured the temperature in New York and the Arctic Circle is warmer.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBoth producing and starring as Reagan in the Paramount TV series, which sees ex-Bond villain Christopher Waltz playing Mikahil Gorbachev, it is based on Ken Adelman’s book Reagan at Reykjavik: Forty-Eight Hours That Ended the Cold War. And Douglas, 81, admits he and the former movie star president shared something of an obsession with their hair.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nReagan was never seen with a single grey hair and Douglas says: \"Hair has always been an important part of my acting. Jack Nicholson always used to give me sh** about my hair and say ‘what is it with this hair acting?’ But if you look at Jack, he does more work with the hair!”\n\n‌\n\n\n\n6 View 6 Images Michael in the Arctic 6 View 6 Images He told fans \"Good morning from the Artic! It’s freezing out here! Have a great weekend! MD\"\n\nSeen through the eyes of Reagan’s arms control director, the new drama explores how the 48-hour summit in Reykjavik in 1986 led to the development of the mutual Strategic Defence Initiative and the hope of eliminating all nuclear weapons. Married to Welsh actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, 56, it is the latest in a long list of varied roles which display Douglas’ incredible skill - playing everything from a lustful cop in Basic Instinct, to Liberace and a cheating husband in Fatal Attraction.\n\nBut for Reagan, he will be drawing on advice given to him over the years by his late father, Hollywood icon Kirk Douglas, who died aged 103 in 2020. Crediting his dad with teaching him to play a villainous and loveable rogue at the same time, he says: \"I love the grey area of characters. We all like to see ourselves as the hero, but we have all probably done things that we are not proud about.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Dad lived in a generation of good guys and bad guys post the Second World War and the enemy was defined much more clearly. You either had a white hat or a black hat. For my generation, during the Vietnam war, there was this grey area. Large parts of the population were questioning the war and whether we should have been there. There were protests and it caused a lot of friction within families ,whereas my father played the sensitive young man in several roles.\n\nView 6 Images Actors Michael Douglas, Anne Buydens, Kirk Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones arrive at AFI Lifetime Achievement Award: A Tribute to Michael Douglas held at Sony Pictures Studios on June 11, 2009 (Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I guess I was first aware of it when I was doing Fatal Attraction. We were having our screening and in one scene I was having an affair with Glenn Close's character and I come home and toss my bed around to make it look as if I had slept there, to try and fool my wife, when I hadn't. I remember when we showed that scene the audience laughed and our producer said ‘my God, they have forgiven you already. How do you do that? You have just committed adultery.’\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAn enviably accomplished film actor, Douglas is also looking forward to marking 40 years since his career defining role as megalomanic insider trader Gordon Gekko in the 1987 Oliver Stone masterpiece Wall Street. Luck played a big part in him landing the role of Gekko, who immortalised the 1980s’ obsession with greed and power.\n\nHe says: \"When Oliver came to me I was honoured and blown away. I have not seen the movie fully in about 40 years, but I saw an article recently which said Oliver first went to Warren Beatty and he passed on it and then to Richard Gere, who passed on the role. I did not know any of that as he said I was the one that was chosen. But saying that, how did those poor guys feel when the picture turned out to be what it was? I mean they must have been like ‘I can't believe this’.\n\nView 6 Images American actors Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone on the set of Basic Instinct (Image: Corbis via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDouglas, who won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of the slick Manhattan trader, relied on help from some of his stockbroker friends to get his character just right. He says: \"When I read the script I knew it was serious work, so I was really happy and excited as it was a great part. You don't get many great parts in your life and I always try to pick well, having a producer background. I will take whatever part in a movie I think is great ,but I thought this was a great part.\n\n\"Oliver was looking for an actor who had some business acumen, so I guess I was right as I had a film producing background as well growing-up in New York and having been to prep school. I also had a familiarity with the east coast and had friends who went into Wall Street. I understood the lifestyle, so I guess that is why he chose me. Back then Wall Street was private equity. They were about people who were putting deals together and not like someone who runs Amazon [Jeff Bezos] or Elon [Musk]. Back then they were making a lot of money, but today that looks small.\"\n\nDouglas, who watched some authentic white collar traders in action ahead of filming, recalls being stunned when tough talking Oliver Stone quizzed brokers about their trading methods on a site visit. He remembers: \"I went to some offices in Los Angles with Oliver. We were having a nice tour and Oliver suddenly asked ‘where is the shredder?’ I was like ‘Oliver? You don’t ask for the shredder.’\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 6 Images Michael Douglas (C) arrives with his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones (R) and daughter Carys (Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nDouglas says his friend Pat Riley, president of the Miami Heat basketball team, was the inspiration for the finishing touches to the Gekko hairstyle. He says: \"I was trying to figure out the right balance and one of my friends is Pat. Once I went down to see him in Miami ,and he likes hot rod cars. I was looking at him in the back seat thinking ‘his hair is not moving man. His hair is not moving.’”\n\nYet, for all his greasiness, Douglas feels he made Gekko a seductive villain. He laughs: \"Gekko was a villain, but this just shows you that villains should be seductive. You look at the clothing and they did an excellent job. But after the movie all the real life Wall St drunken guys came up to me and said ‘You're the man. You're the man’. I remember telling them ‘No. I was the bad guy?’ They all used to go ‘no, no, no’. It used to scare the hell out of me, like where we are all going?\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWith the Icelandic winter in full flow, he will be lucky to keep Reagan’s slicked down mop from freezing to his head. Although the native New Yorker - who insists the city is the best in the world - would have found no respite from the freezing conditions at home, with the staggering current snow fall.\n\nDouglas, who has an apartment on the Big Apple’s Upper West Side, enthuses: “I have been traveling all over the world and if you talk to anyone when they come to New York that's it. It is such a reminder of the best in people and the melting pot that we are. I grew up here. New York is the greatest city in the world. I mean there is no comparison.”"

The semi-official Tasnim News Agency carried a report from the Governor of Minab, in the south of the country.\n\nHe said: \"In this morning's Israeli missile attack on a girls' elementary school in the city, 51 students have been martyred and 60 have been injured.\"\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

He said hat 60 children had been killed after Israeli strikes hit this morning. He added that another 80 were injured, and there were an unknown number of children under the rubble.\n\nThe news came as a wave of strikes rocked Iran with US and Israeli aircraft and missile striking targets across the country.\n\nThe spokesman for Iran’s Red Crescent services, Mojtaba Khaledi, said 20 of Iran’s 31 provinces have been affected by the U.S. and Israeli strikes.\n\n“All relief bases, ambulance teams, debris removal teams, search and rescue teams, and medical units of the Red Crescent are on standby,” he said.\n\n“People must maintain at least a 100-meter distance from the impact sites and avoid gathering or crowding around those areas.”\n\n“All Red Crescent teams are present at impact sites,” he said.\n\n“More than 20 provinces have been hit,” Khaledi said, which implies the strikes are more widespread than earlier reports had suggested"

US president Donald Trump stated that he has launched 'major combat operations' in Iran.\n\nAnnouncing the news on his social media platform Truth Social, during an eight-minute video, he said: \"A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime. A vicious group of very hard, terrible people. Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Among the regime’s very first acts was to back a violent takeover of the US Embassy in Tehran, holding dozens of American hostages for 444 days. In 1983, Iran’s proxies carried out the marine barracks bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American military personnel.\"\n\nHe went on to say: \"Iran is the world’s number one state sponsor of terror, and just recently killed tens of thousands of its own citizens on the street as they protested. It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon. I’ll say it again, they can never have a nuclear weapon.\"\n\nSince his announcement the British Foreign Office has warned Brits abroad to shelter in place and has advised against travel to the region. Latest reports say there are no reported American casualties from Iran’s retaliatory strikes against US military facilities in Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, UAE and Qatar.\n\nThere is damage to infrastructure in Bahrain after Iran struck the Fifth Fleet, the officials said, but it is unclear whether the base itself sustained damage. The officials stressed that the situation is fluid and the casualty and damage assessment is ‘as of now’ with US and Israeli strikes set to continue and Iran expected to keep up its retaliations."

He also became so paranoid that his food was being poisoned and \"knew that he was a target.\"\n\nHuntley reportedly bought fast food and confectionary from the shop, causing his weight to balloon.

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

            "content": "Formula One star Charles Leclerc ties the knot with influencer Alexandra Saint Mleux as couple are spotted driving off in £9m vintage Ferrari in stunning Monaco backdrop\n\nCharles Leclerc and his influencer partner Alexandra Saint Mleux appear to have tied the knot.\n\nThe couple were filmed driving off in a vintage Ferrari on a picturesque coastal road, with Saint Mleux, 23, wearing a white dress and holding flowers and the driver decked out in a white suit.\n\nBehind them were three motorbikes and a black Mercedes in the clip widely shared on social media.\n\nNeither Leclerc, 28, or his bride have confirmed the news on their channels at time of writing.\n\nOf course, the driver opted for an iconic car for the big day, opting for a 1957 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa, which costs around £9million.\n\nIt is one of the most valuable vintage Ferraris, particularly given the racing success and significance of the model for the legendary Italian company.\n\nWEDDING OF THE YEAR 🙂‍↕️💍 pic.twitter.com/AxbZgr8Kqf — nik ⋆.𐙚 ̊ (@sainzzleclerc) February 28, 2026\n\nCharles Leclerc and his other half were seen driving away in a £9million Ferrari\n\nLeclerc had announced his engagement to his other half only last November and it appears as though there has been a quick turnaround for the wedding.\n\nThe Monaco-based driver, born in Monte Carlo, shared the news on Instagram, captioning an array of romantic photos with the caption 'Mr and Mrs Leclerc', which included their dog Leo - who is fast becoming popular with F1 fans in his own right.\n\nLeclerc and Saint Mleux have been dating since early 2023, when they were spotted together at Paris Fashion Week that March.\n\nLater in the year, shortly after Leclerc confirmed he was in a relationship but stopped short of naming Saint Mleux, they stepped out together at Wimbledon to confirm their relationship.\n\nAnd it appears that Leclerc, worth an estimated £92m, splashed out big on the ring.\n\nAccording to Laura Taylor, a jeweller specialising in engagement rings at Lorel Diamonds, Saint Mleux's ring is worth at least £400,000.\n\n'Alexandra’s engagement ring features a gorgeous oval cut diamond set on a platinum pavé band. The diamond looks to be around 5 to 6 carats, with a truly bright appearance that suggests it’s of exceptional quality,' Taylor said to the Daily Mail.\n\n'If the diamond is natural and of exceptional quality, I’d estimate the ring to be worth upwards of £400,000.'\n\nLeclerc has been in two high-profile relationships before. He dated Italian model Giada Gianna for four years, with the couple splitting up in 2019.\n\nLeclerc announced his engagement to 23-year-old model Alexandra Saint Mleux last year\n\nThe model and influencer has more than three million followers on Instagram alone\n\nAnd after that, the Formula 1 star was with famous architect Charlotte Sine, breaking up in December 2022.\n\nAs for Saint Mleux, the couple tend to keep their relationship out of the spotlight as much as possible. But back in June, they appeared on the red carpet together in New York for the premiere of the F1 movie.\n\nLeclerc will soon be turning his attention back to the track, with the Ferrari driver finishing fifth in the standings last season.\n\n\n\nThe first race of the new campaign will be the Australian GP on March 8."

Some are taking up direct flights into Perth with Qantas, prior to a 3hr 35min internal connection to Melbourne.\n\nSmoke rises in the sky in Bahrain after Iranian missiles targeted a US naval base, with the country due to host a Grand Prix there on April 12\n\nA Formula spokesman said: ‘Our next three races are in Australia, China and Japan, not in the Middle East – those races are not for a number of weeks.\n\n‘As always, we closely monitor any situation like this and work closely with relevant authorities.’\n\nF1 insist the upcoming rounds in Bahrain, on April 12, and Saudi Arabia, the following week, remain on the calendar.\n\n\n\nHowever, it is understood F1 bosses have contingency plans in place should the upheaval in the region necessitate a change of venue to maintain their 24-race world championship."

            "content": "Former world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr has announced a surprise return to the ring, revealing plans for a fourth comeback that will begin with an exhibition against Mike Tyson before a blockbuster professional rematch with Manny Pacquiao later this year.\n\nThe rivals are set to meet again on September 19 at the Sphere - 11 years after their long-awaited 2015 showdown, when Mayweather claimed a unanimous-decision victory in the so-called 'Fight of the Century.'\n\nPacquiao, now 47, returned to action in July 2025 and fought Mario Barrios to a majority draw for the WBC welterweight title, insisting his comeback is driven by a desire to become world champion again. Mayweather, meanwhile, says he 'still has what it takes to set more records,' despite questions regarding his financial status.\n\nA recent report by Business Insider suggested Mayweather’s widely publicised fortune may be overstated, citing liens, outstanding debts, foreclosures and heavily leveraged assets including property holdings and his private jet.\n\nBack in 2024, I caught a glimpse of life inside Mayweather's orbit - a whirlwind casino evening filled with luxury excess, eye-watering tips and one surprising moment of frugality.\n\nFloyd Mayweather invited Daily Mail Sport for a night out in Las Vegas in an extraordinary offer\n\nCharlotte Daly hit the strip with Mayweather for a big night out in Las Vegas (pictured above)\n\nWhen Floyd Mayweather invites you for a night out in Las Vegas, you know it will be extraordinary. Picture this: the neon lights of the strip reflecting off luxury cars, the pulsating energy of the city that never sleeps, and 'Money Mayweather' at the centre of it all.\n\nFrom exclusive cigar lounges to high-roller tables, this was no ordinary night out. We sipped 'Good Money Whiskey' and indulged in caviar before discussing Mayweather's relationship with his father, the key moments in his career, the current crop of boxers, and his exhibition earnings.\n\nIn true Mayweather style, he arrived at Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot, in a blacked-out SUV, wearing a £2,000 Gucci jacket and a gleaming Rolex. Fans clamoured for photos as he was greeted by models holding sparklers and a glowing Mayweather sign.\n\n'I do like the finer things in life', Mayweather quipped when asked about his love for luxury. 'I enjoy my cars and my watches but money don't make me, I make money.\n\n'I don't just keep all the money either, I give back to the less fortunate. My mother don't want for nothing, my loved ones don't want for anything. My team live a pretty good life. They travel the world, stay at five star hotels. But, the most important thing is, we are happy. I was happy before I made money. With or without money I am a happy person.'\n\nA fixture on the Vegas Strip with his 7,000-square-foot gentleman's club and top-tier boxing gym, Mayweather took charge behind the bar, crafting an Old Fashioned cocktail with his Good Money Whiskey - a brand now available in 10 states including Nevada, California, and Florida.\n\nWhen handed the five-year-old whiskey, Mayweather joked, 'She's come all the way from the UK, and you're giving her the five-year-old whiskey? She deserves the 10-year!'\n\nThough not drinking himself, Mayweather passed the cocktail with a knowing smile. 'It's just like boxing,' he said confidently. 'I had the best team, so I got the best results. I've got the best team working on my brands, too. Just try it and you'll see.'\n\nIn true Mayweather style, he arrived at Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot, in a blacked-out SUV, wearing a £2,000 Gucci jacket and a gleaming Rolex\n\nWith a drink in hand, we moved to Mayweather's exclusive area, adorned with Le Bon Argent Champagne and attentive waitresses ensuring my glass was always full. Intrigued by highlight reels of his career playing on the screens overhead, I asked the boxing legend about his favorite memory.\n\n'I'm not sure which one was my favourite fight but the best fighter I ever fought probably was Manny Pacquiao. I can see why he won so many fights, it's all the moves he would make. But, I reckon the roughest fight I ever had was Emanuel Augustus, he was very tough competitor. When I faced him, I think he was 26 with 14 losses but extremely tough.\n\n'That being said, I think around half of my 50 fights were world title fights, so they were all good fights'.\n\nMayweather faced and defeated some of the biggest names in boxing, including Manny Pacquiao, Oscar De La Hoya, and Canelo Alvarez. He also claimed world titles in five different weight classes: Super Featherweight, Lightweight, Light Welterweight, Welterweight, and Light Middleweight.\n\nBut the true highlight of his career was walking away unharmed—a poignant topic given his father and uncle, Roger, both suffered neurological damage resulting in memory loss.\n\n'The real highlight of my career is that I am still able to communicate. That I am still able to speak well. I am still able to read and write. I am able to spend time with my children and I am able to travel. I still have all my faculties. That's the part about my career I am most pleased with. Not everyone gets that luxury and I've seen it first hand.'\n\nMayweather's relationship with his father has been complex but pivotal. Mayweather Sr. was instrumental in shaping his son's career, developing the defensive style that became his hallmark. Despite public disagreements and periods of estrangement, their bond remains strong.\n\n'My dad was my inspiration growing up. Without my dad I wouldn't have any of this. Without my dad I wouldn't have the crazy real estate portfolio I have. I wouldn't have met my two best friends, James McNair and Ricki Brazil. I wouldn't be here with you today. My dad is my driving force, my dad is everything to me.'\n\nFans clamoured for photos with him as he made his way to Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot\n\nA stark contrast to when Mayweather lashed out at his father in 2011, shouting: 'You couldn't fight for s***. You weren't nothing but a motherf***ing cab driver... bum a** trainer. You weren't s*** as a fighter, so how you gonna be something as a trainer. Get the f*** out my gym f*****t!'.\n\nWhile other kids played, Mayweather's childhood was a whirlwind of responsibilities, juggling time between caring for his drug-addict mother and training with his father.\n\n'My dad was about business, ever since I was a kid. From 1985, my dad had me running five miles a day. He wouldn't let me run in sneakers either. He made me run five miles every day in combat boots while I was a child.\n\n'He also brought me out into the garden and made me chop wood. He always told me, there is no room for excuses. He said no matter how many fights you win, it's never good enough, you can always get better. There is always room for growth.\n\n'But, my dad gave me structure. He helped mould me into the man I am today. A man of honour, a man of dignity. A stand-up guy. A person that believes he can get better. It's all because of my father.'\n\nAs we chatted, one of Floyd's friends casually offered spoonfuls of caviar around the room. This wasn't your average caviar; it was the kind that likely costs more than my entire monthly salary. The nonchalant manner in which it was served, however, made it seem like an everyday snack.\n\nMeanwhile, Eddie Griffin, a comedian from American sitcom Malcolm & Eddie, flitted around the room casually cracking jokes before diving into the high-stakes action at the casino tables.\n\nHaving accompanied him to the high-roller area, I watched in awe as players casually dropped $500k per round on craps. It was clear I'd be spectating rather than participating in this high-rolling spectacle.\n\nA fixture on the Vegas Strip with his 7,000-square-foot gentleman's club and top-tier boxing gym, Mayweather took charge behind the bar, crafting an Old Fashioned cocktail\n\nWhile Mayweather wasn't one to splurge at the tables, he was exceptionally generous with his tips. When $500 slipped from his pocket, he handed it to a waitress without hesitation and quickly pulled out another $500 for her colleague, making sure everyone felt appreciated.\n\nMayweather's wealth stems from his boxing prowess. Known for his defensive mastery and unmatched ring IQ, he earned the nickname 'Pretty Boy' for his flawless, unmarked face. He firmly believes no boxer will ever match his unique skills.\n\n'There will never be another boxer like me because my IQ was just on another level. You've got guys that have fast hands, you've got guys who have great punching power but they will never compete with my IQ.\n\n'My IQ was just on a whole different level. I could make adjustments that other people wouldn't be able to do. Go look at the Shane Mosley fight. Guy hit me with a couple of good shots, I came back the next round and put on a master class.\n\n'I was zoned in and knew exactly what he was going to do. I didn't hear the crowd, I didn't hear my trainer, I just listened to myself. I knew exactly what he was going to do. I had the ability to turn a fight on its head like that. Completely change the dynamic of a fight. That's what it takes, a sharp mind, a good chin and the heart of a lion.'\n\nYet, despite his undefeated boxing record (50-0) and iconic status, Mayweather acknowledged personal defeats beyond the ring.\n\n'Losing my uncle was a defeat. Losing my grandmother was a defeat. Losing my housekeeper of 20-something years was a defeat. Losing the mother of my children was a defeat. Losing my best friend was a defeat. I have been defeated in ways like that. Everything you go through in life is an experience you can grow from. I just try to use those experiences to become stronger every day.'\n\nMayweather's resilience in the face of such personal trials is mirrored in his approach to the racism he faced during his career.\n\nEddie Griffin, comedian from American sitcom Malcolm & Eddie, flitted around the room casually cracking jokes before diving into the high-stakes action at the casino tables\n\nGriffin joking told Mayweather he was going to steal a couple bottles of his whiskey\n\n'You're going to get racism and you're going to have to deal with it. I knew I was going to deal with it but that never stopped me from being who I wanted to be. It never stopped me from believing in myself.\n\n'It was never going to stop me from taking myself to the top. I knew I was the best and nothing was going to hold me back. There are many fighters that will come after me that will experience the same thing.\n\n'I want them to be great and I don't want them to be held back by it. I want them to surpass me if they can. Records are there to be broken but there will never be another Floyd Mayweather. I know that for a fact.'\n\nEven in retirement, Mayweather keeps his love for boxing alive through exhibition bouts, taking on the likes of Deji Olatunji, Tenshin Nasukawa, and Logan Paul.\n\nHowever, the pinnacle was his 2017 clash with MMA's Conor McGregor. While Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and LeBron James collectively earned $259 million that year, Mayweather surpassed that sum in a single night, shattering boxing's pay-per-view record with 6.5 million buys.\n\n'People have such a problem with my exhibitions. Jeff Bezos is well off but he's still working. Warren Buffett, he's probably in his 90's now and he's still working. The Walton's who own Walmart are still working. Elon Musk is still working. So, it's okay for me to work.\n\n'There is no risk with these exhibitions. I am taking on former MMA guys and YouTubers. They can't get near me. It's not a crime for me to have some fun with them and entertain the crowd.\n\n'I feel like I deserve it. I am still one of the most talked fighters in the sport of boxing and I'm not even boxing professionally anymore. So, it's only right I am getting the payday to match it. I have plenty of offers I could show you on my phone. $300million, $100million, $50million, $20million, $17million. They are all offers sat on my phone right now. It all depends but if you pay, we play. It's as simple as that.'\n\nMayweather popped into the local doughnut shop. After ordering two boxes of doughnuts, Mayweather was floored when he was told the total would be $90 (pictured above)\n\nPulling out a thick wad of cash, he went to pay before pausing dramatically, spreading the bills across his hands and playfully quipping 'I've got the money, I just don't want to spend it!'\n\nThe hilarious encounter ended with him handing over the money and taking the doughnuts\n\nDespite having the potential to rake in $300million from an exhibition bout and being nicknamed 'Money Mayweather,' the 47-year-old had a hilariously human moment at the end of our night out.\n\nJust as Brits might hit a kebab shop on their way home, Mayweather popped into the local doughnut shop. After ordering two boxes of doughnuts, Mayweather was floored when he was told the total would be $90.\n\nPulling out a thick wad of cash, he went to pay before pausing dramatically, spreading the bills across his hands and playfully quipping 'I've got the money, I just don't want to spend it!'.\n\nMayweather will return to the ring this summer for a rematch against John Gotti III - the grandson of the late mob boss - having first faced the 31-year-old back in June 2023, with the fight ending in chaos after a brawl broke out when people stormed the ring.\n\nThe Good Money is a global brand created in direct partnership with Floyd Mayweather. The brand produces high-quality Champagne and Whisky, with their bourbon available to purchase at large retailers such as Total Wine, Specs, Lee's Liquors and WalMart."

            "content": "Richard Keys forced off air at Middle East-based broadcaster with UK government issuing 'take immediate shelter' warning to Brits abroad following US bombing of Iran\n\nRichard Keys was forced off air with beIN Sports after the UK government warned Brits abroad to 'take immediate shelter' following the US bombing of Iran.\n\nThe former Sky Sports presenter took to X, writing: 'Thank you all for your messages. It was a bit lively earlier. I don’t have space to express my feelings about that idiot Trump. No show today.\n\n'You’ll be in the capable hands of our colleagues in London. Thoughts & prayers for everyone in our region. Ramadan Kareem.'\n\nHis comment came after the UK government's foreign office had issued a stark warning.\n\n'Due to reported missile attacks, British nationals in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates should immediately shelter in place,' came the instruction.\n\n'Remain indoors in a secure location, avoid all travel and follow instructions from the local authorities.'\n\nRichard Keys was forced off air after Brits abroad were warned to take shelter\n\nSmoke rises in Iran after a bomb strike from the US and Israel with conflict escalating\n\nKeys, who has lived in Qatar for 13 years while working as a presenter for the sports channel, has been told by the network that his contract will not be renewed when it expires at the end of the football season but is still working up until that point.\n\nOn Saturday morning, however, he was unable to take to the airwaves, with the frightening instability in the Middle East causing chaos in the region.\n\nThe US and Israel launched an attack on Iran, with President Donald Trump warning 'major combat operations' are taking place, as they aim for regime change.\n\nIsrael say Iran have launched retaliatory strikes of their own and explosions have been heard in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait.\n\nDoha, the capital of Qatar, is next to largest US airbase in the Middle East at Al Udaid, which could be one of the targets for Iranian strikes.\n\nKeys and beIN are based in Qatar and the presenter made it clear what he thought of the military action, calling Trump an 'idiot'.\n\nIn a video statement to the world, Trump had earlier urged the Iranian people to rise up and topple the clerical government.\n\n'When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations,' he declared.\n\nHe also said the Iranian army would be given 'immunity' if they laid down arms - vowing that they would face 'certain death' if they chose the alternative.\n\nKeys called US president Donald Trump an 'idiot' after he was forced off air\n\nEarlier this year, the Iranian government killed 6,480 during widespread protests against their rule. Trump said the government 'would pay a big price' and promised help is on the way.\n\nThe ramifications of the conflict and possible escalation are still not known but the impact on the region is already significant, with Keys' no-show just a microscopic example.\n\nThe controversial broadcaster and long-time colleague Andy Gray, 70, have resided in Doha since 2013, two years after they both lost their jobs at Sky Sports in the wake of a sexism scandal.\n\nA series of sexist remarks made by Keys and Gray about female assistant referee Sian Massey were picked up and leaked in January 2011 when they thought their microphones were off.\n\nGray was sacked by Sky Sports after a video showing him making inappropriate comments to presenter Charlotte Jackson was released. Keys resigned from his £500,000-a-year role shortly afterwards.\n\nKeys, 68, is set to move in permanently with his 37-year-old wife, Lucie Rose, with whom he has been in a long-distance relationship since they secretly married in a private £20,000 ceremony in Devon in June 2023.\n\nHis son Joshua and daughter Jemma, who was previously one of Lucie Rose's closest friends before her romantic involvement with Keys, did not attend the wedding.\n\nThe presenter split with Julia Keys after 36 years of marriage when news of his shock relationship emerged in 2016, with his ex-wife revealing how the affair 'devastated' her as she recovered from thyroid cancer and also wrecked the lives of their two children.\n\nLucie Rose, above, was previously one of Keys' daughter's best friends before their romance\n\nKeys (centre) pictured with his ex-wife Julia (left) and their daughter Jemma (right)\n\nJulia said the affair ruined the career of her Hollyoaks actress daughter as she spiralled into alcoholism and depression. Jemma also faced legal action over a string of abusive texts she sent to Lucie Rose before charges were dropped by prosecutors.\n\nSince joining beIN Sports, Keys and Gray have fronted coverage of the Premier League and Champions League across 24 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, while also presenting for the network at the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\n\nIt is also claimed that the broadcasting pair could quit live football presenting altogether when they return to the UK.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Richard Keys told the Mail: 'Richard decided some months ago that, after 13 great years, the time had come to leave beIN with Andy. Following his decision it was mutually agreed that his final broadcasts for the channel would be in May this year.'"

            "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo the PLAYER-OWNER! Spanish second division side opens door to 'extraordinary' return to Europe after superstar, 41, purchased 25 per cent stake in club\n\nUD Almeria manager Rubi has said that it would be ‘extraordinary and very special’ for new co-owner Cristiano Ronaldo to play for them.\n\nEarlier this week, it was announced that the Portuguese superstar had purchased 25 per cent of the second-tier Spanish side’s shares through his CR7 Sports Investments company.\n\nThe pre-match press conference that preceded Almeria’s away draw with Albacete was dominated by discussion of Ronaldo’s investment and whether he could be involved as a player-owner.\n\n‘From our position, we are very happy. Of course, we welcome him. I think it’s great news because someone like him, with his complete knowledge of the sport and football, can help a club like ours,’ Rubi said.\n\n‘It’s very exciting for the entire club, the city and the province. You already know the good relationship Cristiano has with the owners.\n\n‘(Playing for the side) is a question for him, but it would be something extraordinary and very special. This is his club, and if he wants to continue playing, whoever the coach is here would welcome him with open arms. I have no doubt about that.’\n\nRonaldo's purchase of UD Almeria comes just over a year after he hinted he would like to own his former club Manchester United\n\nThe 41-year-old, who was named a billionaire by Forbes last year, has offered a glimpse into what the future holds when he eventually hangs up his boots after a glittering career.\n\nWhile the financial terms have not been disclosed, the deal is considered a ‘long-term strategic investment’, according to a report.\n\nRonaldo’s purchase of UD Almeria comes just over a year after he hinted he would like to own his former club, Manchester United.\n\nHis involvement also comes a year after the Spanish second division side were taken over by a Saudi investment group in May 2025.\n\nIt is understood that Ronaldo has a close relationship with the group’s leader, Mohamed Al Khereiji, who is reported to have helped facilitate his move to Al-Nassr in 2022 after his acrimonious exit from Manchester United.\n\nAl Khereiji, UD Almeria club president, said: ‘We are very pleased that Cristiano has chosen our club to invest in.\n\n‘He is regarded as the greatest to ever play the game, he knows the Spanish leagues very well and he understands the potential of what we are building here, both in terms of the team and the academy.’\n\nThe club, which is four years younger than their new owner, currently sit third in Spain’s second division, with one point separating them from league leaders Racing, who have a game in hand.\n\nRonaldo’s investment comes just over a year after he hinted that he would like to buy his former club, Manchester United.\n\n‘(The) Premier League, it’s the most difficult league in the world,’ he said.\n\n‘All the teams are good, all the teams fight, all the teams run, all the teams are strong. Football is different right now. There are no easy games any more.\n\n‘They need, I said this one year and a half ago, and I will continue to say it: the problem is not the coaches, it’s like... I always give this example... it’s like an aquarium.\n\n‘If you have the fish inside and he’s sick and you take him out and you fix the problem and you put him again in an aquarium, he will be sick again.\n\n‘The problem of Manchester United is the same. The problem is not always the coach. It’s much more than that.\n\n\n\n‘If I am the owner of the club, I will make things clear and adjust things that are bad there.’"

            "content": "Inside a private cinema room on the ground floor of a modern apartment block in Canary Wharf, Aaron Wan-Bissaka is enjoying something rarely afforded to professional footballers: a moment of peace and quiet.\n\nIt is his day off. Dressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, he sinks into a plush seat with the same composed demeanour that has defined his game. Afterwards, he says with a smile, the plan is simple: take a nap.\n\nThat understated presence has long shaped Wan-Bissaka’s identity, a player more comfortable letting performances speak for themselves than seeking attention. Now with West Ham after a formative spell at Manchester United, he is in reflective mood, revisiting a journey that has carried him from London estates to Old Trafford and back again.\n\nAs the conversation unfolds, the story is as much about family and sacrifice as it is about football. Long before the bright lights of the Premier League, Wan-Bissaka’s football education began on the patch of grass outside his childhood home.\n\n'I was probably age five when I first fell in love with football,' he says. 'It was just me and my brother in the estate playing around with a ball. We would go out to the green opposite our house to play. We'd call it our Wembley.\n\n'It didn’t really click until around 16, when I realised there was a genuine chance of becoming a professional. That’s when I saw the opportunity to put my foot down and properly chase the dream.'\n\nDressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, Aaron Wan-Bissaka is in reflective mood when he meets Daily Mail Sport\n\nThough Wan-Bissaka grew up idolising Thierry Henry, he has grown into a highly dependable, no-nonsense full back\n\nLike many London kids of his generation, his first football idol was Thierry Henry. 'I always wanted to be him,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'Honestly, I used to have this vision of me being him, and growing up to be that sort of player. He was my idol. I think it was because of his composure. He scored lots of goals but he also carried the team. He was a leader. My whole family were Arsenal fans when I was growing up, too.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s boyhood dream contrasts with his reputation as a no-nonsense defender, and the 28-year-old’s career was ultimately forged through family resilience and a demanding relationship with his father.\n\n'I didn't realise how much my parents were sacrificing for my dream to begin with,' he says. 'When I got into secondary school, which is the age when you start to want things like trainers and boots, I was quite demanding. But they would brush it aside and be like, \"You have to wait a couple of months\". That's when I realised that it wasn't easy for my parents to give me the things I was asking for.\n\n'They worked cleaning jobs to afford my boots and my dad would get in trouble for leaving work early to bring me to training.'\n\nHis father Ambrose’s influence came through discipline rather than praise. 'It was difficult because there was a language barrier between us. His English wasn't great and my French wasn't great so there were only a few words exchanged at times,' recalls Wan-Bissaka, who has now played nine times for the country of his father's birth, DR Congo. They will face either New Caledonia or Jamaica next month in FIFA's inter-confederation play-offs in Zapopan, Mexico, for a place at this summer's World Cup.\n\n'We mainly spoke about football. But he was always critiquing me or telling me what I could do better. It was never praise. I have to say, I found it confusing at the time. I always wondered why he wouldn't praise me. I used to question myself: \"Am I not doing enough?\"'\n\n'Even after I scored, I would come off the pitch and he wouldn't be pleased. I used to just think to myself, \"Is one goal not enough?\" But then as I got older I started to understand it. He just wanted me to test myself and become the best version of myself.'\n\nAfter taking to Premier League life with ease at Crystal Palace, where he won player of the year in his first full season in senior football, a £50million move to United soon followed. It was the biggest step of Wan-Bissaka's career - and one of the most challenging periods of his life.\n\nWan-Bissaka felt extremely homesick after making a big-money move to Manchester United. 'Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep,' he admits\n\nThe defender's positive relationship with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a source of reassurance. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well,' says Wan-Bissaka of his former boss\n\n'When I moved to United, I really missed home, my family and friends especially,' he reveals. 'After training, I used to take the train back to London almost every day. It’s only about two hours, but it’s still a big commitment, and eventually it became exhausting, so I knew I had to stop.\n\n'It was something I wasn’t used to at all. I’d always been comfortable at home in London, surrounded by familiar people and places, so for everything to change overnight was difficult to adapt to. Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep. I struggled. It was probably the lowest I’d felt.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s big-money arrival from Palace in 2019 - which coincided with a first England call-up, though he was never capped due to injury - came with a mountain of expectation. But he quickly became a fixture in the United XI, starting more matches than any player across Europe’s top-five leagues in 2020-21.\n\nHis early relationship with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer offered reassurance amid his struggles off the pitch.\n\n'My relationship with Ole was good from the start,' he recalls. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well, and I think the rest of the players felt the same about him. He’s the kind of manager who backs you straight away. Once he gives you a job to do, it’s up to you to trust yourself and go out and deliver it.'\n\nManagerial turnover would later test that security, particularly under Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag.\n\n'Obviously, it’s football, every manager has their preferences,' he says. 'They might like you or they might not, and that’s just part of the game. When he (Rangnick) came in, it wasn’t the best period for me and there was a lot of criticism around…\n\n'It was difficult when Erik ten Hag arrived - as soon as he did, he told me I wasn’t in his plans. But when I tried to leave, he said he didn’t want me to go. I couldn't understand it. That was tough mentally, because it left me wondering what I was supposed to do next.\n\nWan-Bissaka initially struggled to gel as effectively with Solskjaer's successors, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag\n\nHis relationship with Ten Hag ultimately improved, and the pair lifted the Carabao Cup with United in 2023\n\n'I just kept my head down and told myself to keep training, keep improving, and play my game. Staying motivated was hard though, especially when you’re training without the clear goal of playing.\n\n'But the people around me guided me in the right way and encouraged me to keep going. Eventually things turned around and started to improve. You could say I changed or developed tactically under him, because that was something he wanted.'\n\nClarity, he says, is invaluable. And something the right back received from Michael Carrick. He speaks highly of United's recently-appointed interim boss, praising the simplicity of his messaging during his previous caretaker spell in 2021.\n\nNo wonder, then, that he backs Carrick to be given the permanent job after such an impressive start second time around.\n\n'He's someone you can trust,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'He will also trust you back if you buy into him and what he's looking to do. If you trust him, he will trust you.\n\n'He was quite simple in what he wanted from you. The boys were happy with him and the games he had when he was the manager. With him back at the club now, they are in a good place as a team. I think he should be given the full-time role. I think he deserves it.'\n\nIf Manchester represented pressure and growth, West Ham has provided renewal. The move back to London offered proximity to family and a fresh football environment.\n\nHis impressive form in his debut season saw him named 'Hammer of the Year' in May, beating out fan favourite Jarrod Bowen to the award.\n\nWan-Bissaka opens up to Daily Mail Sport's Charlotte Daly about his career - both the highs and the lows\n\n'At West Ham, I’ve been really happy with how things have been going,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'You can probably tell from the smile on my face'\n\nThough the club have struggled this season - sitting in the relegation zone with 11 games to go, despite an upturn in form under Nuno Espirito Santo - he has no regrets about making the move.\n\n'I was in two minds (about moving initially), to be honest,' he says. 'I had a year left on my contract, but I felt I needed to get back on my feet and start playing regularly - not just every couple of games.\n\n'Looking back on my time at Manchester United, I’m grateful for it. Those experiences made me who I am today and helped me both on and off the pitch, especially mentally.\n\n'With all the noise and scrutiny at a club like United, a change of environment can make a big difference. At West Ham, it’s not as intense… I’ve been really happy with how things have been going. You can probably tell from the smile on my face every day. I am playing with a smile too.'"

            "content": "IRELAND head coach Andy Farrell is entitled to feel a degree of bemusement around the punditry and coverage of this Six Nations campaign.\n\nDespite the considerable credit he had built up over the years, there was a fair whack of criticism flung his way following the opening night hammering in France, including justifiable question marks over his long-term planning and loyalty to the old guard.\n\nBut Farrell got little credit when he then ripped up the script with his team selection to face Italy, leaving out established frontliners and rolling the dice on promising newcomers. The result was a surge of energy through the Ireland squad.\n\nA SENSE OF JEOPARDY\n\nAll of a sudden, there was a genuine sense of jeopardy, a brutal realisation that, no matter how big your reputation or how storied your career, if you do not perform to the standards expected, you are out.\n\nIcon: Andy Farrell is adored by Irish rugby supporters but the Ireland head coach was on the receiving end of heavy criticism after two games of this Six Nations Championship\n\nThis had not been the case previously on Farrell’s watch, with the general policy revolving around running the same established names almost regardless of form, an approach that persevered even after the 2023 World Cup failure.\n\nIt was a defiant change of direction, an era-altering policy shift, yet it was largely dismissed as ‘rotation’ for the perceived lesser challenge of facing the Italians at home.\n\nFor some, this correspondent included, the subsequent victory over Italy was hugely positive.\n\nYes, there were lots of errors and areas to improve in a win that could be more readily described as ‘nervy’ than ‘convincing’, but Italy are a decent side now and Ireland digging themselves out of a hole with a bunch of new faces catching the eye was a major plus.\n\nOn the front foot: Farrell did not get enough recognition for his bold selection calls against Italy\n\nOr so we thought…\n\nIt quickly became apparent that this was a minority opinion as the widespread reaction across was doom and gloom – with little recognition of what Farrell was, belatedly, trying to do in terms of widening options.\n\n‘TERMINAL DECLINE’\n\nPhrases like ‘terminal decline’ and ‘irreversible recession’ abounded after the Italy game and the general consensus was that Ireland’s efforts to extricate themselves from the deep trough they now found themselves in ‘could take years’.\n\nIt took Farrell a week.\n\nWhen he reinstated a clutch of his tried-and-trusted for the (on paper) daunting trip to Twickenham, they returned to a side re-energised by the Italy reshuffle and ruthlessly determined to prove their worth, driven by the unsettling knowledge that their places were no longer guaranteed.\n\nThe result was a performance of ferocious intensity that proved far too much for a brittle England side, still assailed with doubt after their shock Murrayfield humiliation.\n\nToo much: Ireland played with far greater intensity than England in their Twickenham win\n\nIt was a euphoric occasion for Irish rugby and, suddenly, the same heads who had been talking about the dark days being here to stay, did a 180 with frothy talk of ‘rebirth’ and ‘rejuvenation’.\n\nThere is a tendency in modern media – driven by the internet’s insatiable demand for clip-worthy reaction, and over-reaction – to get mired in the immediate.\n\nThere is also a lemming-like, ‘we are all individuals’ aspect to rugby analysis where nearly everyone dives frantically for the consensus and starts parrotting the same phrase du jour along the way.\n\nThis month it was ‘intent’ after Farrell questioned the lack of it from his players following their Paris pummelling.\n\nAs soon as he said it, the word ‘intent’ was being sprinkled excitedly across Irish rugby analysis, as though pundits had been gifted a secret sauce to use at will.\n\nEuphoria: Caelan Doris and Tadhg Beirne celebrate at the final whistle in Twickenham\n\nFarrell must be shaking his head at it all.\n\nNow, post Twickenham, the analysis has shifted to the head coach’s next career move, with stories linking Farrell to a return to his old haunt of Saracens in English rugby on a whopping €1.2million contract.\n\nThis has led to a cacophony of calls for Farrell to be handed an extended Ireland contract to keep at the helm for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnother knee-jerk, instant reaction to breaking events when it would be better to step back and assess the overall picture.\n\nTHE PENNY FINALLY DROPS\n\nFarrell’s time with Ireland has been a remarkable story of progression and success – with the obvious exception of the World Cup.\n\nAnd now, finally, it appears as though the penny has dropped and he is viewing everything through the prism of next year’s World Cup – because the rhetoric from Farrell, and his assistants, is radically different to what we have heard before.\n\nAfter the 2023 disappointment, it was ‘as we were’ with the message that the ‘journey continues’ and, while Farrell oversaw a thumping win over France in Marseille and landed a Six Nations, it all seemed a little ‘after the Lord Mayor’s show’.\n\nThis Six Nations feels a whole lot different, the right attitude seems to have been adopted (namely that this tournament is a means to a World Cup end) as Ireland continue to assess options for down the road.\n\nEven in the euphoria of the win over England last weekend, Farrell impressed hugely with his calm, bigger picture observations.\n\nMindset shift: Farrell has realised the need to look down the road and broaden his options\n\n‘I didn’t care whether we won or lost today, just whether we grew as a group because we know where we want to go,’ he said afterwards.\n\nIrish rugby has been waiting to hear those words from a head coach for 15 years.\n\nThe message, and mind shift, appears to have been embraced by everyone in camp, based on Johnny Sexton’s observations when asked about the contest for his old No 10 jersey between Jack Crowley, Sam Prendergast, Harry Byrne and Ciaran Frawley.\n\n‘All the criticism from previous World Cup cycles is that we did not develop guys and we have relied too heavily on one player in some positions,’ said Sexton, referencing the over-dependence on his own role at the 2015, 2019 and 2023 World Cups.\n\n‘So, we are doing it a different way now.’\n\nAmen to that.\n\nTHE LAST DANCE\n\nWhatever way you look at it, Farrell has been a phenomenally good coach for Ireland since coming on board as Joe Schmidt’s defensive coordinator in 2016.\n\nBy the time of the World Cup in Australia next year, the Englishman will have been 11 years working for the IRFU and living in this country, where he and his family are known to be very happily settled.\n\nHowever, every coach, no matter how talented, popular or successful they are, has a shelf life, and when his contract expires next year, it feels like a natural conclusion to this Irish rugby chapter.\n\nThe concern is that, if the IRFU were to make that decision and announce it later this year, there is the danger of Farrell becoming a ‘lame duck’ coach.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that this is what happened to Joe Schmidt in 2019 after Farrell was announced as the Kiwi’s successor a year out.\n\nThe New Zealander, who had been the most influential and transformative head coach in Irish rugby history up to that point, had difficulties selling his message in his final year as players began to gravitate towards his successor.\n\nHowever, there is less chance of that happening this time around.\n\nFor Farrell and the core of the squad he has been loyal to over the past five years, it’s ‘Last Dance’ time – the final chance to crack the World Cup code.\n\nThat incentive would be hugely motivating and more than enough to keep Farrell and the likes of Tadhg Furlong, Andrew Porter, Tadhg Beirne, Josh van der Flier, Jamison Gibson-Park and Garry Ringrose right on message through to the conclusion of Australia 2027.\n\nDown and out: Eddie O'Sullivan was given a new deal prior to the 2007 World Cup only for a highly-rated Ireland side to crash out at the pool stages with the coach gone not long after\n\nThe alternative approach, and one that has widespread support, is to hand Farrell another deal to keep him on board for yet another World Cup cycle – but Ireland have been burned this way before, most famously in 2007.\n\nThat summer, prior to the World Cup in France, the IRFU extended Eddie O’Sullivan’s contract and when the announcement was made to the squad, the story goes that, rather than the standing ovation which had been possibly expected, there was an awkward shuffling of feet and half-hearted murmurings of congratulations.\n\nIt was reflective of a bubbling desire for change, amid fringe frustration at O’Sullivan’s loyalty-driven selection policy, and when Ireland crashed horribly at that tournament, there was an enormous backlash against the contract extension and the head coach was gone within a matter of months.\n\nThere are obvious differences between the O’Sullivan landscape then and Farrell’s now – not least the English man’s focus on keeping a happy camp.\n\nBut, when you look at how a Farrell contract extension plays out, it does not make much sense.\n\nIf Ireland did manage to finally have a successful World Cup and reach a first semi-final or go further, it would be a tough mental challenge to start from scratch again on yet another four-year cycle, especially with the complication of the Lions tour to New Zealand in 2029 which Farrell is known to be keen to lead.\n\nAlternatively, if Ireland bombed out yet again at the quarter-final stage, or earlier, there would be a massive outcry for change and Farrell’s position would surely be untenable, regardless of past achievements.\n\nSuccession plan: Ronan O'Gara would be the ideal man to take over from Farrell next year\n\nFar better to take the ‘Last Dance’ approach, confirm Farrell’s departure after the World Cup, announce his replacement – ideally Ronan O’Gara – and pour everything into going out on a high.\n\nPERFECT ENDING\n\nAs for Farrell’s next move, he is not short of options. Saracens have hotly denied any approach or €1.2m contract offer but those words can be taken with a large dollop of salt – this is Sarries we are talking about, after all.\n\nEngland would also appear a highly plausible option; the RFU blazers watching Farrell’s team dismantle Steve Borthwick’s side in Twickenham last weekend would surely have been thinking how to break the bank to get the proud Englishman back on board – and few here could quibble if they did.\n\nWhatever happens, the good news for Ireland is that Farrell appears to have got his focus back in a big way following the drift post-2023.\n\nThat bodes extremely well for next year and what better way for Ireland’s greatest coach to step off the stage than by ending this 40-year World Cup hoodoo?\n\nThe perfect ending."

The Dutch tennis star was due to take to the court at 3pm but had to pull out due to a hamstring injury.\n\nMedvedev showed his class as he issued a statement to social media following the news. He said: \"Not how I want to win a final. Hoping the injury for @Griekii is not too bad and wishing him a speedy recovery.\"\n\nGriekspoor defeated Andrey Rublev 7-5, 7-6 to earn his place in the final against Medvedev, but could not take his place. The contender prevailed despite being visibly injured and struggling to run after the ball because of his hamstring injury.\n\nDubai champion Medvedev defeated top seed Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 6-2 in his semi-final clash. Speaking after earning his place in the final, the Russian said: \"It has been an amazing four matches, probably playing better and better each match, today being the best performance.\n\n\"If I can put an even better performance tomorrow, I will have my chances to win and that is what I am going to try to do.\"\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

The Minister of Defence of the United Arab Emirates said the country is at risk of bombing by Iran, with Abu Dhabi and Dubai said to be possible targets.\n\nAll flights into and out of Dubai Airports have been suspended. The airport confirmed that all flight operations at Dubai International (DXB) and Dubai World Central – Al Maktoum International (DWC) have been halted after the city was rocked by an explosion earlier today.\n\nA representative for Medvedev said they were trying to get the player out of the country, as the BNP Paribas Open is set to begin next week in Indian Wells, California.\n\nExplosions have been reported in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, with missiles also targeting a US naval base in Bahrain, among other targets across the region. Blasts have been heard in Abu Dhabi, capital of the UAE, with a death reported after debris fell on a residential area.\n\nThe UAE defence ministry said in a post on X a civilian had been killed in a \"blatant attack involving Iranian ballistic missiles\" after missile debris fell in a residential area killing a person \"of Asian nationality.\" They have not identified the victim.\n\nImage: UGC/UNKNOWN/AFP via Getty Images) UGC/UNKNOWN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nUS President Donald Trump made the intentions of the military intervention clear. The 79-year-old said: \"We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground.\n\n\"It will be totally, again, obliterated. We're going to annihilate their Navy. We're going to ensure that the region's terrorist proxies can no longer destabilise the region or the world, and attack our forces and no longer use their IEDs or roadside bombs, as they are sometimes called to so gravely wound and kill thousands and thousands of people, including many Americans.\n\n\"And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It is a very simple message. They will never have a nuclear weapon.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Now 30 years since the Dallas Cowboys' last Super Bowl appearance, owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he has let the fans down with his team's championship drought.\n\n\"I really can't accept just the thought of winning one Super Bowl and then what?\" Jones said Friday night from the NFL scouting combine. \"I've got more time on my clock than that in my mind. And so I don't see it that way. I see a chance to put a team together and basically be knocking at the edge and get another one or get a chance at a another one.\n\n\"It runs that way in my view. ... Make no mistake about it now, if you told me I could, because I've done a lot of hitchhiking in my life. ... I'd start here with you right now and hitchhike back to Dallas to win a Super Bowl.\"\n\nAfter a 7-9-1 finish in 2025, Jones promised change. One change will be the team's approach to free agency.\n\nThe Cowboys have not relied heavily on free agency in years, choosing to pick their spots to shore up holes on the roster with cost-effective players.\n\n\"I would bet that we will spend more money in free agency than we have,\" Jones said.\n\nTo do so, the Cowboys will first have to create salary cap room. Well over the $301.2 million cap that was set Friday, they will restructure the contracts of quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and left guard Tyler Smith, which will create $66 million of room.\n\nJones said the Cowboys will rework the contracts of defensive tackles Kenny Clark, Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa, who are scheduled to count around $63 million against the cap. With Clark and Williams, the Cowboys can look to add voidable years to their contracts then restructure that way.\n\n\"I want you to know that the only way to push more [out] is for me to go borrow some of my future, OK?\" Jones said. \"Expect me to go borrow some of my future.\"\n\nTo Jones, it goes beyond his personal Super Bowl wishes.\n\n\"I look at where we are with Dak and I look at where he is in his career. And I look at some of the pluses that we have on our front and what we think we can do there. And what we can do with [George] Pickens and Lamb and what we can do with our running back that we just signed [Javonte Williams],\" Jones said. \"And so all of those things I want to do everything we possibly can to stop somebody and to basically win some third downs more than we did last year. And so I think that would be the area that you would see me bust the budget. Where you would see me do that is what we're doing defensively.\n\n\"And I would expect anybody that's a Cowboy fan or a critic of the Cowboys to say, 'Duh, that's not hard to see, Jerry, to do.' But I guess what I'm doing is saying, yes, I intend to do that if given the opportunity.\"\n\nThe Cowboys defense finished at or near the bottom of the league in yards and points allowed in 2025. Christian Parker has been hired as the new defensive coordinator, and Jones acknowledged the need for more than just one or two new players, while also saying players that were on the defense in 2025 will be better in 2026 \"because the situation has changed.\"\n\nWith two first-round picks, the Cowboys have an opportunity to add more talent to their defense. Jones would not rule out the possibility of making trades, like the additions of Williams from the New York Jets and Clark from the Green Bay Packers for Micah Parsons.\n\n\"I don't know that I'd expect it but we have the ammunition to be good at it,\" Jones said. \"And I wouldn't hesitate to be good at it if it will help our team and help the timeline that we're talking about.\"\n\nNow 83, Jones was introspective at times during the hourlong meeting with reporters. His resolve to win a championship is strong.\n\n\"It's every bit the prize of anything I have, with the exception of family and your love for family,\" Jones said. \"I guess what I would say is make no mistake about it, I don't have a higher priority than to go and win a Super Bowl.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- After Denver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic tumbled to the Paycom Center court early in the fourth quarter Friday night, he determined that he needed to react to what he considered a dirty tactic by Oklahoma City Thunder guard Luguentz Dort.\n\nA chippy game between rivals who faced off in a seven-game series in last season's Western Conference semifinals escalated into a heated confrontation at that point, resulting in Dort's ejection and double technical fouls on Jokic and Oklahoma City center Jaylin Williams.\n\nThe fracas began when Dort appeared to trip Jokic as he ran up the court with 8:03 remaining in the fourth quarter. Dort backed into Jokic and stuck out his right foot, knocking down the big man, who quickly pounced to his feet to angrily confront Dort.\n\n\"It's an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction,\" Jokic said after the Nuggets' 127-121 overtime loss to the defending champions. \"There is no such thing -- I think there's not supposed to be those things on a basketball floor. So, it was just an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction by me.\"\n\nAfter Jokic chest-bumped Dort, Williams rushed over to intervene. Jokic and Williams exchanged shoves and grabbed each other's jerseys as a scrum of players, coaches, officials and staffers formed around them and eventually separated them.\n\n\"Just competing,\" Williams told ESPN. \"Two teams competing, that's it. That's all I got.\"\n\nAfter a review, the foul called against Dort was upgraded to a flagrant foul 2, resulting in an automatic ejection. Crew chief James Williams told a pool reporter that the officials \"deemed [Dort's] contact on Jokic to be unnecessary and excessive with a high potential for injury.\" Williams also cited the contact leading to an \"altercation that did not dissolve\" as a reason for upgrading it to a flagrant foul 2.\n\n\"I will say this: If [Williams] is running up the floor and gets tripped, we expect a flagrant 2 from this point forward,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \"That's all. If that's the precedent, if that becomes a malicious play and flagrant 2 is the line in the sand on that, we would expect that if it's [Williams]. We would expect that if it's anybody. And if that's the case, we're good.\"\n\nAsked if he believed the play was ruled a flagrant 2 because the foul was committed against a three-time MVP, Daigneault said: \"No, I'm not going to answer the question like that. I said what I needed to say about it.\"\n\nNuggets star Nikola Jokic confronts Thunder guard Luguentz Dort, who was called for a flagrant foul 2 after an apparent trip in the fourth quarter. Jokic and OKC's Jaylin Williams received technical fouls. Photo by Joshua Gateley/Getty Images\n\nThe referees determined that the actions of Jokic and Jaylin Williams during the altercation did not rise to the level of an ejection, James Williams said in the pool report.\n\nThe fracas overshadowed the return of reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had 36 points on 12-of-29 shooting and dished out nine assists in 34 minutes. Gilgeous-Alexander sat out the overtime period because he had reached his minutes limit after missing the previous nine games because of an abdominal strain suffered Feb. 3.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was called for a technical foul in the first quarter when he responded to Jokic's post-whistle contact by throwing the ball at him. James Williams told the pool reporter that Jokic was not called for a technical on that play because the officials determined that his contact with his left forearm did not rise to the level of an unsportsmanlike act.\n\n\"They're obviously a high-level team, we're a high-level team, and we've seen each other a lot in the past couple of years, so we might be a little bit more into the game just because we know the opponent,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"It was fun. It was good out there. End-of-season basketball is like that. It's that chippy, that physical, so it was good to get one of those in the regular season.\"\n\nThe Nuggets fell to 4-7 since Jokic returned from a monthlong absence, including 1-6 in clutch games (within five points in the final five minutes) during that span. Jokic recorded his league-leading 22nd triple-double with 23 points, 17 rebounds and 14 assists against the Thunder, but his uncharacteristic recent shooting struggles continued, as he went 9-of-25 from the floor and 2-of-10 from 3-point range.\n\nJokic, who was 3-of-5 from the free throw line, animatedly protested no-calls after several of his shots. There were also multiple instances of Jokic bumping and shoving with Thunder players during the game.\n\n\"I think his frustration is sometimes because the game's officiated differently out on the floor than it is near the basket, and I think he was reacting to what was being done to him,\" Nuggets coach David Adelman said. \"And his reaction's not going to be to cower away. He's competitive. ... I know why he's frustrated. I can feel his frustration with all the contact out there. He shot five free throws.\n\n\"It's just part of the game. The closer you get to the basket, it seems like for a bigger guy, it seems like it's called a little bit different, but he has to react to that the right way. Concentrate and finish through contact. And obviously with Dort's play, I think that took it to a different level for him. He felt like it was malicious, also.\"\n\nThe Nuggets and Thunder meet again March 9 in Oklahoma City."

Including the playoffs, it was the club's third-highest percentage in a game in the shot clock era (since 1954-55), behind 67.9% in 1984 and 67.0% in 1990, according to ESPN Research.\n\nThe Celtics also shot 64.7% from the 3-point line Friday, which equated to an 80.8% effective field goal percentage -- the highest in the shot clock era. Effective field goal percentage measures shooting efficiency by adjusting for the fact that 3-pointers are worth more than two-point shots\n\nAll-Star Jaylen Brown led the way, finishing with 28 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. But he got plenty of support from his teammates, with trade deadline acquisition Nikola Vucevic adding 28 points and 11 rebounds for his third double-double as a member of the Celtics.\n\n\"I thought we just did a good job reading the game,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"I thought we made the right reads throughout most of the entire game. I thought tonight Vooch really looked comfortable in his offensive reads and his offensive screening. He unlocked a lot of stuff for us.\"\n\nAll 13 Celtics players scored, with Boston committing only three turnovers after halftime.\n\n\"We just try to read the game and take what's there,\" Brown said.\n\nBoston, winners of five of its six games since the All-Star break, will wait to see if Sunday night's home matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers will mark the return of Tatum.\n\nThe game, originally scheduled to be played earlier in the day, was moved by NBC into an 8 p.m. ET prime-time slot, creating speculation it could signal Tatum's plan to return.\n\nIt's been 41 weeks since Tatum ruptured his right Achilles tendon in May in the waning minutes of the Celtics' loss to the New York Knicks in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe Celtics are required by the NBA to release an initial injury report by 5 p.m. ET on Saturday ahead of Sunday's home game against the 76ers.\n\nAfter practicing with the Celtics' G League team two weeks ago, Tatum said he hadn't decided whether he would return.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that I'm coming back or I'm not, it's just following the plan. So it's just another step,\" Tatum said. \"I don't know percentage. I just know I feel a little bit better every day. I just try to focus on that.\"\n\nTatum said in the same interview that he is also mindful of not wanting to disrupt the progress of a Celtics team that at 39-20 sits in second place in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\n\"I'm just hyper aware of what's going on. I think it would just stem from that. Obviously, I know what I bring to the table and bring to the team. But I'm also aware that these guys have been playing extremely well,\" Tatum said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

Miami extended the best start in program history and added to its school record for wins in a season. Miami also boasts the best start and longest win streak in MAC annals.\n\nMiami is also just the fourth Division I team in the past 20 years to enter March unbeaten, according to ESPN Research. The previous three (2013-14 Wichita State, 2014-15 Kentucky and 2020-21 Gonzaga) all remained unbeaten heading into the NCAA tournament.\n\nPeter Suder scored 18 points for the RedHawks before fouling out with just over seven minutes remaining. Almar Atlason added 16 points, Perry finished with 14 and Eian Elmer 10.\n\nJayden Brewer led Western Michigan (10-19, 4-12) with 19 points and 11 rebounds. Justice Williams and EJ Ryans each added 14 points.\n\nMiami is used to playing close games and won for the seventh time this season by fewer than six points.\n\n\"Our grouip is unflappabe,\" Miami coach Travis Steele said. \"It's calm, cool and collected. It's very, very even the entire time, even during tight moments.\"\n\nThe RedHawks trailed 30-26 at the half and fell behind by eight points twice early in the second half before tying the score at 49-49 with 11:02 remaining.\n\nWestern Michigan ran off eight straight points for a 57-49 advantage with 8:40 remaining and led 59-50 with 6:38 left before Miami chipped away and moved ahead 66-65 on a layup by Antwone Woolfolk with 14 seconds left.\n\nElmer's free throw with 37 seconds remaining gave the RedHawks a 67-65 edge, but Western Michigan tied it with 11 seconds left on a basket by Williams before Perry made the winner.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe Women's National Basketball Players Association submitted a new counterproposal to the WNBA on Friday evening with some concessions on revenue share and housing, a source familiar with the collective bargaining negotiations told ESPN.\n\nIn the new CBA proposal, the players' union is asking for players to receive 26% of gross revenue (defined as revenue before deducting expenses) over the lifetime of the agreement, with the salary cap in Year 1 of the deal (about $9.5 million) unchanged from its previous offer.\n\nThe revenue share split is down from 27.5% of gross revenue as proposed in the WNBPA's Feb. 17 proposal, a change that a source said amounts to nearly $100 million in reductions on revenue share.\n\nThe new proposal also contains tweaks to the union's housing offerings: Previously, the players asked that teams continue to provide housing to players in the first several years of the new deal, but that in later years, teams will no longer be obligated to provide it for players making at least 80% of the maximum salary, on multiyear deals and receiving full salary protection.\n\nIn the new proposal, the union struck the multiyear component and lowered the salary threshold to 75% at which players would no longer be obligated to receive team-provided housing.\n\nThe two sides are still negotiating the years of service limit for developmental players -- a new feature of this CBA with each team now expected to have two developmental player spots. The union is now proposing a years of service limit of six after originally asking for no experience limit for those players, a source said, whereas the league's latest proposal suggested a limit of four or five years of service based on minutes played.\n\nThe WNBPA's counterproposal comes one week after the league submitted one of its own. That Feb. 20 league proposal guaranteed housing for all players in 2026 before being phased out in subsequent years of the deal. Players on their applicable minimum salary and those with zero years of service would be provided a one-bedroom apartment in 2027 and 2028 only, and developmental players would be provided studio apartments for the entirety of the deal.\n\nBut the two sides are still far apart on the issue of revenue sharing, including proposing different revenue sharing systems: The WNBA has held firm in its proposals, with players being offered on average over 70% of net revenue (revenue after deducting expenses), which would amount to less than 15% of gross revenue. The 2026 salary cap would come in at $5.65 million (up from $1.5 million in 2025) and in subsequent years would grow in line with revenue growth.\n\nThe league's proposal features maximum salaries, including revenue sharing payouts, amounting to nearly $1.3 million in 2026 and projecting to approach $2 million in 2031. The supermax in 2025 came in at $249,000. The average player salary, including revenue sharing, would be projected to reach $540,000 in 2026 and $780,000 by 2031, up from $120,000 in 2025.\n\nThe WNBA publicly struck down the WNBPA's previous proposal as \"unrealistic\" and \"caus[ing] hundreds of millions of dollars of losses for our teams.\" A source familiar with the negotiations told ESPN the league projected that Feb. 17 plan would result in losses of $460 million over the lifetime of the agreement, though the union has maintained its revenue sharing model would still put the league in a \"profitable position,\" another source said.\n\nEarlier this week, the league gave its teams and the WNBPA a target date of March 10 to complete a term sheet, or else the schedule for the 2026 season might be impacted."

            "content": "AUBURN, Calif. -- Former MLB pitcher Daniel Serafini was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 2021 shooting of his wife's parents during a burglary at their home by Lake Tahoe, authorities said.\n\nSerafini, 51, was convicted in July 2025 of first-degree murder of his father-in-law, Gary Spohr; attempted murder of his mother-in-law, Wendy Wood; and first-degree burglary. Spohr was killed, and Wood survived, though she died a year after the shooting.\n\nPlacer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said in a statement Friday that Spohr and Wood were loving grandparents and that Serafini's crimes greatly impacted family members and friends.\n\n\"The impact of this attack has extended far beyond the immediate victims, deeply affecting family members and the broader community, and highlighting the lasting harm caused by deliberate violence,\" Gire said.\n\nSerafini's attorney did not return requests for comment.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Serafini addressed the court and maintained his innocence, according to MyNews4. He said he was out partying with his wife the night of the shooting and described himself as a \"broken, imperfect man that makes mistakes.\"\n\nSerafini was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 1992. In a career spanning 11 years, the left-hander played for the Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies.\n\nProsecutors said Serafini hated his wife's wealthy parents and was heard saying he was willing to pay $20,000 to have them killed, according to the Sacramento Bee. Prosecutors showed jurors transcripts of angry emails and text messages between Serafini and his in-laws.\n\nDuring the six-week trial, Serafini's attorney, David Dratman, argued that there was no physical evidence linking his client to the crime scene. Dratman told the jury that although Serafini had a rocky relationship with his in-laws, he did not have a motive to kill them.\n\nAfter his conviction, Serafini filed multiple motions for a new trial, but those were denied.\n\nSerafini will serve his sentence at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the Placer County District Attorney's Office."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

Of those, 12 places are reserved for UEFA qualifying group winners, with the other four coming via the play-offs.\n\nThe 12 group runners-up will be joined by four teams who finished outside the top two of their respective qualifying groups, who were the 'best performers' in the 2024/25 Nations League.\n\nImage: Troy Parrott's stunning hat-trick against Hungary saw the Republic of Ireland secure a shock play-off spot\n\nHere are the final standings from each of the 12 groups:\n\nGroup A: Germany qualified, Slovakia and Northern Ireland into play-offs\n\nGermany qualified, and into play-offs Group B: Switzerland qualified, Kosovo and Sweden into play-offs\n\nSwitzerland qualified, and into play-offs Group C: Scotland qualified, Denmark into play-offs\n\nScotland qualified, into play-offs Group D: France qualified, Ukraine into play-offs\n\nFrance qualified, into play-offs Group E: Spain qualified, Turkey into play-offs\n\nSpain qualified, into play-offs Group F: Portugal qualified, Republic of Ireland into play-offs\n\nPortugal qualified, into play-offs Group G: Netherlands qualified, Poland into play-offs\n\nNetherlands qualified, into play-offs Group H: Austria qualified, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Romania into play-offs\n\nAustria qualified, and into play-offs Group I: Norway qualified, Italy into play-offs\n\nNorway qualified, into play-offs Group J: Belgium qualified, Wales and North Macedonia into play-offs\n\nBelgium qualified, and into play-offs Group K: England qualified, Albania into play-offs\n\nEngland qualified, into play-offs Group L: Croatia qualified, Czech Republic into play-offs\n\nCould every home nation be at the World Cup?\n\nNo!

You can't even dream about something like that.

            "content": "International corporate lawyer and entrepreneur Victoria Bright has called for an end to what she describes as “cocoa politics”, urging policymakers to focus on long-term reforms that protect farmers and secure the future of the sector.\n\nSpeaking on Newsfile on JoyNews on Saturday, 28 February, during a discussion on the 2026 State of the Nation Address, Ms Bright said Ghana’s cocoa industry is at a critical point.\n\n“I think that we have to make progress in cocoa, and to do that, we have to stop the cocoa politics,” she said.\n\nAccording to her, the challenges facing the sector are not new.\n\n“As we all know, these problems have been with us from time immemorial,” she said, adding that she sympathised with the President over the difficult choices involved in managing the industry.\n\n“I do sympathise with the President that he had to do a difficult balancing act between the greater good, if you like, and how to protect the interests of our cherished and very hard-working farmers,” she said.\n\nMs Bright warned that the cocoa sector is now facing what she described as a “moment of structural truth”.\n\n“Our cocoa sector has now come to a point where it’s facing a moment of structural truth. Between the lack of proper investment into the industry and galamsey, the sector is really suffering,” she said.\n\nShe raised concerns about the ageing population of cocoa farmers, noting that many have spent decades in the industry with little to show for their labour.\n\n“When you see the average age of the cocoa farmer, they’re old. These are people who have worked for 40 years. I heard one saying he had worked like 50 years, ever since he was a child. They have nothing to show for it,” she said.\n\nShe argued that because cocoa revenues benefit the entire nation, more attention must be given to the welfare of farmers to attract young people into the sector.\n\n“The youth are not being attracted to cocoa farming,” she observed.\n\nMs Bright also pointed to Ghana’s declining position in global cocoa production.\n\n“We used to be number one in the world. Then we are now at number two, and the way Ecuador is going, very soon we’ll be number three. So what is it about us?” she asked.\n\nShe cautioned against neglecting cocoa in favour of other revenue sources such as gold.\n\n“Just because we’re getting reserves from gold and other things does not mean that we should abandon our core asset. We must not do that because other people are trying to get into the space. So there’s still value in being in that space.”\n\nWhile welcoming proposed reforms in the sector, she said key questions remain about their long-term impact.\n\n“Yes, we must have reforms. The proposed reforms are quite ambitious. But the real question is, are they economically coherent? Will they work in the long term? Are they fiscally sustainable? And operationally, will they be feasible?” she asked.\n\nShe said that any reform must ultimately protect farmers.\n\n“Most importantly, will it protect and support our farmers? Because at the end of the day, that is what this is all about.”\n\nResponding to a question on political debate surrounding the sector, Ms Bright said the focus should move away from partisan arguments.\n\n“This is not about politics. For me, this is about the farmers, pure and simple. And Ghana,” she said. “I want us to focus on the farmer. Pure and simple.”\n\nShe added that cocoa farmers have “suffered in silence for too long” and welcomed the renewed national attention on their plight.\n\n“I think it’s in their interest and in the nation’s interest to strengthen the sector. It’s good that they’ve blown this onto the national stage,” she said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Somehow I believe it because of what I have experienced,” he said.\n\nHe said that the persistent controversies surrounding electricity meters point to deeper procurement and contractual problems.\n\n“You see the whole thing of meters, meter selling, every administration wants to bring its own meters because that’s how they make the money to cheat us,” he alleged.\n\nAccording to him, frequent changes in meters raise serious questions. He cited an instance where meters imported from Egypt allegedly failed to function.\n\n“Do you know the time they imported some meters from Egypt? They were all discarded because they never worked,” he claimed.\n\nDrawing from his personal experience abroad, Prof Agyeman-Duah compared the situation to what he observed in Tanzania.\n\n“I was in Tanzania for five years. The same meter worked for me, and it continued to work when I left after five years,” he said. “Why is it that we are changing meters?”\n\nHe suggested that the repeated replacement of meters may be driven by financial interests rather than technical necessity.\n\n“Because you know why? It’s a way for them to make money. Contracts, procurement. And that’s the truth,” he stated.\n\nProf Agyeman-Duah appealed directly to the President to take action, saying stronger oversight and transparency are needed in the electricity sector to protect consumers from exploitation.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

It is something that is ongoing,” he added.\n\nThe NPA CEO first signalled this approach at the New Year School and Conference in January 2026, confirming his leadership of the Steering Committee tasked with addressing infrastructure challenges and enabling effective deployment of the 24-hour economy in the petroleum downstream industry.\n\nAccording to Tamakloe, the policy is projected to create up to 1.7 million jobs over four years, stimulating economic activity and raising living standards through continuous productivity.\n\nHis comments follow President Mahama’s signing of the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill into law on February 19, 2026, which established a coordinating body for the policy.\n\nCritics, including NPP communicators like Dennis Miracles Aboagye, had described the law as a bureaucratic shell.\n\nTamakloe pushed back, stressing that the authority is meant to provide sector-specific roadmaps, not top-down directives.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Director of Communications for the Bawumia Campaign Team has accused the National Democratic Congress (NDC) government of avoiding responsibility for the everyday challenges facing Ghanaians, despite improvements in key economic indicators.\n\nSpeaking on Newsfile on JoyNews on Saturday, February 28, during a discussion on the 2026 State of the Nation Address, Dennis Miracles Aboagye said the true state of the nation goes beyond headline macroeconomic figures.\n\n“I think the state of the nation is just the aggregation of every person within the state. And so if you have the majority of the elements within the state not doing so well, that is what will tell on the state.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the country’s macroeconomic performance over the past year has been strong.\n\n“The macroeconomic performance in the last one year is without doubt. There was no debate about that,” he said.\n\n“The fact that we’ve seen unprecedented improvement in inflation, never seen before. I doubt even first-world countries see this kind of macroeconomic improvement in such a short period.”\n\nHe also pointed to the strength of the cedi, saying, “The fact that we’ve seen some very heavy strength from our currency, it’s without doubt,” he said.\n\nHowever, Mr Aboagye questioned the sustainability of the gains and what is driving them.\n\n“The details as to whether it’s sustainable, based on what is driving it, is another conversation. It’s time for the government to actually sit back and be honest with themselves,” he said.\n\nHe called on the government to clearly explain the source of the improvement.\n\n\"First of all, you need to begin to tell the Ghanaian people what is driving this improvement. So that, should anything go wrong, which we are not praying for, you don’t come back with excuses.”\n\nAccording to him, Ghana’s recent stability is largely tied to high international gold prices.\n\n“We’ve always made a point about gold, and we’ve said that if gold is what is driving us, then we are in trouble. Because we don’t control it. One single thing is what has driven us to where we are now. High international market price for gold,” he said.\n\nHe warned that over-reliance on a single commodity leaves the economy exposed.\n\n“Tomorrow, should gold drop to 2,000 dollars, can we survive?” he asked.\n\nMr Aboagye also referred to the cocoa sector, suggesting that external market forces can quickly reverse gains.\n\nHe said comments attributed to a government official about giving cocoa farmers a “haircut” to prevent economic collapse show how fragile the situation could be.\n\nWhile conceding that some Ghanaians have benefited from the improved indicators, he said that the impact has been limited.\n\n“I have said it here that the government’s performance in the last one year has benefited, in my view, some 10 to 15 per cent of the population,” he claimed.\n\nHe explained that those who directly import goods and require foreign exchange have benefited significantly.\n\n“The person who imports directly and needs forex benefited big time. The person who pays anything in dollars benefited. Who drives to the fuel station to buy fuel for their vehicle, plant, or machinery benefited.”\n\nHowever, he said the ordinary commuter has not felt the same relief.\n\n“The person joining the trotro also hasn’t. That is where the issue comes in,” he said.\n\nHe cited data suggesting that between 75 and 80 per cent of residents in Accra rely on commercial transport. According to him, the limited supply of vehicles has pushed up fares and made commuting more difficult.\n\n“Today, people have to wake up at 3:00 a.m. so they can get to work at 8:30 a.m., which they are late anyway. And they have to leave the office at 5:00,” he said.\n\nMr Aboagye said that economic management should ultimately improve the daily lives of citizens.\n\n“What is macroeconomy without its positive impact on micro?” he asked. “The whole essence of macroeconomic management is the output on the microeconomy.”\n\n“If you drive your macroeconomic indicators to the best of numbers and your micro is not positively affected, you’ve done nothing,” he said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Some supporters, maybe they were dreaming it. Now we are not with the possibility to fight for the Premier League, some can feel frustrated, even myself because I have my dreams.\n\n\n\n\"In September I was worried and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. In December I was so happy and excited to get the top-five position and achieve the Champions League.\n\n\"One month ago I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League. Now we are in the average to be in the top five.\n\n\n\n\"Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, they are trying to get to us, for them it is a priority to get into the Champions League.\"\n\n\n\nVilla are fortunate others have stumbled sooner and for longer this season - ensuring they have maintained a decent grip on third place until now.\n\n\n\nChelsea have dropped 17 points from winning positions at Stamford Bridge and 19 points overall in the Premier League this season.\n\n\n\nThey go to Arsenal on Sunday hoping to capitalise on Villa's latest slip - before travelling to Villa Park on Wednesday for a game which could define both teams' seasons.\n\n\n\nLille, in the Europa League on 12 March, and then a trip to Old Trafford on 15 March, will loom large for Villa.\n\nIndividual form has also plummeted, with Ollie Watkins scoring just once in 11 games - reminiscent of the spell where he scored only one goal in the opening 19 matches - while Morgan Rogers is on a similar streak.\n\n\n\nThe slump was sparked by injuries to Boubacar Kamara, John McGinn and Youri Tielemans last month as Villa's lack of depth was exposed.\n\n\n\nPlayers argued between themselves as Ezri Konsa - who also had a flashpoint with fans at the end - and Amadou Onana urged Emi Buendia to leave the pitch quicker as he was substituted.\n\n\n\nThe cracks are showing and even the players are admitting to feeling the pressure.\n\n\n\n\"It does weigh on us but it shouldn't,\" said Rogers. \"We deserve to be here and we should not forget that.\n\n\n\n\"Our run lately has not been as good as usual but that is the battle of the Premier League. We are going to get back to our good run of wins.\n\n\"We set our standards high and we have the ability to win every game. Obviously that is not realistic but we are playing good football as a whole and there is nothing to worry about.\n\n\n\n\"[The next fixtures] are the games you want to play and, with so much on the line, we need to show why we deserve to be where we are.\""

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "The outbreak of conflict between Israel and the United States against Iran, triggered by joint US-Israeli strikes across Iran, has drawn frantic calls for calm across the globe.\n\nCriticism has mounted against Washington for taking part in the attacks while still engaged in nuclear negotiations with Tehran. Anger has also surfaced in Gulf states caught up in the conflict, as Iran launches retaliatory missile strikes against US military assets hosted on their soil.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how countries and institutions are responding:\n\nUnited States\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced that the US was engaged in a “major combat operation” aimed at “eliminating threats from the Iranian regime” on Saturday morning, as missiles hit numerous areas in Tehran and across the country. Trump pledged to raze Iran’s missile industry and destroy its navy, while urging the Iranian people to overthrow the government.\n\nIsrael\n\nA senior Israeli defence official told the Reuters news agency the joint US-Israeli attacks had been planned for months, with a specific date set weeks ago. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the attacks aimed to remove an “existential threat” posed by Iran. He said the attacks would “create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands”.\n\nIran\n\nIran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Israel and the US of violating the United Nations charter with their attacks and pledged a harsh response, as the country waged retaliatory attacks on Israel as well as in several Gulf states that host US military assets, including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait. “All American and Israeli assets and interests in the Middle East have become a legitimate target,” a senior Iranian official told Al Jazeera. “There are no red lines after this aggression.”\n\n\n\nEuropean Union\n\nEuropean ⁠Commission President ⁠Ursula von der Leyen and European Council ⁠President Antonio Costa called the conflict “greatly concerning” and urged all parties “to exercise maximum restraint, to protect civilians, ‌and to fully respect international law”.\n\nRed Cross\n\nMirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, called on countries to respect the rules of war and urged them to find the political will to prevent “further death and destruction”.\n\nShe warned that “a dangerous chain reaction” of military escalation was under way across the Middle East, “with potentially devastating consequences for civilians”.\n\nOman\n\nThe main mediator in ongoing US-Iran negotiations, Oman, expressed dismay at the outbreak of violence. Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said the conflict would not serve US interests, nor the interests of global peace, and urged Washington “not to get sucked in” further.\n\nFrance\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron ⁠called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council, ⁠saying the conflict carries “serious consequences” for international peace and security. “The current escalation is dangerous for everyone. It must stop,” he said, adding that Iran must now “engage in good-faith negotiations to end its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, as well as ⁠its actions to destabilise the ⁠region”.\n\nQatar\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned Iran for firing missiles at Qatari territory, which is home to the Al Udeid Air Base that hosts US troops. The ministry called the attacks a flagrant violation of Qatar’s national sovereignty and a direct assault on its security. It added that Qatar reserves the right to respond, as per international law.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nThe Ministry of Defence condemned in the “strongest terms” Iran’s attacks on its territory, several of which it said its air defences intercepted. It called the attack “a dangerous escalation and a cowardly act that threatens the security and safety of civilians”, stressing that the UAE has the “full right” to respond.\n\nBahrain\n\nBahrain confirmed that an Iranian missile attack targeted the headquarters of the US Navy’s 5th Fleet that it hosts, and called the attack “treacherous”.\n\nKuwait\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the Iranian attack on its soil as a “flagrant violation” of international law and said it had the right to respond. It warned that any additional escalation would only deepen regional instability.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSaudi Arabia condemned in the “strongest terms” the Iranian attacks on Gulf Arab states and warned of “dire consequences”.\n\n\n\nPakistan\n\nForeign Minister Ishaq Dar “strongly condemned the unwarranted attacks against Iran and called for an immediate halt to escalation through urgent resumption of diplomacy to achieve a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis”.\n\nRussia\n\nDmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, accused the US of having used its nuclear talks with Iran as a cover-up before military operations. The country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the international community to swiftly deliver an objective assessment of what it called irresponsible ⁠actions that risk ⁠further destabilising the region.\n\nUkraine\n\nThe ⁠Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Iran of being responsible for the chain of events leading to the conflict, including its crackdown on protests earlier this year. “The cause of the current ⁠events is precisely ⁠the violence and impunity of the Iranian regime, ⁠in particular the killings and ⁠repression of ⁠peaceful protesters, which have become particularly widespread in recent ‌months,” said the Foreign Ministry.\n\nNorway\n\nForeign Minister Espen Barth said the initial attack on Iran by Israel breached standards of international law. “The attack is ⁠described by Israel as a preventive strike, but ⁠it is not in line with international law,” said Barth. “Preventive attacks require an immediately imminent threat.”\n\nBelgium\n\nForeign Minister Maxime Prevot said the Iranian people “must not pay the price for their government’s choices. We deeply regret that diplomatic efforts could not lead earlier to a negotiated solution.”"

We just have to prepare in the best way to earn the right to win it, as I always said,” Arteta told reporters on Friday.\n\n“What you have done two weeks or two years ago is irrelevant because every game and every context is different, the ⁠players might change, the mood of the team might ⁠be different. We are prepared.”\n\nArteta praised Chelsea’s ability to react to the game under Rosenior, who is yet to lose a league game as Chelsea manager.\n\n“They can change throughout the game ⁠and they have a manager very comfortable doing that, so we are prepared for the possible scenarios we ⁠can face and then we will try ⁠to be better than them,” Arteta added.\n\n‘Let’s go game by game’\n\nAsked if Arsenal can become the first English club to win the quadruple – including the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and the Champions League – this ‌season, Arteta shrugged off the idea.\n\n“Has it been done? That is how difficult it is,” he said.\n\n“So let’s go game by game and try ‌to ‌earn the right to be there in the last stage of every competition, and then we will see what happens.”\n\nRosenior eyes extended stay to stabilise Chelsea\n\nAsked how he viewed his Chelsea future after a solid start featuring four wins from six league games before disappointing draws with Leeds and Burnley, Chelsea’s boss said patience was the key to success.\n\n“Sitting here in this chair, I want to be here for as long as possible,” Rosenior told reporters on Friday.\n\n“I want to be the guy – and not just me but the team, the staff, the ownership, sporting directors – I want to be a part of something really successful for a long time. That’s why I signed up for this challenge.\n\n“The reality of football is that what gives you time is being successful. You need to show your quality, not just in terms of the games, but every day.\n\n“Every day you need to be top with the players in terms of the way you develop them, the way you put your sessions on, the way you conduct your meetings.\n\n“I hope this is the end of the upheaval for this club. I hope I can be here for a very long time and bring the club the success it deserves.”\n\nHead-to-head\n\nThe two London clubs first locked horns in 1907 – when the Gunners were called Woolwich Arsenal – and they have now played each other 214 times.\n\nArsenal have won 87 of those encounters, while Chelsea have won 66, and 61 games have ended as draws.\n\n\n\nThe Gunners have dominated many of the more recent fixtures and are unbeaten against the Blues in eight Premier League games, and 10 in all competitions.\n\nEarlier this year, Arsenal beat Chelsea over two League Cup semifinal legs, winning 3-2 at Stamford Bridge and 1-0 at the Emirates.\n\nChelsea did manage to hold the Gunners to a 1-1 draw in their last league game back in November 2025.\n\nArsenal’s team news\n\nVersatile midfielder Mikel Merino could miss the rest of the season after undergoing surgery to address a stress fracture in his foot.\n\nDefender Ben White is a doubt after missing the north London derby with a knock.\n\nWinger Bukayo Saka hobbled off in the win over Tottenham but is expected to be declared fit to face Chelsea.\n\nKai Havertz could possibly be in line to face his former club, but Arsenal are keen not to rush his comeback from a hamstring injury.\n\nPredicted starting XI:\n\nRaya (goalkeeper); Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Hincapie; Zubimendi, Rice; Saka, Odegaard, Martinelli; Gyokeres\n\nChelsea’s team news\n\nJamie Gittens and Levi Colwill have both been ruled out with injuries, while Wesley Fofana will be suspended after receiving a red card against Burnley.\n\nEstevao and Marc Cucurella both missed the Burnley game with hamstring problems and remain doubtful for this match.\n\nMidfielder Dario Essugo is available again as he has recovered from injury.\n\nPredicted starting XI:\n\nSanchez (goalkeeper); James, Tosin, Chalobah, Gusto; Santos, Caicedo; Palmer, Fernandez, Neto; Joao Pedro"

The strike is part of a wave of joint US-Israeli military attacks across Iran that has triggered an outbreak of regional violence.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi shared a photo of the attack, which he said destroyed the girls’ school and killed “innocent children”.\n\n“These crimes against the Iranian People will not go unanswered,” Araghchi wrote in a post on X.\n\nIran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei also slammed the “blatant crime” and urged action from the United Nations Security Council.\n\nSeparately, Iran’s Mehr news agency reported that at least two students were killed by another Israeli attack that hit a school east of the capital, Tehran.\n\nReporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Mohammed Vall said the attacks call into question US and Israeli claims that “they are targeting only military targets and they are trying to punish the regime, not the people of Iran.”\n\n“President Trump has promised the Iranian people that aid or help is coming their way, but now we are seeing civilian casualties; that’s something that the Iranian government will stress as a case of violation of international law and an aggression against the Iranian people,” said Vall.\n\n\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the US or Israel on Iran’s claims about the school strikes.\n\nThe last time the US and Iran waged attacks on Iran in June 2025, sparking the 12-day war, the civilian toll in Iran was also heavy.\n\nAccording to Iran’s Ministry of Health and Medical Education, thousands of civilians were killed or injured, and public infrastructure was damaged, during that conflict."

No team has ever retained the T20 World Cup, and no side has ever won the trophy on home soil.\n\nWest Indies, meanwhile, had been building some momentum until they ran into the mightily impressive South Africa in their last Super Eights match.\n\nAl Jazeera Sport takes a closer look at what is a quarterfinal clash at the 2026 edition.\n\nHow have India fared at the 2026 T20 World Cup?\n\nIndia have endured a mixed tournament so far, with their top-order batters failing to fire.\n\nA below-par victory in their opening group-stage match against the USA was quickly forgotten, following a comprehensive win to seal qualification against rivals Pakistan. With their progress to the second phase assured, India sealed top spot with a third win in three by beating the Netherlands.\n\nFor India, the Super Eights began with a defeat at the hands of South Africa, the side they overcame in the 2024 final, making the match against Zimbabwe a must-win. Abhishek Sharma returned to form with a fifty at the top in a 72-run win against the Africans; however, all-rounder Hardik Pandya was named Player of the Match for his half-century and his performance with the ball.\n\n\n\nHow have West Indies fared at the 2026 T20 World Cup?\n\nWest Indies’ four-match winning streak at this edition ended in a nine-wicket defeat against South Africa in their last match.\n\nOf their victories so far, the biggest test has been in their opening match, when they beat England by 30 runs. Wins followed against Nepal, Italy and Zimbabwe – in their opening Super Eights match.\n\nThe winner-takes-all match against India will mark the first heavily pressurised test of the tournament for the team from the Caribbean.\n\nHow does Group 1 stand at the 2026 T20 World Cup?\n\nSouth Africa, who meet Zimbabwe in the first game of the day on Sunday, have already sealed qualification with four points from their two games. The latter are already eliminated, following defeats at the hands of West Indies and India.\n\nWhat have India said before their T20 World Cup showdown with West Indies?\n\nIndia revived their T20 World Cup campaign with their “fearless” brand of cricket against Zimbabwe.\n\nThe defending champions’ batting, led by opener Abhishek Sharma’s blistering 55, and an unbeaten 50 by Hardik Pandya, piled up 256-4, the second-highest total in the history of the tournament.\n\nIn a brutal show of power hitting, the Indian batters demolished the opposition bowling with 17 sixes and 17 fours at the MA Chidambaram Stadium – it is how India intend to proceed.\n\n“We want to play the fearless cricket, the brand of cricket we played against Zimbabwe and we played since last year,” batter Tilak Varma said before the meeting with West Indies.\n\n“The same intent we want to keep in the next game as well. And going ahead in the tournament, we take the same intensity [forward].”\n\nCan India’s batting find form against West Indies?\n\nThe left-handed Varma hit a 19-ball 44 as he put together an unbeaten 84-run stand with Pandya, who capped off the innings with two sixes to raise his fifty.\n\nIt all came together for India after they rejigged their opening combination with the return of Sanju Samson, who handed the team a quick start with his 24 off 15 balls.\n\nThe left-handed Abhishek hit form with his first T20 World Cup fifty after he struggled in the tournament with three ducks in four innings.\n\n“It’s important when the openers give us a good start, the same confidence follows to number three, four and five,” said Varma.\n\n“And we discussed that whatever the situation is, [even] if we lose three-four wickets in powerplay, we will bat with the same rhythm,” he added.\n\n“And we want to show the fear in opposition bowlers, that these guys are ready to hit each and every ball.”\n\n\n\nWhat has gone wrong with India’s batting?\n\nIndia, the world’s top-ranked T20 team, came into the World Cup on the back of huge totals in bilateral contests and were tipped to cross the 300-run mark at the tournament.\n\nBut their batting had looked fragile and was often exposed, including by minnows the United States, who reduced them to 77-6 in their opener.\n\nVarma remains cautious of his team’s plans against the West Indies, who posted 254-6 against Zimbabwe in their Super Eights opener.\n\n“So if the wicket is not good, then we’ll adjust, and we’ll keep that intensity on,” said Varma.\n\n“I would not say we want to score more than 250, but if we get a good start, then, of course, we’ll go for it.”\n\nHow has the India bowling shaped up at the T20 World Cup?\n\nThe Indian bowling has looked good. On Thursday, left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh returned figures of 3-24 to limit Zimbabwe to 184-6.\n\nHe surpassed senior paceman Jasprit Bumrah as the leading bowler for India at the T20 World Cup with 35 wickets to Bumrah’s 33.\n\n“We have been doing well for the past couple of years, so even after a blip or a defeat, the belief of the group was there,” Arshdeep told reporters.\n\n“We knew we just have to come and follow our processes, and the result will come our way. So the thought was very simple, and we are enjoying it.”\n\nWhat happened in the last T20 between India and West Indies?\n\nThis will be the first T20 meeting between the sides since the August 2023 bilateral series, which resulted in a 3-2 series win for West Indies.\n\nWest Indies secured a two-wicket win in the final game to clinch the series, with India restricted to 165/9 despite Suryakumar Yadav’s 61 off 45 balls.\n\nHead-to-head\n\nThis will be the 31st meeting between the sides in T20 internationals, with India winning 19 of the matches so far. West Indies have won 10 of the encounters, with one no result.\n\nHow have the teams fared in encounters at T20 World Cups?\n\nInterestingly, West Indies have won three of the four T20 World Cup meetings between the sides, while India have recorded just the one win – and that was back in 2014.\n\nIndia team news\n\nIndia batter Rinku Singh has left the team during the T20 World Cup in the middle of the tournament after the death of his long-ailing father.\n\nThe middle-order batter had rejoined India before Thursday’s Super Eights victory against Zimbabwe, but did not feature in the playing XI in Chennai.\n\nShivam Dube is set to continue in the left-hander’s place, but Kuldeep Yadav could come in to add another spin option.\n\nWest Indies team news\n\nBrandon King is the main concern for West Indies in the run-up to the match against India, after sustaining an injury during the match against South Africa. The opening batter was hurt diving to attempt a catch and did not play for the remainder of that match.\n\nShamar Joseph is an option to come in for Gudakesh Motie if West Indies choose to go for a more seam-heavy attack, while dropping a spin option.\n\nPredicted India team\n\nAbhishek Sharma Sanju Samson (wk), Ishan Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav (c), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Arshdeep Singh, Varun Chakravarthy, Jasprit Bumrah\n\n\n\nPredicted West Indies team\n\nBrandon King, Johnson Charles, Shai Hope (c & wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Rovman Powell, Sherfane Rutherford, Romario Shepherd, Jason Holder, Akeal Hosein, Gudakesh Motie, Matthew Forde\n\nIndia and West Indies form guides"

He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nXiaomi and Leica’s long-running phone partnership just got a little closer. Alongside the new international release of its 17 Ultra flagship, Xiaomi has been entrusted with manufacturing a separate version that is the first Leica Leitzphone to release outside of Japan, following three Sharp-made models exclusive to the country.\n\nIn truth, the Leitzphone is a 17 Ultra with Leica branding and a rotatable camera ring, and apart from a few design tweaks, it’s mostly the same as the Leica Edition of that phone already available in China. But the branding is a big deal: Leica hasn’t let Xiaomi use its red dot logo on hardware until now, even though the companies have partnered on Xiaomi’s flagship cameras since 2022. The jump to a fully Leica-branded phone is a vote of confidence from the camera company.\n\nAfter two weeks using the Leitzphone version of the 17 Ultra, it’s clear that confidence was well placed. This is my favorite phone of 2026 so far, Leica logo or not, though most buyers would be better off saving money with the standard 17 Ultra.\n\nThe 17 Ultra and its original Leica Edition launched in China on December 25th, 2025. The international version and the Leitzphone were launched at Xiaomi’s pre-MWC press conference in Barcelona on February 28th, alongside the regular Xiaomi 17. The 17 Ultra starts from £1,299 / €1,499 (about $1,750) with 512GB storage, rising by £400 / €700 for the Leica version. That’s a hefty premium, but there are a few differences from the regular 17 Ultra.\n\nLet’s start with the Leica of it all. It’s obvious first and foremost in the design: an ever-so-slightly glossy black finish on the back, an industrial touch in the knurled aluminum-alloy edges, and Leica’s red dot logo in one corner. It’s a slightly different design to the 17 Ultra Leica Edition that released in China at the end of December, which has a two-tone finish and orients the Leica logo the other way. It also ships with branded accessories, including a faux leather case with a Leica lens cap, a microfiber cleaning cloth, and a bright red wrist strap.\n\nThe Leica logo isn’t just printed on; that lettering is raised metal. The textured edges make the phone more grippy, even without a case. My favorite accessory by far is this case, which preserves the red dot logo and adds a lens cap.\n\nOther changes run through the software. While both versions of the 17 Ultra run Xiaomi’s HyperOS 3, based on Android 16, the Leitzphone’s interface has been customized. There are dedicated Leica widgets, including photo galleries and a golden-hour timer, and custom monochrome app icons for the most popular apps from Xiaomi and third parties — which look great when you first turn the phone on, but less so once they’re mixed in with all the non-monochromatic apps you’ll inevitably download from elsewhere.\n\nLeica and Xiaomi’s design languages coexist in the camera app.\n\nMost of the customization is in the camera. There’s an expanded array of Leica filters, and the interface uses Leica fonts and red as its accent color, instead of Xiaomi’s usual yellow. A new Leica Essential shooting mode lets you pick between two camera simulations: a color re-creation of the M9 and a monochromatic take on the M3. The Leitzphone also adds the option to enable C2PA content credentials on every shot you take.\n\nNone of this is as novel as the Leitzphone’s unique hardware feature: a rotatable camera ring. The edge of the camera island can be twisted round, with a satisfying haptic buzz to emulate the feel of gears clicking. It makes for an excellent fidget spinner, though its real purpose is to control zoom in the camera app, or cycle through exposure settings or filters if you prefer.\n\nThe metal rim of the camera island is the part that twists round.\n\nThis sounds like a great idea, and it’s something I’ve wanted to see on more phones since spotting it on Nubia’s Focus 2 Ultra. In practice, it’s not that useful. The camera island may be enormous by phone standards, but it would be small on a real camera, and it’s too flush against the body to hold comfortably. I’ve had to force myself to use the camera ring to zoom, finding the onscreen controls quicker and more natural every time. Perhaps with persistence I could drill it in my muscle memory; for now, I mostly rotate it by accident and get annoyed when I do.\n\nThe addition of the zoom ring makes sense given the 17 Ultra’s headline photography feature: a telephoto with continuous optical zoom. While Xiaomi’s 15 Ultra featured two telephoto cameras, the 17 Ultra combines them into one. (The company skipped 16 to catch up with Apple.) A single 1/1.4-inch type 200-megapixel sensor is paired with a Leica APO zoom lens that covers 3.2-4.3x magnification — the equivalent of 75-100mm — adjusting the aperture from f/2.39-2.96 as it goes.\n\nThe obvious criticism is the same we levied at Sony’s Xperia 1 IV, which boasted continuous 3.5-5.2x zoom: This is too short a spread to make much difference. It’s rare that the framing of a photo changes drastically as you move through the range, and outside those limits you’re back to the same digital zoom and sensor cropping that every other phone offers.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 20 I took all of these photos using the 17 Ultra’s telephoto camera.\n\nPhotos are excellent. The large sensor delivers natural bokeh, along with macro support at a minimum distance of 30cm. It can handle challenging lighting conditions, with good results in dim light — though it did once struggle with the inverse, blowing out highlights on an especially bright day. Mostly I’ve shot exclusively on the Leica Authentic mode — the other option being Leica Vibrant — which I like for its filmic qualities, preserving more of the highlights and shadows than most phones and avoiding the flattened sheen of excessive HDR.\n\nThe other lenses are just as impressive, though I do find myself defaulting to the telephoto. The main camera has a large 1-inch-type sensor, and the same 50-megapixel resolution as the ultrawide and selfie camera. It’s one of the first phones to include a LOFIC (lateral overflow integration capacitor) sensor, which expands the dynamic range for highlights, helping me take some of the most dramatic skyline shots I’ve managed on a phone, and contributing to excellent performance in nighttime shots with bright lights.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14 These are a mix of photos from the other lenses.\n\nDespite the Leica logo, this isn’t just a camera. The Leitzphone has all of the flagship specs you’d expect: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, 16GB of RAM (in this economy?!) and 1TB of storage (with an option for 512GB on the regular 17 Ultra), a 6.9-inch 1-120Hz LTPO OLED display, and IP68 protection.\n\nThe battery is another standout feature. The 6,000mAh silicon-carbon cell isn’t the biggest around, and is smaller than the phone’s Chinese edition, but it’s still impressive. Even powering a demanding phone with a big display, I’ve usually been able to just about get two days of use from it between charges, though with very little left in the tank afterwards. 90W PPS wired charging and 50W wireless top it back up fast, though you’ll be limited to slow Qi speeds over third-party wireless chargers, and there’s no support for the magnetic Qi2 standard.\n\nThis is my favorite phone of the year so far.\n\nThe biggest problem the Leitzphone has is that it’s mostly a more expensive version of the 17 Ultra, which shares most of its best features. I prefer the look of the Leitzphone, and like a few of the Leica-specific shooting styles and the included case. But those aren’t worth £200, and the rotatable camera ring isn’t either. Unless that little red dot is very dear to your heart, there’s not quite enough reason to shell out extra for it — but mostly because the 17 Ultra is such a good phone in its own right.\n\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nAgree to Continue: Xiaomi 17 Ultra Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate. To use the 17 Ultra, you must agree to: Google Terms of Service\n\nGoogle Play Terms of Service\n\nGoogle Privacy Policy (included in ToS\n\nInstall apps and updates: “You agree this device may also automatically download and install updates and apps from Google, your carrier, and your device’s manufacturer, possibly using cellular data.”\n\nXiaomi Agreement\n\nXiaomi Privacy Policy There’s also a variety of optional agreements, including: Provide anonymous location data for Google’s services\n\n“Allow apps and services to scan for Wi-Fi networks and nearby devices at any time, even when Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is off.”\n\nSend usage and diagnostic data to Google\n\nGoogle Gemini Apps Privacy Notice if you opt in to using Gemini Assistant\n\nSend usage and diagnostic data to Xiaomi\n\nXiaomi personalized ads Other features, like Google Wallet, may require additional agreements.

He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nXiaomi has just given a global launch to two of its latest flagship phones, the Xiaomi 17 and 17 Ultra, along with a Leica-branded Leitzphone edition of the Ultra. There’s no sign, however, of the 17 Pro, which launched in China with an additional display mounted next to the rear cameras.\n\nThe 17 and 17 Ultra will apparently be available soon in the UK, Europe, and select other markets. The 17 — pitched as a rival to the likes of the iPhone 17 and Samsung Galaxy S26 — will cost £899 / €999 (about $1,200), while the larger and more capable Ultra starts from £1,299 / €1,499 ($1,750). The limited-edition Leitzphone will be substantially more expensive at £1,699 / €1,999 ($2,300), though it includes 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, along with a few extra accessories.\n\nI like the simple, sleek aesthetic of the phone. The 6.3-inch display isn’t tiny, but it does make the phone small by modern standards. All three of the phone’s rear cameras are 50-megapixel.\n\nThe 17 is an extremely capable small-ish flagship, with a 6.3-inch OLED display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and large 6,330mAh silicon-carbon battery (though sadly smaller than the 7,000mAh version launched in China). I won’t be writing a full review of the 17, but did spend a week using it as my main phone, and found that the battery cruised past the full-day mark, though wasn’t quite enough for two full days of my typical usage. That’s far better battery life than you’d find in similarly sized phones from Apple, Samsung, or Google.\n\nThe cameras impress too, with 50-megapixel sensors behind each of the four lenses, selfie included. Pound for pound, you won’t find many better camera systems in any phone this size.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 10 I’ve been largely impressed by the Xiaomi 17’s cameras.\n\nThe Ultra, unsurprisingly, takes things to another level. It’s much larger, with a 6.9-inch display, and weighs a hefty 218g. Despite that, the 6,000mAh is actually smaller, though I found it delivered pretty similar longevity.\n\nThe 17 Ultra is larger in just about every respect, but strangely has a smaller battery.\n\nThe enormous camera is, as ever for Xiaomi’s Ultra phones, the highlight. There are 50-megapixel sensors for each of the main, ultrawide, and selfie cameras, with a large 1-inch-type sensor behind the primary lens. The periscope telephoto is even more impressive: 200-megapixel resolution, a large 1/1.4-inch sensor, and continuous optical zoom from 3.2x to 4.3x, the equivalent of 75-100mm. Xiaomi isn’t the first to pull off a true zoom phone — Sony’s Xperia 1 IV got there first in 2022 — but the telephoto camera here is far more capable than that phone’s, with natural bokeh and impressive performance even in low light.\n\nThis is the Leica-branded Leitzphone version of the 17 Ultra.\n\nThe camera capabilities are supported by Xiaomi’s ongoing photography partner Leica, but it’s the pair’s Leitzphone that really emphasizes that. Slightly redesigned from the 17 Ultra Leica Edition that was released in China last December, this includes Leica branding across the hardware and software, a range of Leica filters and shooting styles, and a rotatable rear camera ring that can be used to control the zoom. It’s the first Leica Leitzphone produced by Xiaomi — after a trio of Japan-only Sharp models — and comes with additional branded accessories, including a case with a lens cap and a microfiber cleaning cloth.\n\nXiaomi has plenty of other announcements alongside the 17 series phones at MWC this year, including a super-slim magnetic power bank, the Pad 8 and Pad 8 Pro tablets, and a smart tag that supports both Google and Apple’s tech-tracking networks.\n\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge"

            "content": "I never knew how easy it was to die in an orgy. But that’s just one of the many threats facing Geralt of Rivia in his latest adventure. The studio behind the Reigns series of Tinder-like choose-your-own-adventure games has now adapted The Witcher, following a handful of original titles and a take on Game of Thrones. And for Francois Alliot, creative director at Reigns studio Nerial, the series’ structure actually makes it an ideal way to ease players into sprawling fantasies like this. “There’s something about the way you can bring really complex universes, lore, and storylines to simple actions,” he says. “It can work in a lot of contexts.”\n\nWhat makes Reigns so approachable is the way it distills every action into a binary choice. As you play, you’re presented with cards, and you progress by either swiping right or left. In the case of The Witcher, for instance, an elf might ask Geralt for protection, and your options are simply to say either yes or no and then deal with the consequences. Each run through the game involves making a number of these decisions to progress a storyline until, well, you die.\n\nThe idea was for Reigns: The Witcher to work on two levels. For existing fans, it’s a fun way to play around and experiment in the world. “It’s not a new Witcher,” Alliot notes. “It’s a meta game around this universe, a bit like a fanfiction simulator.” But for those who might be intimidated by the franchise, which spans multiple books, games, and TV shows, it’s also a good place to start. “It works nicely as an entry point because you can really get a feel for the tone and rules, or lack of rules, of the world,” says narrative designer Oscar Harrington-Shaw. “But you’re not having to commit to a complex RPG.”\n\nThere are several aspects of the Reigns formula that had to be tweaked to work with The Witcher. One of the key conceits in the games is that you can die; in the original Reigns you played as a king, and when that was over you picked up as their successor. But that doesn’t really work when you’re playing a character like Geralt who can’t die. So you aren’t actually playing as Geralt; instead, you’re his bard pal Dandelion, singing tales of Geralt’s exploits that may or may not be true. This allowed the team at Nerial to “free ourselves from the lore,” as Alliot describes it, and have fun with things. This is especially apparent in the deaths, which come in the form of the aforementioned orgies or even from Geralt drinking himself to an early grave.\n\n“It really helped in two ways,” Harrington-Shaw says of coming up with the Dandelion idea, which came about from discussions with Witcher studio CD Projekt Red. “One is that it helps explain the loop; it gives a really neat end point. And we can have loads of fun deaths because it’s just a satisfying ending to a song. But we think it adds a really fun tension because you are playing as Geralt and you’re trying to survive, but you’re also trying to write good content.”\n\nImage: Devolver Digital\n\nAs I played, this setup made me much more open to experimenting. Instead of trying to roleplay as Geralt, I would often make odd choices just to see what happened. This, in turn, helps open up new storylines, giving some payoff for making the seemingly wrong decision. Even an early death can lead somewhere interesting in future runs.\n\nThe other notable addition in Reigns: The Witcher is a combat system. It wouldn’t be The Witcher if Geralt wasn’t slaying some monsters, but the idea of battles also had the potential to complicate the streamlined Reigns structure. The team settled on a sort of rhythm game, where you’re moving Geralt side to side on a board to attack or avoid monsters. What makes this system work within the confines of Reigns is that you’re still using the same commands; whether you’re making a pivotal decision or staring down a striga, everything comes down to swiping either right or left.\n\nDespite those changes, Harrington-Shaw says that The Witcher universe is an almost ideal fit for Reigns thanks to its dark sense of humor and frequently bleak world full of opposing factions. More important, though, is the main witcher himself. “Geralt is always facing these tricky binary choices,” he says. “The world of The Witcher is full of murky, gray morality, and that seemed perfect to translate.”\n\nReigns: The Witcher is out now on PC and mobile."

The more I get to know Meredith, a new(ish) editor here at The Verge, the more I realize how correct my first assumption was. Meredith has written about fashion and culture and brands and TV shows and also recently made a Pride and Prejudice joke that made me laugh so hard I spilled coffee all over my keyboard. Technically, Meredith owes me a keyboard.\n\nI asked Meredith to share her homescreen with us, both because I think it’s a fun way to get to know new people here and because I want her to tell me about cool things but I don’t want to just constantly badger her for TV recs. Here’s her homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why:\n\nThe phone: An iPhone 17. Until very recently, I was clinging to an iPhone 12 mini that I’d gotten as a hand-me-down corporate gift from a friend; it was so tiny and good and I had the perfect phone case. (Ben Affleck smoking a cigarette in a mask. A conversation starter!) But the battery became glacial, even after a couple of trips to the Genius Bar, and I had to give it up.\n\nThe wallpaper: A screenshot of Roku City, fall edition. I find Roku City very calming, so I decided to keep it with me.\n\nThe apps: Spotify, Messages, Mail, Chrome.\n\nI’m especially dependent on Notes, and here you can see my three main categories of Note: things I need to do, things I need to buy, thoughts I probably would have tweeted a few years ago. I love that the MTA app will tell me when I should leave for the train, but I almost never check it before I leave my house. For the weather, I actually rely on the New York Metro Weather Instagram account; my boyfriend hates it when I tell him what number the vibes are.\n\nTo be clear, this attempt to simplify my homescreen hasn’t alleviated my time-wasting at all. Beyond this page, I have a loopy number of apps, mostly put into folders to keep me away from them, which doesn’t work. I’m still always scrolling to the last page, to the last folder, to the last page of that last folder, so I can play a mobile game I don’t enjoy called Drop the Cat. There’s maybe nothing worse in my life than the hold that mobile games I don’t enjoy have on me. I’m not even a cat person.\n\nI also asked Meredith to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she sent back:\n\nLove Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette . I’m appropriately ashamed of watching this show (I’m sorry, Schlossberg family!), but it’s a fantastic combination of cool and dumb. One second it makes smoking a cigarette in 1994 while wearing Calvin Klein look like the apex of human existence; the next, Fake JFK Jr. is pointing to an actor in a thick white wig, saying, “Have you met my uncle Teddy?” We shouldn’t even talk about the scene where Jackie O dances to Camelot.

It parses the deluge of recommendations from TikTok or Instagram, if you happen to be on the “wealthy children pose with food” side of those apps. You screenshot the clip, send it to Rodeo, and it grabs the relevant information and can save it in fairly handy lists.\n\nThe library. This might be stolen valor from the Meredith who had not yet downloaded Drop the Cat, but a little over a year ago I moved closer to the library and have really been cashing in on how free those books are. Plus, the Brooklyn Public Library app is so good, letting me put things on hold whenever I happen to think of them. I’m currently reading Louise Erdrich’s The Sentence , which I am probably incorrectly not as into as her The Mighty Red , and we don’t have to talk about how many times I’ve renewed it because I’ve been playing phone games instead.\n\nNirvanna the Band the Show the Movie . I’d never watched Viceland’s Nirvanna the Band the Show before I went to see the movie, and you currently cannot do so legally, so probably I still haven’t. I didn’t need it to enjoy the movie, though, which is hilarious and sweet and made me go “How did they do that???” so many times.\n\nCrowdsourced\n\nHere’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads and this post on Bluesky.\n\n“Marathon (a new extraction shooter game by Bungie) is having an open play-test / demo this weekend so that’s what I’ll be into for the next few days.” – Janego\n\n“Really enjoying Agnes Aubert’s Mystical Cat Shelter by Heather Fawcett (author of the delightful Emily Wilde series). Feels like a cross between Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell and Howl’s Moving Castle.” — Spencer\n\n“Since 1Password have upped their price I’ve spent a few hours moving over to Apple Passwords and Uplock. Was mostly okay, but it’s a shame you can’t transfer over all your passkeys to Apple Passwords. Uplock having a lifetime purchase is a big plus.” — Matthew\n\n“Been watching Demon Slayer this past month, and FINALLY watched the Infinity Castle movie in a theater, and, it’s so clear how these anime movies are wildly different (and spectacular!) in tone, direction and characterization from our current crop of Hollywood blockbusters.” — Anshuman\n\n“I just yesterday switched my family from my grandfathered free Google Apps plan for our custom domain email to Fastmail. Fastmail is private but supports industry standard IMAP and CalDAV protocols, so we can use the built-in mail apps on our phones and computers.” — Mike\n\n“I’ve been listening to Comedy Bang Bang! Still super funny. Big Paul F. Tompkins fan.” — Mo\n\n“Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown. Despite the occasionally brutal RNG, it’s so fun to be able to dive into my favourite Trek stories and tweak the outcomes.” — Jono\n\n“Reading the first book in the On the Calculation of Volume series. It’s a time loop story, like Groundhog Day but way more realistic and sorta sad but it’s great so far!” — Colin\n\n“The news of the YouTube app coming to the Apple Vision Pro made me re-watch the only good use of 360 video I’ve seen: ‘How TV screens made watching movies worse,’ a fully 3D-animated, 20-minute video essay about how the home releases of movies differ from their theatrical cuts and why that matters, and how the physical size of TV screens makes an impact on content. If you have a Vision Pro it’s worth pulling out just for this video. After that, watch everything else that YouTuber (Noodle) has made.” — Nathan\n\nSigning off\n\nThis winter has been a disaster, where I live and many other places. So much snow, so many snow days, so much chaos. First of all, I hope you’ve all stayed safe and warm and well! Second of all, there is one bit of good news in all this: Casey Neistat is out in New York City vlogging again. All these years later, nobody YouTubes quite like Casey YouTubes. Between this and the return of Paul Ford’s blog, it almost feels like the good internet is coming back. Here’s hoping.\n\nSee you next week!"

            "content": "is a deputy editor and Verge co-founder with a passion for human-centric cities, e-bikes, and life as a digital nomad. He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nGood electric bikes are expensive. So why not buy one and share it?\n\nThat’s the idea behind the Tenways CGO Compact e-bike I’ve been sharing with my wife and teenage daughter for the last two weeks. It adapts in seconds without any tools to comfortably fit riders of varying heights thanks to its low-entry frame, quick-release seat post, and height-adjustable handlebar.\n\nIt also takes up less space than an ordinary bike with its 20-inch wheels, folding pedals, and a handlebar that twists to create a slim, wall-hugging profile that goes flat inside a car or train.\n\nThe CGO Compact’s geometry puts riders into a comfortable upright body position. Combine that with wide tires and a heavy aluminum frame – heavier than many full-sized e-bikes – and it feels remarkably sturdy despite its size, with a rear carrier system strong enough to hold a child or a few days of groceries.\n\nThe shareable e-bike isn’t a new idea, but Tenways comes close to perfecting it with the €1,999 (about $2,365) CGO Compact.\n\n9 Verge Score Tenways CGO Compact e-bike $ 2365 $ 2365 The Good Saddle and handlebar adjust quickly\n\nTwists and folds to go flat\n\nRides big and sturdy\n\nGood hauling capacity for size\n\nNo service upsells\n\nLow battery alerts The Bad App is just fine\n\nQuick release seat easy to steal $2365 at Tenways How we rate and review products\n\nTenways, the Amsterdam-HQ’d e-bike company of Chinese origin, has been on a tear in Europe thanks to the post-pandemic chaos that took out much of its competition. The brand makes great looking e-bikes from off-the-shelf parts supported by a robust service network. Importantly, they sell below the €2,681 (about $3,160) e-bike average — expensive compared to the US, but far less likely to burst into flames.\n\nMy Tenways review e-bike arrived at my front door in a giant cardboard box. It seemed big enough to fit the CGO Compact fully assembled and with the handlebar twisted, yet I still had to attach the steering column and front wheel myself. The e-bike took about 20 minutes to unbox, but I’ve been assembling direct-to-consumer e-bikes about once a month for the last decade.\n\nQuickly adjusts to fit my wife who is 164cm (5ft 5in) tall. The handlebars and shock-absorbing seat can be raised in seconds to fit my 183cm (6ft) frame. Open the release to raise and lower the handlebars, lift that little pin to twist them out of the way. The folding pedals help create a wall-hugging profile that’s easy to walk past.\n\nThe first thing I did after assembly was play with the Byschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem. It’s magical. Open the lever to quickly raise and lower the handlebar, or to gain access to a pin release that lets the handlebar twist out of the way. It took a little practice for everyone to master but we soon got the hang of it.\n\nThe small LCD dashboard is bright and colorful even in the sun. You have to enter a four-digit PIN code at power-on, which can only be changed in the rudimentary app over Bluetooth. It’s the only theft-deterrence Tenways offers on the CGO Compact, which also means it won’t try to upsell you on subscriptions or software-locked features.\n\nDespite our height differences, ranging from 164cm to 183cm (5ft 5in to 6 feet), everyone found the CGO Compact to be very comfortable. Adjusting the handlebar and saddle takes less than 10 seconds, and the suspension seatpost did a good job of soaking up small bumps. But the seat’s quick release mechanism offers no additional security to prevent the post and saddle from being stolen. A no-no in the big European cities this bike targets.\n\nThe e-bike’s torque sensor made the ride exceptionally intuitive, ensuring that the power delivered by the 250W rear-hub motor was tuned to match the downward force exerted on the pedals. The motor was also very quiet, masked entirely by the sound of the wide, 2.4-inch tires riding over asphalt.\n\nThe Tenways motor is only capable of 45Nm of torque. And without additional gears, the CGO Compact is best for mostly flat environments. It still did better than I expected on hills, easily besting the 35Nm Raleigh One I recently reviewed. For example, I was able to cross a bridge with a 10 percent incline that stymied the Raleigh One, but only if I had a rolling start — otherwise, I had to get off and push. On downhill slopes, the large chainring allowed me to pedal comfortably at speeds approaching 30km/h without my legs frantically spinning out. The pedal-assist, however, quits helping at 25km/h (16mph) in Europe.\n\nI also didn’t experience any of the twitchiness you get from folding bikes with relatively short wheelbases, smaller 16-inch wheels, and narrow handlebars. In general I rode in pedal-assist levels 3 or 4 out of 5, with 3 feeling the most natural, and 4 for when I was in a hurry.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 25 The suspension seat post soaked up bumps on a variety of road surfaces.\n\nOn a full battery I managed to travel 65kms (over 40 miles) before needing a recharge. I received alerts on my iPhone and Apple Watch when the battery dropped to 10 percent, and power dropped noticeably when the estimated remaining range hit 4km. Charging the 494.36Wh battery took a relatively slow 4.5 hours from the bundled charger.\n\nThe CGO Compact was obviously designed by people that actually ride bikes in compact European cities. It comes standard with integrated lighting, mudguards, a loud bell, kickstand, and a partially covered transmission to protect trousers, skirts, and long coats from getting snagged. The little crossbar in the step-through frame even doubles as a handle to help hoist the bike up stairs.\n\nCity bikes need to haul things, which is why the CGO Compact comes fitted with the click-and-go MIK HD rear carrier system. It supports loads up to 27kg (almost 60 pounds) — enough to fit a compatible crate or child seat. The e-bike also has mounting points up front for a bottle cage or rack.\n\nIn general, the Android and iOS app is fine, but it’s rarely needed. It might eventually be useful for buying accessories and insurance, or starting a chat with support and finding the nearest service center. It also promises to show riding data collected by date, but this never worked for me, only showing zeroes.\n\nTenways’ CGO Compact is an excellent e-bike for €1,999 (about $2,365). The riding experience, everyone agrees, has been stellar. And when it eventually needs servicing, Tenways has a solid network of local bike shops in Europe to provide support, with a ready supply of the off-the-shelf parts from brands you know.\n\nThe CGO Compact is a highly adaptable e-bike that rides big and tucks away small, making it an ideal companion for European city life. It’s also exceedingly shareable — but nobody would blame you for keeping it all for yourself.\n\nCGO Compact Specs Tenways C9 Hub Motor (250W, 45Nm torque)\n\nSingle-speed Gates CDN Carbon belt drive\n\n494.36Wh removable battery\n\nSuspension seat post for Selle Royal saddle\n\nTektro hydraulic disc brakes\n\nByschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem\n\nBike weight: 24kg (almost 53 pounds) with all accessories\n\nMax load: 145kg (320 pounds)\n\nMIK HD Rear Carrier system with 27kg (almost 60 pounds) max load\n\nFits riders 160cm and 190cm (5ft 2in to 6ft 2in)\n\nAccessory mounting points on head tube\n\nIntegrated front and rear lighting with daytime running light\n\nLCD display\n\nBasic app for iOS and Android\n\nPhotography by Thomas Ricker / The Verge"

            "content": "This week, Anthropic delivered a master class in arrogance and betrayal as well as a textbook case of how not to do business with the United States Government or the Pentagon.\n\nOur position has never wavered and will never waver: the Department of War must have full, unrestricted access to Anthropic’s models for every LAWFUL purpose in defense of the Republic.\n\nInstead, @AnthropicAI and its CEO @DarioAmodei, have chosen duplicity. Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of “effective altruism,” they have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission - a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives.\n\nThe Terms of Service of Anthropic’s defective altruism will never outweigh the safety, the readiness, or the lives of American troops on the battlefield.\n\nTheir true objective is unmistakable: to seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military. That is unacceptable.\n\nAs President Trump stated on Truth Social, the Commander-in-Chief and the American people alone will determine the destiny of our armed forces, not unelected tech executives.\n\nAnthropic’s stance is fundamentally incompatible with American principles. Their relationship with the United States Armed Forces and the Federal Government has therefore been permanently altered.\n\nIn conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security. Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic. Anthropic will continue to provide the Department of War its services for a period of no more than six months to allow for a seamless transition to a better and more patriotic service.\n\nAmerica’s warfighters will never be held hostage by the ideological whims of Big Tech.

            "content": "Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.\n\nYet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, Kodak, and others.\n\nAll the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.\n\nIf you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that offers great image quality and lets you choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like Kodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.\n\nTake a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for most people\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 306 grams / Charging method: AA batteries / Companion app: None / Other features: Built-in selfie mirror, film counter\n\nIf all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well-suited for kids and those new to photography.\n\nFor an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most struggle to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash helps. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both bright and dark environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. Photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before, but selfies captured my features and skin tone more accurately, thanks in part to the small front-facing mirror. The updated lens design also lets you twist into Close-Up Mode to zoom slightly and activate the Parallax Correction features for a more aligned photo. It’s a fun, point-and-shoot-style feature, though aligning photos still takes some practice (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).\n\nFor an instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 produces vivid, relatively true-to-life photos. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nThe Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the small counter that shows your remaining shots, which is a useful tracking feature given that each print costs about $1. However, it doesn’t support Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it doesn’t feature filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for a solid instant camera that caters to all ages and experience levels, you’ll likely be satisfied with the Instax Mini 12.\n\nThe best premium instant camera\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 285 grams / Charging method: USB-C (on newer models) / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nOne of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo was a favorite of my former colleague Becca Farcase — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a handsome brown version, as well as a newer pink model.\n\nIt’s easy to balk at its price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.\n\nBeing able to adjust the brightness of the prints helped me capture night photos and a low-light immersive exhibit a little more clearly and realistically, which is a feature the Instax Mini 12 doesn’t offer. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Mini 12, the Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can disable the flash, leverage the 3-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder, and adjust the brightness of a print — a helpful feature, given Evo doesn’t capture dark environments well. The camera’s dials also let you apply various lens options and effects, from retro filters to monochrome shades, and you can even take app-based remote shots, allowing for better seflies and more photographic control.\n\nThe Evo isn’t perfect, though. The companion app isn’t as feature-rich as competing software, the menu system can be confusing to navigate, and the camera’s internal storage maxes out at 45 images. Still, these are relatively minor drawbacks for a stylish, portable camera that makes it easy to quickly capture and print quality shots.\n\nThe best instant camera for social occasions\n\nFilm type: Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / Film size: 3 x 3-inch square prints / Weight: 467 grams / Charging method: Micro USB / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nWhereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app lets you apply frames, stickers, filters, and a wide range of customization options to photos, making it great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature in the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making it a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.\n\nLike the Evo, the Shot 3 Retro features an LCD screen — albeit a much smaller one — that lets you decide whether to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp images from your phone. Unlike the Evo, however, the Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of film. It also uses cheaper film; you can often pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for under $20. The cheaper arguably encourages creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than those from both Fujifilm and Polaroid.\n\nPhotos taken with the Kodak Mini Shot 3 aren’t particularly sharp and can have an excessive pink tint. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nHowever, there are notable drawbacks to the Shot 3 Retro. The resulting prints aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone, for one, nor were they as clear or sharp as what you might get with the Evo or Mini 12 (some even have an excessive pink tint). The Shot 3 Retro doesn’t store images the way the Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish. Nonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.\n\nThe best instant camera for retro fans\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / Weight: 648 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: Yes / Other features: Flip-up lid, scene analysis feature\n\nIf you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the Polaroid Flip is the camera for you. It resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 more than any other camera on our list, thanks to its classic, retro-inspired design and flip-up lid. Its square I-Type film prints and iconic white frame give photos an authentically vintage look, while modern touches like Bluetooth, USB-C charging, and a beginner-friendly companion app add greater convenience and creative control.\n\nCompared to the third-gen Polaroid Now Plus, my former retro pick, the Flip delivers clearer shots with fewer wasted photos, making the extra $50 worthwhile given that eight I-Type sheets are a spendy $18.99. The increased clarity can be attributed to several factors, including the Flip’s sonar autofocus and a four-lens hyperfocal system — which result in sharper, more focused images — along with its excellent flash. It’s the most powerful of any Polaroid camera, and while it can sometimes overexpose images, you can adjust exposure directly from the camera or app. The Scene Analysis feature also helps by warning if a shot is likely to be over- or underexposed, or if you’re too close to your subject. In my experience, the warnings didn’t always prevent overexposure, but they did leave me with shots that looked less blown than those from the Now Plus.\n\nA few outdoor examples I captured with the Polaroid Flip. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nAll that being said, there are some notable drawbacks. The Flip is relatively heavy and awkwardly sized, so you can’t slip it into a purse or easily carry it around. Prints also take up to 15 minutes to develop — during which they must be shielded from light — which can be quite an inconvenience. Low-light performance remains a weak spot as well, and I struggled to capture indoor shots given the contrast and saturation are lower than with Instax film. Admittedly, this gave my pictures a more dreamy, vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust the saturation and exposure settings.\n\nTruth be told, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, the Flip is the perfect camera for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for portability\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / Weight: 239 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: No / Other features: Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter\n\nWhereas the Flip is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It weighs just over a pound and fits easily in the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it the most portable instant camera on our list. If its images were more true to life and didn’t require you to sheild them from the light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d call it the best instant camera for kids or travel.\n\nAt $89.99, the latest Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera available, with film that costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (a 16-sheet pack runs $21.99). The new Go sports a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including USB-C support, and Polaroid claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor. Photos are slightly brighter, though the original Go produced warmer images that felt more true to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low, but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Flip.\n\nThe second-gen Polaroid Go produces charming photos but with a cooler tone. Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Flip, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. There’s no Bluetooth or companion app for added effects; however, the camera does include a self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. The smaller prints may disappoint those who prefer traditional Polaroid sizes, though, and its modern design lacks the retro charm of older models. But classic Polaroid cameras didn’t come with an app, either, and the Go’s simplicity makes it an a easy-to-use option that delivers a traditional instant film experience at less than half the price of the Flip.\n\nOther instant cameras to consider\n\nFujifilm’s $116.99 Instax Mini 41 is the long-awaited follow-up to the Mini 40. The updated model retains the retro design found on the prior model but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups. It didn’t take long testing the Mini 41 for me to realize it’s simply the Mini 12 for adults. With its black-and-silver body and flatter, squarer edges, the Mini 41 looks sleeker and more stylish. The two cameras are nearly identical, aside from the design, with the same solid photo quality and feature set. Both battery-powered options turn on with a simple twist of the lens, and each comes equipped with a selfie mirror, a close-up mode, and a flash (which cannot be disabled).\n\nThere are a few subtle upgrades to the Mini 41, however. A textured grip in the front makes it easier to hold, and its shape makes shooting in landscape mode more comfortable. But those are small differences, and at their core, the cameras offer the same experience. Since the Instax Mini 12 retails for less, I ultimately believe it’s the better value; however, if a fashionable, mature look appeals to you, the Mini 41 is a great alternative, especially if you can find it on sale.\n\nIf you’re looking for an advanced analog instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At $234.95, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12 or the Mini 41, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click cameras given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket, an aluminum extension column, and a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur when capturing fast-moving subjects.\n\nThanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12, Mini 41, and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera, not a hybrid like the Evo, so you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The newer model is also less user-friendly than the Mini 12 and Mini 41, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters.\n\nThe Kodak Smile Plus is another hybrid instant camera that allows you to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $129.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with a physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers.\n\nHowever, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark.\n\nThat said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software isn’t as snappy or feature-rich, it still lets you add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it’s often available for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.\n\nFrom photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, Leica’s Sofort 2 is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.\n\nThe drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s challenging to recommend at $399, as most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The Leica user interface is easier to navigate, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also appreciate that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.\n\nWhile it didn’t make the cut, the Instax Square SQ1 is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and features a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $159.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100. That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Flip and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.\n\nFujifilm also sells the newer Instax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at $199.95. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.\n\nFujifilm’s Instax Wide Evo Hybrid is nearly identical to the Instax Mini Evo. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $409.95 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lenses and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.\n\nPlus, unlike the Wide 400, the Wide Evo Hybrid is a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful feature that can reduce wasted shots. However, at $409.95, it costs significantly more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken, which is something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects, such as a dog or hyperactive toddler.\n\nIf you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $409.95 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $175.95 Instax Wide 400 is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar stills to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.\n\nFujifilm’s new Instax Mini LiPlay Plus isn’t nearly as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo, but it’s worth considering if you take a lot of selfies. At $234.99, the hybrid camera costs the same as the Instax Mini Evo, but features a 3-inch LCD screen on the back, along with a second, rear-facing wide-angle lens designed specifically for self-portraits. That dedicated selfie camera, paired with the LCD, delivers some of the best — and most precise — selfies I’ve captured with an instant camera to date.\n\nThe LiPlay Plus also includes some fun extra features, such as a layered photo mode that combines images from both cameras into a single shot. It can also record short audio clips, which are saved as a QR code you can place in a corner of the printed photo. Both features are enjoyable to play with, though the layered photo mode can, admittedly, come off as gimmicky. You’re basically just dropping a selfie onto a background image with no way to reposition or resize it.\n\nWhat I’m looking for How we test instant cameras Collapse Typically, I try to spend at least a couple of weeks, if not months, testing each camera to get a sense of what it would be like to actually own one. I’ll use them to capture photos of loved ones while hanging out, as well as subjects and scenes I stumble across as I explore Los Angeles and its many beaches. I shoot indoors and outside, with and without the flash, allowing me to compare how each camera performs in both bright and low-light environments.I also ask friends and family — both young and old — for their input on image quality, and I have them take photos with the instant camera to get their thoughts on usability. If the camera comes with extra features, such as filters or support for a companion app, I’ll make sure to put them to the test in real-life situations. I note how easy it is to pull up and navigate the app, apply the effects, and, of course, how the results look. Photo quality Collapse Instant cameras aren’t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most struggle in low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life. Ease of use Collapse How easy is it to set the instant camera up and take photos with it? Ease of use is a big part of what makes instant cameras fun and accessible to people of all ages. You shouldn’t need a professional photography background just to enjoy an instant camera. Value Collapse Instant cameras come with different features at various price points. Generally, the more feature-rich cameras tend to be pricier, but do the extra capabilities justify the added cost? Some cameras, for example, pair with a companion app or feature a built-in selfie mirror, while others let you print images from your phone. None of these are essential, though the added niceties may be worth it for some people. Suitability Collapse Some instant cameras aren’t as well-suited for certain situations and / or people as others. For example, there are instant cameras that print old-fashioned Polaroid photos that aren’t very clear. They frustrate me, but retro lovers might find them charming. Other cameras come with advanced creative modes that let you edit photos and even print smartphone photos, but a young child might find them difficult to use. Film Collapse Each instant camera requires a different kind of film, which means that the sticker price of the camera isn’t the true price. This is something you should take into account before making a purchase, as the cost of film can quickly add up. Depending on the brand, you may have to pay anywhere between 50 cents and $2 a shot.It’s also important to take into account that some film is easier to find. The Instax Mini 12, for example, uses credit card-size Instax Mini film that’s sold at most major retailers. Other types of film, including the film needed for Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, are available on Amazon but aren’t sold by as many retailers.Finally, most instant camera brands sell films of varying quality in a range of styles. Some are decorated with colorful frames and patterns, while others are black and white. They also vary in shape and size, from small rectangular prints you can stick in your wallet to square-shaped ones. You can also buy wider prints, and some brands even sell film with an adhesive backing that allows you to use the resulting images as stickers.\n\nUpdate, February 27th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and shorten the copy for all of our main entries."

New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.\n\nThe blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.\n\nThe Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.\n\nAccess to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.\n\nWe understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase. We acknowledge the difficulties this is causing for our users there. Supabase continues to follow up through all available channels to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nWe continue to advise affected customers… — Supabase (@supabase) February 27, 2026\n\nAn Indian founder, who asked not to be named to avoid potential repercussions, told TechCrunch they had stopped seeing new user sign-ups from India over the past two to three days. A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.\n\nWhile Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.\n\nAt the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nA screenshot showing Supabase’s access blocked on ACT Fibernet Image Credits:Screenshot / Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\n\nNotably, Supabase’s main website remained accessible in India — but its underlying developer infrastructure did not.\n\nIndia is Supabase’s fourth-largest source of traffic, accounting for about 9% of global visits, according to data from Similarweb, highlighting the potential fallout for the country’s developer ecosystem. The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.\n\nThe incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.\n\n“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.”\n\nIndia has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted access to developer platform GitHub, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also reported that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.\n\nFounded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has gained traction amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its valuation to $5 billion.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond."

            "content": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.\n\nSuno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\n\nStill, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more."

            "content": "Others We Tested\n\nThere were multiple great bags we tried whose features or designs just didn't add up to a place in the top spots above. However, everyone has something different they're looking for in a toiletry bag, so while not perfect for us, some of these options may still be perfect for you.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nPatricks BB1 Bathroom Bag for $189: This crush-resistant, shock-absorbing rectangular bag is basically a heavier-duty, unisex version of the Flat Lay, below, except it costs four times as much. I tested it in the Triple Black colorway, which is “strictly limited to 1,000 pieces globally.” This one’s got two interior flaps with a slim, shallow zippered pouch on either side, but otherwise is just one big compartment that led to too much clinking and clanking of contents during my test. It’s great for full-sized products, but my testers and I all preferred bags that hold the products securely upright, as in the less expensive Parallelle Kit, above.\n\nFlat Lay Makeup Box Bag for $37: Available in opaque-fabric and clear (\"jelly\") styles, this unassuming pouch looks like a chubby rectangle with a handle on the end but actually unzips into a flat tray for easy access. There's only one compartment, so I didn't love it as a toiletry bag, but I did love it as a pool and beach accessory bag for sunscreen and makeup.\n\nMonos Metro Toiletry Case for $95: This durable, structured case, available in either nylon or vegan leather, exhibits the class and quality construction Monos is known for. It has one main roomy compartment with three small pockets inside; one zippered. It did a great job of protecting its contents while still being squishable enough to fit in a tightly packed carry-on, though I did find myself wishing it had a handle for carrying.\n\nCalpak Clear Cosmetics Case for $85: Constructed largely of water-resistant, wipe-clean PVC, this clear cosmetic case (I tested the Medium size) zips all the way around and folds flat to reveal two zippered compartments and one smaller zippered mesh bag. It also looks like a cute little purse with its 16 trendy color options, dual handles, and metal bottom studs. However, contents aren't as easy to access as other cosmetic bags that just open from the top—you have to lay the Calpak flat to open both sides, which requires a 16-by-10-inch footprint.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nVera Bradley Toiletry Bags for $30: The erstwhile must-have accessory of both early-aughts Southern sorority girls and their grandmothers, Vera Bradley bags are back with a new spokesperson (Zooey Deschanel), new designs, and updated fabrics like smooth twill and cotton gabardine. (Die-hard fans can rest assured that the staple quilted paisley options are still available.) The new line includes multiple styles of toiletry bags and makeup bags that are lightweight, giftable, and can add a pop of color and personality to your travel setup. I tested several, and my favorite was the Lay-Flat Travel Organizer—its two interior clear zippered compartments and three mesh slip pockets were roomy yet snug enough to keep all contents of my morning routine secure, and a rather large spill of soap in the large pocket cleaned up quickly. However, even though the fabric is padded, which provides some protection for the interior contents, the exterior is somewhat absorbent and not machine washable (though other designs are), so be forewarned that light-colored options could attract stains.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBagsmart Blast 4.5L Toiletry Bag for $30: This rectangular toiletry bag can sit on a counter (with about a 10 x 5-inch footprint) or hang with a 360-degree rotating hook. It's machine washable and has a bright orange interior for visibility, sporting five mesh pockets. Both my testers and I liked it a lot. The only thing that kept it from nabbing a top spot is how much space it took up when not hanging, and when it did hang, it stuck out more than the traditional flat hanging styles.\n\nBeis the Dopp Kit for $68: I’ve had Beis' Dopp Kit for four years now, and it’s still my go-to for any trip. The poly canvas material is durable and easy to spot-clean. Plus, I opted for the black version to mask the inevitable scuffs and smaller stains. What I love the most, though, are the compartments. The water-resistant section is a total game-changer when packing liquids or fragrances. If something leaks, a quick wipe gets the job done. The waterproof bottom is also a huge bonus when I’m getting ready at a bathroom sink. —Boutayna Chokrane\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nThule Aion Toiletry Bag for $65: This spacious, 5-liter bag with an 11 x 5-inch footprint features many thoughtful touches, including a wipe-clean interior with a rubbery, water-resistant bottom to protect it from wet countertops. (Though there's also a handy strap that snaps to hang on any-diameter hook or rack.) The sides snap down to compress, almost like a packing cube, and I like that it's squishable to fit into a smaller suitcase. It also comes with a removable translucent bag for taking liquids through the airport security line. However, it does take up a lot of space when not snapped down, and the waxed canvas does attract a lot of lines and marks, which may not be to everyone's aesthetic taste.\n\nNex Dopp for $73: The small and large Dopp kits I tested, part of Nex’s 2024 Hawaii collection, consisted of a roomy, single compartment with a dual zippered strip. They’re made of microfiber leather, which is a higher-quality synthetic leather, said to be softer and more durable. The bags were stiff and well-structured, which felt protective of my cosmetics when jammed into my carry-on. There is a slight synthetic smell from the microfiber leather, which is hard to miss, since you must lean your face quite close to the bag to see the contents in the cavernous single compartment. I also felt that when the bag was unzipped, the zippered strip was either in the way or had to be splayed out, which took up too much space on my tiny hotel-bathroom shelf. Otherwise, this is a fine option that offers both a lifetime warranty and an unlimited trade-in program.\n\nCotopaxi Nido Accessory Bag Cada Día for $50: Cotopaxi’s trim little bag is meant not just for hygiene items, but any collection of odds and ends. It’s made from light recycled deadstock nylon (so, probably not for you if you are carrying glass bottles or anything that needs padding) and weighs in at a modest 6.5 ounces. Your colorway will be unique! I like the surprisingly capacious 4-liter capacity spread over three different compartments, with a big middle compartment for your quart-size, TSA-approved bag of liquids and two other compartments with separate, smaller pockets. I do have to admit, though, that I like hooks better than loops, and hanging is more convenient with a clamshell toiletry bag design than with this one, which can't be hung while open. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nKusshi Hair Tools Bag for $89: Unlike similar bags that just bunch up your hair tools into a roll, this hair tool carrier has two organized pocket sections; a zippered pouch in the middle for hair products or, in my case while I was testing, attachments for my Shark FlexFusion; and a pocket on the outside for rubber bands or small accessories like lip balm. It's also made of neoprene that's heat-resistant up to 380 degrees Fahrenheit, so you don't have to worry about waiting for your tools to cool down before packing them away. Keep in mind, though, that the initial off-gassing is strong with this one—you may want to let it sit in a well-ventilated area for several days before packing it in your suitcase, lest it make everything else smell plasticky. This included the air from my hair dryer when I used it. There are also reports online of it not accommodating some Dyson tools, though it did fit an Airstrait and Corrale.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nAer Travel Kit 2 Ultra for $79: Does the average traveler need a toiletry bag made partially of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which is 15 times stronger than steel by weight? Perhaps not, but it definitely makes for an interesting bag. Part of Aer’s 10th Anniversary Ultra Collection, this hardy, chunky little Dopp kit incorporates the collection's Ultra400X fabric (in black only) by Challenge Sailcloth, known for its high-performance sails for yacht racers and kite surfers. Despite its strength, the Travel Kit is still pretty lightweight at 8 ounces. However, the hook is thick plastic and too small for a towel rack, and the rubbery “Aer” brand tags on the outside and inside seem to accumulate toothbrush and soap residue, as does the mesh zippered pouch in the top compartment. Both proved somewhat difficult to clean.\n\nEagle Creek Pack-It Trifold Toiletry Kit for $50: Eagle Creek's travel accessory game is extremely strong. Its toiletry bags, packing cubes, and various organizers are affordable, sturdy, and exceedingly well designed, and this toiletry bag is no exception. At first glance, it looks like two toiletry bags snapped together, but each side unzips to make a hanging organizer with six compartments. The only problem is that one side of the bag holds products upside down until it's unfurled, which led to items falling out in my tests.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nState Bags Benson Toiletry Kit for $65: This is a solid, simple bag with three mesh pouches and a snap-in/snap-out plastic envelope that can hold a toothbrush and toothpaste or shower items like soap. The navy version I tested had a coated polyester wipe-clean exterior and interior made from recycled bottles, and I liked that it had the option to hang. However, the organization was more rudimentary than similar-category bags we tested, and it was missing some of the thoughtful details featured on other bags in the same price range, like a quick-access pouch on the back and a larger hook with a rubber tip to prevent slipping. (This bag's thick, small plastic hook wasn't even wide enough to hang on a towel rack.)\n\nCuyana Travel Beauty Case for $298: Those still chasing the quiet luxury aesthetic will love this elegant zippered cosmetic case, available in black or pale pink. It’s made of high-end-feeling Italian pebbled leather both inside and out, with gold hardware and “Cuyana” discreetly printed on the bottom. It opens clamshell-style, and the lid contains a snap-close cover concealing a brush holder with elastic loops. A removable pouch snaps onto that lid cover, and the main compartment has a pocket for securing tubes, bottles, and small tools. Contents aren’t as immediately accessible as they are in other cosmetic cases I tested, but they are more secure. This bag is also on the heavy side, even for a cosmetics case, weighing in at 1.6 pounds, but if you can swing the price, this is a well-made, timeless investment for your travel arsenal.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nCincha the Toiletry Bag for $55: After testing nearly every style of toiletry bag in existence, I thought I had seen it all, but this thoughtfully designed bag from Cincha surprised me. The large size is essentially the tackle box of toiletry bags. It zips open in the middle to reveal four roomy compartments—two on each side, each topped with a small, translucent vinyl zippered pouch. I could not believe the amount of stuff I was able to fit into this thing, and yet I never had trouble closing it, despite packing it to the absolute max. I ended up taking it on a five-day getaway where I had to share a bathroom with two other people, and I found that I loved being able to flip it over and lift the “lid” of whatever side I needed, in order to keep the counter footprint small.\n\nJuly Hanging Toiletry Bag for $85: I own and love July's carry-on suitcase, so I was excited to try the brand's popular hanging toiletry bag. It's a great design with a zippered pouch on the back, plus a body that zips flat to reveal PVC and pouch zip compartments and a large, rubber-tipped metal hook that tucks away. It looks well-made and stylish with leather trim and gunmetal hardware, but my husband took it on a business trip and found that its pockets are actually quite small, confirming a worry I had when I tested it in my bathroom at home. It wouldn't be an issue if the bag itself were small, but it took up a full quarter of the carry-on.\n\nTumi Alpha Bravo Response Kit for $225: This rugged-looking, ballistic nylon bag has the classic Tumi Tracer inside to help facilitate its return to you if it gets lost, as well as an antimicrobial lining. It can hang, stand up, or lie flat and has several convenient internal pockets and an external zipped pouch. It's a lot of money for a toiletry bag with many of the same features as ones half the price, but if you're a Tumi fan and need a toiletry bag to match your luggage, you could do worse than this model.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBeautifect Go Mini for $177: WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe loved the larger Beautifect Box, and I tested the Mini to see if it would work for travel. While the smaller size does make it more portable (along with a purse-like carry strap), the multifunction lighted mirror and its battery made the lid top-heavy, so it kept flopping forward when I tried to use it on a soft, uneven surface like my lap or a bed. It's also got a very hard case and is a bit heavy at almost 2.5 pounds, so as much as I wanted to take it with me on a plane, I ended up bringing a smaller bag instead. Worth a buy if you want a makeup case with a lighted mirror, but it's definitely best for day trips.\n\nFjallraven Kanken Toiletry Bag for $60: I love this thing, which makes me feel like a Red Cross nurse on the battlefields of World War II. It’s made from a proprietary Fjallraven fabric blend that combines organic cotton with recycled polyester, so it feels like fabric but is more waterproof and durable. It has a clamshell design with a sturdy interior plastic hook. My quart bag of bottles goes into the enormous lower zip compartment, my toothbrush and deodorant in the top compartment, and there are mesh pockets and MOLLE webbing so that your tiny things are easily visible. However, its dimensions are very large, so this might not be for you if you’re a minimalist with just a toothbrush and a comb. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nTom Beckbe Canvas Dopp Kit for $195: Known for its high-end jackets, field hats, and vests for fishing and waterfowl hunting, Birmingham, Alabama-based sports outfitter Tom Beckbe also makes a Dopp kit made of full-grain distressed leather and the brand’s proprietary Field Canvas. It matches the genteel Southern vibe of Tom Beckbe’s collection of other travel bags and related accessories like camo whiskey totes and insulated shooting gloves. If the Marlboro Man ever left the ranch, this is definitely the Dopp kit he would have used. The only downside is that the bag is relatively large—and dark inside—for what’s essentially one compartment.\n\nEagle Creek Pack-It Isolate Quick Trip for $25: This little bag is a simple design, made from recycled bottles, with a zipper on the top and on the side. However, its light weight and semi-structured shape make it perfect for holding a wallet and keys at the gym, or even as a tech pouch for work purposes.\n\nKusshi Neoprene Wristlet Clutch for $39: It's a purse! It's a toiletry bag! It's a purse that doubles as a toiletry bag! This clutch is the perfect size for a larger phone, e-reader, or small tablet, with a couple of mesh pockets for makeup. I used it to tote a day's worth of makeup and skincare around town and found it was just heavy enough to be burdensome, but if you like the neoprene look and your essentials are lightweight, this clutch, like most Kusshi products, is sturdy and well-made.\n\nSympl Dopp Kit for $75: I liked this bag’s durable Cordura exterior and stow-away clip for hanging, as well as the fact it has a lifetime warranty. The bag opens clamshell-style to reveal four simple waterproof zip pockets—two thin and horizontal, one small rectangle, and one larger rectangle. It's an interesting idea, but in practice, this severely limits utility since a user is restricted to specific toiletry-sized products that fit the shape of each of the pockets. (My deodorant did not fit, nor did a toothbrush in a case.)\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBagsmart Paz Hanging Toiletry Bag for $35: With its stylish, padded exterior; generously sized carry handle; and ability to transport up to eight full-sized products, this one had me reaching for it long after the testing period was over. The thin, tipped metal hanger makes it easy to hang anywhere, and there's an easy-access compartment on the front with loops for makeup brushes or other long, thin items. In fact, this is almost a small toiletry briefcase rather than a bag—the whole thing unfurls into a 33-inch-long organizer with four separate compartments (two with sections to hold full-sized products). It will almost certainly be too much for anyone who likes to travel light, but if you check your luggage, will be on the road for a long time, or just don't want to deal with decanting your personal care products, this is a well-designed and easy-to-use solution.\n\nSaltyface Everywhere Bag for $36: Technically designed to store Saltyface self-tanners and bronzers, this puffy black fabric bag spent an indordinate amount of time on my counter, simply because I liked how it looked. Practically speaking, though, the handle was too small for an adult-sized hand, and I found myself becoming irritated with the single zipper pull, so it's not ideal as a general-purpose travel toiletry bag.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow I Test Toiletry Bags AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron For bags our team hasn’t already been using for years, I spend a four-week period rotating new toiletry bags during my morning routine. I note any annoyances or unique details, volume, how easy it is to store and retrieve items, how much space each one takes up on the vanity, how they survive being splashed with water and soap, and, if the bag can hang, how easy it is to retrieve items once hanging. About every three months, my family goes on trips that require stays in hotels. I always take different groups of bags and determine how easy it is to use multiple bags at once in a small space, if hook designs allowed for multiple places to hang, and whether the contents spilled in or otherwise dirtied the bags, and if so, how easy they are to clean. For bags I am not able to take on trips, I lend them to friends and family members who are traveling and take down their notes to consider alongside my own home testing. How Does WIRED Obtain Toiletry Bags for Testing? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Some toiletry bags are review samples requested from the manufacturer, while others are purchased and expensed. Review samples are only accepted without promise of editorial coverage. Toiletry bags chosen as picks are reused for durability testing purposes, while all other bags are donated upon completion of testing. What Kind of Toiletry Bag Do You Need? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Dopp kits, cosmetics cases, hanging bags … the differences between categories aren’t always clear. Here are some of the more common types of toiletry bags you'll come across, and what to consider with each. Dopp kit: Named for leather craftsman Charles Doppelt, who provided “Dopps,” or toiletry kits, for WWII soldiers. “Dopp kit” has evolved over time to indicate any kind of portable toiletry organizer, but commercially, toiletry bags labeled “Dopp kits” tend to be smaller and hold just a handful of necessities for short trips as opposed to larger fold-up hanging bags and cosmetics cases. Cosmetics case: Designed for those who need more than just the necessities, a cosmetics case is usually a much larger boxlike container with specialized compartments for makeup, skin care, hair care, and other necessities. They often come with extras like brush holders and mirrors. Hanging toiletry bag: A bag that, as the name indicates, comes with a hook so that it can be hung on a hook, towel rack, tree, or someplace it won’t take up space on the counter. Often, the user needs to hang them to be able to access all the storage compartments. Something to consider is that hooks can be used up quite quickly if everyone in your hotel room has a hanging bag. All the hooks in our bathroom were taken almost immediately, so my husband ended up having to hang his bag over the toilet, which he wasn’t thrilled about. A good hanging toiletry bag will also have a hook that's thin enough to slip over just about any hook, and be rubber-tipped so it won't slide off.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "Shopping for a MicroSD card can be a little daunting. There are a ton of numbers to consider, a huge number of brands producing cards with similar-sounding features and names, and words like Pro, Extreme, and Express getting thrown around everywhere.\n\nTo make a long story short, unless you're shooting a ton of photos and videos, and doing so even semiprofessionally where losing those shots might be detrimental to your professional reputation, you're fine to buy a MicroSD card from any company whose name you've heard before. I prefer cards from PNY, SanDisk, and Lexar. Keep an eye out for the “U” symbol with a 3 inside, or a “V30” on the card for the best balance of speed and price. There are two exceptions to that suggestion:\n\nIf you're shooting on a high-end camera, you should consider a V60 MicroSD card, if you can find one for a reasonable price. Some cameras have extra video features you can enable with a faster MicroSD card, so check your manual for more info on whether you need to upgrade.\n\nIf you're buying for a Nintendo Switch 2, you'll need an unfortunately more expensive MicroSD Express card. While you can transfer images and videos from your Switch 2 with most regular MicroSD cards, you'll need an Express version to use it for actually running games.\n\nCapacity\n\nHow much storage you need will largely depend on your needs, but there are a few things to consider when debating between 128 GB and 1 TB. The first is that MicroSD cards are tiny, and having to swap them out on the road can be a risky proposition. Costs tend to go up exponentially for 1 TB and 2 TB cards, but the gap between 256 GB and 512 GB isn't that large, so I recommend sizing up a bit.\n\nThe other factor is that storage sizes are also separated into different standards, so you'll want to make sure your device actually supports that larger card. Cards that are 64 GB are higher are technically “SDXC” for Extended Capacity, and are currently the most common type, and you should be able to use them in most modern situations.\n\nSpeed\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about MicroSD speeds, we have a write-up with a full explanation of the different speeds and how they interact, but I'll give you the quick rundown here too.\n\nEach MicroSD card will have its actual minimum sequential write speed indicated by a letter and number on the card. The number indicates the speed in MB/s, with the letter representing the generation. A C10, U1, and V10 are all essentially the same speed, just written differently, so you're likely to see multiple symbols printed on each card. I'd recommend checking out the SD Association's page on speeds with a handy chart showing the full comparison.\n\nIn practice, you have to go out of your way to find a MicroSD card that's slower than V30/U3 at most retailers, though you may find them included with some electronics that don't require anything more substantial."

            "content": "The idea of using a laptop cooling pad feels antiquated. These days, laptop chips have become extremely efficient. The fans on MacBooks (if they even have them) are barely used, and both Intel and Qualcomm are pushing efficiency on the Windows front.\n\nBut people keep buying laptop cooling pads, so surely there is a use case in 2026 that actually makes sense, right? I tried out a couple cooling pads paired with a couple of different gaming laptops, and walked away surprised at how effective they could be.\n\nDo Cooling Pads Actually Work?\n\nPhotograph: Luke Larsen\n\nLaptop cooling pads have been around for decades, and the idea has always been simple: provide extra air to blow through a laptop that’s otherwise restricted by its own cooling system. In theory, more air means lower temperatures—and, ultimately, better performance. This is the whole idea of the power modes that exist in Windows, which ramp up the RPMs (rotations per minute) of the fans to add more air to both improve performance. More than that, less heat also means a longer-lasting laptop that doesn't degrade as quickly over time. It’s by that same logic that laptop cooling pads offer help.\n\nThe problem, however, is that a cooling pad is a rather inefficient way of transferring air into your device. Most laptop cooling pads, including the two that I tested, use one large fan or two smaller fans to blast cold air across the bottom of the laptop. This is the first reason why the vast majority of modern laptops won’t benefit much from a cooling pad, as these laptops tend to only have vents along the hinge. Without vents or open holes, blowing air across a sheet of metal or plastic isn't going to do anything to cool the components on the other side. It'll only generate a bunch of fan noise.\n\nGaming laptops are the main exception, though, which is why they are the primary use case for such an accessory. Most gaming laptops have a few open vents, usually above the fans, like the Razer Blade 16, which is one of the laptops I used to test these cooling pads. Laptops like the Blade 16 are designed for intensive tasks like gaming, video editing, or local AI processing—and use a high-wattage GPU and CPU to get the kind of performance you need. My model has two of the most powerful laptop components on the market: the RTX 5090 and Ryzen 9 HX 370. As you might guess, they generate a lot of heat when cranked up. Modern chips tend to max out at 100 degrees Celsius, before throttling back performance to bring down temperatures.\n\nMost laptops use fans to cool these components, but the thickness of the laptop chassis is also a determining factor in how much the system will need to throttle back performance to keep temperatures down. In the end, it's geometry and physics, and every millimeter of space in the laptop chassis has an effect on how cool it can keep its internal components. And unlike in a large desktop PC, you have very restricted space. That's especially true in the modern era, where even gaming laptops have become increasingly thin."

            "content": "Congressional Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee released a report this week pinpointing more than $20.9 billion in consumer losses stemming from identity theft that came out of four major breaches of data broker firms. US senator Maggie Hassan launched the investigation in August after an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, copublished by WIRED, found that some data brokers were hiding opt-out tools from Google and other search engines.\n\nThe US Department of Justice’s recent release of 3 million documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein included grand jury subpoenas to Google that shed light on how federal investigators interact with tech companies and how they respond to government requests for information.\n\nThe Mexican drug cartel CJNG may survive the killing of its longtime leader Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes in part thanks to its prolific use of technologies like drones, social media, and AI. Meanwhile, the Mexican Navy announced on Thursday that it had seized a semi-submersible vessel carrying nearly 4 tons of cocaine as part of a recent initiative to deter drug trafficking in the Pacific Ocean. The effort comes as the US has launched its own purported campaign against maritime trafficking via a series of deadly attacks on boats in the Caribbean.\n\nMeanwhile, as AI assistant agents like OpenClaw explode in popularity—and sow chaos around the web—a new open source project called IronCurtain is using a unique design to secure and constrain agentic AI before it can go rogue.\n\nAnd there’s more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nSetting an autonomous internet-enabled robot loose in your house should give anyone a moment’s pause. When that robot is a roving vacuum cleaner equipped with a camera and microphone that could be hijacked from anywhere in the world with nothing more than its serial number, it becomes an actual privacy horror story.\n\nOne such robovac owner, Sammy Azdoufal, discovered that absurd security vulnerability while attempting an experiment in piloting his DJI Romo robot vacuum cleaner with a PS5 controller. He found that he could instead control 6,700 of the robots in 24 countries around the world, with full access to the floor plans they generated of their owners’ homes and their video and audio feeds. When The Verge contacted Azdoufal, he was able to instantly access a Romo owned by a staffer at the tech news outlet just by knowing its 14-digit serial number. DJI has now fixed the vulnerability in response to Azdoufal essentially live-tweeting his findings. But the story nonetheless raises serious questions about the security of other audio- or video-enabled internet-of-things gadgets—not to mention ones capable of freely roaming your home.\n\nWhile the Department of Homeland has been hugely empowered under the Trump administration in its mission to deport millions of immigrants, the organization within DHS that serves as the United States’ primary cyber defender, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, has been neglected. Now its acting director, Madhu Gottumukkala, has been replaced as CISA seeks to find new footing.\n\nEven before that news, CyberScoop this week reported on the crises that have plagued the agency for the entire first year since Trump’s inauguration: A third of the staff has been laid off and entire divisions of the agency have been closed. Nominations for a permanent director have been blocked in Congress. Its capabilities have withered, and organizations that had sought out CISA for assistance and partnerships have looked elsewhere. Gottumukkala has suffered his own more personal scandals such as ousting security personnel after he failed a polygraph test and sharing sensitive contracts on ChatGPT. Now Nick Andersen, who has served as CISA’s executive director for cybersecurity, will replace Gottumukkala at the beleaguered agency.\n\nA researcher at King’s College London pitted three popular large language models against each other in simulated war game scenarios and found that, 95 percent of the time, at least one of the models opted to deploy tactical nuclear weapons. The researcher also found, when an AI model deployed a tactical nuclear weapon, its AI opponent only deescalated a fourth of the time. None of the companies behind the three models—OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic—responded to New Scientist’s request for comment.\n\nAI’s role in war-fighting has lurched into the spotlight this week. Anthropic and the Department of War are embroiled in a contract dispute over whether Anthropic’s AI models can be used to power fully autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance. Dario Amodei, Anthropic’s CEO, wrote in a statement that these types of use cases “can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.” In turn, President Donald Trump has threatened to ban the use of Anthropic products, including its Claude chatbot, within the US government. Meanwhile, hundreds of Google and OpenAI employees have signed an open letter asking for their bosses to “put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War's current demands for permission to use our models for domestic mass surveillance and autonomously killing people without human oversight.”\n\nA new app for Android phones called Nearby Glasses lets users scan for smart glasses in your vicinity, revealing the presence of the wearable gadgets, which are sometimes indistinguishable from normal glasses and let wearers record people without their knowledge. The app scans for the unique Bluetooth signatures that the glasses emit, and sends users a notification if it detects a nearby source.\n\nThe developer told 404 Media that he was inspired to build the app after reading about several incidents involving smart glasses. Over the summer, 404 Media reported that a Customs and Border Protection agent had donned a pair during an immigration raid, and this fall the outlet also reported that men were using smart glasses to film massage parlor workers, seemingly without their knowledge or consent. In February, The New York Times reported that one smart-glasses developer, Meta, had plans to integrate face recognition into its glasses, spurring fresh concerns among privacy experts."

            "content": "As a vegan, my choices for plant-centric meal kits are, let's say, limited, compared to the extremely omnivorous WIRED reviewer Matthew Korfhage, who has tested nearly two dozen meal kits with everything from spicy shrimp to garlic filet mignon and plum pork loin.\n\nI've tested several plant-based meal kits, which, unlike normal meal kits, are often much more expensive than my usual produce-heavy weekly grocery haul, and also seriously limited in their rotating plant-based or vegetarian options.\n\nAll this to say, I was pleasantly surprised when I tried EveryPlate's vegetarian fare for a week. Each meal came to $7 per serving for two people for four meals, but oftentimes the leftovers ended up stretching over several meals. (There's a discount running at the time of writing, with each serving going for $3—which is almost ramen pricing these days.) In total, my first box of four meals ended up being $56 without discount and $24 with the first-time discount (not including shipping cost of $11), and fed me for almost the entire week. That's cheaper than my usual weekly grocery bill at Trader Joe's in NYC.\n\nAlthough EveryPlate meals could be boring, with a pasta or rice base and lots of cheese, each was tasty enough that I actually looked forward to eating the leftovers. I was actually excited to make (and eat) the next planned meal—a rarity in my time testing meal kits, to be honest.\n\nPlan, Preferences, and Picking Process\n\nCourtesy of EveryPlate\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist EveryPlate Meal Kit Shop at EveryPlate\n\nAfter testing many meal kits, one thing I've grown to appreciate is transparency when it comes to meal choices and price. EveryPlate has both. At a regular price of $7 a serving plus shipping, HelloFresh's budget offering, EveryPlate, is still the lowest-cost meal kit either Korfhage or I have tested; it's cheaper than other budget choices, and even meal kits for toddlers.\n\nEveryPlate is much like parent HelloFresh, but stays cheaper by relying more on simple, grain-heavy dishes, like pasta or rice with a hero flavor. EveryPlate's choices leaned more safe and appealing to the masses; no meal was as adventurous as Purple Carrot, or as health-conscious as Thistle. Each meal I tested took about one hour to prep and cook, although the directions said it would take only 20 to 30 minutes (except for the pizzas I made). And each meal was listed in the 500- to 1,200-calorie range. Because there was limited information on the recipe card (more on that below), it was unclear if the calorie count was total or per serving.\n\nWhen you order, you start out selecting meal type preferences, like Smart & Fit (calorie-conscious meals), Quick & Easy, Family Faves, and Veggie, so that EveryPlate shows you the most relevant recipes first. You can also see EveryPlate's weekly menu to get a better idea of future meal selections and weekly choices. I appreciated EveryPlate's transparency, considering about half of the meal kits I've tested don't allow you to see selections until after you sign up and input payment information. If you don't like their choices after you've paid, you're SOL."

            "content": "It's boom time for water filters, ever since the EPA announced that as many as 10 percent of US water systems may have unsafe levels of PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals,” in the water. Lead pipes are still all over the place, even if they're no longer in Flint, Michigan, as of July 2025. Heck, there are maybe heavy metals in the groundwater, depending where you are, and bottled water risks excess microplastics.\n\nI don't say this to panic you. Your drinking water is probably in compliance with federal standards, and only around 4 percent of water systems end up with unsafe contaminant levels, according to an EPA study in 2020. This said, local water systems won't have to comply with the new federal PFAS and PFOA maximums for drinking water until 2031.\n\nIn response to worries about the water supply, a whole new generation of water filters are making wondrous promises about reductions in contaminants: chlorine, PFAS, heavy metals, stray pharmaceuticals like acetaminophen, fluoride if that's a worry for you. Some of these are whole-home or under-sink reverse osmosis systems. Others are simple countertop systems, gravity-fed through mesh or carbon or other filters.\n\nSo how do you sort out which water claims are credible? I've been testing water filters since 2024, often using chemical indicators and equipment, and can attest that it isn't always easy. Here's a quick guide to checking up on that water filter that caught your eye.\n\nWhat Are NSF/ANSI Water Filter Standards?\n\nThe first main sources of comfort for me when assessing water filters are certifications and independent testing. Vague claims of 99 percent reduction in chlorine or PFAS or arsenic are harder to trust if the testing is internal to the company itself. To be credible, any claims of third-party testing should also clearly identify the lab that conducted the testing.\n\nThe most reliable, standardized form of certification is testing against NSF/ANSI standards. The NSF, formerly called the National Sanitation Foundation, is a Michigan-based, nongovernmental nonprofit founded in 1944 that develops and verifies adherence to a number of different testing standards—including those for water filters. ANSI, or the American National Standards Institute, is an independent nonprofit that accredits accreditation and testing organizations like the NSF.\n\nThere are three main NSF/ANSI standards that apply to filters for home drinking water.\n\nNSF-ANSI 42: Drinking Water Treatment Units—Aesthetic Effects.\n\nThis certifies removal of substances that aren't considered harmful but may affect cosmetics or taste of the water. This includes the chlorine and chloramine used by cities to disinfect drinking water.\n\nThis certifies removal of substances that aren't considered harmful but may affect cosmetics or taste of the water.

But don't assume certification is the norm. Among shower water filters in particular, only one filter received certification from NSF for free chlorine removal: the Weddell Duo."

            "content": "“I don't like talking to you wearing that. It's intimidating.”\n\nA friend said this to me—and he's not joking. His name is Stuart. Stuart is about as affable a person as you could wish to meet, and we have skied together three or four times. Now, however, he doesn't want anything to do with me. I haven't upset him, we are on good terms—but he hates what I've got on my head. By the end of the week, so do I.\n\nThe intimidating headgear I'm wearing is the Ruroc RG2. It is, according to Ruroc, the world’s only full-face snowsports helmet—and now I can fully understand why, despite initially thinking it looked like the ideal lid to replace my aging POC. On paper, the RG2 should be a winner, despite a starting price of $379 (making it more expensive than nearly all of WIRED's picks in our ski helmet guide). Only when you wear it do the drawbacks become abundantly clear.\n\nThe RG2 is actually an ISPO Award-winning helmet. It has a built-in Twiceme NFC chip, so you can store critical medical information that can be easily accessed by first responders in emergencies. To protect your noggin, it's lined with Rheon, a breathable, energy-absorbing polymer (originally conceived from a NASA project looking at space shuttle foam replacements) that's flexible in its natural state but instantly stiffens on impact.\n\nFor even more outlay, there's an optional JBL-powered Cardo Communication System that lets you stream music, take calls, connect with a GoPro, and chat with up to 15 other equally intimidating Ruroc users on a mesh network.\n\nThe big boon of the RG2 over the original RG1, however, comes down to a simple tweak in this updated design. In the RG1, you secured the lower face plate using plastic clips that slid—usually unwillingly—into place. It worked, but any supposed cool factor for wearers was immediately ruined as others watched them attempt to wrestle those clips into place with no helpful mirrors on hand outside your average ski lift or mountain restaurant. The solution? Magnets. Ruroc finally made that call after sifting through “15 years of direct feedback.\"\n\nSloping off: The RG2's full-face setup proved to be a look not conducive to social skiing. Photograph: Jeremy White\n\nGone are the plastic clips and in comes the Magnetic Mask System, which “lets users easily remove the helmet’s chin piece while wearing gloves.” Trouble is, taking the chin piece off was never the problem. Putting the darn thing on was the issue. Still, this new magnetic system is definitely easier, but it's by no means foolproof, and you will still likely have to take two or three stabs at getting it locked in each time you want to add it to the helmet."

            "content": "United States and Israeli forces have launched military strikes against Iran, with President Donald Trump calling the attacks a “major combat operation” against the Iranian regime.\n\nExplosions within Iran were first recorded in the early hours of Saturday morning ET, with smoke rising above the capital city Tehran. Shortly after the first reports of the attacks emerged, both the US and Israel claimed responsibility for the strikes. Explosions have subsequently been heard in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, in what appeared to be retaliatory Iranian strikes.\n\nIn an eight-minute video posted to Truth Social and X, Trump said the operation’s objective was to “defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement confirming the military operation and said Israel was aiming to “remove the existential threat posed” by Iran.\n\nThe strikes on Iran, which have been called Operation Epic Fury by the so-called US Department of War and Operation Roaring Lion by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), reportedly hit multiple cities across the country. The impact, targets, and damage caused by the strikes was not immediately clear.\n\nShortly after confirming launching the attacks, the IDF said it had “identified” Iranian missiles being launched towards Israel. Iran’s response to the attacks appeared to include launching missiles towards other countries in the region that host US military bases.\n\nThe US embassy in Bahrain issued an alert saying that missile or drone attacks could be imminent, with images later showing potential explosions around the capital Manama. The United Arab Emirates Ministry of Defense posted on X that it has intercepted “several Iranian missiles” and that building damage had resulted in the death of “an individual of Asian nationality.” Qatar’s defence ministry also confirmed it had intercepted missiles."

            "content": "I took off my shoes to enter the theater space. My eyeglasses, too. The shoes were part of the ritual, but it turned out that An Ark, an augmented reality theater piece showcased at The Shed in New York City, uses Magic Leap 2 glasses. And those don't work with my prescription. I put on contact lenses in the bathroom before the show.\n\nIn a carpeted room with dozens of people seated in the round, I put on the tethered pair of AR glasses. So did everyone else. We sat together while holographic performers, including famed actor Ian McKellen, manifested around us.\n\nAn Ark is an experiment, billed as \"the first play created for mixed reality.\" I've seen AR experiences in immersive showcases before this that I'd call plays of a sort. But the nearly 50-minute run time of An Ark is probably the longest I've continuously been in a Magic Leap 2 headset. By the end, the glasses felt a bit warm on my nose. I was ready to take them off.\n\nMy colleague Bridget Carey and I both attended An Ark, running at The Shed until April 4, on an extremely cold day a few weeks ago. I'm still thinking about it. The experience was haunting. Emotional, but cold. It felt like we were present at a live theater event, and yet there were no live actors there at all.\n\nEnlarge Image Hallways and walls invite you into the experience at An Ark, preparing you for how to put on the headset. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nWhat does this mean for the future of physical theater? I certainly don't want live actors to go away. I don't think that's the intention of this play, either. The whole experience is presented as a memorial-like meditation on the liminal space after death.\n\nFour (virtual) chairs appear in a semicircle in front of me, and one by one, the volumetrically captured actors appear. McKellen, Golda Rosheuvel, Arinzé Kene and Rosie Sheehy are hypnotizing as presences that feel like they're sitting right across from me. It's the eye contact, as Bridget says to me later. Also, it's the sense of how they're all battling for your attention.\n\nMy field of view on the glasses is only wide enough for about two of the four chairs. I turn my head back and forth to see what the others are doing. The actors talk to me, just to me, looking me in the eyes, imparting their stories: Do they know me? Do I know them?\n\nEveryone in the theater space feels like they have these four actors seated across from them. It's a simultaneous illusion. But I can't see what anyone else is seeing: I just see them seated in a semicircle in front of me. That multiplicity might sound strange, but it succeeds here. It ends up feeling like we're all bearing witness together.\n\nWe're also sharing the same ambient audio. I realize this halfway through, that the full room sound I was hearing, of them being there with me, is also there for everyone. At least, I think we are. I'm pretty sure we are.\n\nEnlarge Image I had to take my glasses off and put contact lenses in. Look closely, and you can see the virtual chairs I see in the lenses of the Magic Leap 2 headset, barely. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nWhy this felt profound... and messy\n\nEven in 2026, I haven't seen that many moments where augmented reality becomes a replacement for the real. AR glasses have a challenge that still has never been tackled: How do you make a virtual experience you see in the real world mesh safely and comfortably with everyone else who's there, too, and who probably aren't seeing exactly the same thing in their glasses?\n\nCompounding the problem is that AR glasses aren't something most people have much experience with. Mixed reality headsets like the Apple Vision Pro, the Samsung Galaxy XR and the current line of Meta Quest headsets can create mixed reality that feels like it's in your space with you, but no one's wearing those in public.\n\nMagic Leap was an early innovator trying to make AR things happen. The producer of this show, Todd Eckert, was formerly the head of content development for Magic Leap.\n\nHe produced two other Magic Leap hardware-powered theater experiences in the past: The Life (in an art installation, featuring Marina Abramović) and Kagami (an AR concert piece made with Ryuichi Sakamoto). An Ark feels like an extension of the idea and a challenge for us to reckon with how we might accept the virtual presentation of real actors. It's sort of an inversion of the current moment: While AI is throwing us so many videos of artificially generated people, here I saw a virtual presentation of very real acting. I felt the difference.\n\nSetting up a closed theater event for shared moments like The Ark is a step in the right direction. But I also don't know if this type of experience, over time, will still be interesting when the novelty of AR glasses is lost. Looking around, I got the feeling of people trying out tech they'd never really used before. Coming out of the 45-minute show and walking out a door to retrieve our stored shoes, I felt like I was emerging from a ritual.\n\nCouldn't I do this at home instead? Yes, but would it feel the same, me alone in my cluttered space without the joy of sharing it with others? That's the thing. While this $45, 45-minute show required me to travel to the west side of Manhattan on a cold evening, it also let me feel togetherness virtually. We're still not in a world where most people even have the hardware to make this happen, much less all gather to use it together.\n\nBut it's also the performances, seen at an intimate distance, that made an impact. I've worked out with holographic trainers in the Meta Quest, but it does feel special to see this type of virtual presence in a clean, uncluttered space designed to receive it.\n\nI'd love it more if I somehow didn't need to bring my own contact lenses, but that's the reality of smart eyewear right now. So few smart glasses are made to support all prescription types, and many don't fit over glasses. The performance did offer prescription inserts to help people, but only up to -5. Bridget's -6 prescription couldn't be fully matched, either.\n\nMy \"I'm at a real play\" senses were activated, even though no live actors were actually there. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nAfterward, oddly, a hunger for reality\n\nWhat An Ark did do, though, is make me feel grounded in an experience in a real space. I remember being in that room, seeing the people. Taking my shoes off. Feeling present.\n\nAnd in the show itself, as the four actors -- angels or spirits between the worlds of life and death, perhaps -- begin to share memories of lives once lived, ones that blend and melt and represent many people, perhaps I, too, felt like a message was being imparted to me. I passed through the door, leaving the show happy to be alive and glad to have made a journey to a place to see theater -- even without the actors. Was that the whole idea? Maybe the ark is made of us.\n\nI've found myself thinking more about the real world as I get deeper into personal wearable tech that tries to connect and transform the world around me. The real world is stable and tangible and rich. I want to pay attention to it. An Ark let me do that while also being virtual, which is magic in itself."

            "content": "The Samsung Unpacked event made me want to scream four words: Enough of AI already!\n\nOn Wednesday, the tech titan unveiled its Galaxy S26 models and the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, but AI was the real star of the show. Samsung introduced its Browser with an Ask AI tool, an upgrade to the Circle to Search feature that uses AI to identify items to purchase from a picture, AI photo editing and an array of Galaxy AI updates. The list of AI-integrated features doesn't stop there.\n\nIf you're pumped about the future of AI, that's fine. For me, though, Samsung's event left me more skeptical than excited about what's to come. It reminded me why I will never give up performing some human-centered tasks, like ordering a pizza or looking for dupes of an expensive pair of shoes. It's because I like doing them.\n\n\n\nConvenience and efficiency come at a social cost\n\nSure, Galaxy AI is convenient. It can free up time to do more of what I want while allowing other tasks to run in the background. But I actually enjoy many of my day-to-day duties, like wrangling a complex food order with my family or narrowing down a vacation destination.\n\nI get to be social. I get to laugh at jokes. I get to learn more about my loved ones -- which wouldn't be possible if I gave those tasks to a bot.\n\nI don't want my smartphone to fully disconnect me from the little things. I want to stay connected to what matters most, even if it takes a few more minutes.\n\nWatch this: Samsung Unpacked 2026: The Future of AI Has Arrived (Highlights) 10:34\n\nI don't need Galaxy AI to handle every move I make\n\nSamsung introduced the Now Nudge feature, which monitors what you're doing on your phone and suggests shortcuts to avoid switching between tasks and apps. For example, if you need to share photos from an event, Galaxy AI can pop them into the message for you.\n\nTruthfully, I like going down memory lane and looking at those pictures. Sending them myself gives me a nostalgic feeling, especially from special events like weddings and weekends with long-distance friends. I also like choosing my best angles, something Galaxy AI may not get right.\n\nAnd as an editor, I loathe Galaxy AI's ability to select text, summarize, reformat and tweak words. AI hasn't always gotten this task right, and it definitely doesn't own my voice.\n\nGalaxy AI doesn't need to know everything\n\nSamsung says we'll be able to determine what Galaxy AI data is processed, as it relies on its Knox Matrix Trust Chain technology for cross-platform security. But Galaxy AI's power feels too strong to escape, even with the best safety measures in place.\n\nThe deep integration of AI into every phone feature feels like a major privacy risk, especially since we're only at the starting line. Between document scanning and those new Galaxy Buds Pro 4 briefings, AI is officially everywhere, and the privacy implications are terrifying.\n\nSince cybercriminals are evolving just as fast as AI is, I'm starting to think a carrier pigeon is a safer bet for my personal tasks."

            "content": "Your bottle of wine is only as good as the conditions in which it's stored. While we often follow general rules such as avoiding direct sunlight and seeking cool, dry spaces, you may be committing a handful of wine crimes without realizing it -- otherwise known as pour decisions.\n\nFortunately, I chatted with Liz Martinez, general manager and sommelier at Centrolina in Washington, DC, as well as Beki Miller, advanced sommelier and beverage manager of Las Vegas's Caramá by Wolfgang Puck, to remind us what reds, whites and bubbles demand in ensuring that their quality and integrity are maintained with every cork pop.\n\nHere are their top tips and warnings about proper wine storage.\n\n1. On top of the fridge\n\nThe heat emitted from the top of your fridge can decimate wine in just a few days. Joey Kotfica/Getty Images\n\nWhile you may have ample space to line or stack bottles on top of your fridge, it's far from ideal.\n\n\"Refrigerators give off heat and vibrate constantly, both of which accelerate aging and degrade quality,\" explains Miller. \"You don't need specialized equipment to store wine well. You just need the least bad option.\"\n\n\"My go-to solution is simple: boxes of wine on the floor of an interior closet, with the bottles stored on their sides,\" she says. \"This keeps the cork from drying out and protects the wine from light and vibration. I also store wine in a box under the bed, which offers a dark, quiet and relatively stable environment without taking up valuable space.\"\n\n2. In fact, most of the kitchen is off limits\n\nThe kitchen is one of the worst rooms to keep your wine rack. Ucpage/Getty Images\n\nSure, it may make sense to transfer your above-fridge bottles to cabinets, but the kitchen is a room that experiences frequent changes in temperature, light and activity.\n\n\"Try not to keep wine in the kitchen,\" advises Martinez. \"There are a lot of elements and appliances that can put out heat outside of the stove. In fact, placing wine near any appliance [other than in a wine fridge] is not a good idea.\"\n\nMiller echoes these sentiments, adding that \"kitchen cabinets may seem like a good solution because they're dark, but kitchens experience frequent temperature swings.\"\n\n\"Ovens and dishwashers create heat spikes, and those fluctuations are especially damaging over time,\" she says. \"Garages are another common misstep. Daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations make them among the least stable environments for wine. These fluctuations are often worse for wine than being slightly too warm or too cool. Wine values consistency above all else.\"\n\n\n\n4. In the car\n\nThe car, with all its rattling and temperature fluctuations, is no place to keep wine for more time than it takes to get it home. Choi Dongsu/Getty Images\n\nOne of the biggest threats to wine quality is the trip from store to home.\n\n\"Care should start the moment the wine leaves the store,\" stresses Miller. \"Wine is especially vulnerable during transport, particularly in warm weather. Leaving bottles in a car trunk while running errands, even for an hour or two, can expose them to temperatures well above what wine can tolerate.\"\n\nOn warm days, for example, a parked car can easily exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which effectively \"cooks\" the wine before it's even opened.\n\n\"Whenever possible, wine should be the last stop on your errand list, and bottles should be brought inside promptly. In hotter climates, an insulated bag can help limit exposure on the drive home,\" she suggests.\n\n5. Somewhere for it to \"age\"\n\nDo your research before attempting to age wine. You could be doing more harm than good. Cavan Images/Getty Images\n\nIt is a myth that most wines taste better with age. Instead, most wines should be opened and enjoyed right away.\n\n\"Some wines are intended to be drunk when they are young and fresh. Not every wine is meant for aging,\" says Martinez. \"It is important to understand the difference. If you sit on a wine that is meant to be drunk right away, your wine will lose everything that is good about it.\"\n\n\"Wines like the more impressive Burgundies or Bordeaux, or even a Napa Cabernet, will need some age, versus an everyday wine that you pick up at the grocery store,\" she adds. \"Understanding that distinction and doing a bit of homework will save you the heartache of losing out on a wine that could've been enjoyed at the correct time.\"\n\nThis is important to keep in mind for any new purchases, as you'll have less flexibility with bottles meant for long-term storage.\n\n\"A bottle you grab on Tuesday to open on Friday doesn't need the same care as a case brought home from a winery or a meaningful bottle you're saving for a future celebration,\" says Miller. \"Short-term storage is forgiving; longer-term storage requires a bit more intention.\"\n\nAs a general guide, full-bodied reds like Cabernet Sauvignon and fortified wines such as port or Madeira tend to handle imperfect conditions better. More delicate wines like Champagne, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling are sensitive to heat and fluctuation and will show damage sooner.\n\nYou don't need a wine fridge, but it can certainly help\n\nPlenty of safe storage options don't require a dedicated fridge. owngarden/Getty\n\nIf collecting bottles has piqued your interest, especially while traveling to wine countries around the world, a wine fridge isn't a necessity. That said, dedicated wine fridges can be had for a few hundred dollars and remove the guesswork from proper wine storage.\n\n\"There are plenty of places around the home to store wine that will help with protecting it,\" says Martinez. \"Cool, dark places like a closet or maybe under the stairs [work]. The basement is also a good option, as long as it is not a humid area.\"\n\nAim for these temperatures\n\nA wine fridge can keep your bottles at the perfect temperature for as little as a couple hundred dollars. Media Whalestock/iStock/Getty Images\n\nWhile consistent temperature and climate may be difficult to control in a typical household, most bottles have a \"sweet spot\" for temperature.\n\nAccording to Miller, wine should be stored in darkness at between 50 and 59 degrees Fahrenheit, with minimal vibration and as little temperature fluctuation as possible.\n\n\"That doesn't mean perfection is required,\" she explains. However, \"if a wine tastes flat, dull, or oddly 'old,' storage or transport is often the reason, not the producer or the price tag.\"\n\n\"More specifically, you can go a bit cooler for white and sparkling,\" adds Martinez, recommending sticking to around 45 degrees Fahrenheit for whites and \"a touch cooler for sparkling.\"\n\nWhen it comes to serving the wine, she recommends around 40 degrees for sparkling and white and around 60 degrees Fahrenheit for red.\n\n\"Just under room temperature is great for red wine,\" she says. \"It really helps the wine character develop nicely in the glass if you pull it out of a wine fridge and let it naturally warm up a touch.\""

The victory leaves Arne Slot's men just three points outside the all-important top five.\n\nThat result also provided a boost for their visitors this afternoon, with Forest's loss and West Ham's own creditable draw against in-form Bournemouth last Saturday. That means the Hammers could potentially climb out of the relegation zone at Forest's expense with a win on Merseyside.\n\nLiverpool takes on West Ham on Saturday, Feb. 28, at Anfield, with kickoff set for 3 p.m. GMT. That makes it a 10 a.m. ET or 7 a.m. PT start in the US and Canada, and a 2 a.m. AEDT kickoff in Australia early on Sunday morning.\n\nWest Ham boss Nuno Espírito Santo faces the daunting task of attempting to guide his side to victory at Anfield, a feat the East Londoners have managed just once in their last 57 visits across all competitions. Rhianna Chadwick/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHow to watch Liverpool vs. West Ham in the US without cable\n\n\n\nSaturday's match at Anfield will be broadcast on USA Network, which you can access with a live TV streaming service like Sling TV, or a pricier option such as YouTube TV or DirecTV's MySports package.\n\nHow to watch Premier League 2025-26 from anywhere with a VPN\n\n\n\nIf you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the Premier League action while away, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds.\n\nA VPN can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, providing an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. However, some streaming services might have policies that restrict VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance.\n\nIf you choose to use a VPN, follow the installation instructions from the provider to make sure that you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN usage is crucial.\n\nJames Martin/CNET ExpressVPN Best VPN for streaming Price $13 per month, $75 for the first year or $98 total for the first two years (one- and two-year plans renew at $100 per year) Latest Tests No DNS leaks detected, 18% speed loss in 2025 tests Jurisdiction British Virgin Islands Network 3,000 plus servers in 105 countries ExpressVPN is our best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN that works on a variety of devices.

            "content": "What we like about it: The Dream Duo 2 includes the Owlet Smart HD monitor and the Owlet Dream Sock. The Owlet is the only FDA-cleared infant health monitor on this list. The Dream Sock is the first and only over-the-counter medical pulse oximetry solution for infants. The package came with four different-sized socks that are meant to fit healthy infants weighing 6 pounds to 30 pounds. The socks contain a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, which is similar to what hospitals use to test your heart rate. The sock has velcro straps so you can easily adjust it around your child's foot.\n\nOne thing I liked about this camera is that the cord was the longest of all the monitors, and its magnetic base made it the most adjustable, so you get the best camera angle possible. This was super helpful since the area where I have my son's pack 'n play requires a tricky angle to get the whole view. This baby monitor is powered through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and connects to the Owlet app (available on iOS and Android). The app is free and there is no paid subscription.\n\nThe readings show you the baby's pulse rate, oxygen levels if it detects movement, the noise in the room, the room temperature and predicts their next nap based on their wake windows and when the baby wakes up. After the baby rises, you receive a full report of the sleep session that tells you how long the baby slept and their average heart rate and oxygen levels. One of the things that surprised me was how the sock was able to tell when and for how long my son was awake and when he was in a light or deep sleep.\n\nWho it’s best for: This tool can be helpful for parents with newborns and babies because the data can be shown to their pediatrician if their baby is experiencing a sleep regression or if they're having a hard time figuring out their wake windows and establishing a sleep schedule. If your goal is to get a better understanding of your child's sleep patterns, the Owlet Dream Duo 2 could be a good choice for your family. Please note: The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against using direct-to-consumer heart rate and pulse oximetry monitoring devices to prevent sudden infant death syndrome or other sleep-related deaths. The AAP warns that there is not enough evidence to support that these types of devices can prevent these deaths from occurring and give parents a false sense of security. Owlet states on its website that the Dream Sock is intended for tracking your child's well-being by monitoring sleep patterns, quality and duration of sleep. As long as you use the Dream Sock correctly, you can reap the benefits.\n\nI found the setup for the sock to be easier than the camera, but using the sock on my son took some trial and error. That’s because he didn’t like keeping it on, so it’s something to keep in mind if your child doesn’t like wearing shoes or socks.\n\n\n\nWho should avoid it: If you’re someone who is overly anxious with extra data, this baby monitor may not be the right fit for you. As previously stated, the Owlet sock is only meant to be used as a way to track your baby’s sleep patterns and not as a medical device. You will need to keep the sock on the charging base when it's not in use for it to remain charged. If you don't place it back on the base, the battery will drain and it won't work correctly. Sometimes I'd have to troubleshoot getting the sock and camera to work from the app if they lost connection. The base itself lights up different colors and each one has a different meaning:\n\nGreen light: A blinking green light means it's capturing the heart rate and oxygen readings. Once established and everything seems in range, the blinking becomes more steady.\n\nRed light: If the base starts blinking red, this means oxygen levels or heart rate levels are out of range.\n\nBlue light: This means the base is unable to detect the sock via Bluetooth and it will also play the lullaby \"Hush Little Baby\" to notify you.\n\nYellow light: This indicates that the sock is unable to find a reading on your baby's foot.\n\nIf the Dream Sock seems a bit much, the camera is also sold separately and offers a clear picture of your child as well as two-way audio, temperature check and cry notifications."

            "content": "A total lunar eclipse is happening in a few days. Like supermoons, they come in batches, and this is the final eclipse in a trio that started in 2025. If you miss this one, you won't get another opportunity to see a total lunar eclipse until New Year's Eve in 2028.\n\nAccording to The Farmer's Almanac, March's full moon will occur on the morning of March 3. It'll reach peak illumination, when the moon is at its fullest, at 6:38 a.m. ET. But you won't see the full moon in all of its majesty, even if you're outside at that exact time, because the moon will be in the middle of its eclipse.\n\nA lunar eclipse causes the moon to glow red, which is why people call it a blood moon. NASA Simulation Lab\n\nThose hoping to see the eclipse should consider brewing an extra pot of coffee. The show starts at 3:44 a.m. ET as the moon begins to move into Earth's shadow, a region known as the penumbra. The moon will darken during this time as Earth starts to block sunlight. This phase lasts until 4:50 a.m. ET when the moon enters the umbra, the spot behind Earth where all direct light from the sun is blocked. The moon will enter its maximum eclipse at 6:33 a.m. ET.\n\nThe moon will turn into a blood moon during this time. As sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, shorter blue wavelengths scatter, while longer red and orange hues are refracted toward the moon. This gives the blood moon its signature reddish look.\n\nThis phase of the eclipse will last until 8:17 a.m. ET when the moon enters penumbra again. The eclipse ends at 9:23 a.m. once it leaves the penumbra for the final time.\n\nWill I see the lunar eclipse?\n\nEveryone in North America will have a chance to see the lunar eclipse, though not everyone will experience it equally. The central path of the eclipse rips right down the center of the Pacific Ocean, so only people on the West Coast, Alaska and western Canada can see the whole thing. The further east you go, the less of the eclipse you'll be able to see.\n\nThe website Time and Date offers a map showing who can see the eclipse and how much they'll see. It's almost perfectly lined up with US time zones, so here's how well you'll be able to see the eclipse based on where you live.\n\nPacific Time: The full eclipse will be visible from beginning to end.\n\nThe full eclipse will be visible from beginning to end. Mountain Time: The full eclipse will be visible, but you may miss part of the penumbra phase.\n\nThe full eclipse will be visible, but you may miss part of the penumbra phase. Central Time: The entire eclipse will be visible, but you'll miss more of the penumbra phase. People residing near the western end of the Eastern Time Zone will also experience this level of eclipse.\n\nThe entire eclipse will be visible, but you'll miss more of the penumbra phase. People residing near the western end of the Eastern Time Zone will also experience this level of eclipse. Eastern time: Most of the eclipse will be visible, and you'll miss a significant part of the penumbra phase.\n\nDo I need special equipment to see the lunar eclipse?\n\nYou won't need any special equipment to see the lunar eclipse.\n\nIt'll be the brightest thing in the night sky, and the moonlight isn't a danger to human eyes as it would be during a solar eclipse.\n\nThe only thing you'll need is caffeine, because this all takes place in the middle of the night and very early morning.\n\nThe next lunar eclipse\n\nTotal lunar eclipses tend to happen in batches of three. The last two occurred in March and September 2025, with the final member of the trio coming on March 3. Once that one passes, the next trio of lunar eclipses won't happen until Dec. 31, 2028, followed by June and December 2029."

            "content": "I could go on for hours about all the latest high-tech features in security cameras, including AI summaries, magnetic mounts and privacy zones. But all those extras can get overwhelming, especially if you're trying to ignore the clutter and save money.\n\nDespite all their advances, security cameras still come with unnecessary features, and that's an advantage if you know where to look. You can simplify your setup and save cash by ignoring add-ons, no matter how much they're advertised. Here's my take on the least useful home security camera features -- and why you can skip them.\n\nPan/tilt capabilities\n\nI've seen good pan/tilt cameras, but it's not a feature most homes need. Tyler Lacoma/CNET\n\nPan/tilt features aren't always bad news -- some of my top-reviewed cameras include the ability, giving them nearly 360 degrees of viewing range and tracking. The problem is that most home cameras don't actually need that capability.\n\nUnless you're watching over a very, very large space or have your camera set up in the middle of an open floor plan (a very awkward placement for homes), you don't really need pan/tilt options. Today's cameras typically offer fields of view wider than 130 degrees, so with the right placement, you can capture most of a large room or backyard.\n\nSkipping pan/tilt features can make cameras both more affordable and more durable. Add in motion detection with person recognition, and you should be set with a watchful cam that lets you know what's going on. Pan/tilt is a better option only if the camera is wired -- such as to a junction box or outdoor outlet -- and doesn't have a clear view of your access points.\n\nNVR support\n\nThere are many wireless and wired security cameras that not longer need or benefit from NVRs. Eufy\n\nNVRs -- or network video recorders -- were common parts of very early security systems because they didn't really have any other way to capture and manage lots of video footage. Today, an NVR for home security cameras is largely unnecessary and, I'd argue, a significant drawback.\n\nNot only are these extra hubs bulky, expensive and limited in what they can do, they're also outclassed by today's microSD cards for local storage, which can hold over 1TB of video. Add the wireless video management that mobile apps offer, and NVRs are best reserved for specific commercial applications.\n\nPlus, NVR systems are often designed to use a PoE camera system, which requires much more installation work and isn't suitable for the average home unless you really want to avoid all wireless signals.\n\nProtective enclosures\n\nUnless you live very, very far north, a camera enclosure won't do you much good. Andrew Wevers/Stringer via Getty Images\n\nToday's outdoor security cameras typically have IP64/IP65 weather resistance ratings, which means they can handle most outside conditions. An enclosure to protect the camera is both more work to clean and unnecessary in all but the most blizzardy climates. Also, it can be difficult to find a camera housing that fits your specific model.\n\nIf you're worried about someone damaging your home security camera -- say, with a baseball bat -- that scenario is so rare it's not worth paying extra for a protective enclosure unless you have evidence it's happening in your neighborhood. A nearby family of starlings is likely to cause more problems, in which case you may want a camera cover for around $20.\n\nLTE connections\n\nLTE cameras work well in remote locations, but they're unnecessary for most homes. John Larsen/CNET\n\nLTE cameras have built-in SIM card slots, allowing them -- like your phone -- to connect to cell towers and use a data plan to transmit video (along with the added fees). That's a great option for remote locations, but probably not necessary for your home.\n\nToday's wireless security cameras offer very healthy Wi-Fi ranges suitable for all kinds of homes and Wi-Fi routers. The extra costs of an LTE camera are worth it for construction sites or off-grid cabins, but a poor fit for your backyard. If you get very frequent blackouts that knock out your Wi-Fi, you're better off investing in a powerful home backup battery than spending money on an LTE cam.\n\n4K resolution\n\nGenerally, a 2K camera is the most resolution your home needs. Lorex\n\nA 4K camera offers much higher resolution, which means more detail on your security videos. I know that sounds like a high-value upgrade -- I even have a list of the best 4K cameras for those interested -- but it's not beneficial in the same way as 4K resolution is in your monitor or TV screen.\n\nI'd skip 4K not just to save money, but because it consumes more bandwidth for live viewing and often requires additional storage for video clips. It can also introduce higher latency, which may lead to lag or visual glitches. Many cameras let you switch to a lower resolution to address those issues, but at that point, what's the benefit of paying for 4K in the first place?\n\nThat's why some of the latest and most powerful cameras I've tested, including late 2025 models from Google Nest, Arlo and Blink, stick with a 2K resolution, which I'd say is the sweet spot for security cam resolution. Save 4K for commercial cameras or very specific use cases where lots of detail is mandatory.\n\nSpotlights\n\nSpotlights are usually outclassed by floodlights, making it smarter to either upgrade or skip the feature entirely. Ring\n\nSpotlights occupy an awkward space in home security. Security cameras are often installed in areas that already have porch lights or other nearby illumination. And if not, modern night vision typically delivers excellent results without added lighting. If you do want illumination -- or the \"scare\" factor to deter trespassers -- a floodlight camera is almost always the better option. Battery-powered spotlight cams also tend to drain much faster when the light repeatedly triggers.\n\nThose factors mean it's usually better to choose a floodlight camera, opt for a model without a spotlight or simply turn the light off altogether. There aren't many situations where a spotlight is truly necessary. It could make sense for a dark entryway or a set of shadowy patio steps as a safety feature, but in most cases, it's an add-on you can skip.\n\nWhat about cloud storage?\n\nCloud storage and local storage both have their place. Tapo\n\nCloud storage isn't a useless feature, but its value depends heavily on your camera and your preferred setup. Some cameras rely solely on cloud storage, which may offer only limited access -- such as Nest's six-hour event history -- or require a subscription to unlock full functionality, such as Arlo's $8-per-month Secure plan. Others include a microSD card slot or an optional hub for local storage, which carries a higher upfront cost but avoids ongoing fees. And some cameras offer both options.\n\nCloud and local storage each have their benefits. Local storage is cheaper in the long run and better for privacy, but it's more difficult to share, and you'll have to clear out your local storage occasionally. Cloud storage is convenient, enables more advanced AI features like video searches and lets you download any video you want, but it comes at a higher price. People may also worry about security companies sharing cloud videos with law enforcement or getting hacked, which are legitimate concerns.\n\nOkay, what about the new AI features?\n\nWhen enabled, Gemini for Home adds a new type of watchfulness to security cameras. Tyler Lacoma/CNET\n\nSince advanced generative AI features -- such as object recognition that creates video summaries -- are currently limited to higher-tier subscriptions, they aren't the focus of this list. Instead, I've focused on the more tangible features you'll see on a security camera's box or product page, and which of those don't add much value.\n\nFor more info, check out the worst places to put your camera and what useless features to avoid if you want a full security system, too."
