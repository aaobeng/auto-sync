            "content": "FOOTBALL fans were left stunned yesterday as a household name from the past looked unrecognisable during the Champions League draw.\n\nOne of the best midfielders of his time, but this time, he wasn’t playing, he was the one pulling the strings behind the scenes.\n\n\n\n\n\nA key player for Portugal and some of the biggest clubs in Europe, he’s no stranger to glory.\n\nAt his peak, he was one of the best for his country, playing at every level from under-15s all the way to the national team.\n\nIt’s been years since this football legend hung up his boots, but his name still echoes through the game.\n\nDuring the Champions League draw, some had to go down memory lane before recalling that it was Maniche.\n\n\n\nThe Portuguese dynamo who starred for clubs like Benfica, Porto, and Chelsea.\n\nHe was a key figure in Porto’s 2004 Champions League triumph under Jose Mourinho, and his performances for the Portuguese national team, including a run to the 2004 Euros final, made him a household name.\n\nKnown for his powerful presence in midfield, sharp passing, and knack for scoring crucial goals, Maniche was a key part of every team he played for.\n\nFrom Portugal to the Premier League, his career was one filled with success, with trophies stacking up at every turn. But on Friday, instead of gracing the pitch, he was orchestrating the fate of Europe’s elite clubs from the draw table.\n\n\n\nBEST FREE BETS AND BETTING SIGN UP OFFERS\n\nAs the draw began, the tension was palpable. Chelsea were paired against PSG, Liverpool were handed Galatasaray, Arsenal will take on Bayer Leverkusen, Manchester City take on Real Madrid and Tottenham face Atletico Madrid.\n\nNewcastle, the sixth English team, will face Spanish giants Barcelona.\n\nWith the draw now clear, the road to the final is shaping up to be a real rollercoaster ride.\n\nBut while fans were focusing on the draw itself, it was the identity of the man behind it that really got people talking.\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t just any ex-footballer pulling the strings, it was Maniche, the same player who once bossed midfield for top clubs and made a name for himself on the international stage."

            "content": "MANCHESTER UNITED are growing “concerned” about the future of Harry Maguire as he approaches the end of his contract.\n\nThe defender, 32, has a new lease of life under interim boss Michael Carrick, but there are worries that he could follow Casemiro out of the club this summer when their deals expire.\n\n\n\nHis return to the side in the heart of Carrick’s preferred back four has helped the side take five wins from six games since the boss’ arrival, with their only blemish being an away draw against West Ham.\n\n\n\nBut according to reports from the Mail, the club hierarchy are growing concerned about the prospect of his exit.\n\nHe is available to negotiate over a pre-contract agreement, and has already turned down approaches from the Saudi Pro League and AC Milan this year.\n\nIt is understood Maguire is keen on remaining at the club, but would likely have to take a pay cut in order to make a deal work.\n\nIt is clear that Carrick is aware of the positive impact the former Leicester City man has on the team, opening up on his future earlier this week.\n\n\n\nHe said: “Within the squad there is that balance, you want that younger potential and excitement, but you need the sweet spot in the middle with players at the peak, and experience is massive.\n\n“It’s hard to put a price on how valuable that can be. Harry has gained an awful lot of experience with this club. Casemiro leaving is another one and we have to understand what that means.”\n\nMaguire is only at the club after a 12-month extension to his contract was triggered last year.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL – BEST CASINO BONUSES FROM £10 DEPOSITS\n\n\n\nBut a week away from his 33rd birthday, it is unclear where the man himself stands on a potential renewal.\n\nOne boost to both him and the club’s prospects is his form.\n\nIf there were any lingering doubts about his ability to keep up at this level, they have been quelled after clean sheets against Everton, Spurs and even rivals Manchester City.\n\nWhen asked if Maguire might even be in the form of his life, Carrick said: “There is a case (for that), as your career goes when you’re a young player and everything is fresh, you’re fearless and there’s not many scars there.\n\n“You get to your peak years and you feel good and everything is there, but you’ve had a few ups and downs.\n\n\n\n“You get towards the later times and the experience should make you a better player, we’ve seen that with Harry’s performances of late.\n\n“That’s why experience is important, I felt it when I was playing, 31 or 32 were my best years of being in that sweet spot to do it physically still but use the experiences to know what is coming.”\n\nMaguire came very close to an exit after hitting a rough patch of form in the 2022/23 season.\n\nBut the star rejected a £30million move to West Ham, choosing to continue slugging it out for a starting spot at Old Trafford.\n\n\n\nAnd now he has finally come good, after struggling to find minutes in Ruben Amorim‘s 3421 formation last season.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nCarrick hinted that he has hopes for an extension with the England international, adding: “Harry’s an impressive character. He’s had a great career so far. Hopefully, there’s a lot more to come.\n\n“I think, even while he’s been here, in the journey and the experiences that he’s had, certainly since he’s been here and with England as well, I think he’s shown exactly what he is.”"

            "content": "MO SALAH is ‘increasingly likely’ to leave Liverpool this summer according to report as a host of teams circle to snap up the superstar attacker.\n\nSalah, 33, has under 18 months left on his bumper Anfield deal which was signed just under a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time it looked like Salah was going to leave for free off the back of his best season yet as the Reds also negotiated with Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nIn the end Salah and Van Dijk signed two-year contracts until 2027, pushing the can down the road but ensuring both key players remained.\n\nThe issue of whether to keep Salah beyond this summer, let alone the next one, continues.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Liverpool’s second top scorer of all-time is “increasingly likely” to depart at the end of the season.\n\n\n\nClubs from the MLS and Saudi Pro League are seen as potential options with Liverpool desperate not to lose their Egyptian King for nothing.\n\nSaudi sides have been vocal in the past of their admiration for Salah, offering more than £100million to get him in January previously.\n\nAll of this comes in the wake of his major falling out with manager Arne Slot over the winter.\n\nSalah insisted in December, after being benched for the third game in a row during Liverpool’s horror run, that the club had “thrown me under the bus” and that “someone doesn’t want me.”\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nHe added: “I think it’s very clear that someone wants me to get all the blame.\n\n“The club promised me in the summer for a lot of promises and nothing.”\n\nOn Slot, who was coming under massive scrutiny for his handling of Salah and the squad, he said: “I said that many times before, I had a good relationship with the manager.\n\n“And all of a sudden we don’t have any relationship. I don’t know why.”\n\nThese comments came just before AFCON, where Salah went away with his country and produced.\n\n\n\nMany felt that he had played his last game at Liverpool and a mid-season move was on the cards.\n\nSlot named him as a sub in the first game after his explosive mixed zone interview – a rarity which split opinion – but was forced to bring Salah on after just 20 minutes due to an injury.\n\nThe winger got a late assist and could easily have scored despite some still believing it was set to be his farewell.\n\nAs it happened, Slot and Salah patched things up, though, with the BBC saying he was seen as being as happy as ever when at AFCON.\n\n\n\nSalah returned to the team afterwards and has been a regular.\n\nAlthough the goals have dried up – Salah is yet to score in the Prem since November 1 – he has three assists in the last five.\n\nTwo weeks ago he scored and assisted in the FA Cup against Brighton as well.\n\nSlot has praised Salah’s work ethic and qualities since the drama and recently said: “He sets his own standards and those are so, so high that the moment he doesn’t score for a few games, people are immediately surprised.\n\n“That’s probably the biggest compliment he can get.”\n\n\n\nSlot had said earlier in February after the Brighton FA Cup win: “What I like the most is he is scoring goals [which you] almost expect.\n\n“But he also helps the team a lot defensively and that is something very positive.”\n\nWhat Liverpool do with him over the summer as they plot another rebuild following the turbulence of 2025 is far from clear.\n\nSalah’s exit will rely on possible buyers paying top dollar for his wages and agreeing a fee with Liverpool.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nHe is also settled in England and is loved by fans.\n\n\n\nEither way, this summer will be a defining one for Salah."

            "content": "DELE ALLI left Tottenham fans in tears after penning a heartfelt thank you to the club and supporters.\n\nThe 29-year-old left Spurs in 2022 after seven years at the club, the early days of which saw him become one of the most exciting midfielders in world football.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut more than four years on, he returned to the club for a special homecoming.\n\nHe appeared at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday, February 22 for the North London Derby against Arsenal.\n\nDele and Spurs pumped out content across his visit, going behind-the-scenes of the day.\n\nHe also gave an interview to the club in which he was thanked for his service as a player.\n\nBut the midfielder made a humble statement as he instead paid tribute to the love he received from supporters.\n\nHe said: “I think I have to owe you guys a bigger thank you.\n\n“The love and the support I felt from the fans during my whole time at Tottenham was surreal.\n\n“So I think I owe you guys a thank you rather than you owe me a thank you.”\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nThe kind nature of Alli has broken the hearts of Tottenham fans who have been reduced to tears on social media.\n\nOne posted: “I don’t need to cry this hard on a Friday.”\n\nA second wrote: “Yeah thanks Spurs , crying again.”\n\n\n\nAnother said: “miss you everyday”.\n\nDele’s style and popularity is in contrast to how fans now feel about the team, who are in a genuine relegation battle.\n\nThe former England man admitted to getting choked up at his continued reception: “I see some videos online [of them singing my name].\n\n“For me it’s felt like I have a very special connection with them and sometimes it makes me a little bit emotional.\n\n“Seeing the videos getting love and appreciation. It feels good.”\n\n\n\nHe added that a connection was easy to forge, saying: “Me being me, I like to have fun and I like to entertain. Off the pitch it kind of showed.\n\n“To dare is to do is what Tottenham is about and I showed a lot of that in my personality and that is the way I am as a person.\n\n“It was quite easy to relate.”\n\nDele won the PFA Young Player of the Year in back-to-back seasons in 2015/16 and 2016/17, and was named to the Premier League Team of the Year in 2015/16 and 2016/17 seasons.\n\nHowever, his form began to fade before he ultimately left the north London side for Everton in January 2022.\n\n\n\nStruggles with injury eventually saw him loaned to Besiktas and later released before he was picked up by Como as a free agent.\n\nHe only made one appearance in Italy in which he was sent off after just minutes for a challenge on Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIn a candid 2023 interview, the former England international revealed he had been sexually abused as a child and had been forced into dealing drugs at the age of eight.\n\nHe also spoke about his six-week spell in rehab after the end of his Besiktas loan because of addiction to sleeping pills and mental health issues."

            "content": "SunSport’s Kevin Dunne is back with his picks for a huge FA Cup weekend.\n\nCOURSE and distance winners, we all know Pep Guardiola and Man City get the trip.\n\nSix times in the last eight seasons, it’s been those sky blue colours fluttering away on the Premier League trophy come that sunny day in May.\n\n\n\nAnd as they round the turn with long-time leaders Arsenal right in their sights, the Etihad outfit are hitting their stride.\n\nFive wins in all competitions in February and only one defeat in the league since last November.\n\n\n\nThe Gunners, despite an impressive 4-1 win at Spurs last weekend, have given City room up the inside – having shipped out leads and frittered away four points with draws at both Wolves and Brentford this month.\n\nAs it stands, if City win their remaining 11 league games, including the blockbuster at home to Arsenal on April 18, Pep and his side will land a magnificent seven-timer.\n\nStill the market doesn’t believe they will. The Gunners are currently a best-priced 4-7 with Betway, while City can be had at 7-4 with Sporting Index.\n\nSo which horse would Coral’s John Hill rather be on? He said: “It was an important win over Newcastle last weekend, and a good sign for Pep that his side were able to gut it out.\n\n\n\n“Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi are proving to be excellent signings, and are giving them the lift they need.\n\nBET BALLS Man City to win both halves at Leeds tonight is 14-5 with BetGoodwin\n\nBrighton to beat Forest tomorrow, BTTS, is 11-4 with BetGoodwin\n\nMan United to win from behind against Palace tomorrow is 13-2 with BetGoodwin\n\nArsenal and Chelsea to draw 2-2 is 12-1 with BetGoodwin Get a 10% bonus on all winning accas – 18+ T&Cs apply\n\n“All told I’d be backing City; they’ve been here before. I just think the pressure of being chased could get to Arsenal and they’ll end up the bridesmaids again.”\n\nIf anyone knows anything about being bridesmaids, it’s City’s hosts tonight, Leeds.\n\nThey were First Division runners-up twice in the 1960s and three times in a row, just like this Arsenal side, in the early 70s.\n\n\n\nNow back in the elite after being relegated in 2023, they are doing an increasingly good job of staying there.\n\nSince narrowly losing 3-2 at City on November 29, the mighty Whites have been beaten only by Arsenal and Newcastle in the league.\n\nAnd having kicked off the season as 7-5 third-favourites to go down, that run has given them a six-point cushion on the drop zone and they are now out to 12-1 for relegation.\n\nThat run has included wins over Chelsea and a draw at Stamford Bridge, two draws with Liverpool, and an impressive point at third-placed Villa last weekend.\n\nTonight, then, will be no canter for Pep’s thoroughbreds, even though they are heavy odds-on to win at Elland Road.\n\n\n\nThe home side are a best-priced 22-5 with MGM, with the draw trading at 18-5 with Sporting Index.\n\nBut with the stakes as they are for the title-chasers, City can’t be opposed here. But with just two clean sheets in their last eight league games, nor can the likelihood of Leeds scoring.\n\nCity win and BTTS is a best-priced 21-10 with Ladbrokes Coral and bet365, while the visitors winning 2-1 at 8-1 with 365 has most appeal in the correct-score market.\n\nWhile prolific, Erling Haaland hasn’t scored twice in a Prem game since December so the 4-1 he does tonight with BetGoodwin looks a decent shout.\n\nYelland Road then.\n\n\n\nGoodwinners’ Enclosure\n\nWHAT could be more Spursy than to win the Europa League one year, then get relegated the next?\n\nAnd on the evidence of Sunday’s flimsy north London derby showing, here, at BetGoodwin Towers, we’re not sure that Tottenham’s players have the bottle for a relegation fight.\n\nThey are now into 17-4 to take their billion pound stadium into the Championship, with West Ham 4-6 and Forest 11-5 to join doomed Wolves and Burnley for the drop.\n\nAnd getting buried 4-1 at home by Arsenal was a huge blow to Spurs’ chances in our eyes, especially with Vitor Pereira starting to lay some positive roots at Forest.\n\nOne side we don’t see in the relegation conversation is Leeds. Their form under Daniel Farke since December has pushed the Whites six points clear of the bottom three.\n\n\n\nBut it’s not just the points that have impressed us, it’s the nature of their points that has.\n\nThey’ve picked up key wins and draws against top-class sides and Stach-ed up another one at Villa Park last weekend after Anton scored.\n\nTonight they host title-chasing Man City and both come into this game at Elland Road in great form.\n\nAnd with the reverse tie at the Etihad a close-run 3-2 home win affair, we see City to win and over 3.5 goals as a great bet at 11-8.\n\nLast weekend in the ring, Burnley’s last-gasp equaliser at Chelsea didn’t do our punters any favours, sinking an armada of accas, while Brighton’s win away at Brentford was also a great result for us.\n\n\n\nAs far as the title race goes, Arsenal remain rightful jollies in our eyes after their huge win against Spurs. They are 4-9, with City out at 6-4.\n\nBut Pep’s boys have a habit of going on huge winning runs towards the end of the season, so we see this going right down to the wire, especially with City and Arsenal facing off at the Etihad in April.\n\nAt least there’s a few more runners in the top-four race! And with Man United putting together a monumental run under Michael Carrick to storm up the league, we now have them joint-favourites with third-placed Villa to finish in the top four at 8-15.\n\nLiverpool are close behind at 8-11, with Chelsea now 2-1. But we fancy United to be best of the rest – and an Arsenal-City-United straight tricast can be backed at 100-30.\n\nAnd we’re sticking with the big guns for this week’s Nap Acca, going for Liverpool, United, Arsenal, Man City and Newcastle all to win for 10-1.\n\n\n\nChampions League\n\nNAPOLEON famously said: “I’d rather have a lucky general than a good one.”\n\nSo he’d have liked Mikel Arteta, who qualified again on both counts after yesterday’s Champions League draw.\n\nHaving already had Portsmouth, Wigan and Mansfield in the FA Cup, Arteta’s Arsenal will now face Bayer Leverkusen (sixth in the Bundesliga) in the last-16 in Europe.\n\nThat would be followed by the prospect of surprise packages Bodo Glimt or Sporting Lisbon in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe bookies swiftly cut the Emirates outfit into 11-4 favourites to win it, a best price with Ladbrokes, Coral and 888.\n\n\n\nMan City were not so lucky, pulling out Real Madrid in the last-16, with probably Bayern Munich to follow.\n\nChelsea will be 4-1 underdogs when they go to Paris Saint-Germain for their first leg, while Newcastle are odds-against 15-8 for their first leg at home to Barcelona.\n\nArne Slot’s Liverpool are heavy favourites to dispense with Turks Galatasaray, with Spurs massive 13-2 outsiders for their first leg at Atletico Madrid.\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE OUTRIGHTS (best prices): 11-4 Arsenal; 11-2 Bayern Munich; 13-2 Barcelona; 8-1 Man City; 10-1 PSG; 11-1 Liverpool; 12-1 Real Madrid; 25-1 Chelsea; 33-1 Newcastle; 40-1 Tottenham; 125-1 Bodo Glimt.\n\nDark Horse\n\n219-1: Man City are second in the Premier League, in the Carabao Cup final against Arsenal, and still in the Champions League and FA Cup. They are a best priced 219-1 with bet365 to win an unprecedented Quad.\n\n\n\nTV Previews\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest\n\nLAST TIME Brighton won consecutive league games was against Brentford and tomorrow’s visitors Forest.\n\nWell, they ended a run of one win in 13 Prem games at Brentford last weekend.\n\nRelegation-fighting Forest were a shade unlucky to lose 1-0 at home to Liverpool on Sunday but have now failed to score in 13 of their 27 Prem outings.\n\nNarrow home win and Diego Gomez to score anytime at 4-1 with BetVictor.\n\n\n\nFORECAST: 2-1\n\nMan United v Crystal Palace\n\nOLD TRAFFORD has been Gold Trafford for Palace, who’ve won four of six there, including the last two.\n\nThe Eagles have also chalked up six road wins this term and scored in six of their last seven aways.\n\nSo while charging United, six wins from seven under interim boss Michael Carrick, should oblige, it could be tight.\n\n\n\nConsistent Ismaila Sarr is the 4-1 anytime scorer pick with Sky Bet.\n\nFORECAST: 2-1\n\nArsenal v Chelsea\n\nIT’S five years since Chelsea beat Arsenal – a long time for the reigning world club champions.\n\nIn three meetings this term, the Gunners won two by a single goal, with the other drawn.\n\n\n\nTomorrow, with City breathing down their necks, leaders Arsenal will have to force the pace.\n\nAn opening for the Blues, who can take at least a point.

Nuno’s side rank seventh for expected goals conceded and have allowed more than one goal just once in their last eight matches.\n\nLiverpool, meanwhile, aren’t exactly firing on all cylinders in attack, having managed just three goals across their last three Premier League games, with low-scoring encounters against Leeds and Burnley at Anfield still fresh in the memory this year.\n\nUnder 2.5 goals at 9/5 with Betfair – CLAIM HERE\n\nFirst goalscorer and correct score predictions Liverpool vs West Ham First goalscorer: Mohamed Salah at 7/2 with Midnite – CLAIM HERE Correct score: 1-0 at 9/1 with Betfred – CLAIM HERE\n\nMo time\n\nI’m also tipping Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah to get back on the scoresheet against one of his favourite opponents, available at 10/11 to score anytime with Betfair.\n\n\n\nSalah, 33, has struck twice in six matches in all competitions, but the metrics suggest he should have netted more.

The Hammers have revealed a £104.2million loss for the last financial year.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFigures announced by West Ham show a dramatic change from a profit of £57.2m in the previous financial year.

Should this not be preferred or sufficient, additional funding from the shareholders would be required.\n\n\"In the event the severe but plausible scenario occurs, the Group is also forecasting a liquidity shortfall in summer 2026 to a greater severity.

Champions League-chasing Chelsea will take on Premier League title contenders Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Dutch legend revealed to Gambling Insider that he rejected the chance to sign for the Gunners while playing for HFC Haarlem, where he featured between 1979 and 1982.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGullit, 63, said that former Arsenal stalwart Liam Brady was among the club's scouting staff who tried to convince him to sign with the club.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“When I was at HFC Haarlem at the age of 17, I heard that Arsenal wanted to sign me,” he said. \"Liam Brady was a scout at the club at the time, and I was made aware of their interest in bringing me to Highbury.

The talented playmaker headed to west London with a hatful of accolades. During his time in Italy, Gullit won three Serie A titles and two European Cups, amongst other silverware.\n\nBefore to his trophy haul in Italy, Gullit claimed three Dutch league titles during his spells at Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven. He also won the European Championships with the Netherlands in 1988.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC in 2020, Gullit said that Stamford Bridge was a slice of nirvana for him, insisting that he was bewitched by London's charm.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Glenn Hoddle welcomes Ruud Gullit to Chelsea in June 1995.

I fell in love with London straight away because I found a kind of freedom that is priceless. It was my happy place.\"\n\nExplaining how English football was a culture shock for him, Gullit elaborated on his decision to join Chelsea because Glenn Hoddle was the manager at the time. He revealed that Stamford Bridge also shocked him due to its primitive state in its old guise.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I was 32, nearly 33, I had been at the top for a long time and had won a lot too,\" Gullit said. \"Some people probably thought my legs had gone and I was coming here for the ride - to take the money and just get ready to retire. They were wrong.\n\n\"Nobody I spoke to that summer understood why I chose Chelsea. I must say I didn't know much about the club or even that part of town when I went there - it was just because Glenn Hoddle was manager, that's what persuaded me to go.\n\n\"When I came for the first time to see Stamford Bridge, I was like 'what the hell kind of stadium is this?' I was used to playing in the best stadiums in the world, but here there were only two stands. The place wasn't just a building site; it was a total wreck. You had to walk around on planks of wood.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Chelsea new signing Gianfranco Zola meets the press with manager Ruud Gullit (Image: Ben Radford/Allsport)\n\n\"But I loved it. It was almost like I was going back to when I had just started playing, when I was nine years old. It was fantastic.\"\n\nChoosing Chelsea years after he snubbed Arsenal, Gullit was careful to add that the Blues were still a project that had to be sold to him.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe explained: \"Glenn [Hoddle] had to sell Chelsea and their ambition to me - he said they were at the start of a journey too - but what was most important was that it was Glenn. In the eyes of the Dutch, he was the best English footballer ever.\"\n\nDiscussing the differences between Italian and English football in the 1990s, he said: \"There was another way English football was different from Italy, and in a good way - the crowd, and the attitude in the stands.\n\n\"I felt a different bond with them, and not just the Chelsea supporters. In the Premier League, the fans appreciated what you were doing more - if you did something special on the pitch that they loved, people went crazy. I hit it off with the Chelsea fans straight away.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Their supporters were fantastic, always, even when I left, and they still are now. I loved it. I loved the way they were with me and I will always treasure that.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Hoddle left Chelsea to take the reins as England boss. Gullit was appointed as a player-manager, subsequently becoming the first Dutch manager in the Premier League.\n\nView 4 Images Ruud Gullit in action for Chelsea (Image: Gary M. Prior/ALLSPORT)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe led the club to the FA Cup, their first trophy in 26 years. He also finished a credible sixth with the Blues but was sacked in his second season, despite being second in the league at the time, reportedly due to a disagreement with the board.\n\n\"I signed Gianfranco Zola, Gianluca Vialli, Roberto di Matteo and Frank Leboeuf. We won the FA Cup in 1997 and, in February 1998 we were second in the Premier League, in the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup,\" Gullit said of his time as manager.\n\n\"Being sacked was a horrible experience, and there was no reason to do what they did. They made out it was over my contract demands but that was rubbish because there had not been any negotiations.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR CHELSEA FB PAGE! Latest Blues news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nUltimately, Gullit has a positive outlook on his time with Chelsea and in England. So much was his affection for these shores that he took up a job with Newcastle United in 1998 but only lasted just over a season at St James' Park.\n\n\"I felt that living in England enriched my experiences in life, and enhanced my ideas about football. I still feel the same way,\" Gullit said.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"I am very proud I was there at the start for Chelsea, and to see what the Premier League has become too.

He scored a hat-trick in a 7-0 triumph away at Liverpool before the turn of the year, the second time he left with the match ball after a league game.\n\nView 2 Images Michael Carrick has backed United's youngsters, handing Tyler Fletcher a Premier League debut (Image: Ash Donelon, Manchester United via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUnited's senior squad have remained undefeated since that cup fixture against Brighton in January, when their ex-player Danny Welbeck netted for Brighton in a 2-1 Seagulls victory. Carrick has taken charge of six league games since, winning five and drawing one.\n\nAnother of United's academy talents was given game time against Brighton in the cup, with Shea Lacey introduced for the final half-hour. However, the 18-year-old's day concluded prematurely when he received a second yellow card.\n\n\"He's disappointed because he cares and he understands and he knows he will learn from it,\" interim manager Fletcher commented post-match. \"There is no doubt about his talent and it was a steep learning curve today but we believe in Shea. He's one of our most exciting young prospects and I'm sure at Old Trafford he will have a chance to make amends for that in the future.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!

(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMichael Carrick's decision to install experienced coaches is paying dividends as the interim Manchester United head coach enjoys the fruits of Ruben Amorim's mistakes. According to reports, the introduction of Steve Holland, formerly an assistant to Sir Gareth Southgate, Jonathan Woodgate, Travis Binnion and Craig Mawson, has played a role in righting the wrongs of the Portuguese's tenure.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Red Devils have won five of their last six matches, with Carrick guiding United into the driving seat for Champions League qualification. Since the former United midfielder took charge of his second spell at the club, he has made a number of key changes around Carrington and Old Trafford which has revitalised the squad as they reap the rewards with results.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOne of the first changes saw Carrick ditch Amorim's controversial, and much-debated, 3-4-2-1 formation in favour of a 4-2-3-1, while restoring Kobbie Mainoo back into the fold.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nKieran Trippier spotted on night out with OnlyFans model 14 years younger after divorce READ MORE :\n\nThe Telegraph has reported on a number of changes rung by Carrick that have resonated with club sources. It has been said that the former Middlesbrough manager's demeanour has had a calming and reassuring presence around the United facilities.\n\nAnother aspect was the removal of young staff and the implementation of Holland, Woodgate, Evans, Binnion and Evans. It was said that Amorim's backroom staff had to wait to speak up and rarely challenged or disagreed with the Portuguese.\n\nAs well as this, it has been said that training sessions have become shorter with one ending quickly before the win over Arsenal because Carrick wanted to maintain to quality for the trip to the Emirates Stadium.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!

I enjoyed it, but this one was too good to turn down, unfortunately.\n\n\"City was a huge game - playing at home, and the atmosphere I have to say was pretty special on the day. Even building up to the game, you could feel it in and around the stadium before kick-off.\n\n\"It's impossible to describe how much that helps, but to feel that between everyone - it's a real special feeling for me to be in the position to be able to share that with so many people.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"That's probably the most satisfying thing so far - getting that connection and feeling that emotion from everyone in such a positive way.\n\n**Ensure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. **Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings"

Then-boss Louis van Gaal had a decision to make with little time to think - but for the Dutch manager it wasn't a difficult one.\n\nImage: Frans Hoek alongside Rashford after his debut against Midtjylland\n\n\"We came back into the locker room, and the assistants were coming up with all kinds of solutions, except for Marcus,\" Frans Hoek, a key part of Van Gaal's coaching staff at the time, reveals to Sky Sports.\n\n\"They were saying, 'Okay, if we do this, then this player can be there and blah blah blah.' The normal discussions that you have when something happens like that.\n\n\"And then, when everybody had said what they had to say, Louis said, 'We don't change anything. Marcus goes in. Marcus deserves it. Marcus is doing a good job. He is improving. He is young and I believe in that.' That was the moment.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Louis van Gaal says Marcus Rashford produced 'a great performance' after scoring twice on his Manchester United debut against FC Midtjylland\n\nVan Gaal was resting his hopes on someone whose only experience in the first team up to that point was a bench appearance at Watford a few months prior.\n\n\"All credit to Louis because he was never afraid to put young players in,\" Hoek adds.\n\n\"He did the same at Ajax, at Barcelona, at Bayern Munich and with the national team. For him, if they are good enough, then they are old enough. It is simple.\n\n\"And he definitely was not afraid to replace people who had certain reputations if he felt it was the best for the team.\n\n\"A coach like Louis does not get influenced. He just has his eyes and his way of thinking. He put in Andres Iniesta, he put in Xavi. He put in so many of them.\n\n\"If you are objective as a coach and not influenced by everything that happens around football, I think you make these kinds of decisions faster.\"\n\n'In the academy, Rashford could do anything he wanted with a football'\n\nFrom the outside, it was a surprise. 'Who on earth is this kid?' Those in the stands uttered amid the late change. But for those closer to Rashford, through his time in the academy, could tell he had been marked early on to impact the first team.\n\nImage: James Weir made his Manchester United debut against Arsenal after Rashford's Premier League debut double\n\n\"He was the guy!\" James Weir, who played with Rashford in the United Academy.\n\n\"He was two years younger and I knew his name, whereas I couldn't name any other person in his age group.\n\n\"I think they can tell technically, and they know when they're going to fill out. He had two older brothers who were quite big as well and tall. So, they probably expected him to grow and fill into his body.\n\n\"But technically, he was pretty superior. The first time I played with him was probably in one of the reserve games, like under-21s or 23s and he was, jumping ahead of people a couple of years above him, just because he was that good.\n\n\"He was always. I remember, even in digs, we'd be playing football with a balloon, and he'd be doing, around the worlds. It's actually harder to do it with a balloon than it is with a normal football.\n\n\"He could do anything he wanted with a football, even doing keepy-ups with a tennis ball. Most people are lucky to do four or five; he's consistently doing it.\"\n\nRecollections of Rashford's first training session with the first team have lived with former team-mate and current Melbourne Victory midfielder, Juan Mata for the past decade.\n\nImage: Rashford in training alongside Juan Mata\n\n\"I have a vivid memory of that day, he was playing on the right wing,\" Mata says.\n\n\"He was quite thin and quick. He was quite shy off the pitch but he was brave on the pitch, and that was nice to see. You could see he was already taking people one against one, going behind. Very quick, very speedy.\n\n\"At the end of the session, I was talking with Ander Herrera and he was telling me, 'did you see this kid? I think he's going to be a great player'.\n\n\"Ander really saw it since the beginning and I remember he told me that day, he's going to bring us a lot and I said, 'Well, wait, it's too early, he only trained with us once'... Ander was not wrong.\"\n\nImage: Man Utd's starting lineup on Rashford's debut\n\nMata set up Rashford's first-ever professional goal, opening the floodgates.\n\n\"You could see how happy he was, his family in the stands, it meant a lot for him,\" Mata recalls.\n\n\"So it was the start of something really nice for him and a very nice start to a good week. I still remember celebrating with him and seeing how this kid from Manchester was fulfilling his dream and it was very nice to see how happy he was and how much he deserved it.\"\n\nThe Arsenal game that followed United's 5-1 win over Midtjylland and it was a special day for the United Academy.\n\nAlongside Rashford's Premier League debut, Timothy Fosu-Mensah earned his first stripes and so did Weir as United beat the Gunners 3-2 at Old Trafford.\n\nWeir recalls LVG dive - 'I thought Wenger had hit him!' Man Utd's win over Arsenal at Old Trafford is also remembered for a bizarre moment from Louis van Gaal on the touchline. The Dutch coach mimicked what he thought was a dive from Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez after a challenge from Herrera. Weir watched on while warming up: \"I just saw all the fans do something, like all this commotion, and then I saw LVG on the floor, so I honestly thought Wenger had hit him. I thought Wenger had dropped him.\"\n\nImage: Louis van Gaal mimics Alexis Sanchez from the touchline\n\nReplacing Herrera in injury time meant that Weir watched from the dugout as Rashford continued to do the remarkable, playing a part in all three goals.\n\n\"I remember when he banged that first goal in, like, you're not surprised, because he has that, you've seen it in training, you've seen it in the academy, you've seen it in the reserves, he's got the quality. I've seen it in the back garden!\n\n\"I remember him being buzzing and obviously, everyone around the club was buzzing for him, because that's what it's about, getting youth team players into the first team.\"\n\n'He was a kid and a man who gave everything to Man Utd' - Mata\n\nRashford didn't slow down from then on. He went on to play an instrumental role as United won the FA Cup that season.\n\nEngland and Roy Hodgson couldn't ignore the prodigy either, as his first call-up and debut goal came three months later. Rashford then earned a spot in the Three Lions squad for the 2016 Euros, where he would make two appearances.\n\nImage: Rashford made his England debut in May 2016\n\nNow, after a difficult spell, before back-to-back loans at Aston Villa and now at Barcelona, Rashford's time at Old Trafford looks to be moving towards a permanent end, with a divorce seemingly the best option for both parties. But there's a consensus that he wrote a beautiful story at United.\n\n\"It's not easy to handle with all the expectations and the pressure at the club like Man Utd but I think people will realise that he was a kid and he was a man who gave everything for the club he supported since he was a kid,\" Mata says.\n\n\"You can see photos of him when he was almost a baby with a Man Utd shirt on. So it meant a lot for him to play for Man Utd. You could see that. I think he gave great moments and great memories for many fans. Of course, there were also some challenging times but I think they made him more mature and a stronger man.\n\n\"Nobody has an easy career. It doesn't matter how successful you have been. There are always challenges and he had that at the club. But he's now in a new chapter. He went to Barcelona, which is one of the best teams in the world and he's performing there. He's showing his level. I'm very happy for him that he's able to try and prove his level in different countries.\"\n\nImage: Rashford smiles during a Barcelona training session at the Nou Camp\n\nHoek, who also has a storied coaching history with Barcelona, shares Mata's sentiment. Rashford has scored 10 goals and assisted 13 in 34 games at Barcelona.\n\n\"Rashford was an easy guy to work with,\" Hoek says.\n\n\"Hardworking and not complaining. Of course, when they start their career, it is different but I have followed his career from United to Barcelona and he is doing some great things there.\n\n\"I think that he has lived up to the expectations that were there at Barcelona. I think it is a fantastic experience for him in that league, away from United, away from the Premier League. I think it has only been very positive for him.\"\n\nImage: Rashford has scored 10 goals and assisted 13 in 34 games at Barcelona\n\nWeir, though, still has hopes that the Rashford story at United has not yet seen its conclusion.\n\n\"I'd love him to win LaLiga this year, the Champions League,\" Weir says\n\n\"Go and do that, and then he's done it. But I'd love him to come back to United.\n\n\"I think he'd look back in when he's 40 and think, I left the chapter of my career there. He is some player. Hopefully, he gets to the World Cup and does well there. Then if United do get Champions League, it's made for him.\n\n\"I think it depends a lot on the manager who comes in at United, but obviously, the club is growing now, for sure, and he's a fantastic player, so he'd definitely add something to that Man United squad.\"\n\nThe beginning was picture-book, a true video-game-like storyline to becoming a superstar. The future of Rashford's career may be uncertain but there will be no forgetting the fresh-faced 18-year-old from Wythenshawe who lived and became the dream."

            "content": "The FIA has confirmed a mid-season rule change will be made following Formula 1's engine dispute, with a new test being introduced from June.\n\nThe build-up to the new 2026 season, which begins in Melbourne next weekend, has led to potential loopholes being exploited, with Mercedes in the spotlight after rival teams claimed they have found a way around engine compression ratio limits.\n\nAs part of F1's biggest regulation changes ever, the compression ratio limit has been lowered from 18.0 under the previous ruleset to 16.0, but measurements are currently only taken when the engine is not running at full temperature, with Mercedes being believed by teams to be exploiting this which could give them a competitive advantage.\n\nHowever, the FIA has announced a new test will take place from June 1 when the engine ambient temperature is at 130 degrees.\n\nSeven races are scheduled before the new test is introduced, with 17 rounds on the calendar from June onwards.\n\nThe FIA said \"some aspects of the amendments were concurrently approved unanimously by the Formula 1 power unit manufacturers\". F1's engine manufacturers are Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull-Ford, Audi and Honda.\n\n\"The modifications to the technical regulations follow the pre-season tests in Barcelona and Bahrain and extensive feedback received from drivers and teams,\" said the FIA.\n\n\"A significant effort has been invested in finding a solution to the topic of the compression ratio. This parameter, which was one of the key fundamental targets of these regulations in order to attract newcomers to the sport, is limited in the regulations to 16:1, measured in cold conditions.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports F1's David Croft takes a closer look at how F1 in 2026 will evolve as the sport begins a new era of recharge, featuring more electric power, new teams, and engine suppliers\n\n\"The FIA has worked to find a compromise solution which determines that the compression ratio will be controlled in both hot and cold conditions from June 1 2026, and subsequently only in the operating conditions (130deg C) from 2027 onwards.\n\n\"The regulations introduced for 2026 represent one of the biggest changes in recent memory. All parties acknowledge that with the introduction of such significant regulatory changes, there are collective learnings to be taken from pre-season testing and the initial rounds of the 2026 championship.\n\n\"Further evaluation and technical checks on energy management matters are ongoing.\"\n\nF1's governing body confirmed that from the new test \"any component, assembly, mechanism, or integrate arrangement of components that is designed or functions to in ratio in operating conditions beyond 16.0 is prohibited\".\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Hear from George Russell, Oscar Piastri and many more following the third and final day of the second testing in Bahrain\n\nWill this impact the pecking order?\n\nMercedes team principal Toto Wolff stated before F1's two pre-season tests in Bahrain that a change to the power-unit regulations could be \"quite damaging for the performance\".\n\nBut, during the final Bahrain test, Wolff softened his stance and said Mercedes would be \"pretty comfortable\" if a team protested their engine at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix - a scenario that now seems highly unlikely given a resolution appears to have been found.\n\nHe added: \"We said it all along that this looks like a storm in a teacup, the whole thing, and numbers were coming up that were… if these numbers would have been true, I absolutely understand why somebody would fight it, but eventually, it's not worth the fight.\n\n\"It doesn't change anything for us, whether we stay like this or whether we change to the new regulations, and that's been a process.\n\n\"But we also want to be good citizens in the sport because it doesn't make a big difference we then changed opinion.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff spoke out against Formula 1 bosses moving to close a loophole in the new engine rules\n\nIn January, when the engine saga was first reported, Red Bull engine chief Ben Hodgkinson said it was \"a lot of noise about nothing\" and had sided with Mercedes against the other three engine manufacturers - Ferrari, Audi and Honda.\n\nHowever, Aston Martin team principal Adrian Newey told Sky Sports News in February that \"everybody is aligned bar one manufacturer\". Newey did not name Mercedes, but the stance Wolff has taken suggests Red Bull had changed their stance.\n\nRed Bull team principal Laurent Mekies said: \"Sometimes it was felt that we were not so sure where Red Bull was standing. At least that's what I was reading, listening to you guys.\n\n\"The simple truth is that we don't really mind if the regs goes left or if the regs goes right.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Jenson Button unpacks life in Formula 1 by answering the 11 questions you have always wanted to ask an F1 world champion\n\nFIA single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis said \"I don't think this topic ever needed to get to the level of attention\" that it has over the off-season.\n\nHe said: \"I don't think that we are anywhere near the levels of performance that was stated, and certainly there was no cheat or anything like that, or no allegation of anybody being illegal.\n\n\"It is just a matter whether that was an intent of the regulation, and, as new regulations currently enforce, there will be this, but there will be other little topics that we will need to resolve going forward, and the approach will try to be even-handed.\n\n\"Each time that we follow something, I'm sure there will be people that are unhappy that we're not acting soon enough, and there will be people who are unhappy that we are not letting things by, and part of our job is to try to keep that on a on a sort of balanced way.\"\n\nBernie Collins on new engine test Sky Sports F1's Bernie Collins during Bahrain pre-season testing\n\n\n\n“It’s not the first time we have had this sort of thing in F1.\n\n\n\n“The suggestion is Mercedes have a different compression ratio in the engine, which compresses the gas more at a higher temperature, which gives them more power out of the engine.\n\n\n\n“We had this last year with front and rear wings where midway through the season we brought in an extra test to try and slow the leaders, at that stage McLaren, but they passed all the tests and nothing changes in the pecking order.\n\n\n\n“We don’t know the details of the test exactly, how thorough it will be, and whether it will make a change to the pecking order because we don’t even know what it is.\n\n\n\n“It’s a move to quieten the rumours that Mercedes have got an advantage over others in this area. Any change to regulations, particularly engine regulations, are a hard thing to change quickly because these engines are changed over years and years, so hopefully Mercedes, or other teams, don’t have any changes to make to comply with this regulation.”\n\nQualifying rule tweak announced and no mandatory Monaco pit stops\n\nAlso on Saturday, the FIA revealed Q3 will increase from 12 minutes to 13 minutes from this season.\n\nQualifying will still be scheduled for one hour as to compensate the minor change, the interval between Q2 and Q3 will be reduced from eight to seven minutes.\n\nNewcomers Cadillac join the F1 grid this year, so there will be 11 teams in the field, and it means the bottom six cars in Q1 and Q2 will be eliminated, rather than five.\n\nLast year's mandatory two pit stops at the Monaco Grand Prix has been shelved, so the race will have the same regulations as the other grand prix when it takes place at the later-than-usual date of June 7.\n\nThursday March 5\n\n3am: Drivers' Press Conference\n\n6am: Paddock Uncut\n\n9.45pm: F3 Practice\n\n10.55pm: F2 Practice\n\nFriday March 6\n\n1am: Australian GP Practice One (session starts at 1.30am)*\n\n2.55am: F3 Qualifying*\n\n3.30am: Team Bosses Press Conference\n\n3.50am: F2 Qualifying*\n\n4.35am: Australian GP Practice Two (session starts at 5am)*\n\n6.15am: The F1 Show*\n\nSaturday March 7\n\n0.10am: F3 Sprint*\n\n1.10am: Australian GP Practice Three (session starts at 1.30am)*\n\n3.05am: F2 Sprint*\n\n4.10am: Australian GP Qualifying build-up*\n\n5am: AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX QUALIFYING*\n\n7am: Ted's Qualifying Notebook*\n\n9.45pm: F3 Feature Race*\n\nSunday March 8\n\n12.20am: F2 Feature Race*\n\n2.30am: Australian GP build-up: Grand Prix Sunday*\n\n4am: THE AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX*\n\n6am: Australian GP reaction: Chequered Flag*\n\n7am: Ted's Notebook*\n\n7.55am: Australian GP race replay*\n\n10am: Australian GP highlights (also on Sky Showcase)*\n\n*Also on Sky Sports Main Event\n\nWatch every race of the 2026 Formula 1 season live on Sky Sports, starting with the Australian Grand Prix from March 6-8.

It is not the best period from a results perspective. We are learning a lot, and it is often in these tough phases that you are learning more.” Speaking about the racist abuse to which winger Romaine Mundle was subjected on social media following Sunderland’s defeat against Fulham, Le Bris said the club “stand with” their player, adding: “There is no room for racism or abuse in football. That is clear for us. We stand for respect and inclusion.

In an interview with Le Telgramme this week, the comparatively elderly 19-year-old said he was looking forward to being reunited with the coach who gave him his first senior start. “I never would have imagined this, it’s wonderful,” he said. “We’re not on the same side this time.

Many of the fans who are being affected are unhappy with the situation, presumably on the grounds that those being forced to make way for the Prawn Sandwich Brigade already have the best seats in the house. The subject of their displeasure was raised at Andoni Iraola’s press conference yesterday. “I’ve been asking also about these things,” he said. “About how we’re going to save the situation, what’s going to be built, what’s it going to be in two years, how it’s going to be provisionally and I think that it’s a moment where the club has to make important decisions. It’s important to get it right first time. The club has to hear what the supporters want and we have to, all together, get it right because we need to create the best atmosphere we can in our stadium.” With his contract due to expire at the end of this season, there’s a very good chance the in-demand Iraola will not be around to enjoy the Vitality Stadium glow-up but it’s nice to see him taking unpopular decisions made by the club hierarchy seriously.

Marcus Tavernier and David Brooks come into the side, with Amine Adli and Evanilson dropping to the bench. There are four changes to the Sunderland side that started against Fulham last weekend, with three of them enforced. Mackems everywhere will be delighted to see club captain Granit Xhaka come back into the side to make his first start in six weeks, while Lutsharel Geertruida, Eliezer Mayenda and Chemsdine Talbi also come in.

Ben Gannon-Doak is also hoping to be back at around the same time. Justin Kluivert and Julio Soler are also unavailable. Following his captain’s return from injury as a substitute against Fulham last weekend, Regis Le Bris said Granit Xhaka “might” start this afternoon. Romaine Mundle and Jocelin Ta Bi will be sidelined for “a few weeks or months” on the back of injuries they sustained against Fulham, while Nordi Mukiele and Brian Brobbey will be assessed. This game has come too soon for Dennis Cirkin, who is expected to be back in 10 days, while Bertrand Traore is back in full training.

            "content": "There’s a good advert right now on the rolling TV sports news channels. It starts with a rush of beeps and plinks and flashing symbols, generating instantly the flat, glazed, hungry quality of the online casino. A well-groomed middle-aged woman is shown sitting in an armchair in a suburban living room. It’s a jarring tonal shift, but we’re still in that same space, betting graphics dancing around her head.\n\nThe middle-aged woman turns to the camera and says: “The games are all different … It never gets boring,” eyes gleaming strangely, hands gripping the struts of her chair. Here is a person who is not just pleased, but uncontrollably energised by the prospect of WowBet.com’s 10bn mildly divergent AI-generated gambling patterns. At this point the words “Sandra Frottwangle, funeral director” appear on the screen.\n\nBy now it’s just an overload of feelings. The first thought is about transgression. Sandra Frottwangle’s job is to curate death. She spends her days managing the nobility of human flesh. She stands at the far edge of existence creating ritual and comfort, a timeless figure, the eternal footman, the director of last things. But she also gets bored easily and prefers stuff with flashing lights.\n\nIs this OK? Would you want Sandra Frottwangle to direct your funeral? Death is repetitive. Mortality is tedious. What if she decides this is all really dull and needs more beeping noises, less weeping and organ music? The ferryman is at the door. He’s unsheathing his scythe. He’s also got 400 free online spins at GambleDick.com.\n\nThe second thought is a rush of tenderness. Yes, Sandra Frottwangle’s life is spent in that liminal space. She stares into the void. She sees the weakness of the flesh, fish-grey monkey-brown. But even here she is still hungry for life, still craving that wild human energy. Eyes gleaming like opals, casino chips circling her head, she looks like one of those renaissance friezes expressing the glory and brevity of human life, the globe, the skull, the bowl of rotting fruit.\n\nOnly now we’re strapped into a velour armchair, drooling down our necks, being force-fed endless brain-shredding content and just wanting to feel something. I … love her. I love Sandra Frottwangle (funeral director). And she’s right. All the games are the same. But we still want the games.\n\nEither all of that stuff, or the people who make daytime TV adverts are bored twentysomething creatives who just thought it would be funny to put the words “funeral director” over shots of an actor pretending to be really into gambling websites. Probably it’s one or the other.\n\nAnd yes, this is supposed to be about the Scottish Premiership title race, which enters its spring ignition phase this weekend, and which is now arguably the most interesting title race in Europe.\n\nEither way Sunday’s Old Firm derby at Ibrox is a genuinely rare thing. For once this is not a title decider. It could be a title eliminator. It could be a step towards neither of Celtic or Rangers winning the league for the first time in 41 years. A draw in Glasgow could leave Hearts six points clear at the top. But by now it is a startling transformation whatever the outcome.\n\nHearts finished 40 points behind Celtic last year. The great clanking hand of Tony Bloom and his big data hive-brain robots has been on site for only eight months. The word “disruption” is usually shorthand for tech bro types in $4,000 Japanese trainers working out new ways to fire people. This is actual, good disruption. A three-way title race isn’t just deeply un-Scotland, it’s deeply un-anywhere these days.\n\nIn the major European leagues only Greece, Denmark and Poland have something this close. The trend is towards stratification, dead air after Christmas, a single basking giant or a two-way chase energetically spun by the broadcasters. Money has made this happen. The Premier League in particular has harvested talent, turning previously robust leagues into clearing houses, exit lounges to the life-altering four-year deal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Hearts have sustained a title challenge and it has provided a welcome alternative to the traditional dominance of Celtic and Rangers. Photograph: Steve Welsh/PA\n\nThis is perhaps partly the case in Scotland. But there is also a sense of useful incompetence in play, accidental competitiveness. The Glasgow clubs have spent decades trying to sustain a place in the roided-up Euro elite, taking it in turns to fall over their feet. Now we have this, a perfect storm of super-smart newcomer and a pair of sleepwalking giants.\n\nThere are other places for proper chapter and verse on whether Hearts can sustain this. The key aspect at this stage is that this title race has taken on a sense of outside life. My own kids follow every Hearts game with a rare sense of urgency, despite being fully TikTok-brained, zombified by reel culture.\n\nIt is, of course, only one season. It could all fall away quite rapidly. But there is also a lesson here, perhaps even a control experiment. Because big football is often boring now. The direction of travel is fewer meaningful matches, a cartel of mega-clubs resting on the ropes, a Champions League group stage that feels like an autumn exhibition tour.\n\nThe idea is out there that younger people will be happy with this, will feast instead on clips, screengrabs, parasocial celebrity worship; that young people are essentially industrialised idiots who have for the first time in all human existence lost the craving for actual narrative.\n\nThe reality is this culture creates a yearning for something else. Marketing people will assume hate clicks, or boredom clicks, or any kind of clicks represent actual value and desire. But young people also like real things.\n\nFinding interest in a competitive football league is a bit like getting into vinyl, or books made from paper, or the revelation, usually via an American man on YouTube who looks as if he keeps a collection of children’s dolls in a shed, that food can actually be made from ingredients.\n\nPerhaps Scottish football has fallen into a less globalist version of how to thrive. Tend to the soil. Build it and they will come. The league has plenty that can be weaponised: deep history, heritage value, the same authenticity that made it so moreish back in the days when Old Firm games were basically catharsis, insanity, people at the edge of their own emotions colliding for 90 minutes.\n\nWhy do sporting leagues roll over so willingly? Why do they turn themselves inside out, shred the basis of their own value – English cricket: we see you – in order to chase those precarious streams of macro-money? What if you just stopped trying to expand outward in every direction? What if the guiding principle is: what will make the thing we have right here in front of us better? Why not go hyper-local?\n\nThere is an argument that Hearts winning would be better for Rangers and Celtic. It energises the league, supercharges the brand, speaks to the desire for sporting tension among those bored by the drift of big football.\n\nWe have replaced a great deal that was valuable with generalised digital noise. In a sense we are all strapped into our armchairs now, craving a place where the games are different, anything with heart and life to distract us from the grey, out there staring into the void with Sandra Frottwangle eyes."

            "content": "Arsenal had to expect the jibes from Tottenham and they were not disappointed. Just before kick-off in last Sunday’s north London derby, the Spurs support in the South Stand of their stadium spelled out a giant message in mosaic form. “North Ldn since 1882,” it read.\n\nA clear dig, then, at Arsenal’s south of the river history from the Woolwich days and, as mentioned, very much a part of a rivalry where goading and baiting go hand in hand with the loathing. Arsenal had been similarly provocative before the derby against Spurs at the Emirates Stadium last November, lighting the pre-match scene with a tifo featuring images of various club greats. The most prominent at the top of it? Sol Campbell, of course.\n\nWhat was more surprising – and certainly led to raised eyebrows at Arsenal – was Wolves’ now infamous TikTok post on the Thursday before last. The 80-second clip, uploaded after the 2-2 draw between the clubs the previous night, was a savage take on Arsenal’s “game management”. Or, to put it another way, and as Wolves surely intended, their dark arts and shithousery.\n\nThe social media team at Wolves showed how Gabriel Martinelli taunted the home crowd by flashing up the scoreline on his fingers as Arsenal led 2-1. They highlighted the delay in Arsenal taking a corner as they continued to lead. They mocked Gabriel Magalhães for going down after an apparent head clash before he got back up and carried on.\n\nThere was indignation from the in-house commentators when Leandro Trossard also went to ground after an aerial clash in the 90th minute. In the background, it was easy to make out the chant from the Wolves fans: “Same old Arsenal, always cheating.” There was laughter and the corresponding emojis on the clip when Wolves equalised at the bitter end.\n\nThere was more from elsewhere later in the day. At tea time, Manchester City’s X account piped up with a three-year-old clip of their team playing keep-ball by the corner flag in the dying minutes of a 2-0 home victory over Newcastle. “Seeing out the win,” read the text with a tick emoji above footage of Erling Haaland and Jack Grealish, well, managing the game to a successful conclusion. It was a mickey-take with an obvious target.\n\nThis is where Arsenal find themselves as they prepare for Sunday’s home game against Chelsea – the latest staging post in their draining push for the Premier League title. Their rivals, big and small, are lining up the pot shots, eager to have fun at their expense, to prey on their sensitivities. To drive a particular narrative and make Arsenal prisoners of it.\n\nThe Wolves TikTok clip overlooked a major detail when it came to Trossard. On as a 73rd-minute substitute, the winger was cleaned out by a shoulder barge from Santiago Bueno, who was on a yellow card. Trossard had eyes only for the high ball; the Wolves defender looked directly at him and left a calling card on his opponent’s jaw. A dazed Trossard was forced off after treatment, Arsenal relieved that he avoided injury, and how do you think the club’s doctors felt about essentially being accused of complicity in a plot to run down the clock?\n\nNobody thought about that. They were too busy enjoying the clip, which went viral for the reason that these things always do. It struck a chord. It fed a perception with which opposing fans are seemingly on board. Arsenal as the roughhouse guys – and not only when they are loading men into the six-yard box on corners. The ones that will do whatever it takes to win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Leandro Trossard’s injury at Wolves seemed to invoke opprobrium from the home side. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nArsenal were much better than Spurs. They deserved to beat them, which they did; to clear their heads after the trauma of Wolves. As an aside, it was only this Spurs team. Chelsea ought to be a tougher prospect. Yet Arsenal did get away with one in the 53rd minute as they led 2-1. Would it have been different if Randal Kolo Muani had not been penalised for the slightest of pushes into Gabriel’s back before he shot past David Raya? At the very least, Arsenal would have felt their anxiety levels rise.\n\nGabriel drew the contact to the referee’s attention in theatrical fashion, as he had done at Newcastle last September in a similar situation against Nick Woltemade. That day, the referee said no foul and Woltemade scored. This time, Gabriel got the decision.\n\nWhat did Gabriel do after the game? Did he a) keep his head down and quietly count his blessings? Or b) post a picture to social media of him holding a hand of cards with the four of hearts visible, signifying his team’s four goals? He went for the latter, even tagging the Spurs forward Richarlison. Cue a host of diving memes in the responses. Was goading really the right option given the climate around the club? On the other hand, you have to admire Gabriel’s chutzpah.\n\nMikel Arteta’s response to what we are obliged to call the “outside noise” has been to narrow the focus; to dial up the intensity while also talking up his players and their mindset. The manager has his eyes on the prize and there are a number of points that need to be made, beginning with the feeling towards him and his side in coaching circles.\n\nTowards the end of January, Pep Guardiola described Arsenal as the “best team in the world” and it did not sound like just mind games from the City manager. The Wolves head coach, Rob Edwards, messaged Arteta after last week’s game to say that Arsenal were the best side in the league and there have been others in their positions who have privately expressed the highest admiration for what Arteta is doing. Namely, how Arsenal press, massing men around the ball, cutting off the passing lanes, forcing turnovers. How they dominate in possession, playing on the front foot, creating overloads, moving it quickly. The watchwords are remorselessness and control.\n\nAccording to Opta, Arsenal have had seven yellow cards for time-wasting in the league this season – the same number as Chelsea and behind only Bournemouth and Fulham, who each have eight. They are the seventh-worst offenders for the average time of delays for restarts, taking in set pieces and goal-kicks. They sit behind Sunderland, Brentford, Crystal Palace, Newcastle, Leeds and Burnley on the list in that order.\n\nArteta and his players remain at the centre of a storm, buffeted by ill winds, Chelsea ready to bring the latest of them. If Arsenal hold their nerve, they will have done it the hard way."

            "content": "“I just want to have my name out there to the point where when someone hears it they know instantly who is being talked about,” says the Chelsea full-back Chloe Sarwie. “I want to be that player who can amaze people constantly and that is up there as one of the best.”\n\nYou could be forgiven for viewing this level of confidence as arrogant, but you would be wrong. The talented 17-year-old defender comes across as grounded, intelligent, hard-working and humble, but her edge is a steely belief in her football.\n\nSarwie is speaking to the Guardian shortly before signing her first professional contract, four months after her debut in the 1-1 draw with Twente in the Champions League and three months after her first call-up to the England Under-23s.\n\nSarwie is back with the under‑23s for next month’s games against France and the Netherlands, one of two 17-year-olds considered good enough to compete alongside those vying for a chance in the senior side (the other is Erica Meg Parkinson, who plays her club football in Portugal). Last summer, at 16, she was in the squad that competed at the Under-19 Euros in Poland. “I was taken aback and I didn’t really have any expectations so it was incredible,” she says.\n\n“It’s honestly a really intense environment and every training session everyone just wants to one-up each other. It gets really competitive and just being around that wanting-to-win group was incredible.”\n\nHer Chelsea debut in October, when still 16, came as a surprise. “As soon as I got the nod from Sonia [Bompastor] that I’d be coming on for Sandy [Baltimore] and making my debut, I was just down on the sideline, shocked but pumped and ready to get on the pitch,” says Sarwie, who entered the fray against Twente in the 73rd minute.\n\nShe impressed instantly, playing with an admirable fearlessness. “Honestly, when I stepped on that pitch, I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know how to play, but I was just trying to play my part for the team, fit in and see what I could do. Towards the end of the game, I was being myself a bit more and the more playing time I’m getting, the more I’m able to express myself, but my full self hasn’t come out yet.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Chloe Sarwie (right) made her Chelsea debut in the Champions League draw with Twente last October. Photograph: Chris Lee/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\nChelsea are well equipped at right-back, with two of the world’s best in Lucy Bronze and Ellie Carpenter at their disposal, but at left-back there is a hole. With Baltimore performing well in the position but naturally a more attacking player and Niamh Charles out with an ankle injury, there have been some opportunities for Sarwie, against Crystal Palace in the FA Cup and West Ham and Tottenham in the Women’s Super League.\n\nShould her development continue at its accelerated pace there is also the chance to stake a claim in the senior England squad that has had question marks at left‑back under Sarina Wiegman. London City Lionesses’ Poppy Pattinson is the latest to receive a call-up with an eye on finding a solution to the conundrum.\n\nSarwie was introduced to the Chelsea senior side in pre-season. It was “quite exciting but also quite nerve-racking”, though training and playing with the first team has been hugely beneficial. “It’s a great challenge and I love being challenged and going up against these players, seeing how their level compares to mine and how I can get to that level,” says Sarwie.\n\n“Obviously, Lucy’s at England as well and being able to have that connection is great, even though I’m in one of the lower age groups because, ultimately, I’m learning how I can then progress to that next step and be part of the senior squad. That’s where she can give me tips and show what it takes.”\n\nSarwie began playing football in the park on her own, light on her feet thanks to ballet from the ages of two until eight. “I used to turn up to ballet with muddy tights after playing football and rolling around in the mud for a good hour or two. But ballet had a big impact on my journey as a football player as my dribbling playing style kind of links back to it. Ballet made me light on my feet. I also had to adapt from a ballet mindset, from a solo stage, to a football mindset and a team performance stage.”\n\nIt was in the park where coaches would approach her and tell her she should be playing for a club and eventually she thought: “Why not?” After a season at Millwall, she had trials at Arsenal and Chelsea and had offers from both. “I had to pick Chelsea because it was closer,” she says. “I let my family down on that one because they’re all Arsenal supporters, but oh well.”\n\nShe juggles playing and training with studying for her BTec in engineering and her mum, Jean, who is a teacher at her school, is the force that has enabled her to pursue football. She takes her laptop everywhere, to catch up with coursework, with one day a week spent in the classroom.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie takes a selfie with fans after featuring in the FA Cup against Crystal Palace. Photograph: Sport Press Photo/Alamy\n\nSarwie is having to contend with an influx of information. “It’s mad trying to switch the brain from studying engineering to football and back,” she says. “I’m still taking in everything in relation to the first team. I have all that information coming at me and then I have to go home, switch off and then do my work and it’s all a bit chaotic.”\n\nOn the pitch, there is also a balance to be struck between what is being asked of her and instinct. “Sometimes on the pitch I can be quite hesitant because I’m trying to think about what I should do at that moment instead of what I want to do, because that’s sometimes two different things. The coach wants me to do something but I want to do something else in the moment and it’s about quickly processing which one I should do.\n\n“Every day I’m getting new information coming in and I’m just trying to soak that up but trying to show myself on the pitch and putting those words into actions on the pitch can be quite difficult and it’s going to be like that for a while because of my age.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie practised ballet until the age of eight. ‘It made me light on my feet,’ she says. Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\n“Once I’m on the pitch I just want to be my most relaxed self. Breathing techniques on the pitch really help me stay calm and I’ve been told I look arrogant doing this, but chewing gum on the pitch makes me relax as well.\n\n“I want to be that person that looks in place and calm with the rest of the team, that calms that team down. I don’t want to be nervous when I get the ball, or for them to be nervous when I get the ball, I want to get the ball and to express myself as much as possible with it.”"

            "content": "1. Title run-in all about ‘little details’ Pep Guardiola has told his Manchester City players their pursuit of honours in the final three months of the season will depend on their “brains and minds”. City, who remain in contention for four trophies, meet title rivals Arsenal in the Carabao Cup final and Newcastle in the fifth-round of the FA Cup next month, as well as Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League. In the Premier League, they are five points behind Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal with a game in hand. City have had no midweek games for two weeks and – after the visit to Leeds on Saturday – Guardiola has given his players Sunday to Tuesday off as he believes the challenge in the defining part of the campaign is more mental than technical. Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more “There are still things that we should train and practise more, but I prioritised rest,” Guardiola said. “With three months left, there are many things that the team have improved in and still some things that the team has to improve, but now it is the little details. “Now it is how it is in your brains and your minds that will make the difference. Maybe for the new players it is new, but we have talked a lot in many meetings for many years that, when you arrive in the last three months, competing in all competitions, everything is here [points to his head].” Jamie Jackson\n\nEddie Howe has urged Anthony Gordon not to be distracted by reports linking him with a summer move to Arsenal amid speculation that the 25-year-old winger will be a target for the title-chasing Gunners. Howe, who is still dealing with the fallout from Alexander Isak’s defection to Liverpool last summer, could do without a repeat of that saga, but the Newcastle manager admits there is little he can do to prevent it. Newcastle face Gordon’s former cub Everton in the Premier League on Saturday and Howe said: “I’m not sure there’s a lot I can do about that. I’ve not seen the story, so it’s news to me. But we’re mid-season, we’re in the middle of some of the biggest games of his career and who knows what’s going to happen internationally with him in the summer as well? “He’s got no time to look left or right, he’s got to be fully focused on straight ahead and the next game and trying to be as good as he can be.” View image in fullscreen Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon is reported to be on Arsenal’s wishlist. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA Gordon, who earlier this month dismissed rumours he was on the way out of the club where he signed a new contract in October 2024, will hope to continue his good run of form to secure a place in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for this summer’s World Cup finals and Howe is hopeful he will not be unsettled by talk over his future. “It comes with the territory of being a top player and playing at this level, that there’s going to be speculation,” said Howe. “You’ve just got to put it out of your brain and you’ve got to focus on the football because as we know with our schedule, there’s so many games, there’s no time for distractions. We have to be fully focused on each match.” PA Media\n\n3. Moyes blames referees for corner ‘dark arts’ David Moyes has claimed corner-kick routines are turning into wrestling contests because referees have ignored “the dark arts” for too long. Moyes’s Everton team were criticised for crowding the Manchester United goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, at several corners during their 1-0 defeat at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Monday. Ahead of Saturday’s game at Newcastle, the Everton manager insisted that went against his gameplan but he, and other managers, would seek any advantage that the laws of the game offer. However, he also believes referees should take a harder line to try to eradicate jostling at set-pieces. “Truthfully, it wasn’t the plan for our corner kicks to end up like that. But I think there’s a bigger issue with it,” Moyes said. “It has been allowed to let go, whether it be blocking of goalkeepers or blocking of defenders, and you get the feeling now that referees really don’t want to get involved in any of it. It is nearly wrestling to an extent, which it shouldn’t be. It should never have got to this situation, but I think it’s been really poor that they’ve not tried to deal with it well enough and stop it. “You are now allowed lots of blocking, for example. In my day, if you blocked someone it would have been a free-kick. But blocking has become a big part of it. Let’s be fair, the best at it – but with style – would be Arsenal: good delivery, good style, but ultimately there’s a lot of dark arts in it such as blocking the goalkeeper from the back or the front, blocking defenders and making it difficult for them to be your key headers of the ball. “It is a big thing in football, but I do think the level of refereeing has let that part of the game drop. And managers, if we see somebody else doing it and not getting punished for it, then we are all on it.” View image in fullscreen More wrestling match than football as Manchester United and Everton players indulge in some dark arts from a corner. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images Ironically, Moyes felt Everton’s approach in the closing stages against United worked against his team. He wanted more variety from Everton’s corners but claimed: “It was very difficult to get the message on.” Moyes admitted: “The plan was not to deliver the corners in the fashion we did the other night. They shouldn’t have been delivered as close to the goalkeeper. They should have been delivered into different areas at different times according to what we had worked on. It became a bit of a wrestling match and I didn’t think it showed enough quality or enough thought.” Andy Hunter\n\n4. Glasner wary of United’s Carrick bounce Oliver Glasner credits Michael Carrick for imbuing Manchester United with a “great spirit” and “clear structure” since his appointment last month. No team has picked up more Premier League points in 2026 than United, with Carrick winning five of his six games in charge since replacing Ruben Amorim. Palace have been a thorn in United’s side in recent years, winning three of their five last encounters, but Glasner expects Carrick’s side to be in fine form on Sunday when the Eagles head to Old Trafford. View image in fullscreen The Crystal Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, steered his team into the last 16 of the Uefa Conference league on Thursday. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA “Of course, when Man United plays at home against Crystal Palace, everybody there is expecting now a win,” said Glasner. “They are a very good team now. They gave a very good balance between, it’s a very experienced team, with really, very experienced Premier League players, and very young players with huge talent. “It’s a good mix they have now, but I think the most important thing for them is they are consistently playing with their team and have a clear structure in the way they are playing. This is what I could see against Everton. They have a great spirit right now. It was really impressive seeing Matheus Cunha celebrating winning a duel in their own box. This, I think, is what Michael Carrick brought into this team.” PA Media"

            "content": "Igor Tudor says his Tottenham players are not fit enough and has questioned their desire to put in the hard yards without the ball.\n\nThe interim head coach has a clearer idea of the problems he faces after two weeks – and there are many of them, including low levels of confidence and the capacity of the younger players to handle the pressure of a relegation battle.\n\nTudor knows there are reasons for the physical issues with the squad stretched by an injury crisis amid a punishing schedule. Although Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso are in contention to return for Sunday’s trip to Fulham, Tottenham will be without eight injured players plus the suspended Cristian Romero.\n\nTudor believes there is only one way out of the situation – an on-the-hoof fitness reboot in training, particularly as the club had no midweek fixture last week or this. The Croat surprised the players by working them extremely hard throughout last week and not tapering off before last Sunday’s home game against Arsenal, which they lost 4-1. As Tudor made plain, it is not a time to pander to player sensibilities.\n\n“Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,” Tudor said. “They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and it made the physical condition of the team drop down. So we need to use this period where we don’t play the games to put some petrol in the engine so the engine starts to work better.\n\n“They are fatigued. To do the pressing high you need to be fit. But [it is] all of them because if someone is not in the right shape there is a problem because someone is coming late [to the press].\n\n“The second thing is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back. If you run up and don’t run back it’s a problem. For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it’s a big question what we can do and what we cannot do.”\n\nTudor was asked about his full-throttle approach from the first training session. “Yes, that’s the only way – running,” he said. “The pitch is 100 yards, it’s long. So you need to run.\n\n“Maybe you have habits to, I don’t know … work a bit less. I put some runs without the ball [into the sessions]. Never players like runs without the ball so we put some runs without balls. But it’s a moment when there is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn’t like. And the best thing is that they understand this. They gave me their availability to do these things.”\n\nTudor is under no illusions about the size of the challenge. It was put to him that the striker, Randal Kolo Muani, had played well against Arsenal. “That’s good, one good thing,” he replied.\n\nWhat Tudor wants to see at Fulham and beyond is players such as Kolo Muani stepping up, accepting the responsibility. “Some players are still young,” he said. “They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to resolve the problems.\n\nView image in fullscreen Randal Kolo Muani scores against Arsenal – Igor Tudor wants him to keep raising his game for Spurs. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\n“If you have too many of these players because of the amount of injuries, who are playing together in the squad, it does create some problems. But it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man. To say: ‘Come on, I’m the guy, give me the ball, I will score.’ Instead of just: ‘What can I do? I’m just here, you know.’\n\n“It’s always how you see the situation. It’s not: ‘I’m just here. We had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play.’ How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy and positive, there is opportunity.”\n\nTudor has not dwelt for long on the derby with Arsenal. “No, no, forget that,” he said. It was never likely to be a game that would define the club’s survival hopes. The same is not true of Fulham – or the home fixture against Crystal Palace next Thursday.\n\n“After the first game, I said if you play against the best team in the world at this moment, it’s not a realistic game to show [whether] we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,” Tudor said. “That’s the truth. They show they can be in some parts of the game. But for long periods we had problems, in defence especially. It’s not easy against them. Let’s see in the next games.”"

The club are not planning to publish their 2024-25 accounts until the end of March.\n\nChelsea, while not contesting the £355m loss, which is based on information they provided to Uefa, insist the headline figure does not reflect the economic reality.\n\nClub sources have disclosed that the record loss reflects non-cash accounting adjustments required by Uefa’s financial sustainability regulations, specifically one-off transactions related to player contract and asset write-offs, and that they are profitable on an operational basis.\n\nChelsea were fined £27m by Uefa last summer for breaching its spending restrictions and ordered to submit to a business plan, but are confident of avoiding another sanction. As part of that settlement agreement Chelsea were permitted to continue running at a substantial loss, as long as it remained in line with “the projected deficit submitted in the business plan”."

It was a moment of catharsis for Edwards, who beat his chest and wellied an advertising hoarding, but for Unai Emery it was a different kind of cue.\n\nAs those in old gold savoured a win over near neighbours that takes them to 13 points, ending any fears that they may not eclipse Derby’s record-low tally of 11 in 2007-08, Emery marched straight down the tunnel before the post-match handshakes.\n\nWolves’s other Premier League win came against West Ham at the start of last month and no wonder the supporters savoured every second. “The two games we’ve won in the league this year, both managers have disappeared from the touchline,” Edwards said with a smile. “I think everyone expects just to turn up and win, which is understandable given how this season has gone.”\n\nAt the end of the season, how costly might this untimely slip prove for Villa? Judging by the way Emery fumed, this defeat will hurt for a while yet and, significantly, it could have major implications for their hopes of returning to the Champions League. They are on a poor run of form having taken only one win in their past six matches in all competitions and 12 points from their past nine league games. Emery called for perspective.\n\n“Maybe you can say: ‘We are losing the chance to the win the Premier League,’” Emery said animatedly. “Some supporters maybe were dreaming. Now we are not with the possibility to fight for the Premier League, some can feel frustrated, even myself because I have my dreams. In September I was worried and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. One month ago I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League.”\n\nView image in fullscreen A sodden Unai Emery tries to spur on his Aston Villa team as they struggled against Wolves. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters\n\nVilla were unpicked by a team almost certainly heading for the Championship but, as they did when rousing to a draw against the leaders, Arsenal, Wolves showed they will go down fighting.\n\nJoão Gomes fired in his first goal in a year just after the hour, starting the move himself after nutmegging the Villa substitute Ross Barkley, and then Rodrigo Gomes put the game beyond doubt on the counterattack, after Yerson Mosquera and José Sá combined to deny Amadou Onana. Morgan Rogers’s attempt to recycle a corner ended with Wolves attacking three v two. Rogers had his face in the turf as Rodrigo Gomes swivelled near the penalty spot and buried the ball past Emiliano Martínez.\n\nIt was never going to be an evening for the purists and driving rain did little to enhance this soggy Midlands derby as a spectacle. It was a contest bogged down by misplaced passes, clunky touches and the ball slowing unpredictably on a saturated surface. Ezri Konsa can vouch for that, the Villa centre-back nudging the ball back to Martínez with his big toe, just as Adam Armstrong sought to prey on Douglas Luiz’s loose pass. It was a night for the poncho-clad Wolves supporters in the uncovered Graham Hughes stand in a corner of this stadium. Hugo Bueno looked battle-hardened, the reverse of the Wolves full-back’s old gold shirt caked in mud.\n\nEmery grew increasingly agitated as the game went on. He exploded as Jadon Sancho declined to take a shot first time at the back post and there was a restlessness within the home support too. Edwards gestured for calm as the locals aired their frustration at Jackson Tchatchoua looking inside for the perceived easy pass. Wolves struggled to hold on to the ball and when they did have it surrendered possession cheaply, João Gomes among those guilty. Sá, wearing the captain’s armband, shanked a goal-kick straight out of play to the disbelief of those in the stands.\n\nWolves, certainly not lacking in spirit, defended admirably. Tchatchoua did well to halt Ian Maatsen, one of those thrown on by Emery as Villa chased the game. Toti Gomes halted an advancing Leon Bailey, another second-half substitute. Bueno blocked off all avenues for Cash and turned to celebrate with the home fans. Then, at the final whistle, having doubled their lead, Wolves let loose."

Most people can get a painless blood pressure test, and they do not always have to go to the doctor's office for it.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAround one in three adults in the UK has high blood pressure. Blood Pressure UK reports that in England, 31% of men and 26% of women have high blood pressure, proving how common the condition is across the country.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nExperts can help the public stay informed and prepared to avoid the worst that can happen when high blood pressure goes unchecked. Anyone born in 1986 or later meets one of the main criteria for getting one of these free health checks.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHow to know if I'm eligible?\n\nAs part of the NHS Community Pharmacy Blood Pressure Check Service, you can get a free blood pressure check if you are:\n\nOver the age of 40\n\nlive in England\n\nhaven't had your blood pressure checked by a medical professional in the past six months\n\ndon't already have high blood pressure\n\nGut health doctor's three rules to stop acid reflux and heartburn READ MORE :\n\nIf you're under 40 but have a family history of high blood pressure, or your GP has referred you, you may still qualify. Check with the pharmacy or your GP if you're unsure.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nYou can get a blood pressure check at your GP surgery, participating community pharmacies such as Lloyds Pharmacy and Well Pharmacy, and at pharmacy counters inside some major supermarkets such as Asda and Tesco. Some workplaces also offer blood pressure checks. Check with your employer.\n\nWhy is high blood pressure a problem?\n\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) is often called a 'silent killer' because most people don’t know they have it. Left untreated, it can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease or vascular dementia.\n\nView 3 Images You can get a blood pressure check at your GP surgery or other eligible locations - like Asda or Tesco (Image: Getty)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAccording to the NHS website, things that increase your chances of having high blood pressure include:\n\nyour age – you're more likely to get high blood pressure as you get older\n\nhaving close relatives with high blood pressure\n\nyour ethnicity – you're at higher risk if you have a Black African, Black Caribbean or South Asian ethnic background\n\nhaving an unhealthy diet – especially a diet that's high in salt\n\nbeing overweight\n\nsmoking\n\ndrinking too much alcohol\n\nfeeling stressed over a long period\n\nHealthy lifestyle changes can help lower your blood pressure, alongside any medication that is prescribed by a doctor. People are given suggestions such as having a healthy, balanced diet (with a limit on salt) and adding regular exercise (at least 150 minutes a week) to help them lose weight if they are overweight.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images The quick and painless test takes less than a few minutes to do and could help detect a 'silent killer' (Image: Getty)\n\nAre there any high blood pressure warning signs?\n\nHigh blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms. Many people have it without realising it.\n\nIn some cases, high blood pressure can cause symptoms such as headaches, blurred vision and chest pain. However, these are very general symptoms and could be caused by another issue altogether.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe only way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to get your blood pressure checked.

In the swiftly developing situation, explosions have been reported in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTensions have been building in the region for weeks, with President Donald Trump moving what he dubbed an \"armada\" of military force to the region. The US has called the operation \"Epic Fury\", and the President told Iranians in a video statement to \"take over\" their government when the conflict ends, saying: \"It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDiplomatic nuclear negotiations have been stalling between US and Iran recently, with Trump saying in his statement that the Islamic Republic has \"rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions\" as a justification for the \"massive and ongoing operation\" against Iran, which has reportedly included a strike that hit the office of the Supreme Leader, as plumes of smoke have been seen over Tehran.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as your Preferred Source in your Google search settings.\n\nThe Iranian Revolutionary Guard has launched retaliatory strikes, according to the Israeli Defence Force, marking that for the second time in less than a year, direct conflict has broken out between the two countries. Airlines have been turning planes headed to the Middle East around, and some have halted flights to the region altogether.\n\nThe UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office has told Brits in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE to \"immediately shelter in place\" and to \"Remain indoors in a secure location, avoid all travel, and follow instructions from the local authorities.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the principal players in the Middle East conflict - and why they matter so much.\n\nDonald Trump - USA\n\nView 7 Images Donald Trump gave a lengthy video statement about the \"massive\" military operation he has launched (Image: TRUTH SOCIAL)\n\nTrump has said that American citizens may die during the conflict, but that \"we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.\" He accused Iran of \"mass terror\" and called it the \"world's number one state sponsor of terror\" in his statement about Operation Epic Fury. He also cited widespread protests that took place earlier this year in the country, which were violently repressed by the regime.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe urged Iranians who want a change of regime to take advantage of the conflict, saying: \"For many years, you have asked for America's help, but you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want, so let's see how you respond. America is backing you with overwhelming strength and devastating force. Now is the time to seize control of your destiny and to unleash the prosperous and glorious future that is close within your reach. This is the moment for action. Do not let it pass.\"\n\nLast year, when conflict broke out between Israel and the US against Iran, world leaders urged de-escalation, but Donald Trump launched US military action of its own. Dubbed Operation Midnight, three strikes targeting Iran's nuclear facilities - Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordo - were carried out, involving 125 US aircraft.\n\nTrump has claimed the US inflicted \"monumental damage\" to the nuclear sites, and the US asserted this severely set back Iran's nuclear programme; however, less than a year later, the potential nuclear capabilities of Iran have been used again as a justification for war. Last June, a leaked intelligence report from the Pentagon suggested the damage was far less substantial, and the Iranians still retained the capacity to develop a nuclear weapon within months, something Trump dismissed at the time as \"fake news\".\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIran retaliated with strikes on a US military base in Qatar, in what numerous analysts have described as a \"choreographed\" manoeuvre, where prior warning of the attack was provided to prevent casualties. This has been characterised as a \"face-saving\" exercise by Iran, with one expert noting: \"By keeping its military action contained, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps gifted Trump an off-ramp\" and enabled de-escalation.\n\nNone of these armed confrontations, which are presently balanced on the brink of further escalation, has emerged from nowhere. Trump told reporters outside The Hague last year about the relationship between Israel and Iran, \"We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f**k they are doing.\"\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu - Israel\n\nView 7 Images Benjamin Netanyahu (Image: X)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIsrael and Benjamin Netanyahu have long been regarded as a crucial ally in the Middle East for the UK and the US, with expert Dr Alexander Gilder - Associate Professor of International Law and Security at the University of Reading - telling The Mirror: \"Israel provides a friendly foothold in the Middle East to deter states, like Iran, that the West have long-standing ideological differences with.\n\n\"For example, the US operates early missile warning systems in Israel, which is strategically important for monitoring missile launches from Iran.\" The US supplies Israel with more than $3 billion annually in aid - yet the perception of Israel's significance to the West is diminishing for some.\n\n\"The question is whether Israel is still a close ally of the great Western European democracies, and in my view, it is no longer one,\" Professor Anthony Glees, from the University of Buckinghamshire, told the Mirror. \"Israel has moved away from us by leaps and bounds. Its values right now are not shared by many of us here in the UK. Brits have always believed in fairness. We think that what's right for the Jews in the Middle East and beyond, to have their own state, must also apply to the Palestinians.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite the nation's strategic value to the US, Professor Glees explained that European populations are gradually becoming more detached from Israel. \"Israel, though a very small country, used to be a key ally in the Middle East because it was the only true liberal democracy in the region and its political, economic and cultural values were European,\" he explained.\n\nView 7 Images Smoke over Bahrain after a strike on the headquarters of the U.S. Navy 5th Fleet (Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\n\"But over the years since the state was founded, it has become less European in outlook and more extreme and more embattled: the hardcore nationalists like Netanyahu have gained in power over the more traditional centre and centre-left parties, and they've been egged on by hardline groups, whose numbers have been swollen by immigrants from the USA and Russia.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Like Putin, like Xi and indeed like Trump in the new world order, Netanyahu fits in well. Like the three of them, Netanyahu believes in being strong but also being a land-grabber. Security for all of them comes not just from guns and bullets, nor nuclear weapons that they cannot use (unless they want to commit suicide), but by the acquisition of land that is not theirs.\"\n\nThe expert cited Trump's suggestions about annexing Canada and Greenland into the US, Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and President Xi Jinping's assertion that China will inevitably reclaim Taiwan as examples. \"This is why Netanyahu will never agree to an independent state of Palestine, which has been our policy for many years.\n\n\"In short, Israel is no longer the country it was even 25 years ago. It too is now ruled by a strong man, and it's easy to see why the USA today feels so close to Israel,\" said Professor Glees. Israel's values and culture were, as a nation, the most closely aligned with those of the West in the Middle East for an extended period.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDr Nick Westcott - Professor of Practice at SOAS Department of Politics and International Studies, and previously a diplomat and director of the Royal African Society - stated, \"Historically a lot of Israelis came from Europe, refugees from the Holocaust. So they were culturally very close to Europe and the US\" and reinforced Professor Glees' views that \"Israel's democratic traditions also made it feel close to the West.\"\n\nNevertheless, the expert observed: \"This has changed over time, as Israeli culture has become more orthodox and more influenced by Sephardic (Middle Eastern) Jewish traditions, and newer immigration from the US.\" That represents a crucial factor in grasping the differences in public perception internationally between the Islamic Republic of Iran and that of Israel, because, naturally, what appears more familiar to us in the UK will be simpler for most people to connect with.\n\nAli Khamenei - Iran\n\nView 7 Images Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's office was reportedly hit in a strike (Image: AP)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIran and Ali Khamenei's image continues to suffer from Western attitudes towards \"the Orient\", according to Dr Westcott, which represents the mysterious East, Islamic fundamentalism, political absolutism and so forth. \"Iranian culture is much richer, more ancient, more complex and more accountable, but many in the US and Europe don't find it so accessible.\"\n\nIran has often been labelled as an \"apocalyptic death cult\" by numerous analysts, and it indeed exhibits many characteristics of a backward, deeply religious regime. Dissidents have been subjected to torture in prison, British nationals accused of spying and detained, and in 2022, widespread protests erupted following the killing of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was alleged to have violated rules mandating women to don a headscarf.\n\nA UN investigative team concluded that Iran's morality police were accountable for the \"physical violence\" leading to her death \"as a result of beatings\". Massive demonstrations ensued in the wake of her death, during which the harsh response from Iranian security forces resulted in over 500 protestors losing their lives, coupled with allegations of sexual violence perpetrated against demonstrators as well as \"branding\" them by shooting them in the eye.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister has urged opposition in Iran to seize the conflict as an opportunity to topple the regime; however, Trump has expressed his disinterest in regime change, arguing that it would lead to \"chaos\". Whilst Professor Glees voiced strong criticism of the Iranian regime to The Mirror, he clarified that his views on the country's government did not make him \"feel closer to the Israelis than to the Iranians\".\n\nThe expert stated: \"Many of us know Iranian exiles, we have been moved by Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, by the fact that the ayatollahs allow the rape of women routinely in their gaols, they hang gays from cranes in Tehran and have a country which is without doubt a crucible of terror in the region. But also, as MI5 has told us, brews up plots against us here in the UK.\n\n\"But we are smart enough to distinguish between the Iranian people and those who have ruled them since 1979. We know that they are controlled entirely by the ruthless and bloodthirsty ayatollahs. We admire Iranians for their culture, where it still exists, and would gladly travel to a free Iran.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAre there any good guys in this conflict?\n\nBoth Israel and Iran prove divisive, and there can be an understandable temptation to label one side as the 'good guys' and the other as 'bad' - but experts unanimously agree this approach is simplistic and counterproductive.\n\n\"Things are almost never black and white, only shades of grey - like fog,\" Dr Westcott told The Mirror. \"It's the diplomat's job to look for the light in the grey. There are extremists on both sides who want to reduce it to a simple 'us or them'. But also moderates who are willing to talk and listen. The need is to create space for the latter, not stoke up the former.\n\n\"Geopolitics is never that simple,\" reiterated Dr Gilder, emphasising that the conflict cannot be isolated from its broader regional context, \"Israel-Iran relations are heavily influenced by other countries such as the US, Saudi Arabia and others.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 7 Images Smoke rises on the skyline after an explosion in Tehran, Iran (Vahid Salemi/AP) (Image: (Image: AP))\n\nProfessor Glees highlighted that to some extent it \"makes good political sense for us to distinguish between 'good' and 'bad' and appeal with our official media outlets to the 'good' ones,\" adding that the UK did so \"to great effect during WW2 when we knew that not every German was a Nazi, not every Italian a Fascist, something that allowed us to be respected when we'd got rid of the Fascists in Germany and Italy and for our views of how they should move to free democracies were followed so successfully.\"\n\nHowever, he added, \"This is a big question. What I would say is that our government and our media needs to make it plain that in police states like Iran, or in totally traumatised states like Israel, it is hard to know who is 'good' and who is 'bad'. We always need to ask ourselves what people would be like if they had a different leadership and were truly at liberty to lead their lives in peace.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBreaking out of 'Us versus Them' mindset\n\nBoth Israel and Iran have a religious basis at the very core of their states - and this means, the experts explain, things can be overly simplified into an \"us versus them\" scenario. \"Often the whole conflict is reduced to religious over-simplification - Jews versus Muslims,\" explained Dr Westcott, adding, \"This helps no one.\"\n\n\"Both Israel and Iran have strong relationships between religion and the state that has led to some calling them theocracies,\" Dr Gilder noted, highlighting that \"There is a large diaspora of Iranian jews that left Iran following the Islamic Revolution and moved to Israel.\" Prior to the Iranian revolution in 1979, Israel and Iran maintained favourable relations, but this dramatically shifted once the Shah was deposed.\n\nFrom then on, official ties were severed between the two nations, and anti-Israel rhetoric has escalated over the years, with cries for \"death to Israel\" becoming commonplace and a former president denying the Holocaust ever occurred. Tensions have only heightened, but for a long time, these took the form of a proxy war.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIran has consistently backed Israel's adversaries. Since Hezbollah's establishment in 1982, the Lebanese group has received funding, arms, and training from Iran.\n\nView 7 Images The damage at an impact site following strikes on Tehran (Image: UGC/UNKNOWN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMilitias in Yemen and Iraq have similarly benefited from Iran's support, and Hamas has also received funding and weaponry from Iran, leading the US government to label the country a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" since 1984. This use of \"proxies\" was cited by Trump as another reason behind the conflict. \"From Lebanon to Yemen, and Syria to Iraq, the regime has armed, trained and funded terrorist militias that have soaked the earth with blood and guts. And it was Iran's proxy, Hamas, that launched the monstrous October 7 attacks on Israel,\" he said today.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIran's conflicts had remained 'cold' in this manner for an extended period, and the American University has noted these actions \"demonstrate the control that Iran exerts over conflicts in the region - without ever becoming officially involved in the conflicts.\" Dr Gilder explained that the reality that \"Iran has long been accused of state-sponsored terrorism against Israel and the West\" only \"deepens these strong feelings\" of one side towards the other.\n\nIran is \"determined to demonise the other side, stoke up hatred,\" explains Dr Westcott, \"Hence some of the misinformation going round on social media. \"And many people still believe what they want to hear, and don't look for objective truth. So positions polarise, and the truth gets lost. Governments have a responsibility to stick to the truth and avoid, not propagate, false reports.\"\n\nHamas, Gaza, and normalisation\n\nThe financing of groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah doesn't mean Iran has total control over them. Nevertheless, Professor Joe Young has stated that operating in this fashion gives Iran \"plausible deniability\" and whilst they lack \"full control\" over Hamas or Hezbollah for example, \"Ceding some of that control over a proxy group's interests is a price that Iran is willing to pay to keep conflicts with the US and Saudi Arabia from escalating to full-scale war.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIran officially recognises Palestine as a state, and has formally backed the Palestinian people against \"Israeli occupation\" - following the 1979 revolution, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) was given the keys to the former Israeli embassy in Tehran, in what was viewed as a symbolic gesture of transformation.\n\nNevertheless, the Palestinian Authority rebuffed Iran's involvement, stating in 2024 that they had \"no objective [other] than to sow chaos\". Regardless of whether Iran's motives for funding and backing Hamas are purely self-serving to wage a proxy war, or stem from genuine concern about the plight of Palestinians, Israel's continued assault on Gaza has damaged its standing in the international community.\n\nProfessor Glees, whilst \"appalled\" by the October 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas that witnessed \"unspeakable evil\" unfold, has also been \"horrified\" by Israel's conduct in Gaza, describing it as a \"war of revenge\". \"We here in the UK, like our strong allies in Europe, reject the idea of 'security through land-grabbing'; we were utterly appalled by the brutal murder, rape and hostage taking of October 7 2023, when over a thousand Jews were killed simply because they were Jews.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It reminded us, rightly, of the pogroms in the 19th century and, above all, of the Holocaust when 6 to 10 million Jews were coldly exterminated by the Germans simply because they were Jews. However, the war that Israel has been fighting in Gaza, so far without success, has horrified us. Whilst we believe, I think, the Hamas terrorists should be destroyed, it is plain that the Israeli government led by Netanyahu not only failed the Israelis by a total lack of intelligence about Hamas and its plots but then went on to fight a war of revenge, in which more than 50,000 civilians were killed and are still being killed.\"\n\nStrong emotions surround these conflicts and the nations of Iran and Israel across all perspectives. \"I think the real reason the strong feelings are being generated is because of our sense of justice,\" Professor Glees explained. \"That's really important. The British people, in particular, are fair and believe in justice. We think that Israel has a right to exist because of what was done to the Jews by the Nazis and by anti-Semitic viewpoints throughout Europe, including the UK.\n\n\"But for exactly the same reason, we understand and support the Palestinians in their quest for their own nation, and we are appalled at the brutal way they are being treated by now. Just as Jews could never forget what was done to them, we know the Palestinian people will be equally shaped by their fate right now.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"What has made things so much harder, and this comes back in part of Iran, is Islamist extremism and terror. Ayatollahs and Islamist (not Islamic) faith leaders have radicalised three generations of young Muslims who have spread violence and death globally in support of the Palestinians. Most Brits, I believe, understand that a just cause (a free Palestine) does not justify acts of unspeakable evil, whoever executes them. That's why we have believed in a rules-based system. Sadly, it will disappear if we do not fight for it.\"\n\nThe Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, went so far as to praise the October 7 attacks, describing them as essential to thwart the plans of the US, Israel and \"some of the region's countries to change the equation in the region.\" This was widely interpreted as a reference to the continuing normalisation efforts aimed at establishing relations between Israel and neighbouring states, including Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs Dr Gilder highlighted to The Mirror, the conflict and tensions between Iran and Israel do not exist in isolation, but are shaped by the broader state of relations across the Gulf. He explained: \"Iran has also been concerned at the potential for improved relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel that could lead to intelligence and military cooperation that threatens Iran's position in the region.\" Now, with explosions reported across the region, countries closing the airspaces, and the potential for escalation a terrifying prospect, the relationships in the wider region matter more than ever."

            "content": "'Mr Trump, the world is asking, why have you started this war?'\n\nThe world deserves a clear answer from Donald Trump on why he has launched a dangerously escalating war with Iran and what the true objective really is.\n\nView 4 Images During his 2024 campaign, Donald Trump pledged to be the president who would wind wars down, not ignite new ones. Yet in the year since, he has authorised military strikes in seven countries (Image: Photo by US President Trump Via Truth Social/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nIt is now the most asked question in the world and one that the President of the United States refuses to answer plainly. Why have you started this war, Mr Trump?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNot in slogans. Not in fragments. Not in shifting soundbites about nuclear threats or freedom for the Iranian people. But in clear, accountable terms. Because what is unfolding now is not a limited strike, not a shadow skirmish, not another fleeting operation that vanishes from the headlines in a week. Direct confrontation with Iran is a different order of magnitude. It is riskier than anything this administration has undertaken before.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIran is not an isolated militia in a desert compound. It is a heavily militarised state with missile capabilities, proxy networks across the Middle East and a regime that has survived revolution, sanctions and internal unrest for nearly half a century. Once you strike at the heart of such a system, you are no longer nudging events - you are gambling on survival or collapse. That is the true measure of this conflict.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

It will be judged by whether Iran’s current regime endures - wounded but intact - or whether it falls. If the regime survives, it will claim defiance and rebuild. If it collapses, the world will confront the chaos that follows.\n\nEither way, this is no small, tidy intervention. Which brings us back to the question. Why now?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhy escalate to a level that risks retaliation against American troops, diplomats and regional allies? Why act without securing formal congressional approval, when the Constitution is explicit about who holds the power to declare war? Why ask for trust when recent history offers so many reasons for scepticism?\n\nThe president previously declared Iran’s nuclear programme “obliterated”. That assertion has not aged well. If obliteration required follow-up, was it ever obliteration at all? Words matter when missiles follow them.\n\nAnd there is another reality that Americans cannot ignore. US military involvement abroad is now at its highest level in recent memory. The tempo has quickened. The footprint has widened. The sense of drift has grown. At the same time, scrutiny at home has intensified, including renewed questions surrounding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and his years-long friendship with him.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nForeign conflict has a way of absorbing oxygen. It rearranges the news agenda. It moves the spotlight. No one should cynically reduce war to distraction. But neither should anyone pretend that escalating overseas confrontation does not redirect attention from domestic discomfort.\n\nView 4 Images People take shelter as Iran launched missiles and drones towards Israel following the US-Israeli attacks, in Jerusalem (Image: Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nThe Iranian regime deserves no sympathy. It represses its people, funds terror and pursues nuclear capability in defiance of international norms. Preventing Tehran from acquiring a bomb is a legitimate strategic objective. But legitimacy of concern does not equal clarity of strategy.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIf the goal is limited to setting back nuclear ambitions, what prevents Iran from rebuilding? Is America committing to an open-ended cycle of strikes stretching years into the future? If the goal is broader, to destabilise or even topple the regime, what evidence suggests that the outcome will be cleaner or more stable than regime-change efforts elsewhere this century? Iraq and Afghanistan removed governments. They also left scars that shaped a generation.\n\nThis moment demands seriousness, a defined objective, congressional consent and a sober explanation of risks. Instead, Americans are being asked for faith. Faith that escalation will not spiral. Faith that retaliation will be contained. Faith that the endgame is understood.\n\nBut faith is not a substitute for strategy. So the question stands. Why have you started this war, Mr Trump? Is it to halt a nuclear programme? To weaken a regime? To bring it down entirely? Or to project strength at a time when questions at home are uncomfortable?\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAnd Britain cannot pretend it is someone else’s problem. When Washington escalates, the global economy shudders. Oil prices move. Markets react. British forces in the region face heightened risk. Our own security calculations shift.\n\nView 4 Images Smoke over Bahrain after an Iranian strike on the headquarters of the US Navy 5th Fleet (Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nWar is the gravest decision a nation can make. It should never feel impulsive. And it should never leave citizens guessing about its purpose. Until Trump answers that simple question with clarity and accountability, doubt will continue to shadow every missile launched in America’s name."

And their story is now a film\n\nThe Corinthians - We Were The Champions\n\nThe Corinthians Ladies FC were formed in Manchester back in 1949, at the height of the FA’s ban on women’s football. And for three years, documentary maker Helen Tither campaigned to get their story turned into a film, with the support of the Mirror. Now their dreams have finally become a reality as the original rebel girls of football - now aged between 70 and 90 - walked the red carpet this week at their very own film premiere. Former Corinthian Monica Curran tells The Mirror: “The film really makes me see how what we did was a cornerstone for developing women’s football. It lays down an important historical marker. I am so pleased to see it getting out there into cinemas at last.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Corinthians Ladies FC were the globetrotting champions of women’s football that history forgot. Banned from playing the beautiful game from 1921 to 1971 by the FA - who declared it ‘quite unsuitable for females’ - these pioneering girls from Manchester defied the rules to win worldwide trophies.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe first women’s team to tour South America in 1960, they beat Germany to an unofficial European Cup in 1957, triumphed over Juventus to bag a cup in Europe in 1970, and have been named as ‘one of the most successful women’s teams the UK ever had’ by the National Football Museum. Yet their story had been all but forgotten … until now.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images The Manchester Corinthians (Image: Collect Unknown)\n\nBut, at last, they will see their names in lights in their native Manchester as The Corinthians: We Were The Champions , is released in cinemas, following an award-winning film festival run. The premiere marks a huge moment for the Corinthians players and their families, who have spent decades fighting for recognition.\n\nIn the film, the team is represented by 10 players - Myra Lypnyckyj, Anne Grimes, Pauline Hulme, Marlene Cook, Freda Ashton, Monica Curran, Margaret ‘Whit’ Whitworth, Jean Wilson, Jan Lyons and Margaret ‘Tiny’ Shepherd. Despite their advancing years, they are fast becoming celebrities - receiving standing ovations wherever they appear to talk about the documentary.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHailed by Mayor Andy Burnham as Manchester’s “football suffragettes”, The Corinthians Ladies FC were pioneers of the women’s game. Starting their team in 1949, ignoring the FA ban, after a 21-year struggle to be allowed to play, they survived to become one of the founding teams of the Women’s FA. Like many Manchester teams, The Corinthians were champions, but achieved this with no facilities, no other teams to play, and despite being banned from pitches in the UK.\n\nView 3 Images Former Manchester Corinthians player Margaret Whitworth with the blue plaque which is being unveiled at Fog Lane Park in Didsbury, Manchester marking the creation of the team (Image: Manchester Evening News)\n\nThey took their incredible show on the road - drawing huge crowds when they played abroad, in massive stadiums including Sporting Lisbon. Among many firsts and victories, The Corinthians beat Germany to a European Cup in 1957, and became the first women’s team to tour South America in 1960.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Corinthians’ talent and resilience were instrumental in beating the ban - brought in by a male establishment after women’s football became popular during WWI, drawing crowds of up to 50,000. The Manchester team’s popularity and success abroad led to other women’s teams sparking up around the world and, finally, they could no longer be ignored and the ban was lifted.\n\nBacked by the National Football Museum – who have no other films of women talking about playing during the ban in their archive – and supported by Lioness and Manchester United star Ella Toone, the film has been a real labour of love for the production team. Despite initially being told ‘nobody wants to watch women’s sport’, they started making the film anyway, raising money through crowdfunding and sponsorship from BT Group and Tech Mahindra. “The Corinthians Ladies FC were a proud Mancunian team,” says Director Helen, of Manchester-based production company Films Not Words. “With that rebellious Mancunian spirit, they refused to take no for an answer, so we had to do the same.”\n\nView 3 Images Manchester Corinthians - England's most successful - and forgotten - female football team. Anne Grimes is on the left of this photo, from 1957 in Portugal (Image: National Fotos)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSelected for six film festivals, as far afield as Orlando and Stockholm, it is already winning awards, including Best of the Fest at the North East International Film Festival. Now, the filmmakers are thrilled it will be receiving its major public launch in the team’s home city. Helen says: “We have had the absolute privilege of working with 10 surviving players – some of whom joined back in 1954 – to record their amazing stories, in their own words\n\n“And we have always wanted the film to officially launch in their home city, where we believe they deserve to be remembered as one of our great teams, alongside United and City. We are thrilled to give these legendary players that red carpet moment they truly deserve.”\n\nThe Corinthians: We Were The Champions has won Best of The Fest (Feature) at NEIFF, is nominated for Best Documentary at the Northampton Film Festival and will have its London Premiere at the prestigious Women in Film & TV Festival, as part of their showcase event in Covent Garden in March. The film is being screened at Manchester’s HOME cinema, with further screenings across the country to be announced."

The money expert asked listeners to his BBC podcast who had already retired, to share their ideas for what they wished someone had told them going into retirement.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOne idea that came up in the responses was to stay active and look after your health. One retiree urged people to take care of their physical health, saying: \"Lifespan and health span are two things. Enjoy your health span while you can and maintain your muscle mass. You want to be able to lift cabin bags into the overhead rack at 80, and not be out of breath walking up a flight of steps.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMr Lewis gave his support to this idea of keeping in robust physical condition. The finance expert, who is aged 53, said he himself gets in \"loads of exercise\" and does exercise every day.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe shared some thoughts on the importance of having variety in your fitness routine: \"Cardio is important, but weights are important, and squats and being able to get up out of a chair.\"\n\nState Pensioners to face major tax change\n\nExplaining the difference between lifespan versus health span, the expert said: \"This is interesting. Do you want to live to 150? - That's lifespan. Health span is about living as long as you can when you have your health to be able to be both physically and mentally functional, and doing things out there that you enjoy.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe went on to say: \"Maximising our health spans, being healthy as long as possible, is arguably more important than maximising our lifespans.\" Another listener urged people planning for their retirement to think about what structure they want for their life in retirement. They said: \"Routine, purpose and social connection - without those even a healthy pension pot can feel empty.\"\n\nMr Lewis agreed with this sentiment and pointed to four key areas to think about. He said: \"One of the other health span things is social interaction. They say the main things are exercise, sleep, eat well and social interactions. Those are the things that keep you going as you get older.\"\n\nDiscounted rates\n\nOn this topic of keeping fit in your senior years, many older people can get free or discounted memberships at leisure centres and gyms. You may be able to get these through your local council, so it may be worth checking with them to see what is on offer.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThese schemes often apply to people aged 60+ or 65 and over. For example, leisure centre chain Better has a senior membership for people aged 66 and over, offering a \"competitive price\" for access to its gyms, swimming pools and leisure facilities.\n\nOf course, it's also a good idea to make sure your finances are in good health. Those approaching retirement may want to check how much state pension they are eligible for. You can do so using the state pension forecast tool on the Government website.\n\nA key rule change to note when it comes to accessing your state pension is that the age when you can access the DWP benefit is increasing. From April 2026, the access age will move up from the current 66, moving up in stages to reach 67 by April 2028.\n\nArticle continues below"

The vast majority - 123 - were what were classed as community pubs, including many that still rely on drinks sales to survive.\n\nThe number of food-led pubs fell by 56, along with nine high street sites, according to a report from NIQ and CGA intelligence. The NIQ data showed the number of hospitality sites across the UK fell by 382 between September and December, down to 98,914, equivalent to more than four net closures per day. More than 240 restaurants of different types closed in the past three months.\n\nThe Mirror has been championing the industry’s cause with its Your Pub Needs You campaign, calling for support for landlords and the communities they serve.

He also closed it again at the start of last year for a major refurbishment, which included a new kitchen, before reopening it last February.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nSuffolk-based Sheeran previously told how Bertie Blossoms was originally going to be a chicken shop takeaway and had struggled to survive during the health crisis. He admitted: \"I bought a building and I was meant to make it into a fried chicken shop. That fell through and then I thought, what the f*** do I do with this building?\n\n\"And then my manager suggested that we start a pub together and that's literally the reason.\" He added: \"If you're looking to make a small fortune in the food industry you should start with a large fortune. It's one of these things where, unless you're Jamie Oliver or Gordon Ramsay and you have loads of restaurants, it's very difficult.\""

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

No finder's fee, no compensation,’ Rueda allegedly wrote in an email to his publicists at the time.\n\nManny Pacquiao is suing a law firm and their client for allegedly fabricating a case against him\n\nThe message never came to light despite a judge ordering Rueda’s messages be turned over in 2018, and was only uncovered from a forensic analysis by Pacquiao’s team in 2023.\n\nPacquiao’s lawyers say they traced the gruesome texts of body parts back to a mass-distributed cartel scam.\n\nRecords cited by his new lawsuit allegedly show identical threats were sent to more than 100 other people unconnected to the case.\n\nAfter losing the case, Withers Bergman tried to withdraw as Rueda’s lawyers, and his attorney Amman Khan’s profile was removed from the firm’s website.\n\nOver a decade on from their first encounter, Pacquiao is set for a stunning rematch with Mayweather in Las Vegas later this year.\n\nA Hollywood waiter sued Pacquiao in 2016 after claiming he was owed an $8million fee for helping to arrange his blockbuster May 2015 fight against Floyd Mayweather (pictured)\n\nThe fight icons will meet again in September in the first ever boxing match at 'The Sphere' off the strip in Sin City, it was announced earlier this week.\n\nThe bout is set to be globally broadcast on Netflix as part of the streamer's growing investment into live sports.\n\nMayweather, 49, first has to take on Mike Tyson, 59, in an exhibition bout this spring. A date and location has not yet been confirmed.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile Pacquiao, 47, has a warm-up fight against Ruslan Provodnikov on April 18, almost a year after his draw with then-WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios."

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The cameras were forced to cut away before medics attended to the fighter.\n\nReplays show that late in the first round, the two boxers clashed heads, with George coming away dazed and shaken. It appears this was the reason for his sudden fall to the canvas.\n\nThe 36-year-old made it back to his feet following medical attention and was taken to a Detroit hospital to be monitored.

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\n\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

Of course, we welcome him. I think it’s great news because someone like him, with his complete knowledge of the sport and football, can help a club like ours,’ Rubi said.\n\n‘It’s very exciting for the entire club, the city and the province.

I have no doubt about that.’\n\nRonaldo's purchase of UD Almeria comes just over a year after he hinted he would like to own his former club Manchester United\n\nThe 41-year-old, who was named a billionaire by Forbes last year, has offered a glimpse into what the future holds when he eventually hangs up his boots after a glittering career.\n\nWhile the financial terms have not been disclosed, the deal is considered a ‘long-term strategic investment’, according to a report.\n\nRonaldo’s purchase of UD Almeria comes just over a year after he hinted he would like to own his former club, Manchester United.\n\nHis involvement also comes a year after the Spanish second division side were taken over by a Saudi investment group in May 2025.\n\nIt is understood that Ronaldo has a close relationship with the group’s leader, Mohamed Al Khereiji, who is reported to have helped facilitate his move to Al-Nassr in 2022 after his acrimonious exit from Manchester United.\n\nAl Khereiji, UD Almeria club president, said: ‘We are very pleased that Cristiano has chosen our club to invest in.\n\n‘He is regarded as the greatest to ever play the game, he knows the Spanish leagues very well and he understands the potential of what we are building here, both in terms of the team and the academy.’\n\nThe club, which is four years younger than their new owner, currently sit third in Spain’s second division, with one point separating them from league leaders Racing, who have a game in hand.\n\nRonaldo’s investment comes just over a year after he hinted that he would like to buy his former club, Manchester United.\n\n‘(The) Premier League, it’s the most difficult league in the world,’ he said.\n\n‘All the teams are good, all the teams fight, all the teams run, all the teams are strong. Football is different right now. There are no easy games any more.\n\n‘They need, I said this one year and a half ago, and I will continue to say it: the problem is not the coaches, it’s like... I always give this example... it’s like an aquarium.\n\n‘If you have the fish inside and he’s sick and you take him out and you fix the problem and you put him again in an aquarium, he will be sick again.\n\n‘The problem of Manchester United is the same.

It was a bit lively earlier. I don’t have space to express my feelings about that idiot Trump. No show today.\n\n'You’ll be in the capable hands of our colleagues in London. Thoughts & prayers for everyone in our region. Ramadan Kareem.'\n\nHis comment came after the UK government's foreign office had issued a stark warning.\n\n'Due to reported missile attacks, British nationals in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates should immediately shelter in place,' came the instruction.\n\n'Remain indoors in a secure location, avoid all travel and follow instructions from the local authorities.'\n\nRichard Keys was forced off air after Brits abroad were warned to take shelter\n\nSmoke rises in Iran after a bomb strike from the US and Israel with conflict escalating\n\nKeys, who has lived in Qatar for 13 years while working as a presenter for the sports channel, has been told by the network that his contract will not be renewed when it expires at the end of the football season but is still working up until that point.\n\nOn Saturday morning, however, he was unable to take to the airwaves, with the frightening instability in the Middle East causing chaos in the region.\n\nThe US and Israel launched an attack on Iran, with President Donald Trump warning 'major combat operations' are taking place, as they aim for regime change.\n\nIsrael say Iran have launched retaliatory strikes of their own and explosions have been heard in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait.\n\nDoha, the capital of Qatar, is next to largest US airbase in the Middle East at Al Udaid, which could be one of the targets for Iranian strikes.\n\nKeys and beIN are based in Qatar and the presenter made it clear what he thought of the military action, calling Trump an 'idiot'.\n\nIn a video statement to the world, Trump had earlier urged the Iranian people to rise up and topple the clerical government.\n\n'When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations,' he declared.\n\nHe also said the Iranian army would be given 'immunity' if they laid down arms - vowing that they would face 'certain death' if they chose the alternative.\n\nKeys called US president Donald Trump an 'idiot' after he was forced off air\n\nEarlier this year, the Iranian government killed 6,480 during widespread protests against their rule. Trump said the government 'would pay a big price' and promised help is on the way.\n\nThe ramifications of the conflict and possible escalation are still not known but the impact on the region is already significant, with Keys' no-show just a microscopic example.\n\nThe controversial broadcaster and long-time colleague Andy Gray, 70, have resided in Doha since 2013, two years after they both lost their jobs at Sky Sports in the wake of a sexism scandal.\n\nA series of sexist remarks made by Keys and Gray about female assistant referee Sian Massey were picked up and leaked in January 2011 when they thought their microphones were off.\n\nGray was sacked by Sky Sports after a video showing him making inappropriate comments to presenter Charlotte Jackson was released. Keys resigned from his £500,000-a-year role shortly afterwards.\n\nKeys, 68, is set to move in permanently with his 37-year-old wife, Lucie Rose, with whom he has been in a long-distance relationship since they secretly married in a private £20,000 ceremony in Devon in June 2023.\n\nHis son Joshua and daughter Jemma, who was previously one of Lucie Rose's closest friends before her romantic involvement with Keys, did not attend the wedding.\n\nThe presenter split with Julia Keys after 36 years of marriage when news of his shock relationship emerged in 2016, with his ex-wife revealing how the affair 'devastated' her as she recovered from thyroid cancer and also wrecked the lives of their two children.\n\nLucie Rose, above, was previously one of Keys' daughter's best friends before their romance\n\nKeys (centre) pictured with his ex-wife Julia (left) and their daughter Jemma (right)\n\nJulia said the affair ruined the career of her Hollyoaks actress daughter as she spiralled into alcoholism and depression. Jemma also faced legal action over a string of abusive texts she sent to Lucie Rose before charges were dropped by prosecutors.\n\nSince joining beIN Sports, Keys and Gray have fronted coverage of the Premier League and Champions League across 24 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, while also presenting for the network at the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\n\nIt is also claimed that the broadcasting pair could quit live football presenting altogether when they return to the UK.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Richard Keys told the Mail: 'Richard decided some months ago that, after 13 great years, the time had come to leave beIN with Andy. Following his decision it was mutually agreed that his final broadcasts for the channel would be in May this year.'"

            "content": "Inside a private cinema room on the ground floor of a modern apartment block in Canary Wharf, Aaron Wan-Bissaka is enjoying something rarely afforded to professional footballers: a moment of peace and quiet.\n\nIt is his day off. Dressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, he sinks into a plush seat with the same composed demeanour that has defined his game. Afterwards, he says with a smile, the plan is simple: take a nap.\n\nThat understated presence has long shaped Wan-Bissaka’s identity, a player more comfortable letting performances speak for themselves than seeking attention. Now with West Ham after a formative spell at Manchester United, he is in reflective mood, revisiting a journey that has carried him from London estates to Old Trafford and back again.\n\nAs the conversation unfolds, the story is as much about family and sacrifice as it is about football. Long before the bright lights of the Premier League, Wan-Bissaka’s football education began on the patch of grass outside his childhood home.\n\n'I was probably age five when I first fell in love with football,' he says. 'It was just me and my brother in the estate playing around with a ball. We would go out to the green opposite our house to play. We'd call it our Wembley.\n\n'It didn’t really click until around 16, when I realised there was a genuine chance of becoming a professional. That’s when I saw the opportunity to put my foot down and properly chase the dream.'\n\nDressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, Aaron Wan-Bissaka is in reflective mood when he meets Daily Mail Sport\n\nThough Wan-Bissaka grew up idolising Thierry Henry, he has grown into a highly dependable, no-nonsense full back\n\nLike many London kids of his generation, his first football idol was Thierry Henry. 'I always wanted to be him,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'Honestly, I used to have this vision of me being him, and growing up to be that sort of player. He was my idol. I think it was because of his composure. He scored lots of goals but he also carried the team. He was a leader. My whole family were Arsenal fans when I was growing up, too.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s boyhood dream contrasts with his reputation as a no-nonsense defender, and the 28-year-old’s career was ultimately forged through family resilience and a demanding relationship with his father.\n\n'I didn't realise how much my parents were sacrificing for my dream to begin with,' he says. 'When I got into secondary school, which is the age when you start to want things like trainers and boots, I was quite demanding. But they would brush it aside and be like, \"You have to wait a couple of months\". That's when I realised that it wasn't easy for my parents to give me the things I was asking for.\n\n'They worked cleaning jobs to afford my boots and my dad would get in trouble for leaving work early to bring me to training.'\n\nHis father Ambrose’s influence came through discipline rather than praise. 'It was difficult because there was a language barrier between us. His English wasn't great and my French wasn't great so there were only a few words exchanged at times,' recalls Wan-Bissaka, who has now played nine times for the country of his father's birth, DR Congo. They will face either New Caledonia or Jamaica next month in FIFA's inter-confederation play-offs in Zapopan, Mexico, for a place at this summer's World Cup.\n\n'We mainly spoke about football. But he was always critiquing me or telling me what I could do better. It was never praise. I have to say, I found it confusing at the time. I always wondered why he wouldn't praise me. I used to question myself: \"Am I not doing enough?\"'\n\n'Even after I scored, I would come off the pitch and he wouldn't be pleased. I used to just think to myself, \"Is one goal not enough?\" But then as I got older I started to understand it. He just wanted me to test myself and become the best version of myself.'\n\nAfter taking to Premier League life with ease at Crystal Palace, where he won player of the year in his first full season in senior football, a £50million move to United soon followed. It was the biggest step of Wan-Bissaka's career - and one of the most challenging periods of his life.\n\nWan-Bissaka felt extremely homesick after making a big-money move to Manchester United. 'Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep,' he admits\n\nThe defender's positive relationship with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a source of reassurance. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well,' says Wan-Bissaka of his former boss\n\n'When I moved to United, I really missed home, my family and friends especially,' he reveals. 'After training, I used to take the train back to London almost every day. It’s only about two hours, but it’s still a big commitment, and eventually it became exhausting, so I knew I had to stop.\n\n'It was something I wasn’t used to at all. I’d always been comfortable at home in London, surrounded by familiar people and places, so for everything to change overnight was difficult to adapt to. Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep. I struggled. It was probably the lowest I’d felt.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s big-money arrival from Palace in 2019 - which coincided with a first England call-up, though he was never capped due to injury - came with a mountain of expectation. But he quickly became a fixture in the United XI, starting more matches than any player across Europe’s top-five leagues in 2020-21.\n\nHis early relationship with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer offered reassurance amid his struggles off the pitch.\n\n'My relationship with Ole was good from the start,' he recalls. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well, and I think the rest of the players felt the same about him. He’s the kind of manager who backs you straight away. Once he gives you a job to do, it’s up to you to trust yourself and go out and deliver it.'\n\nManagerial turnover would later test that security, particularly under Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag.\n\n'Obviously, it’s football, every manager has their preferences,' he says. 'They might like you or they might not, and that’s just part of the game. When he (Rangnick) came in, it wasn’t the best period for me and there was a lot of criticism around…\n\n'It was difficult when Erik ten Hag arrived - as soon as he did, he told me I wasn’t in his plans. But when I tried to leave, he said he didn’t want me to go. I couldn't understand it. That was tough mentally, because it left me wondering what I was supposed to do next.\n\nWan-Bissaka initially struggled to gel as effectively with Solskjaer's successors, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag\n\nHis relationship with Ten Hag ultimately improved, and the pair lifted the Carabao Cup with United in 2023\n\n'I just kept my head down and told myself to keep training, keep improving, and play my game. Staying motivated was hard though, especially when you’re training without the clear goal of playing.\n\n'But the people around me guided me in the right way and encouraged me to keep going. Eventually things turned around and started to improve. You could say I changed or developed tactically under him, because that was something he wanted.'\n\nClarity, he says, is invaluable. And something the right back received from Michael Carrick. He speaks highly of United's recently-appointed interim boss, praising the simplicity of his messaging during his previous caretaker spell in 2021.\n\nNo wonder, then, that he backs Carrick to be given the permanent job after such an impressive start second time around.\n\n'He's someone you can trust,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'He will also trust you back if you buy into him and what he's looking to do. If you trust him, he will trust you.\n\n'He was quite simple in what he wanted from you. The boys were happy with him and the games he had when he was the manager. With him back at the club now, they are in a good place as a team. I think he should be given the full-time role. I think he deserves it.'\n\nIf Manchester represented pressure and growth, West Ham has provided renewal. The move back to London offered proximity to family and a fresh football environment.\n\nHis impressive form in his debut season saw him named 'Hammer of the Year' in May, beating out fan favourite Jarrod Bowen to the award.\n\nWan-Bissaka opens up to Daily Mail Sport's Charlotte Daly about his career - both the highs and the lows\n\n'At West Ham, I’ve been really happy with how things have been going,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'You can probably tell from the smile on my face'\n\nThough the club have struggled this season - sitting in the relegation zone with 11 games to go, despite an upturn in form under Nuno Espirito Santo - he has no regrets about making the move.\n\n'I was in two minds (about moving initially), to be honest,' he says. 'I had a year left on my contract, but I felt I needed to get back on my feet and start playing regularly - not just every couple of games.\n\n'Looking back on my time at Manchester United, I’m grateful for it. Those experiences made me who I am today and helped me both on and off the pitch, especially mentally.\n\n'With all the noise and scrutiny at a club like United, a change of environment can make a big difference. At West Ham, it’s not as intense… I’ve been really happy with how things have been going. You can probably tell from the smile on my face every day. I am playing with a smile too.'"

            "content": "IRELAND head coach Andy Farrell is entitled to feel a degree of bemusement around the punditry and coverage of this Six Nations campaign.\n\nDespite the considerable credit he had built up over the years, there was a fair whack of criticism flung his way following the opening night hammering in France, including justifiable question marks over his long-term planning and loyalty to the old guard.\n\nBut Farrell got little credit when he then ripped up the script with his team selection to face Italy, leaving out established frontliners and rolling the dice on promising newcomers. The result was a surge of energy through the Ireland squad.\n\nA SENSE OF JEOPARDY\n\nAll of a sudden, there was a genuine sense of jeopardy, a brutal realisation that, no matter how big your reputation or how storied your career, if you do not perform to the standards expected, you are out.\n\nIcon: Andy Farrell is adored by Irish rugby supporters but the Ireland head coach was on the receiving end of heavy criticism after two games of this Six Nations Championship\n\nThis had not been the case previously on Farrell’s watch, with the general policy revolving around running the same established names almost regardless of form, an approach that persevered even after the 2023 World Cup failure.\n\nIt was a defiant change of direction, an era-altering policy shift, yet it was largely dismissed as ‘rotation’ for the perceived lesser challenge of facing the Italians at home.\n\nFor some, this correspondent included, the subsequent victory over Italy was hugely positive.\n\nYes, there were lots of errors and areas to improve in a win that could be more readily described as ‘nervy’ than ‘convincing’, but Italy are a decent side now and Ireland digging themselves out of a hole with a bunch of new faces catching the eye was a major plus.\n\nOn the front foot: Farrell did not get enough recognition for his bold selection calls against Italy\n\nOr so we thought…\n\nIt quickly became apparent that this was a minority opinion as the widespread reaction across was doom and gloom – with little recognition of what Farrell was, belatedly, trying to do in terms of widening options.\n\n‘TERMINAL DECLINE’\n\nPhrases like ‘terminal decline’ and ‘irreversible recession’ abounded after the Italy game and the general consensus was that Ireland’s efforts to extricate themselves from the deep trough they now found themselves in ‘could take years’.\n\nIt took Farrell a week.\n\nWhen he reinstated a clutch of his tried-and-trusted for the (on paper) daunting trip to Twickenham, they returned to a side re-energised by the Italy reshuffle and ruthlessly determined to prove their worth, driven by the unsettling knowledge that their places were no longer guaranteed.\n\nThe result was a performance of ferocious intensity that proved far too much for a brittle England side, still assailed with doubt after their shock Murrayfield humiliation.\n\nToo much: Ireland played with far greater intensity than England in their Twickenham win\n\nIt was a euphoric occasion for Irish rugby and, suddenly, the same heads who had been talking about the dark days being here to stay, did a 180 with frothy talk of ‘rebirth’ and ‘rejuvenation’.\n\nThere is a tendency in modern media – driven by the internet’s insatiable demand for clip-worthy reaction, and over-reaction – to get mired in the immediate.\n\nThere is also a lemming-like, ‘we are all individuals’ aspect to rugby analysis where nearly everyone dives frantically for the consensus and starts parrotting the same phrase du jour along the way.\n\nThis month it was ‘intent’ after Farrell questioned the lack of it from his players following their Paris pummelling.\n\nAs soon as he said it, the word ‘intent’ was being sprinkled excitedly across Irish rugby analysis, as though pundits had been gifted a secret sauce to use at will.\n\nEuphoria: Caelan Doris and Tadhg Beirne celebrate at the final whistle in Twickenham\n\nFarrell must be shaking his head at it all.\n\nNow, post Twickenham, the analysis has shifted to the head coach’s next career move, with stories linking Farrell to a return to his old haunt of Saracens in English rugby on a whopping €1.2million contract.\n\nThis has led to a cacophony of calls for Farrell to be handed an extended Ireland contract to keep at the helm for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnother knee-jerk, instant reaction to breaking events when it would be better to step back and assess the overall picture.\n\nTHE PENNY FINALLY DROPS\n\nFarrell’s time with Ireland has been a remarkable story of progression and success – with the obvious exception of the World Cup.\n\nAnd now, finally, it appears as though the penny has dropped and he is viewing everything through the prism of next year’s World Cup – because the rhetoric from Farrell, and his assistants, is radically different to what we have heard before.\n\nAfter the 2023 disappointment, it was ‘as we were’ with the message that the ‘journey continues’ and, while Farrell oversaw a thumping win over France in Marseille and landed a Six Nations, it all seemed a little ‘after the Lord Mayor’s show’.\n\nThis Six Nations feels a whole lot different, the right attitude seems to have been adopted (namely that this tournament is a means to a World Cup end) as Ireland continue to assess options for down the road.\n\nEven in the euphoria of the win over England last weekend, Farrell impressed hugely with his calm, bigger picture observations.\n\nMindset shift: Farrell has realised the need to look down the road and broaden his options\n\n‘I didn’t care whether we won or lost today, just whether we grew as a group because we know where we want to go,’ he said afterwards.\n\nIrish rugby has been waiting to hear those words from a head coach for 15 years.\n\nThe message, and mind shift, appears to have been embraced by everyone in camp, based on Johnny Sexton’s observations when asked about the contest for his old No 10 jersey between Jack Crowley, Sam Prendergast, Harry Byrne and Ciaran Frawley.\n\n‘All the criticism from previous World Cup cycles is that we did not develop guys and we have relied too heavily on one player in some positions,’ said Sexton, referencing the over-dependence on his own role at the 2015, 2019 and 2023 World Cups.\n\n‘So, we are doing it a different way now.’\n\nAmen to that.\n\nTHE LAST DANCE\n\nWhatever way you look at it, Farrell has been a phenomenally good coach for Ireland since coming on board as Joe Schmidt’s defensive coordinator in 2016.\n\nBy the time of the World Cup in Australia next year, the Englishman will have been 11 years working for the IRFU and living in this country, where he and his family are known to be very happily settled.\n\nHowever, every coach, no matter how talented, popular or successful they are, has a shelf life, and when his contract expires next year, it feels like a natural conclusion to this Irish rugby chapter.\n\nThe concern is that, if the IRFU were to make that decision and announce it later this year, there is the danger of Farrell becoming a ‘lame duck’ coach.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that this is what happened to Joe Schmidt in 2019 after Farrell was announced as the Kiwi’s successor a year out.\n\nThe New Zealander, who had been the most influential and transformative head coach in Irish rugby history up to that point, had difficulties selling his message in his final year as players began to gravitate towards his successor.\n\nHowever, there is less chance of that happening this time around.\n\nFor Farrell and the core of the squad he has been loyal to over the past five years, it’s ‘Last Dance’ time – the final chance to crack the World Cup code.\n\nThat incentive would be hugely motivating and more than enough to keep Farrell and the likes of Tadhg Furlong, Andrew Porter, Tadhg Beirne, Josh van der Flier, Jamison Gibson-Park and Garry Ringrose right on message through to the conclusion of Australia 2027.\n\nDown and out: Eddie O'Sullivan was given a new deal prior to the 2007 World Cup only for a highly-rated Ireland side to crash out at the pool stages with the coach gone not long after\n\nThe alternative approach, and one that has widespread support, is to hand Farrell another deal to keep him on board for yet another World Cup cycle – but Ireland have been burned this way before, most famously in 2007.\n\nThat summer, prior to the World Cup in France, the IRFU extended Eddie O’Sullivan’s contract and when the announcement was made to the squad, the story goes that, rather than the standing ovation which had been possibly expected, there was an awkward shuffling of feet and half-hearted murmurings of congratulations.\n\nIt was reflective of a bubbling desire for change, amid fringe frustration at O’Sullivan’s loyalty-driven selection policy, and when Ireland crashed horribly at that tournament, there was an enormous backlash against the contract extension and the head coach was gone within a matter of months.\n\nThere are obvious differences between the O’Sullivan landscape then and Farrell’s now – not least the English man’s focus on keeping a happy camp.\n\nBut, when you look at how a Farrell contract extension plays out, it does not make much sense.\n\nIf Ireland did manage to finally have a successful World Cup and reach a first semi-final or go further, it would be a tough mental challenge to start from scratch again on yet another four-year cycle, especially with the complication of the Lions tour to New Zealand in 2029 which Farrell is known to be keen to lead.\n\nAlternatively, if Ireland bombed out yet again at the quarter-final stage, or earlier, there would be a massive outcry for change and Farrell’s position would surely be untenable, regardless of past achievements.\n\nSuccession plan: Ronan O'Gara would be the ideal man to take over from Farrell next year\n\nFar better to take the ‘Last Dance’ approach, confirm Farrell’s departure after the World Cup, announce his replacement – ideally Ronan O’Gara – and pour everything into going out on a high.\n\nPERFECT ENDING\n\nAs for Farrell’s next move, he is not short of options. Saracens have hotly denied any approach or €1.2m contract offer but those words can be taken with a large dollop of salt – this is Sarries we are talking about, after all.\n\nEngland would also appear a highly plausible option; the RFU blazers watching Farrell’s team dismantle Steve Borthwick’s side in Twickenham last weekend would surely have been thinking how to break the bank to get the proud Englishman back on board – and few here could quibble if they did.\n\nWhatever happens, the good news for Ireland is that Farrell appears to have got his focus back in a big way following the drift post-2023.\n\nThat bodes extremely well for next year and what better way for Ireland’s greatest coach to step off the stage than by ending this 40-year World Cup hoodoo?\n\nThe perfect ending."

A report in The Guardian this week claimed the 29-year-old is keen to return to United's starting XI once his loan comes to an end in May.\n\nAnd his countryman Geremi has shed light on Onana's state of mind.\n\nAndre Onana is eager to fight for his place in United's starting XI when his loan spell ends\n\nSpeaking to Telecom Asia via The Sun, Geremi said: 'Listen, I know Andre very well and during his time at United there were a lot of things that were not right.\n\n'It wasn't just him. And believe me, with the arrival of Michael Carrick, things are looking good for everyone, including him.\n\n'He is clearly talented and his gifts are rare. The next thing is for him to go back there and fight for his spot.\n\n'Andre has always excelled when faced with a challenge. He thrives when he's given a fair chance to prove himself.'\n\nThe former Chelsea star added that football's biggest clubs need big characters, and says Andre needs that same mentality to thrive at United.\n\nHe said: 'In my career I enjoyed playing in teams with big ambitions and big personalities.\n\n'If I had a few bad games, there was always someone knocking on the manager's door asking for a chance.\n\n'That meant I had to stand up, be counted and not walk away.\n\nHis replacement, Senne Lammens, has seriously impressed since joining the Red Devils\n\n'But that is for Andre to decide.'\n\nShould Carrick stay at the club beyond this season, Onana will have to seriously impress to dislodge Lammens from the team.\n\nAfter the Everton win, Carrick said of the Belgian: 'You want a goalkeeper to be reliable, trustworthy and, instead of creating the chaos, you want him to take the chaos away and calm things down.\n\n\n\n'I think Senne is that. He's quite quiet at times and unassuming but he's got a real steeliness. To step in, it's a big role – for some.'"

Wives and girlfriends – better known as WAGs – are constantly fighting to prove they are more than just trophy wives.\n\nThey are persistently put in a box, and it's not one that they always enjoy. Yes, WAGs are known for what their husbands do on the football pitch, but they have their own lives too.\n\nTake Victoria Beckham, for example. A megastar in the music world, winning five Brit Awards with the Spice Girls. She was, and still is, far from just 'David's wife'; she has her own uber-successful career in her own right.\n\nNot only this, but being the partner of a professional player who is constantly travelling around the country, or even the world, to do their job, can feel very lonely. Louise Redknapp once stated that she felt 'invisible' at times while married to former Tottenham and Liverpool star Jamie, and ultimately, the pair got divorced in 2017.\n\nIt's fair to say that being a WAG is not always as glamorous as it looks.\n\nLisa Muller, who is married to Bayern Munich legend Thomas Muller, has now opened up on how she gets treated being the wife of one of German football's greatest-ever forwards. Spoiler alert: it's not all sunshine and rainbows.\n\nThomas Muller's wife Lisa (right) has claimed she no longer cares what people think of her\n\nLisa, 36, has a somewhat successful sporting career herself as a professional dressage rider, winning a variety of competitions, including the Stuttgart Masters in 2019.\n\nOver the years, though, as her husband racked up a series of accolades, people often saw her as just his wife, not as the athlete she is.\n\nThis used to frustrate her hugely, and she would often feel the need to prove herself to banish those views from people's minds. These days, though, she places no value on what people think and just lives her life.\n\nSpeaking at a campaign event via Bild, Lisa said: 'At first, I tried for a long time to fight against it and say: I'm more than that, I can ride. Now I don't care anymore.'\n\nThomas and Lisa met in 2007, while the former was still in the Bayern academy, looking to make a name for himself.\n\nThey were only 18 years of age when they first came across each other, but they didn't hang back, getting married only two years later.\n\nThe majority of the Mullers' marriage has been spent in Bavaria, where Thomas spent 17 years playing for the Bundesliga's most successful club, and Lisa regularly rides.\n\nHowever, the dynamic of their marriage changed due to Thomas's move to MLS side Vancouver Whitecaps. Lisa opted to stay in Germany despite the move, with the pair now living 5,200 miles and over a 10-hour flight apart.\n\nShe continued: 'As an athlete, he knows how much I live for my sport. As an athlete, I know how much he lives for his.\n\n'The decision to continue working on two continents wasn't easy for us. We wouldn't leave our stud farm unattended for a year.'\n\nLisa has always made it clear that she won't throw away her career by moving away from Germany, just because of potential opportunities for Muller.\n\nLisa has her own successful career as a dressage rider and she also owns a farm with Thomas\n\nShe has too much going on in her homeland. Not only does she regularly ride and work at her own stables, but alongside Thomas, she has a rather interesting entrepreneurial venture.\n\nThe couple own a company called EU Insemination Station, a breeding farm for their horses, and it's fair to say it brings in a more than healthy amount of money on the side.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, rumours were ramping up that Thomas was close to joining Manchester United from Bayern, which would have been a huge move at the time. However, Louis van Gaal has since said that Lisa blocked the move due to her desire to stay in Bavaria.\n\nVan Gaal said of Lisa's involvement: 'In 2015, it would have been possible if his wife had been a little more open to a transfer abroad.\n\n'At least that was the reason Thomas gave my assistant Marcel Bout, who had had all the conversations with him, why the transfer had been rejected.'\n\nOutside of riding, Lisa is trying to expand her horizons, challenging herself by getting involved in politics in Germany.\n\nLast year, Lisa, who hails from the Miesbach district, is now part of the Christian Social Union party and has completed an internship with the Bavarian State Parliament. She was even asked if she would consider running as a candidate for their next election.\n\nHowever, she declined because, in her own words, she was ‘too much of a chicken'.\n\nDespite all of this, Lisa still feels there are people who downplay her intellect before even having a conversation with her.\n\nLisa has always made it clear that she won't throw away her career by moving away from Germany\n\n'It's sometimes quite amusing,' she added. 'I'm always considered the dumbest person in the room.\n\n'Sometimes it's nice to be considered the silly one, then you can impress people more when they talk to you.'\n\nPolitics will continue to play a big part in Lisa's life moving forward, even when Thomas inevitably moves back from his venture across the pond.\n\n'The CSU is my political home,' she has told Antenne Bayern radio station, and in the future she may just turn from party member to candidate.\n\nThen there can't be anybody who can call her the so-called 'dumbest in the room'."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Now 30 years since the Dallas Cowboys' last Super Bowl appearance, owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he has let the fans down with his team's championship drought.\n\n\"I really can't accept just the thought of winning one Super Bowl and then what?\" Jones said Friday night from the NFL scouting combine. \"I've got more time on my clock than that in my mind. And so I don't see it that way. I see a chance to put a team together and basically be knocking at the edge and get another one or get a chance at a another one.\n\n\"It runs that way in my view. ... Make no mistake about it now, if you told me I could, because I've done a lot of hitchhiking in my life. ... I'd start here with you right now and hitchhike back to Dallas to win a Super Bowl.\"\n\nAfter a 7-9-1 finish in 2025, Jones promised change. One change will be the team's approach to free agency.\n\nThe Cowboys have not relied heavily on free agency in years, choosing to pick their spots to shore up holes on the roster with cost-effective players.\n\n\"I would bet that we will spend more money in free agency than we have,\" Jones said.\n\nTo do so, the Cowboys will first have to create salary cap room. Well over the $301.2 million cap that was set Friday, they will restructure the contracts of quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and left guard Tyler Smith, which will create $66 million of room.\n\nJones said the Cowboys will rework the contracts of defensive tackles Kenny Clark, Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa, who are scheduled to count around $63 million against the cap. With Clark and Williams, the Cowboys can look to add voidable years to their contracts then restructure that way.\n\n\"I want you to know that the only way to push more [out] is for me to go borrow some of my future, OK?\" Jones said. \"Expect me to go borrow some of my future.\"\n\nTo Jones, it goes beyond his personal Super Bowl wishes.\n\n\"I look at where we are with Dak and I look at where he is in his career. And I look at some of the pluses that we have on our front and what we think we can do there. And what we can do with [George] Pickens and Lamb and what we can do with our running back that we just signed [Javonte Williams],\" Jones said. \"And so all of those things I want to do everything we possibly can to stop somebody and to basically win some third downs more than we did last year. And so I think that would be the area that you would see me bust the budget. Where you would see me do that is what we're doing defensively.\n\n\"And I would expect anybody that's a Cowboy fan or a critic of the Cowboys to say, 'Duh, that's not hard to see, Jerry, to do.' But I guess what I'm doing is saying, yes, I intend to do that if given the opportunity.\"\n\nThe Cowboys defense finished at or near the bottom of the league in yards and points allowed in 2025. Christian Parker has been hired as the new defensive coordinator, and Jones acknowledged the need for more than just one or two new players, while also saying players that were on the defense in 2025 will be better in 2026 \"because the situation has changed.\"\n\nWith two first-round picks, the Cowboys have an opportunity to add more talent to their defense. Jones would not rule out the possibility of making trades, like the additions of Williams from the New York Jets and Clark from the Green Bay Packers for Micah Parsons.\n\n\"I don't know that I'd expect it but we have the ammunition to be good at it,\" Jones said. \"And I wouldn't hesitate to be good at it if it will help our team and help the timeline that we're talking about.\"\n\nNow 83, Jones was introspective at times during the hourlong meeting with reporters. His resolve to win a championship is strong.\n\n\"It's every bit the prize of anything I have, with the exception of family and your love for family,\" Jones said. \"I guess what I would say is make no mistake about it, I don't have a higher priority than to go and win a Super Bowl.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- After Denver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic tumbled to the Paycom Center court early in the fourth quarter Friday night, he determined that he needed to react to what he considered a dirty tactic by Oklahoma City Thunder guard Luguentz Dort.\n\nA chippy game between rivals who faced off in a seven-game series in last season's Western Conference semifinals escalated into a heated confrontation at that point, resulting in Dort's ejection and double technical fouls on Jokic and Oklahoma City center Jaylin Williams.\n\nThe fracas began when Dort appeared to trip Jokic as he ran up the court with 8:03 remaining in the fourth quarter. Dort backed into Jokic and stuck out his right foot, knocking down the big man, who quickly pounced to his feet to angrily confront Dort.\n\n\"It's an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction,\" Jokic said after the Nuggets' 127-121 overtime loss to the defending champions. \"There is no such thing -- I think there's not supposed to be those things on a basketball floor. So, it was just an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction by me.\"\n\nAfter Jokic chest-bumped Dort, Williams rushed over to intervene. Jokic and Williams exchanged shoves and grabbed each other's jerseys as a scrum of players, coaches, officials and staffers formed around them and eventually separated them.\n\n\"Just competing,\" Williams told ESPN. \"Two teams competing, that's it. That's all I got.\"\n\nAfter a review, the foul called against Dort was upgraded to a flagrant foul 2, resulting in an automatic ejection. Crew chief James Williams told a pool reporter that the officials \"deemed [Dort's] contact on Jokic to be unnecessary and excessive with a high potential for injury.\" Williams also cited the contact leading to an \"altercation that did not dissolve\" as a reason for upgrading it to a flagrant foul 2.\n\n\"I will say this: If [Williams] is running up the floor and gets tripped, we expect a flagrant 2 from this point forward,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \"That's all. If that's the precedent, if that becomes a malicious play and flagrant 2 is the line in the sand on that, we would expect that if it's [Williams]. We would expect that if it's anybody. And if that's the case, we're good.\"\n\nAsked if he believed the play was ruled a flagrant 2 because the foul was committed against a three-time MVP, Daigneault said: \"No, I'm not going to answer the question like that. I said what I needed to say about it.\"\n\nNuggets star Nikola Jokic confronts Thunder guard Luguentz Dort, who was called for a flagrant foul 2 after an apparent trip in the fourth quarter. Jokic and OKC's Jaylin Williams received technical fouls. Photo by Joshua Gateley/Getty Images\n\nThe referees determined that the actions of Jokic and Jaylin Williams during the altercation did not rise to the level of an ejection, James Williams said in the pool report.\n\nThe fracas overshadowed the return of reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had 36 points on 12-of-29 shooting and dished out nine assists in 34 minutes. Gilgeous-Alexander sat out the overtime period because he had reached his minutes limit after missing the previous nine games because of an abdominal strain suffered Feb. 3.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was called for a technical foul in the first quarter when he responded to Jokic's post-whistle contact by throwing the ball at him. James Williams told the pool reporter that Jokic was not called for a technical on that play because the officials determined that his contact with his left forearm did not rise to the level of an unsportsmanlike act.\n\n\"They're obviously a high-level team, we're a high-level team, and we've seen each other a lot in the past couple of years, so we might be a little bit more into the game just because we know the opponent,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"It was fun. It was good out there. End-of-season basketball is like that. It's that chippy, that physical, so it was good to get one of those in the regular season.\"\n\nThe Nuggets fell to 4-7 since Jokic returned from a monthlong absence, including 1-6 in clutch games (within five points in the final five minutes) during that span. Jokic recorded his league-leading 22nd triple-double with 23 points, 17 rebounds and 14 assists against the Thunder, but his uncharacteristic recent shooting struggles continued, as he went 9-of-25 from the floor and 2-of-10 from 3-point range.\n\nJokic, who was 3-of-5 from the free throw line, animatedly protested no-calls after several of his shots. There were also multiple instances of Jokic bumping and shoving with Thunder players during the game.\n\n\"I think his frustration is sometimes because the game's officiated differently out on the floor than it is near the basket, and I think he was reacting to what was being done to him,\" Nuggets coach David Adelman said. \"And his reaction's not going to be to cower away. He's competitive. ... I know why he's frustrated. I can feel his frustration with all the contact out there. He shot five free throws.\n\n\"It's just part of the game. The closer you get to the basket, it seems like for a bigger guy, it seems like it's called a little bit different, but he has to react to that the right way. Concentrate and finish through contact. And obviously with Dort's play, I think that took it to a different level for him. He felt like it was malicious, also.\"\n\nThe Nuggets and Thunder meet again March 9 in Oklahoma City."

Including the playoffs, it was the club's third-highest percentage in a game in the shot clock era (since 1954-55), behind 67.9% in 1984 and 67.0% in 1990, according to ESPN Research.\n\nThe Celtics also shot 64.7% from the 3-point line Friday, which equated to an 80.8% effective field goal percentage -- the highest in the shot clock era. Effective field goal percentage measures shooting efficiency by adjusting for the fact that 3-pointers are worth more than two-point shots\n\nAll-Star Jaylen Brown led the way, finishing with 28 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. But he got plenty of support from his teammates, with trade deadline acquisition Nikola Vucevic adding 28 points and 11 rebounds for his third double-double as a member of the Celtics.\n\n\"I thought we just did a good job reading the game,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"I thought we made the right reads throughout most of the entire game. I thought tonight Vooch really looked comfortable in his offensive reads and his offensive screening. He unlocked a lot of stuff for us.\"\n\nAll 13 Celtics players scored, with Boston committing only three turnovers after halftime.\n\n\"We just try to read the game and take what's there,\" Brown said.\n\nBoston, winners of five of its six games since the All-Star break, will wait to see if Sunday night's home matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers will mark the return of Tatum.\n\nThe game, originally scheduled to be played earlier in the day, was moved by NBC into an 8 p.m. ET prime-time slot, creating speculation it could signal Tatum's plan to return.\n\nIt's been 41 weeks since Tatum ruptured his right Achilles tendon in May in the waning minutes of the Celtics' loss to the New York Knicks in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe Celtics are required by the NBA to release an initial injury report by 5 p.m. ET on Saturday ahead of Sunday's home game against the 76ers.\n\nAfter practicing with the Celtics' G League team two weeks ago, Tatum said he hadn't decided whether he would return.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that I'm coming back or I'm not, it's just following the plan. So it's just another step,\" Tatum said. \"I don't know percentage. I just know I feel a little bit better every day. I just try to focus on that.\"\n\nTatum said in the same interview that he is also mindful of not wanting to disrupt the progress of a Celtics team that at 39-20 sits in second place in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\n\"I'm just hyper aware of what's going on. I think it would just stem from that. Obviously, I know what I bring to the table and bring to the team. But I'm also aware that these guys have been playing extremely well,\" Tatum said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

(1:49)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nKALAMAZOO, Mich. -- Trey Perry scored on a driving layup with a second remaining, and No. 21 Miami of Ohio rallied to beat Western Michigan 69-67 on Friday night to extend its season-opening winning streak to 29 games.\n\nThe RedHawks (16-0 Mid-American Conference) remain the only undefeated team in Division I men's basketball. Miami extended the best start in program history and added to its school record for wins in a season. Miami also boasts the best start and longest win streak in MAC annals.\n\nMiami is also just the fourth Division I team in the past 20 years to enter March unbeaten, according to ESPN Research. The previous three (2013-14 Wichita State, 2014-15 Kentucky and 2020-21 Gonzaga) all remained unbeaten heading into the NCAA tournament.\n\nPeter Suder scored 18 points for the RedHawks before fouling out with just over seven minutes remaining. Almar Atlason added 16 points, Perry finished with 14 and Eian Elmer 10.\n\nJayden Brewer led Western Michigan (10-19, 4-12) with 19 points and 11 rebounds. Justice Williams and EJ Ryans each added 14 points.\n\nMiami is used to playing close games and won for the seventh time this season by fewer than six points.\n\n\"Our grouip is unflappabe,\" Miami coach Travis Steele said. \"It's calm, cool and collected. It's very, very even the entire time, even during tight moments.\"\n\nThe RedHawks trailed 30-26 at the half and fell behind by eight points twice early in the second half before tying the score at 49-49 with 11:02 remaining.\n\nWestern Michigan ran off eight straight points for a 57-49 advantage with 8:40 remaining and led 59-50 with 6:38 left before Miami chipped away and moved ahead 66-65 on a layup by Antwone Woolfolk with 14 seconds left.\n\nElmer's free throw with 37 seconds remaining gave the RedHawks a 67-65 edge, but Western Michigan tied it with 11 seconds left on a basket by Williams before Perry made the winner.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe Women's National Basketball Players Association submitted a new counterproposal to the WNBA on Friday evening with some concessions on revenue share and housing, a source familiar with the collective bargaining negotiations told ESPN.\n\nIn the new CBA proposal, the players' union is asking for players to receive 26% of gross revenue (defined as revenue before deducting expenses) over the lifetime of the agreement, with the salary cap in Year 1 of the deal (about $9.5 million) unchanged from its previous offer.\n\nThe revenue share split is down from 27.5% of gross revenue as proposed in the WNBPA's Feb. 17 proposal, a change that a source said amounts to nearly $100 million in reductions on revenue share.\n\nThe new proposal also contains tweaks to the union's housing offerings: Previously, the players asked that teams continue to provide housing to players in the first several years of the new deal, but that in later years, teams will no longer be obligated to provide it for players making at least 80% of the maximum salary, on multiyear deals and receiving full salary protection.\n\nIn the new proposal, the union struck the multiyear component and lowered the salary threshold to 75% at which players would no longer be obligated to receive team-provided housing.\n\nThe two sides are still negotiating the years of service limit for developmental players -- a new feature of this CBA with each team now expected to have two developmental player spots. The union is now proposing a years of service limit of six after originally asking for no experience limit for those players, a source said, whereas the league's latest proposal suggested a limit of four or five years of service based on minutes played.\n\nThe WNBPA's counterproposal comes one week after the league submitted one of its own. That Feb. 20 league proposal guaranteed housing for all players in 2026 before being phased out in subsequent years of the deal. Players on their applicable minimum salary and those with zero years of service would be provided a one-bedroom apartment in 2027 and 2028 only, and developmental players would be provided studio apartments for the entirety of the deal.\n\nBut the two sides are still far apart on the issue of revenue sharing, including proposing different revenue sharing systems: The WNBA has held firm in its proposals, with players being offered on average over 70% of net revenue (revenue after deducting expenses), which would amount to less than 15% of gross revenue. The 2026 salary cap would come in at $5.65 million (up from $1.5 million in 2025) and in subsequent years would grow in line with revenue growth.\n\nThe league's proposal features maximum salaries, including revenue sharing payouts, amounting to nearly $1.3 million in 2026 and projecting to approach $2 million in 2031. The supermax in 2025 came in at $249,000. The average player salary, including revenue sharing, would be projected to reach $540,000 in 2026 and $780,000 by 2031, up from $120,000 in 2025.\n\nThe WNBA publicly struck down the WNBPA's previous proposal as \"unrealistic\" and \"caus[ing] hundreds of millions of dollars of losses for our teams.\" A source familiar with the negotiations told ESPN the league projected that Feb. 17 plan would result in losses of $460 million over the lifetime of the agreement, though the union has maintained its revenue sharing model would still put the league in a \"profitable position,\" another source said.\n\nEarlier this week, the league gave its teams and the WNBPA a target date of March 10 to complete a term sheet, or else the schedule for the 2026 season might be impacted."

The announcement means that former champion Alex Pereira, who has shown interest in moving up to heavyweight, has vacated the belt.\n\nWhite did not comment on Pereira's title reign ending.

He challenged Pereira for the belt twice, in 2023 and 2024, losing both times via second-round knockout. Since his second loss to Pereira, Prochazka has recorded back-to-back finishes against Jamahal Hill and Khalil Rountree Jr.\n\nUlberg (13-1), who lives and trains out of New Zealand, has been steadily working up the light heavyweight ranks since he signed with the UFC in 2020.

            "content": "AUBURN, Calif. -- Former MLB pitcher Daniel Serafini was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 2021 shooting of his wife's parents during a burglary at their home by Lake Tahoe, authorities said.\n\nSerafini, 51, was convicted in July 2025 of first-degree murder of his father-in-law, Gary Spohr; attempted murder of his mother-in-law, Wendy Wood; and first-degree burglary. Spohr was killed, and Wood survived, though she died a year after the shooting.\n\nPlacer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said in a statement Friday that Spohr and Wood were loving grandparents and that Serafini's crimes greatly impacted family members and friends.\n\n\"The impact of this attack has extended far beyond the immediate victims, deeply affecting family members and the broader community, and highlighting the lasting harm caused by deliberate violence,\" Gire said.\n\nSerafini's attorney did not return requests for comment.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Serafini addressed the court and maintained his innocence, according to MyNews4. He said he was out partying with his wife the night of the shooting and described himself as a \"broken, imperfect man that makes mistakes.\"\n\nSerafini was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 1992. In a career spanning 11 years, the left-hander played for the Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies.\n\nProsecutors said Serafini hated his wife's wealthy parents and was heard saying he was willing to pay $20,000 to have them killed, according to the Sacramento Bee. Prosecutors showed jurors transcripts of angry emails and text messages between Serafini and his in-laws.\n\nDuring the six-week trial, Serafini's attorney, David Dratman, argued that there was no physical evidence linking his client to the crime scene. Dratman told the jury that although Serafini had a rocky relationship with his in-laws, he did not have a motive to kill them.\n\nAfter his conviction, Serafini filed multiple motions for a new trial, but those were denied.\n\nSerafini will serve his sentence at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the Placer County District Attorney's Office."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

It is something that is ongoing,” he added.\n\nThe NPA CEO first signalled this approach at the New Year School and Conference in January 2026, confirming his leadership of the Steering Committee tasked with addressing infrastructure challenges and enabling effective deployment of the 24-hour economy in the petroleum downstream industry.\n\nAccording to Tamakloe, the policy is projected to create up to 1.7 million jobs over four years, stimulating economic activity and raising living standards through continuous productivity.\n\nHis comments follow President Mahama’s signing of the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill into law on February 19, 2026, which established a coordinating body for the policy.\n\nCritics, including NPP communicators like Dennis Miracles Aboagye, had described the law as a bureaucratic shell.\n\nTamakloe pushed back, stressing that the authority is meant to provide sector-specific roadmaps, not top-down directives.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Director of Communications for the Bawumia Campaign Team has accused the National Democratic Congress (NDC) government of avoiding responsibility for the everyday challenges facing Ghanaians, despite improvements in key economic indicators.\n\nSpeaking on Newsfile on JoyNews on Saturday, February 28, during a discussion on the 2026 State of the Nation Address, Dennis Miracles Aboagye said the true state of the nation goes beyond headline macroeconomic figures.\n\n“I think the state of the nation is just the aggregation of every person within the state. And so if you have the majority of the elements within the state not doing so well, that is what will tell on the state.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the country’s macroeconomic performance over the past year has been strong.\n\n“The macroeconomic performance in the last one year is without doubt. There was no debate about that,” he said.\n\n“The fact that we’ve seen unprecedented improvement in inflation, never seen before. I doubt even first-world countries see this kind of macroeconomic improvement in such a short period.”\n\nHe also pointed to the strength of the cedi, saying, “The fact that we’ve seen some very heavy strength from our currency, it’s without doubt,” he said.\n\nHowever, Mr Aboagye questioned the sustainability of the gains and what is driving them.\n\n“The details as to whether it’s sustainable, based on what is driving it, is another conversation. It’s time for the government to actually sit back and be honest with themselves,” he said.\n\nHe called on the government to clearly explain the source of the improvement.\n\n\"First of all, you need to begin to tell the Ghanaian people what is driving this improvement. So that, should anything go wrong, which we are not praying for, you don’t come back with excuses.”\n\nAccording to him, Ghana’s recent stability is largely tied to high international gold prices.\n\n“We’ve always made a point about gold, and we’ve said that if gold is what is driving us, then we are in trouble. Because we don’t control it. One single thing is what has driven us to where we are now. High international market price for gold,” he said.\n\nHe warned that over-reliance on a single commodity leaves the economy exposed.\n\n“Tomorrow, should gold drop to 2,000 dollars, can we survive?” he asked.\n\nMr Aboagye also referred to the cocoa sector, suggesting that external market forces can quickly reverse gains.\n\nHe said comments attributed to a government official about giving cocoa farmers a “haircut” to prevent economic collapse show how fragile the situation could be.\n\nWhile conceding that some Ghanaians have benefited from the improved indicators, he said that the impact has been limited.\n\n“I have said it here that the government’s performance in the last one year has benefited, in my view, some 10 to 15 per cent of the population,” he claimed.\n\nHe explained that those who directly import goods and require foreign exchange have benefited significantly.\n\n“The person who imports directly and needs forex benefited big time. The person who pays anything in dollars benefited. Who drives to the fuel station to buy fuel for their vehicle, plant, or machinery benefited.”\n\nHowever, he said the ordinary commuter has not felt the same relief.\n\n“The person joining the trotro also hasn’t. That is where the issue comes in,” he said.\n\nHe cited data suggesting that between 75 and 80 per cent of residents in Accra rely on commercial transport. According to him, the limited supply of vehicles has pushed up fares and made commuting more difficult.\n\n“Today, people have to wake up at 3:00 a.m. so they can get to work at 8:30 a.m., which they are late anyway. And they have to leave the office at 5:00,” he said.\n\nMr Aboagye said that economic management should ultimately improve the daily lives of citizens.\n\n“What is macroeconomy without its positive impact on micro?” he asked. “The whole essence of macroeconomic management is the output on the microeconomy.”\n\n“If you drive your macroeconomic indicators to the best of numbers and your micro is not positively affected, you’ve done nothing,” he said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Al-Hassan Kodwo Baidoo\n\nIn many contemporary households, economic pressures, long work hours, and increasing social commitments have reshaped parenting patterns. A growing notion suggests that as long as parents provide financially and pay school fees, the responsibility of grooming children rests primarily with schools.\n\nConsequently, some children spend over 12 hours daily in school or daycare environments with minimal parental interaction. While this model may appear practical, research consistently shows that parental involvement is not a mere provision but a decisive factor in children’s academic success, emotional stability, and moral development.\n\nResearch Evidence on Parental Involvement and Child Development\n\nExtensive global studies affirm that parental engagement is one of the strongest predictors of a child’s educational achievement. Renowned educational researchers such as John Hattie, Joyce Epstein, and our own Prof. Ato Essuman indicate that parental involvement significantly improves academic outcomes, motivation, and behaviour. Similarly, findings by the OECD show that students whose parents actively monitor homework, communicate with teachers, and discuss school activities consistently perform better in literacy, numeracy, and critical thinking.\n\nThe UNICEF further reports that parental supervision contributes to improved emotional regulation, reduced risky behaviour, and stronger social competence. Children who experience regular parental interaction develop higher self-esteem and better coping mechanisms, which are essential for holistic wellbeing.\n\nComparative Outcomes: Present vs. Near-Absent Parenting\n\nResearch across Europe, Asia, and Africa reveals a clear developmental gap between children with involved parents and those with limited parental supervision. Children with Active Parental Supervision:\n\nHigher academic achievement and school attendance\n\nStronger discipline and moral reasoning\n\nLower rates of delinquency and substance abuse\n\nBetter emotional resilience and mental health\n\nStronger parent-child attachment and communication\n\nChildren with Minimal Parental Presence:\n\nIncreased behavioural challenges and indiscipline\n\nHigher susceptibility to peer pressure and deviant conduct\n\nEmotional detachment and anxiety\n\nPoor academic consistency despite school attendance\n\nGreater reliance on external validation and social media influence\n\nA longitudinal study by the Harvard University Centre on the Developing Child emphasises that responsive parenting and consistent adult engagement are foundational to cognitive and socio-emotional growth. Children deprived of meaningful parental interaction may experience developmental delays even when enrolled in high-quality schools.\n\nThe School Cannot Replace the Parent.\n\nSchools are structured for instruction, not total upbringing. Teachers manage large classrooms and cannot provide the individualised moral, emotional, and behavioural guidance that parents offer. When children are dropped off very early and picked up late, the educational institution becomes a holding space rather than a complementary partner in upbringing. Evidence from global education systems shows that the most successful learners emerge from homes where education is reinforced through conversation, supervision, and values formation.\n\nHolistic Wellbeing: Beyond Academics\n\nParental involvement shapes not only academic excellence but also character formation. Studies from child psychology bodies highlight that children who engage in daily discussions with parents exhibit higher empathy, discipline, and ethical awareness. In contrast, prolonged emotional absence can lead to attention-seeking behaviour, aggression, and weakened moral judgment. From a public policy perspective, countries with strong parental engagement cultures, such as Finland, Japan, and Canada, consistently record higher educational outcomes and lower youth delinquency rates. The common denominator is not just quality schooling but structured parental supervision and involvement in children’s daily lives.\n\nThe Role of Religious Bodies and Moral Institutions\n\nReligious and community institutions play a strategic role in reinforcing parental responsibility. While spiritual teachings on salvation and prosperity are important, there is a growing need for faith-based organisations to intensify guidance on parenting, moral instruction, and restorative family interventions. Churches, mosques, and community fellowships can:\n\nOrganise parenting education programs.\n\nPromote family bonding and mentorship initiatives\n\nProvide counselling for struggling parents and children\n\nReinforce discipline, empathy, and ethical values\n\nMoral formation is most effective when religious teachings align with practical family engagement rather than replace it.\n\nConclusion\n\nFinancial provision is essential, but it cannot substitute for parental presence. Global research consistently demonstrates that children thrive academically, emotionally, and morally when parents are actively involved in their upbringing.\n\nSchools can educate, but parents cultivate character, discipline, and identity. In an era of demanding work schedules and social commitments, intentional parental supervision must be treated not as an optional duty but as a developmental necessity. Religious bodies, educational institutions, and policymakers must therefore collaborate to promote value-based parenting, strengthen family engagement, and implement restorative interventions that nurture responsible, well-rounded children for society’s future.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

President Mahama signed the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill into law in February 2026, creating a central coordinating body for the policy.\n\nCompanies operating two shifts qualify for a 25 percent corporate tax rebate, while those running three shifts can get 50 percent, alongside import duty waivers for qualifying machinery.\n\n“Passing a law is not the same as delivering on a promise,” Aboagye said, adding that NDC leaders, in 46 publicly available videos promoting the policy, had presented it as an immediate, holistic solution — not a secretariat or authority.\n\n“The young men and women who were hopeful — millions of young Ghanaians queued and voted for the first time. They are tired of waiting,” he said.\n\nAboagye also recalled the party’s national chairman promising that organisers on the Tema Motorway would be working at 1 a.m., and that businesses, nightclubs, and public offices would operate morning, afternoon, and evening — commitments he says remain unfulfilled.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "International Corporate Lawyer and entrepreneur Victoria Bright has praised the government’s recent macroeconomic gains but warned that long-term progress will depend on structural reforms and stronger support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nSpeaking on Newsfile on JoyNews on Saturday, February 28, during a discussion on the 2026 State of the Nation Address, Ms Bright acknowledged that the country’s economic indicators have improved.\n\n“I mean, our currency is stronger. We have lower debt ratios, higher reserves, lower inflation,\" she said.\n\nShe also pointed to developments in the export sector. “The gold exports have been institutionalised under the gold board, and the cocoa sector reforms will be presented. So, I think we’ll hold our horses a little bit on that to see how that’s meant to be operationalised.”\n\nWhile describing the government’s macroeconomic recovery as “very commendable”, she cautioned against focusing only on short-term fiscal corrections.\n\n“What we are hoping and praying for is that the reforms don’t just end up being fiscal corrections following the extreme difficulties that we found ourselves in not too long ago. But they operate in such a way that in the long term they prevent a relapse,” she said.\n\nMs Bright said that Ghana has often experienced cycles of progress followed by setbacks.\n\n“We do well, and then we go back. Two steps forward, four steps back. So, we don’t want that. We’re all hoping and praying that this time it stays,” she said.\n\nAccording to her, reforms must be embedded firmly in national systems to avoid a repeat of past downturns.\n\n“Unless fiscal discipline, export diversification, energy reforms and enforcement independence are locked into our systems, then the recovery risks become cyclical rather than permanent. They are not structural, and that is what we want,” she explained.\n\n“We can’t keep doing the same things over and over again and expect a different result. I’m hoping that this time things will be done differently,” she added.\n\nMs Bright said that macroeconomic stability must translate into real benefits for citizens.\n\n“This stability that we can all see and which we have to acknowledge has to translate into money in our pockets, lower cost of living for the ordinary Ghanaian, increased real wages and sustained SME growth,” she said.\n\nShe said that SMEs are critical to job creation and economic inclusion. “SMEs, in any country, drive the economy and reduce youth exclusion,” she noted.\n\nAlthough she acknowledged data from the Ghana Statistical Service showing that employment increased by one million between the first and third quarters of last year, she raised concerns about youth unemployment.\n\n“When you look at the other side of the coin and the 1.95 million youth who are not in employment, education or training, it means that a fifth of our youth are actually excluded,” she said.\n\nShe also questioned the quality of the jobs being created. “Are they formal jobs? Are they informal? Are they seasonal? Are they permanent? Private sector or public sector?” she asked.\n\nMs Bright warned against relying too heavily on public sector employment. “We can’t also pack people into the public sector. It then leads us to the same problems,” she said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Some supporters, maybe they were dreaming it. Now we are not with the possibility to fight for the Premier League, some can feel frustrated, even myself because I have my dreams.\n\n\n\n\"In September I was worried and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. In December I was so happy and excited to get the top-five position and achieve the Champions League.\n\n\"One month ago I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League. Now we are in the average to be in the top five.\n\n\n\n\"Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, they are trying to get to us, for them it is a priority to get into the Champions League.\"\n\n\n\nVilla are fortunate others have stumbled sooner and for longer this season - ensuring they have maintained a decent grip on third place until now.\n\n\n\nChelsea have dropped 17 points from winning positions at Stamford Bridge and 19 points overall in the Premier League this season.\n\n\n\nThey go to Arsenal on Sunday hoping to capitalise on Villa's latest slip - before travelling to Villa Park on Wednesday for a game which could define both teams' seasons.\n\n\n\nLille, in the Europa League on 12 March, and then a trip to Old Trafford on 15 March, will loom large for Villa.\n\nIndividual form has also plummeted, with Ollie Watkins scoring just once in 11 games - reminiscent of the spell where he scored only one goal in the opening 19 matches - while Morgan Rogers is on a similar streak.\n\n\n\nThe slump was sparked by injuries to Boubacar Kamara, John McGinn and Youri Tielemans last month as Villa's lack of depth was exposed.\n\n\n\nPlayers argued between themselves as Ezri Konsa - who also had a flashpoint with fans at the end - and Amadou Onana urged Emi Buendia to leave the pitch quicker as he was substituted.\n\n\n\nThe cracks are showing and even the players are admitting to feeling the pressure.\n\n\n\n\"It does weigh on us but it shouldn't,\" said Rogers. \"We deserve to be here and we should not forget that.\n\n\n\n\"Our run lately has not been as good as usual but that is the battle of the Premier League. We are going to get back to our good run of wins.\n\n\"We set our standards high and we have the ability to win every game. Obviously that is not realistic but we are playing good football as a whole and there is nothing to worry about.\n\n\n\n\"[The next fixtures] are the games you want to play and, with so much on the line, we need to show why we deserve to be where we are.\""

Today, I can say with confidence: Ghana is back. Ghana is working again and is open for business. The fundamentals are improving, and the path to sustained acceleration is clear.\n\n\n\n\"From the outset, we resolved to choose discipline over waste, reform over excuses, and stability over speculation. As a responsible government, our first order of business was to halt the economic haemorrhage and restore order to our public finances. We tightened expenditure and commitment controls, improved payables reporting, and conducted a comprehensive audit of 2024 commitments to restore credibility and discipline. he remarked.\n\n\n\nPresident Mahama also outlined priority areas for the coming year, including the economy, energy, agriculture, health, education, infrastructure, and job creation.\n\n\n\nThe address touched on several key national concerns, including the no-bed syndrome in hospitals, illegal mining (galamsey), education, and other critical sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the video below:\n\n\n\n\n\nJKB/EB"

            "content": "General News of Saturday, 28 February 2026\n\nSource: www.ghanaweb.com\n\nThe environmental crisis caused by illegal mining (galamsey) in Ghana has turned once-potable rivers into \"brown waters\" of silt and toxic chemicals.\n\n\n\nTraditional water treatment often fails to handle the extreme turbidity and heavy metal loads currently found in water bodies like the Birim River.\n\n\n\nTo combat this, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Ghana, under the leadership of Professor Nana Ama Brown Klutse, is piloting a cutting-edge copper-based ionic nano-liquid technology.\n\n\n\nThe technology is expected to purify the water with the application of ionic nano copper solution.\n\n\n\nThis GhanaWeb article seeks to explain how this molecular-level solution works to reclaim heavily polluted waters.\n\n\n\nGhana’s EPA eyes nano-liquid technology in fight against river pollution\n\n\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in collaboration with Ghana Standards Authority and other relevant organization have started a pilot of this technology on the Birim River; later to be extended to the Pra, Ankobra and other major rivers in the country.\n\n\n\nWhat is Copper-Based Ionic Nano-Liquid?\n\n\n\nAt its core, this technology uses nanoparticles (particles so small they are measured in billionths of a meter) suspended in an ionic liquid.\n\n\n\nUnlike standard chemicals that simply float in water, ionic liquids are essentially \"liquid salts\" that exist in a fluid state at low temperatures.\n\n\n\nWhen copper is engineered into this state at a nano-scale, it gains an incredibly high surface-area-to-volume ratio, making it hyper-reactive compared to regular copper.\n\n\n\n1. The Composition: Three Parts of a Whole\n\n•Copper (The Active Agent): Copper is naturally antimicrobial and has a high affinity for other metals. In this liquid, it acts as the primary tool for killing bacteria and binding to toxic heavy metals like mercury and lead.\n\n\n\n•Ionic Liquid (The Carrier): Unlike water or oil, an ionic liquid is essentially \"molten salt\" that remains liquid at room temperature. Because it consists entirely of ions (charged particles), it has a powerful electrical pull that keeps the copper stable and helps it interact with contaminants.\n\n\n\n•Nano-Scale (The Size): By shrinking the copper particles to a \"nano\" size (billionths of a meter), the surface area increases exponentially. A small amount of this liquid has more \"active surface\" than a massive block of solid copper, making it hyper-efficient.\n\n\n\nEPA tryouts ionic nano copper technology on polluted Birim River\n\n\n\n2. How it Works in Polluted Water\n\nWhen this liquid is introduced into a \"galamsey-polluted\" river, a three-step chemical reaction occurs:\n\nA. Adsorption (The Metal Magnet)\n\nThe copper ions in the liquid carry a charge that attracts heavy metals (Lead, Arsenic, Cyanide). These toxins \"stick\" to the copper nanoparticles. Once bound together, they become heavy and fall to the bottom as a stable sediment, or are easily filtered out.\n\n\n\nB. Flocculation (Clearing the Mud)\n\nGalamsey water is \"turbid\" (muddy) because tiny clay particles are suspended in the water. The ionic liquid neutralizes the electrical charges that keep these particles floating. This causes them to clump together, a process called flocculation, turning the \"brown soup\" into clear water with settled silt at the bottom.\n\n\n\nC. Disinfection (Biological Cleanup)\n\nCopper nanoparticles can penetrate the cell walls of harmful bacteria and fungi. Once inside, they disrupt the cell's metabolism, effectively sterilizing the water without the need for harsh chemicals like chlorine.\n\n\n\n3. Why is it \"Revolutionary\" for Ghana?\n\nTraditional water treatment (using Alum or Chlorine) often fails when the water is too muddy because the chemicals get \"lost\" in the silt.\n\n\n\nThis nano-liquid is different because:\n\n\n\n1.Speed: It works in minutes compared to the hours required for traditional settling.\n\n2.Precision: It targets specific heavy metals left behind by illegal mining.\n\n3.Low Residuals: Because it is so efficient, very small amounts are needed, reducing the risk of chemical buildup in the environment.\n\n\n\nVPO/EB\n\n\n\nMahama, Veep share laughs after Minority presents cocoa pods in Parliament"

            "content": "Sports News of Saturday, 28 February 2026\n\nSource: bbc.com\n\nMuslims around the world are currently observing the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, including players in the Premier League.\n\n\n\nSaturday's game between Leeds United and Manchester City at Elland Road might be paused in the first half to allow players observing Ramadan to break their fast.\n\n\n\nWith the match kicking off at 17:30 GMT and the sun setting in West Yorkshire at 17:41, a stoppage in play may see the likes of Omar Marmoush, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Rayan Cherki or Abdukodir Khusanov come to the side of the pitch to take on food and fluids.\n\n\n\nSources say a firm decision on a short break is likely to be made on Saturday morning, while it is understood Leeds would happily accommodate any such request from City.\n\n\n\nAsked by BBC Sport if the club have to alter their schedules to help its Muslim players, manager Pep Guardiola said: \"They follow this religious tradition. We have good nutritionists and they adapt to what the team needs.\n\n\n\n\"We cannot adapt the schedule for the Premier League [kick-off] times and I think they are used to it - they are not young and have been playing [for] many years during this period.\n\n\n\n\"For the players I think it is not new. Both Rayans, Omar and Khusa, it is not the first time for [observing] Ramadan and they know perfectly how to handle it.\"\n\n\n\nThis season, the quartet have all started together once in each of the cup competitions but are yet to feature from kick-off in the Premier League.\n\n\n\nChaplaincy for players and staff\n\n\n\nCity have a memorable history with a number of Muslim players.\n\n\n\nGerman midfielder Ilkay Gundogan captained the side to the Treble in 2023, while Algeria winger Riyad Mahrez was also part of that squad and won the PFA player of the year award with Leicester City in 2016.\n\n\n\nIvorian Yaya Toure scored the winning goal in the 2011 FA Cup final against Stoke City to end the club's 35-year wait for a major trophy - a year later he refused a bottle of champagne for man of the match on live television, stating his Islamic beliefs, with the Premier League subsequently changing the prize to a trophy.\n\n\n\nThough City's training kit is sponsored by Japanese beer company Asahi, its Super Dry 0.0% brand is printed on it, meaning Muslim players are advertising a non-alcoholic product.\n\n\n\nIt is subjects like these that City players and staff are being educated about by the Muslim Chaplains in Sport (MCS) organisation, which has been working closely with the club since 2016-17 from the under-8s all the way up to the first team.\n\n\n\nMCS founder Imam Ismail Bhamji explains to BBC Sport: \"We visit clubs and often lead prayers and we sit down and learn about a particular subject afterwards. I am then available for club staff and players.\n\n\n\n\"I walk around club training facilities and buildings, meeting people and help sort out any issues that they may have and discuss in confidentiality.\"\n\n\n\nThis month Guardiola spoke at a news conference about the \"hurt\" he feels for victims of global conflict, including the thousands killed in Palestine.\n\n\n\nImam Ismail says it is a subject that has struck a chord within some clubs, adding: \"If help is needed, people do reach out to me for guidance on family matters and personal issues.\n\n\n\n\"One example is being asked about how to navigate the war in Gaza - in controlling their emotions and not be at risk of losing their jobs by posting something on social media.\"\n\n\n\n'We leave it to clubs to decide what do to'\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Manchester United held an Iftar (breaking of the Ramadan fast) at Old Trafford for supporters, with the Adhan (call to prayer) taking place inside the stadium.\n\n\n\nClubs up and down the country, including Manchester City, have held similar initiatives during Ramadan in recent years.\n\n\n\nImam Ismail delivers workshops on Islamic awareness and Halal food guidance, while the ongoing month of Ramadan is a particularly busy period.\n\n\n\n\"We explain what Ramadan is and why Muslims find it important and why we must observe it,\" he says. \"It is mentioned in the Quran and one of the five pillars of Islam.\n\n\n\n\"We explain the importance of fasting for those who qualify and we also explain the impact of fasting on professional athletes and how they could navigate and work around that to ensure they can fulfil their religious obligations and the sporting side too so that they can continue to play.\n\n\n\n\"Ultimately, we leave it to clubs to decide what do to - we can't tell them what to do.\"\n\nPlayers that work with MCS are understood to be pleased that they do not have to miss prayers and an Imam can come in to help them perform their duties as Muslims.\n\n\n\n\"I bumped into Pep Guardiola last week and he held my hand and wished me Ramadan Kareem,\" said a beaming Imam Ismail. \"That was nice of him.\"\n\n\n\nThe end of Ramadan is marked by the day of Eid, which will take place on Friday, 20 or Saturday, 21 March - depending on the sighting of the new moon - when celebrations take place with families and friends and gifts are exchanged.\n\n\n\nCity face Arsenal in a tantalising Carabao Cup final on the Sunday - lifting the trophy at Wembley will provide the perfect Eid present for players and supporters alike."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

Syria also announced it had closed part of its airspace in the south along its border with Israel for 12 hours.\n\nThe closures came after the US and Israel carried out attacks across Iran that US President Donald Trump pledged would raze Iran’s missile industry and destroy its navy. Iran, which had been engaged in negotiations with the US over its nuclear programme right up until the attack, pledged a harsh response and soon began waging retaliatory strikes in Israel, as well as several Gulf Arab states that host US military assets, including Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE and Bahrain.\n\n“All American and Israeli assets and interests in the Middle East have become a legitimate target,” a senior Iranian official told Al Jazeera. “There are no red lines after this aggression, and everything is possible.”\n\nThe disruption caused global airlines to cancel or divert flights from destinations across the Middle East, which has become an important route for flights between Europe and Asia, as Russian and Ukrainian airspace is closed to most airlines due to the war there.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Transport said Russian air carriers had suspended flights to Iran and ⁠Israel. Air India said it would temporarily avoid the Middle East altogether.\n\n\n\nAmong other airlines announcing suspensions to destinations in the region were Lufthansa, Air France, Iberia, Wizz Air, Turkish Airlines, Qatar Airways, Virgin Atlantic, KLM, British Airways, Aegean Airlines, Indigo, Japan Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Doha, said the joint US-Israeli attack on Iran and Iran’s response, affecting numerous Gulf states, have created two “parallel” conflicts, further deepening instability.\n\n“This could make the whole crisis very intertwined and very complicated in a way that this region has never witnessed,” said Hashem."

            "content": "Military operations by the US and Israel in Iran mark the most intense escalation since the June 2025 war despite several rounds of indirect US-Iran talks.\n\nThe United States and Israel have launched strikes on Iran despite ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran over Iran’s nuclear programme.\n\nIran responded to Saturday’s attacks with missile and air strikes across the region, including in Israel, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq.\n\nIsraeli officials said their strikes targeted Iran’s military and nuclear-related infrastructure, while airspace across Israel was closed and emergency measures imposed. Several other countries in the region also announced the closure of their airspace.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump said Washington has begun a “major combat operation” in Iran, aimed at “eliminating threats from the Iranian regime”.\n\n“This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces,” he said.\n\nThe strikes came just two days after high-stakes US–Iran nuclear negotiations in Geneva, mediated by Oman, ended without a breakthrough. The US-Israel attack marks the most serious escalation since the brief but intense June 2025 war.\n\nHere is a timeline of the events, including attacks and diplomatic overtures leading up to Saturday’s strikes by the US and Israel, and Iran’s fierce response.\n\nJune 13, 2025 — Israel launches major air strikes against Iranian nuclear and military facilities, amid ongoing talks between the US and Tehran. Iran responds within hours with large-scale missile and drone attacks on Israeli cities.\n\nJune 22 – The US strikes Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan, with Trump claiming the attacks degraded Tehran’s nuclear programme. Iranian officials said their programme was set back but not destroyed.\n\n\n\nJune 23 – In retaliation, Iran fires missiles towards Al Udeid airbase in Qatar, housing US soldiers. The missiles are intercepted, and no casualties are reported.\n\nJune 24 – After 12 days of fighting, a US-brokered ceasefire takes effect between Iran and Israel, ending all hostilities. Iran says at least 610 of its citizens were killed in the war, while Israel claimed 28 were killed on its side.\n\nJuly 2 – Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signs legislation halting cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), barring its inspectors from accessing Iran’s nuclear facilities unless specifically authorised by the country’s Supreme National Security Council.\n\nJuly 22 – Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s foreign minister, says Tehran will not give up its uranium enrichment programme, despite a temporary halt due to “serious and severe” damages.\n\nAugust 12 – Iranian police arrest as many as 21,000 people related to the 12-day war with Israel, according to state media.\n\nAugust 22 – Iran agrees to resume nuclear talks later in the month with the United Kingdom, France and Germany, despite the threat of revived sanctions.\n\nAugust 28 – The three European countries trigger a mechanism reinstating the United Nations’ sanctions on the Islamic republic for the first time in a decade.\n\nNovember 1 – Oman urges both the US and Iran to go back to the negotiating table as Iran reiterates it will not stop enriching uranium.\n\nNovember 7 – Trump says Iran has requested that Washington remove its crippling sanctions on Tehran, and that he is willing to talk about the issue.\n\nDecember 28 – Protests break out in major cities, including Tehran, over soaring prices after the rial plunges against the US dollar.\n\nJanuary 8, 2026 – The internet is shut down across Iran following the outbreak of antigovernment protests, which have now spread beyond cities. The blackout lasts for more than two weeks.\n\nJanuary 13 – Trump tells Iranians to “keep protesting” , claiming that “help is on the way”, and that the US may be preparing for military intervention against Tehran. The US begins to bolster its military presence off Iran.\n\nFebruary 6 – Iran and the US begin indirect nuclear negotiations in Geneva, mediated by Oman, with the aim of reaching a deal to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme.\n\nFebruary 17 – High-level US–Iran nuclear talks resume in Geneva, again with Omani mediation.\n\nFebruary 22 – Oman confirms another round of discussions in Geneva, describing a “positive push” but admits that significant differences remain.\n\n\n\nFebruary 26 – A third round of nuclear talks concludes in Geneva, with mediator Oman saying “significant progress” was made and more discussions would be held the following week in Vienna.\n\nFebruary 27 – Oman’s foreign minister says Iran has agreed to degrade its current stockpiles of nuclear material to “the lowest level possible” — effectively to unrefined levels. US President Donald Trump says he prefers diplomacy but warns that “all options” remain available if diplomacy fails.\n\nFebruary 28 – Israel launches coordinated strikes on Iranian targets, including sites in and around Tehran. Iran retaliates by launching air and missile strikes across the region, including Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait."

            "content": "Iran has targeted United States assets across the Gulf Arab states in retaliation for a huge joint attack on Iran by the US and Israel, as the region’s worst fears of being ignited in the flames of a sustained war loom.\n\nThe Iranian government on Saturday confirmed its attacks on several targets, according to the Fars news agency, including Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, where US airbases are hosted.\n\nIran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed all Israeli and US military targets in the Middle East have been struck “by the powerful blows of Iranian missiles”.\n\n“This operation will continue relentlessly until the enemy is decisively defeated,” it said. All US assets throughout the region are considered legitimate targets for Iran’s army, it added.\n\nAt least one person has been killed in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital, after several missiles launched from Iran were intercepted, according to the country’s state news agency.\n\nBahrain says a missile attack targeted the headquarters of the US Navy’s 5th Fleet, which it hosts.\n\nThe government called it a “treacherous attack” and “a blatant violation of the kingdom’s sovereignty and security”.\n\nAl Jazeera Arabic has meanwhile confirmed the sound of explosions in Kuwait, home to the US military’s Central Command headquarters.\n\nIn Qatar, the Defense Ministry says it “thwarted” several attacks on the country.\n\n“The Ministry of Defense confirms that the threat was dealt with immediately upon detection, in accordance with the pre-approved security plan, and that all missiles were intercepted before reaching Qatari territory,” it said.\n\n\n\nQatar, Kuwait and the UAE have all closed their airspaces.\n\nAn Al Jazeera correspondent reported that Erbil Airport in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq was targeted twice on Saturday. A drone attack attempted to target Erbil International Airport, but air defences intercepted and shot it down, they added.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Doha, said the only country in the Gulf Cooperation Council that Iran has not struck today thus far is Oman.\n\nOman has for years served as a liaison between Iran and other nations in the region and beyond. It has played a central role in recent indirect talks between Iran and the US in Oman and Geneva.\n\nOman’s foreign minister on Friday had voiced optimism that peace was “within reach” as Iran had agreed during the talks never to stockpile enriched uranium. Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi described the development as a major breakthrough. Hours later, Israel and the US attacked, and those talks are now dead and buried.\n\nThe GCC is an alliance of six countries in the Arabian Peninsula: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, established in 1981 to promote economic, security, cultural and social cooperation.\n\n“Here in Doha, in the last few hours, we’ve heard at least a dozen explosions. The majority of them sound like they were Patriot defence missiles intercepting incoming Iran missiles,” Basravi said.\n\n“As far as Iran is concerned, with the US and Israel firing the first shot in this latest go-round, everything is now probably fair game,” he added."

            "content": "is a deputy editor and Verge co-founder with a passion for human-centric cities, e-bikes, and life as a digital nomad. He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nGood electric bikes are expensive. So why not buy one and share it?\n\nThat’s the idea behind the Tenways CGO Compact e-bike I’ve been sharing with my wife and teenage daughter for the last two weeks. It adapts in seconds without any tools to comfortably fit riders of varying heights thanks to its low-entry frame, quick-release seat post, and height-adjustable handlebar.\n\nIt also takes up less space than an ordinary bike with its 20-inch wheels, folding pedals, and a handlebar that twists to create a slim, wall-hugging profile that goes flat inside a car or train.\n\nThe CGO Compact’s geometry puts riders into a comfortable upright body position. Combine that with wide tires and a heavy aluminum frame – heavier than many full-sized e-bikes – and it feels remarkably sturdy despite its size, with a rear carrier system strong enough to hold a child or a few days of groceries.\n\nThe shareable e-bike isn’t a new idea, but Tenways comes close to perfecting it with the €1,999 (about $2,365) CGO Compact.\n\n9 Verge Score Tenways CGO Compact e-bike $ 2365 $ 2365 The Good Saddle and handlebar adjust quickly\n\nTwists and folds to go flat\n\nRides big and sturdy\n\nGood hauling capacity for size\n\nNo service upsells\n\nLow battery alerts The Bad App is just fine\n\nQuick release seat easy to steal $2365 at Tenways How we rate and review products\n\nTenways, the Amsterdam-HQ’d e-bike company of Chinese origin, has been on a tear in Europe thanks to the post-pandemic chaos that took out much of its competition. The brand makes great looking e-bikes from off-the-shelf parts supported by a robust service network. Importantly, they sell below the €2,681 (about $3,160) e-bike average — expensive compared to the US, but far less likely to burst into flames.\n\nMy Tenways review e-bike arrived at my front door in a giant cardboard box. It seemed big enough to fit the CGO Compact fully assembled and with the handlebar twisted, yet I still had to attach the steering column and front wheel myself. The e-bike took about 20 minutes to unbox, but I’ve been assembling direct-to-consumer e-bikes about once a month for the last decade.\n\nQuickly adjusts to fit my wife who is 164cm (5ft 5in) tall. The handlebars and shock-absorbing seat can be raised in seconds to fit my 183cm (6ft) frame. Open the release to raise and lower the handlebars, lift that little pin to twist them out of the way. The folding pedals help create a wall-hugging profile that’s easy to walk past.\n\nThe first thing I did after assembly was play with the Byschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem. It’s magical. Open the lever to quickly raise and lower the handlebar, or to gain access to a pin release that lets the handlebar twist out of the way. It took a little practice for everyone to master but we soon got the hang of it.\n\nThe small LCD dashboard is bright and colorful even in the sun. You have to enter a four-digit PIN code at power-on, which can only be changed in the rudimentary app over Bluetooth. It’s the only theft-deterrence Tenways offers on the CGO Compact, which also means it won’t try to upsell you on subscriptions or software-locked features.\n\nDespite our height differences, ranging from 164cm to 183cm (5ft 5in to 6 feet), everyone found the CGO Compact to be very comfortable. Adjusting the handlebar and saddle takes less than 10 seconds, and the suspension seatpost did a good job of soaking up small bumps. But the seat’s quick release mechanism offers no additional security to prevent the post and saddle from being stolen. A no-no in the big European cities this bike targets.\n\nThe e-bike’s torque sensor made the ride exceptionally intuitive, ensuring that the power delivered by the 250W rear-hub motor was tuned to match the downward force exerted on the pedals. The motor was also very quiet, masked entirely by the sound of the wide, 2.4-inch tires riding over asphalt.\n\nThe Tenways motor is only capable of 45Nm of torque. And without additional gears, the CGO Compact is best for mostly flat environments. It still did better than I expected on hills, easily besting the 35Nm Raleigh One I recently reviewed. For example, I was able to cross a bridge with a 10 percent incline that stymied the Raleigh One, but only if I had a rolling start — otherwise, I had to get off and push. On downhill slopes, the large chainring allowed me to pedal comfortably at speeds approaching 30km/h without my legs frantically spinning out. The pedal-assist, however, quits helping at 25km/h (16mph) in Europe.\n\nI also didn’t experience any of the twitchiness you get from folding bikes with relatively short wheelbases, smaller 16-inch wheels, and narrow handlebars. In general I rode in pedal-assist levels 3 or 4 out of 5, with 3 feeling the most natural, and 4 for when I was in a hurry.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 25 The suspension seat post soaked up bumps on a variety of road surfaces.\n\nOn a full battery I managed to travel 65kms (over 40 miles) before needing a recharge. I received alerts on my iPhone and Apple Watch when the battery dropped to 10 percent, and power dropped noticeably when the estimated remaining range hit 4km. Charging the 494.36Wh battery took a relatively slow 4.5 hours from the bundled charger.\n\nThe CGO Compact was obviously designed by people that actually ride bikes in compact European cities. It comes standard with integrated lighting, mudguards, a loud bell, kickstand, and a partially covered transmission to protect trousers, skirts, and long coats from getting snagged. The little crossbar in the step-through frame even doubles as a handle to help hoist the bike up stairs.\n\nCity bikes need to haul things, which is why the CGO Compact comes fitted with the click-and-go MIK HD rear carrier system. It supports loads up to 27kg (almost 60 pounds) — enough to fit a compatible crate or child seat. The e-bike also has mounting points up front for a bottle cage or rack.\n\nIn general, the Android and iOS app is fine, but it’s rarely needed. It might eventually be useful for buying accessories and insurance, or starting a chat with support and finding the nearest service center. It also promises to show riding data collected by date, but this never worked for me, only showing zeroes.\n\nTenways’ CGO Compact is an excellent e-bike for €1,999 (about $2,365). The riding experience, everyone agrees, has been stellar. And when it eventually needs servicing, Tenways has a solid network of local bike shops in Europe to provide support, with a ready supply of the off-the-shelf parts from brands you know.\n\nThe CGO Compact is a highly adaptable e-bike that rides big and tucks away small, making it an ideal companion for European city life. It’s also exceedingly shareable — but nobody would blame you for keeping it all for yourself.\n\nCGO Compact Specs Tenways C9 Hub Motor (250W, 45Nm torque)\n\nSingle-speed Gates CDN Carbon belt drive\n\n494.36Wh removable battery\n\nSuspension seat post for Selle Royal saddle\n\nTektro hydraulic disc brakes\n\nByschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem\n\nBike weight: 24kg (almost 53 pounds) with all accessories\n\nMax load: 145kg (320 pounds)\n\nMIK HD Rear Carrier system with 27kg (almost 60 pounds) max load\n\nFits riders 160cm and 190cm (5ft 2in to 6ft 2in)\n\nAccessory mounting points on head tube\n\nIntegrated front and rear lighting with daytime running light\n\nLCD display\n\nBasic app for iOS and Android\n\nPhotography by Thomas Ricker / The Verge"

Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of “effective altruism,” they have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission - a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives.\n\nThe Terms of Service of Anthropic’s defective altruism will never outweigh the safety, the readiness, or the lives of American troops on the battlefield.\n\nTheir true objective is unmistakable: to seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military. That is unacceptable.\n\nAs President Trump stated on Truth Social, the Commander-in-Chief and the American people alone will determine the destiny of our armed forces, not unelected tech executives.\n\nAnthropic’s stance is fundamentally incompatible with American principles. Their relationship with the United States Armed Forces and the Federal Government has therefore been permanently altered.\n\nIn conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security. Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic. Anthropic will continue to provide the Department of War its services for a period of no more than six months to allow for a seamless transition to a better and more patriotic service.\n\nAmerica’s warfighters will never be held hostage by the ideological whims of Big Tech.

            "content": "Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.\n\nYet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, Kodak, and others.\n\nAll the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.\n\nIf you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that offers great image quality and lets you choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like Kodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.\n\nTake a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for most people\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 306 grams / Charging method: AA batteries / Companion app: None / Other features: Built-in selfie mirror, film counter\n\nIf all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well-suited for kids and those new to photography.\n\nFor an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most struggle to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash helps. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both bright and dark environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. Photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before, but selfies captured my features and skin tone more accurately, thanks in part to the small front-facing mirror. The updated lens design also lets you twist into Close-Up Mode to zoom slightly and activate the Parallax Correction features for a more aligned photo. It’s a fun, point-and-shoot-style feature, though aligning photos still takes some practice (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).\n\nFor an instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 produces vivid, relatively true-to-life photos. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nThe Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the small counter that shows your remaining shots, which is a useful tracking feature given that each print costs about $1. However, it doesn’t support Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it doesn’t feature filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for a solid instant camera that caters to all ages and experience levels, you’ll likely be satisfied with the Instax Mini 12.\n\nThe best premium instant camera\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 285 grams / Charging method: USB-C (on newer models) / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nOne of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo was a favorite of my former colleague Becca Farcase — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a handsome brown version, as well as a newer pink model.\n\nIt’s easy to balk at its price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.\n\nBeing able to adjust the brightness of the prints helped me capture night photos and a low-light immersive exhibit a little more clearly and realistically, which is a feature the Instax Mini 12 doesn’t offer. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Mini 12, the Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can disable the flash, leverage the 3-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder, and adjust the brightness of a print — a helpful feature, given Evo doesn’t capture dark environments well. The camera’s dials also let you apply various lens options and effects, from retro filters to monochrome shades, and you can even take app-based remote shots, allowing for better seflies and more photographic control.\n\nThe Evo isn’t perfect, though. The companion app isn’t as feature-rich as competing software, the menu system can be confusing to navigate, and the camera’s internal storage maxes out at 45 images. Still, these are relatively minor drawbacks for a stylish, portable camera that makes it easy to quickly capture and print quality shots.\n\nThe best instant camera for social occasions\n\nFilm type: Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / Film size: 3 x 3-inch square prints / Weight: 467 grams / Charging method: Micro USB / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nWhereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app lets you apply frames, stickers, filters, and a wide range of customization options to photos, making it great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature in the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making it a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.\n\nLike the Evo, the Shot 3 Retro features an LCD screen — albeit a much smaller one — that lets you decide whether to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp images from your phone. Unlike the Evo, however, the Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of film. It also uses cheaper film; you can often pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for under $20. The cheaper arguably encourages creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than those from both Fujifilm and Polaroid.\n\nPhotos taken with the Kodak Mini Shot 3 aren’t particularly sharp and can have an excessive pink tint. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nHowever, there are notable drawbacks to the Shot 3 Retro. The resulting prints aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone, for one, nor were they as clear or sharp as what you might get with the Evo or Mini 12 (some even have an excessive pink tint). The Shot 3 Retro doesn’t store images the way the Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish. Nonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.\n\nThe best instant camera for retro fans\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / Weight: 648 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: Yes / Other features: Flip-up lid, scene analysis feature\n\nIf you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the Polaroid Flip is the camera for you. It resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 more than any other camera on our list, thanks to its classic, retro-inspired design and flip-up lid. Its square I-Type film prints and iconic white frame give photos an authentically vintage look, while modern touches like Bluetooth, USB-C charging, and a beginner-friendly companion app add greater convenience and creative control.\n\nCompared to the third-gen Polaroid Now Plus, my former retro pick, the Flip delivers clearer shots with fewer wasted photos, making the extra $50 worthwhile given that eight I-Type sheets are a spendy $18.99. The increased clarity can be attributed to several factors, including the Flip’s sonar autofocus and a four-lens hyperfocal system — which result in sharper, more focused images — along with its excellent flash. It’s the most powerful of any Polaroid camera, and while it can sometimes overexpose images, you can adjust exposure directly from the camera or app. The Scene Analysis feature also helps by warning if a shot is likely to be over- or underexposed, or if you’re too close to your subject. In my experience, the warnings didn’t always prevent overexposure, but they did leave me with shots that looked less blown than those from the Now Plus.\n\nA few outdoor examples I captured with the Polaroid Flip. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nAll that being said, there are some notable drawbacks. The Flip is relatively heavy and awkwardly sized, so you can’t slip it into a purse or easily carry it around. Prints also take up to 15 minutes to develop — during which they must be shielded from light — which can be quite an inconvenience. Low-light performance remains a weak spot as well, and I struggled to capture indoor shots given the contrast and saturation are lower than with Instax film. Admittedly, this gave my pictures a more dreamy, vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust the saturation and exposure settings.\n\nTruth be told, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, the Flip is the perfect camera for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for portability\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / Weight: 239 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: No / Other features: Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter\n\nWhereas the Flip is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It weighs just over a pound and fits easily in the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it the most portable instant camera on our list. If its images were more true to life and didn’t require you to sheild them from the light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d call it the best instant camera for kids or travel.\n\nAt $89.99, the latest Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera available, with film that costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (a 16-sheet pack runs $21.99). The new Go sports a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including USB-C support, and Polaroid claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor. Photos are slightly brighter, though the original Go produced warmer images that felt more true to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low, but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Flip.\n\nThe second-gen Polaroid Go produces charming photos but with a cooler tone. Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Flip, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. There’s no Bluetooth or companion app for added effects; however, the camera does include a self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. The smaller prints may disappoint those who prefer traditional Polaroid sizes, though, and its modern design lacks the retro charm of older models. But classic Polaroid cameras didn’t come with an app, either, and the Go’s simplicity makes it an a easy-to-use option that delivers a traditional instant film experience at less than half the price of the Flip.\n\nOther instant cameras to consider\n\nFujifilm’s $116.99 Instax Mini 41 is the long-awaited follow-up to the Mini 40. The updated model retains the retro design found on the prior model but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups. It didn’t take long testing the Mini 41 for me to realize it’s simply the Mini 12 for adults. With its black-and-silver body and flatter, squarer edges, the Mini 41 looks sleeker and more stylish. The two cameras are nearly identical, aside from the design, with the same solid photo quality and feature set. Both battery-powered options turn on with a simple twist of the lens, and each comes equipped with a selfie mirror, a close-up mode, and a flash (which cannot be disabled).\n\nThere are a few subtle upgrades to the Mini 41, however. A textured grip in the front makes it easier to hold, and its shape makes shooting in landscape mode more comfortable. But those are small differences, and at their core, the cameras offer the same experience. Since the Instax Mini 12 retails for less, I ultimately believe it’s the better value; however, if a fashionable, mature look appeals to you, the Mini 41 is a great alternative, especially if you can find it on sale.\n\nIf you’re looking for an advanced analog instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At $234.95, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12 or the Mini 41, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click cameras given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket, an aluminum extension column, and a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur when capturing fast-moving subjects.\n\nThanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12, Mini 41, and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera, not a hybrid like the Evo, so you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The newer model is also less user-friendly than the Mini 12 and Mini 41, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters.\n\nThe Kodak Smile Plus is another hybrid instant camera that allows you to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $129.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with a physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers.\n\nHowever, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark.\n\nThat said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software isn’t as snappy or feature-rich, it still lets you add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it’s often available for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.\n\nFrom photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, Leica’s Sofort 2 is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.\n\nThe drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s challenging to recommend at $399, as most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The Leica user interface is easier to navigate, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also appreciate that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.\n\nWhile it didn’t make the cut, the Instax Square SQ1 is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and features a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $159.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100. That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Flip and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.\n\nFujifilm also sells the newer Instax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at $199.95. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.\n\nFujifilm’s Instax Wide Evo Hybrid is nearly identical to the Instax Mini Evo. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $409.95 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lenses and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.\n\nPlus, unlike the Wide 400, the Wide Evo Hybrid is a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful feature that can reduce wasted shots. However, at $409.95, it costs significantly more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken, which is something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects, such as a dog or hyperactive toddler.\n\nIf you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $409.95 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $175.95 Instax Wide 400 is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar stills to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.\n\nFujifilm’s new Instax Mini LiPlay Plus isn’t nearly as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo, but it’s worth considering if you take a lot of selfies. At $234.99, the hybrid camera costs the same as the Instax Mini Evo, but features a 3-inch LCD screen on the back, along with a second, rear-facing wide-angle lens designed specifically for self-portraits. That dedicated selfie camera, paired with the LCD, delivers some of the best — and most precise — selfies I’ve captured with an instant camera to date.\n\nThe LiPlay Plus also includes some fun extra features, such as a layered photo mode that combines images from both cameras into a single shot. It can also record short audio clips, which are saved as a QR code you can place in a corner of the printed photo. Both features are enjoyable to play with, though the layered photo mode can, admittedly, come off as gimmicky. You’re basically just dropping a selfie onto a background image with no way to reposition or resize it.\n\nWhat I’m looking for How we test instant cameras Collapse Typically, I try to spend at least a couple of weeks, if not months, testing each camera to get a sense of what it would be like to actually own one. I’ll use them to capture photos of loved ones while hanging out, as well as subjects and scenes I stumble across as I explore Los Angeles and its many beaches. I shoot indoors and outside, with and without the flash, allowing me to compare how each camera performs in both bright and low-light environments.I also ask friends and family — both young and old — for their input on image quality, and I have them take photos with the instant camera to get their thoughts on usability. If the camera comes with extra features, such as filters or support for a companion app, I’ll make sure to put them to the test in real-life situations. I note how easy it is to pull up and navigate the app, apply the effects, and, of course, how the results look. Photo quality Collapse Instant cameras aren’t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most struggle in low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life. Ease of use Collapse How easy is it to set the instant camera up and take photos with it? Ease of use is a big part of what makes instant cameras fun and accessible to people of all ages. You shouldn’t need a professional photography background just to enjoy an instant camera. Value Collapse Instant cameras come with different features at various price points. Generally, the more feature-rich cameras tend to be pricier, but do the extra capabilities justify the added cost? Some cameras, for example, pair with a companion app or feature a built-in selfie mirror, while others let you print images from your phone. None of these are essential, though the added niceties may be worth it for some people. Suitability Collapse Some instant cameras aren’t as well-suited for certain situations and / or people as others. For example, there are instant cameras that print old-fashioned Polaroid photos that aren’t very clear. They frustrate me, but retro lovers might find them charming. Other cameras come with advanced creative modes that let you edit photos and even print smartphone photos, but a young child might find them difficult to use. Film Collapse Each instant camera requires a different kind of film, which means that the sticker price of the camera isn’t the true price. This is something you should take into account before making a purchase, as the cost of film can quickly add up. Depending on the brand, you may have to pay anywhere between 50 cents and $2 a shot.It’s also important to take into account that some film is easier to find. The Instax Mini 12, for example, uses credit card-size Instax Mini film that’s sold at most major retailers. Other types of film, including the film needed for Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, are available on Amazon but aren’t sold by as many retailers.Finally, most instant camera brands sell films of varying quality in a range of styles. Some are decorated with colorful frames and patterns, while others are black and white. They also vary in shape and size, from small rectangular prints you can stick in your wallet to square-shaped ones. You can also buy wider prints, and some brands even sell film with an adhesive backing that allows you to use the resulting images as stickers.\n\nUpdate, February 27th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and shorten the copy for all of our main entries."

The Artemis III mission, scheduled for 2027, was originally going to attempt to land on the Moon but will now be a test flight instead. NASA also says it’s “increasing its cadence of missions,” including adding a second test flight in 2027 and aiming for “at least one surface landing every year thereafter,” including the Artemis IV landing.\n\nThe overhaul to the Artemis launch schedule follows a report from NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) earlier this month that highlighted serious safety risks with NASA’s previous plans for future launches. ASAP was particularly concerned about Artemis III, which its report said included too many “cumulative technical, operational, and schedule risks associated with multiple first-of-a-kind objectives planned for a single mission.”\n\nThe Artemis II mission, scheduled for this year, has faced a string of issues during testing over recent weeks, delaying its launch until no earlier than April. Artemis II is intended to orbit the Moon — if it’s successful, it will be the first time humans visit lunar orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance’s merger agreement is now official. On Friday, the two companies announced plans to merge into a massive media company that will fold WBD’s studio, linear channels, streaming service, and gaming segment into Paramount.\n\nThough WBD initially signed onto an $83 billion agreement to merge part of Warner Bros. with Netflix, Paramount persisted with a hostile takeover bid, followed by a series of offers. That persistence paid off, as WBD determined that Paramount’s “best and final” offer is “superior” to Netflix’s deal. On Thursday, Netflix declined to match Paramount’s bid, calling it “no longer financially attractive.”\n\nParamount and WBD say the board of directors of both companies has signed off on the deal. The companies expect it to close in the third quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Under the agreement, Paramount will acquire WBD in a deal valued at $110 billion. Paramount has also agreed to cover the $7 billion regulatory termination fee and the $2.8 billion breakup fee owed to Netflix, which it has already paid, according to Bloomberg.\n\n“Together, Paramount and WBD will deliver greater choice for consumers through its leading streaming platforms with an exceptional intellectual property portfolio that has produced popular franchises such as Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Top Gun, the DC Universe and SpongeBob SquarePants,” the companies say in the press release.\n\nLawmakers and regulators are skeptical about the Paramount-WBD merger. “A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a statement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta also warned that the agreement isn’t a “done deal,” and that the state’s Department of Justice will be “vigorous” in its review of the merger."

            "content": "Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts, and have stopped getting a response. This week, thanks to a reader tip, we think we’ve found the original phone the T1 is based on.\n\nA long time ago, back when the Trump phone was but a single, inaccurate render and a contradictory spec sheet, we tried to figure out what other phone it might be based on. Now, eight months, two spec overhauls, and one redesign later, I have a good guess: the HTC U24 Pro.\n\nI didn’t spot this by myself. A reader first tipped me off to the similarities between the U24 Pro and the Trump phone I revealed a few weeks ago, which are numerous: a similar angled body and curved display, a unique front sensor array, and broadly similar specs, including oddities like a headphone jack and microSD card support.\n\nLet’s get one thing out the way at the top: I’m pretty sure HTC isn’t secretly building the Trump phone. Sohaib Ahmed, the company’s global director of PR, told me as much: “HTC does not design or manufacture phones for third parties.” But that doesn’t rule out another company playing a part in designing or building both phones, and given just how similar they look, I suspect that’s exactly what happened.\n\nIt’s a little hard to make out in this screenshot, but the Trump phone shares the sharply angled edges of the HTC U24 Pro. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nThe U24 Pro is an odd phone in its own right. It launched in 2024 for €549 (around $600 at the time), and was heralded in some corners as a return from the dead for HTC, despite the fact that it followed the U23 Pro a year earlier, and a string of smaller releases that targeted the Asian market. HTC, once one of the major players in the Android phone industry, had been greatly diminished ever since selling a large part of its smartphone business to Google for $1.1 billion in 2017.\n\nBoth the T1 Phone and the U24 Pro share a slightly asymmetric angular frame, jutting out into a point along every edge, with a heavily curved screen on the front. I cannot think of, nor find, another phone that is quite the same shape — even small details like the positions of the antenna lines around the power and volume buttons line up. Even more telling is the set of sensors along each phone’s top. The U24 Pro splits up its speaker grill, notification LED, and proximity sensor into three, resulting in an unusual design with a long bar, a small dot for the LED, and then a second shorter bar, at the point where the display meets the phone’s top. What looks like the same sensor design can be clearly seen on the Trump phone I was shown, though I can’t confirm that the sensors themselves are the same, or that the T1 Phone will also have a notification LED.\n\nBoth phones have near-identical sets of speakers and sensors about the front selfie camera, with headphone jack and microphone visible behind them on the top edges. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nOther details are subtler. It’s hard to tell exactly from the glimpses I got of the Trump phone, but along the top frame it certainly looks to have both a headphone jack and a microphone in the exact same positions as on the HTC device. Even having a headphone jack in the first place is evidence of the phones’ connection, given how rare the feature is in modern devices. The same can be said for the fact that both phones include a microSD card slot, sharing support for up to 1TB cards on top of a base 512GB of storage.\n\nWhile the rear cameras look completely different, which seems to scupper my theory, look again: The U24 Pro’s cameras are split into a pair close together, with a third lens lower down. The new Trump phone sets all its cameras in one mount, but they’re unevenly spaced, with a larger gap between the second and third lenses. These cameras may look totally different on the surface, but I suspect that underneath you’ll find they’re similar. And what we know of the specs matches too: Trump Mobile told me that its phone will have 50-megapixel sensors for both the main and selfie cameras, and my glimpse of its camera UI showed an ultrawide and a 2x zoom option — all of which you’ll find on the U24 Pro.\n\nThe two phones’ cameras look different at first, but the unusual lens placement might just line up. Screenshot: Dominic Preston / The Verge and Image: HTC\n\nAssuming that the two phones are essentially the same, does the U24 Pro tell us any more about what to expect from the T1? It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, matching what I’d been told about a Snapdragon 7-series chip in the Trump phone. The U24 Pro has a 6.8-inch OLED display, 60W wired charging and even wireless charging support, and an IP67 rating for dust and water protection. There’s reason to be cautious reading too much into the spec sheet, though: The U24 Pro released with a 4,600mAh battery, smaller than the 5,000mAh capacity I’ve been told will be in the Trump phone. If that spec differs, then other elements of the internals could well too — the bigger battery in particular might replace the wireless charging coils of the HTC phone.\n\nThe U24 Pro launched to middling reviews, which may not inspire much confidence in Trump Mobile’s offering. Tech Advisor gave the phone two and a half stars out of five, calling it “hard to recommend over rivals,” while Notebookcheck declared it “modern and yet out of date.” Still, it fared surprisingly well in a JerryRigEverything teardown and durability test.\n\nHe noticed, however, that this didn’t appear to be the HTC of old, lacking the sapphire crystal HTC previously used on its displays and optical image stabilization on the front camera it once pioneered. The U24 Pro and other HTC phones released in the last few years share little consistent design language, and ship with near-stock Android software. Speculation has been rife that HTC isn’t in fact manufacturing the phones internally, but had commissioned an ODM — original design manufacturer — to produce the hardware. ODMs design and manufacture phones for other companies, usually to a set of specifications provided by the consumer-facing brands, and often retain ownership of the designs, allowing them to reuse and repurpose them for other clients. I asked HTC for clarification, but the company wouldn’t confirm whether the U24 Pro was made in-house or contracted out.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that Trump Mobile, or its manufacturing partner, is simply ripping off the design of a little-known HTC device. But I think the most likely answer here is a more mundane one: HTC probably worked with some unnamed ODM to design and manufacture the U24 Pro, and Trump Mobile just happened to work with the same company. That manufacturer may have either dug out its old designs for HTC when developing the T1 Phone, or perhaps gave new life to old, unused components from HTC’s production run. Without knowing the hypothetical ODM involved, it’s hard to say for sure. Trump Mobile has previously confirmed that it’s working with a partner or partners to manufacture its phones outside the US, before their “final assembly” in Miami, but executive Don Hendrickson wouldn’t tell me the name of its manufacturer or where it’s based. I reached out to the company again for comment on this story, and received no reply.\n\nSo no, I don’t think that HTC made the Trump phone. But it does look likely that it is based, more or less, on one of that company’s phones. It remains to be seen how the T1 Phone will differ in its details, but the fact that its origins seem so closely tied to an unpopular midranger from two years ago doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the T1 Phone’s flagship credentials.\n\nGot inside information on Trump Mobile or the Trump phone?

            "content": "Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.\n\nThe blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.\n\nThe Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.\n\nAccess to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.\n\nWe understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase.

A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.\n\nWhile Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.\n\nAt the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.\n\nThe incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.\n\n“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.”\n\nIndia has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted access to developer platform GitHub, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also reported that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.\n\nFounded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has gained traction amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its valuation to $5 billion.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond."

The president allowed for a six-month phase-out period for departments using the products, but emphasized that Anthropic was no longer welcome as a federal contractor.\n\n“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again,” the president wrote in the post.\n\nNotably, the president’s post did not mention any plans to designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk, as had been previously mentioned as a consequence. However, a subsequent tweet from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made good on the threat.\n\n“In conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security,” Secretary Hegseth wrote. “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\n\nThe Pentagon dispute centered on Anthropic’s refusal to allow its AI models to be used to power either mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, which Secretary Hegseth found unduly restrictive.\n\nCEO Dario Amodei reiterated his stance in a public post on Thursday, refusing to compromise on the two points.\n\n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters — with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei wrote at the time. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.\n\nSuno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\n\nStill, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more."

            "content": "Others We Tested\n\nThere were multiple great bags we tried whose features or designs just didn't add up to a place in the top spots above. However, everyone has something different they're looking for in a toiletry bag, so while not perfect for us, some of these options may still be perfect for you.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nPatricks BB1 Bathroom Bag for $189: This crush-resistant, shock-absorbing rectangular bag is basically a heavier-duty, unisex version of the Flat Lay, below, except it costs four times as much. I tested it in the Triple Black colorway, which is “strictly limited to 1,000 pieces globally.” This one’s got two interior flaps with a slim, shallow zippered pouch on either side, but otherwise is just one big compartment that led to too much clinking and clanking of contents during my test. It’s great for full-sized products, but my testers and I all preferred bags that hold the products securely upright, as in the less expensive Parallelle Kit, above.\n\nFlat Lay Makeup Box Bag for $37: Available in opaque-fabric and clear (\"jelly\") styles, this unassuming pouch looks like a chubby rectangle with a handle on the end but actually unzips into a flat tray for easy access. There's only one compartment, so I didn't love it as a toiletry bag, but I did love it as a pool and beach accessory bag for sunscreen and makeup.\n\nMonos Metro Toiletry Case for $95: This durable, structured case, available in either nylon or vegan leather, exhibits the class and quality construction Monos is known for. It has one main roomy compartment with three small pockets inside; one zippered. It did a great job of protecting its contents while still being squishable enough to fit in a tightly packed carry-on, though I did find myself wishing it had a handle for carrying.\n\nCalpak Clear Cosmetics Case for $85: Constructed largely of water-resistant, wipe-clean PVC, this clear cosmetic case (I tested the Medium size) zips all the way around and folds flat to reveal two zippered compartments and one smaller zippered mesh bag. It also looks like a cute little purse with its 16 trendy color options, dual handles, and metal bottom studs. However, contents aren't as easy to access as other cosmetic bags that just open from the top—you have to lay the Calpak flat to open both sides, which requires a 16-by-10-inch footprint.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nVera Bradley Toiletry Bags for $30: The erstwhile must-have accessory of both early-aughts Southern sorority girls and their grandmothers, Vera Bradley bags are back with a new spokesperson (Zooey Deschanel), new designs, and updated fabrics like smooth twill and cotton gabardine. (Die-hard fans can rest assured that the staple quilted paisley options are still available.) The new line includes multiple styles of toiletry bags and makeup bags that are lightweight, giftable, and can add a pop of color and personality to your travel setup. I tested several, and my favorite was the Lay-Flat Travel Organizer—its two interior clear zippered compartments and three mesh slip pockets were roomy yet snug enough to keep all contents of my morning routine secure, and a rather large spill of soap in the large pocket cleaned up quickly. However, even though the fabric is padded, which provides some protection for the interior contents, the exterior is somewhat absorbent and not machine washable (though other designs are), so be forewarned that light-colored options could attract stains.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBagsmart Blast 4.5L Toiletry Bag for $30: This rectangular toiletry bag can sit on a counter (with about a 10 x 5-inch footprint) or hang with a 360-degree rotating hook. It's machine washable and has a bright orange interior for visibility, sporting five mesh pockets. Both my testers and I liked it a lot. The only thing that kept it from nabbing a top spot is how much space it took up when not hanging, and when it did hang, it stuck out more than the traditional flat hanging styles.\n\nBeis the Dopp Kit for $68: I’ve had Beis' Dopp Kit for four years now, and it’s still my go-to for any trip. The poly canvas material is durable and easy to spot-clean. Plus, I opted for the black version to mask the inevitable scuffs and smaller stains. What I love the most, though, are the compartments. The water-resistant section is a total game-changer when packing liquids or fragrances. If something leaks, a quick wipe gets the job done. The waterproof bottom is also a huge bonus when I’m getting ready at a bathroom sink. —Boutayna Chokrane\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nThule Aion Toiletry Bag for $65: This spacious, 5-liter bag with an 11 x 5-inch footprint features many thoughtful touches, including a wipe-clean interior with a rubbery, water-resistant bottom to protect it from wet countertops. (Though there's also a handy strap that snaps to hang on any-diameter hook or rack.) The sides snap down to compress, almost like a packing cube, and I like that it's squishable to fit into a smaller suitcase. It also comes with a removable translucent bag for taking liquids through the airport security line. However, it does take up a lot of space when not snapped down, and the waxed canvas does attract a lot of lines and marks, which may not be to everyone's aesthetic taste.\n\nNex Dopp for $73: The small and large Dopp kits I tested, part of Nex’s 2024 Hawaii collection, consisted of a roomy, single compartment with a dual zippered strip. They’re made of microfiber leather, which is a higher-quality synthetic leather, said to be softer and more durable. The bags were stiff and well-structured, which felt protective of my cosmetics when jammed into my carry-on. There is a slight synthetic smell from the microfiber leather, which is hard to miss, since you must lean your face quite close to the bag to see the contents in the cavernous single compartment. I also felt that when the bag was unzipped, the zippered strip was either in the way or had to be splayed out, which took up too much space on my tiny hotel-bathroom shelf. Otherwise, this is a fine option that offers both a lifetime warranty and an unlimited trade-in program.\n\nCotopaxi Nido Accessory Bag Cada Día for $50: Cotopaxi’s trim little bag is meant not just for hygiene items, but any collection of odds and ends. It’s made from light recycled deadstock nylon (so, probably not for you if you are carrying glass bottles or anything that needs padding) and weighs in at a modest 6.5 ounces. Your colorway will be unique! I like the surprisingly capacious 4-liter capacity spread over three different compartments, with a big middle compartment for your quart-size, TSA-approved bag of liquids and two other compartments with separate, smaller pockets. I do have to admit, though, that I like hooks better than loops, and hanging is more convenient with a clamshell toiletry bag design than with this one, which can't be hung while open. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nKusshi Hair Tools Bag for $89: Unlike similar bags that just bunch up your hair tools into a roll, this hair tool carrier has two organized pocket sections; a zippered pouch in the middle for hair products or, in my case while I was testing, attachments for my Shark FlexFusion; and a pocket on the outside for rubber bands or small accessories like lip balm. It's also made of neoprene that's heat-resistant up to 380 degrees Fahrenheit, so you don't have to worry about waiting for your tools to cool down before packing them away. Keep in mind, though, that the initial off-gassing is strong with this one—you may want to let it sit in a well-ventilated area for several days before packing it in your suitcase, lest it make everything else smell plasticky. This included the air from my hair dryer when I used it. There are also reports online of it not accommodating some Dyson tools, though it did fit an Airstrait and Corrale.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nAer Travel Kit 2 Ultra for $79: Does the average traveler need a toiletry bag made partially of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which is 15 times stronger than steel by weight? Perhaps not, but it definitely makes for an interesting bag. Part of Aer’s 10th Anniversary Ultra Collection, this hardy, chunky little Dopp kit incorporates the collection's Ultra400X fabric (in black only) by Challenge Sailcloth, known for its high-performance sails for yacht racers and kite surfers. Despite its strength, the Travel Kit is still pretty lightweight at 8 ounces. However, the hook is thick plastic and too small for a towel rack, and the rubbery “Aer” brand tags on the outside and inside seem to accumulate toothbrush and soap residue, as does the mesh zippered pouch in the top compartment. Both proved somewhat difficult to clean.\n\nEagle Creek Pack-It Trifold Toiletry Kit for $50: Eagle Creek's travel accessory game is extremely strong. Its toiletry bags, packing cubes, and various organizers are affordable, sturdy, and exceedingly well designed, and this toiletry bag is no exception. At first glance, it looks like two toiletry bags snapped together, but each side unzips to make a hanging organizer with six compartments. The only problem is that one side of the bag holds products upside down until it's unfurled, which led to items falling out in my tests.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nState Bags Benson Toiletry Kit for $65: This is a solid, simple bag with three mesh pouches and a snap-in/snap-out plastic envelope that can hold a toothbrush and toothpaste or shower items like soap. The navy version I tested had a coated polyester wipe-clean exterior and interior made from recycled bottles, and I liked that it had the option to hang. However, the organization was more rudimentary than similar-category bags we tested, and it was missing some of the thoughtful details featured on other bags in the same price range, like a quick-access pouch on the back and a larger hook with a rubber tip to prevent slipping. (This bag's thick, small plastic hook wasn't even wide enough to hang on a towel rack.)\n\nCuyana Travel Beauty Case for $298: Those still chasing the quiet luxury aesthetic will love this elegant zippered cosmetic case, available in black or pale pink. It’s made of high-end-feeling Italian pebbled leather both inside and out, with gold hardware and “Cuyana” discreetly printed on the bottom. It opens clamshell-style, and the lid contains a snap-close cover concealing a brush holder with elastic loops. A removable pouch snaps onto that lid cover, and the main compartment has a pocket for securing tubes, bottles, and small tools. Contents aren’t as immediately accessible as they are in other cosmetic cases I tested, but they are more secure. This bag is also on the heavy side, even for a cosmetics case, weighing in at 1.6 pounds, but if you can swing the price, this is a well-made, timeless investment for your travel arsenal.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nCincha the Toiletry Bag for $55: After testing nearly every style of toiletry bag in existence, I thought I had seen it all, but this thoughtfully designed bag from Cincha surprised me. The large size is essentially the tackle box of toiletry bags. It zips open in the middle to reveal four roomy compartments—two on each side, each topped with a small, translucent vinyl zippered pouch. I could not believe the amount of stuff I was able to fit into this thing, and yet I never had trouble closing it, despite packing it to the absolute max. I ended up taking it on a five-day getaway where I had to share a bathroom with two other people, and I found that I loved being able to flip it over and lift the “lid” of whatever side I needed, in order to keep the counter footprint small.\n\nJuly Hanging Toiletry Bag for $85: I own and love July's carry-on suitcase, so I was excited to try the brand's popular hanging toiletry bag. It's a great design with a zippered pouch on the back, plus a body that zips flat to reveal PVC and pouch zip compartments and a large, rubber-tipped metal hook that tucks away. It looks well-made and stylish with leather trim and gunmetal hardware, but my husband took it on a business trip and found that its pockets are actually quite small, confirming a worry I had when I tested it in my bathroom at home. It wouldn't be an issue if the bag itself were small, but it took up a full quarter of the carry-on.\n\nTumi Alpha Bravo Response Kit for $225: This rugged-looking, ballistic nylon bag has the classic Tumi Tracer inside to help facilitate its return to you if it gets lost, as well as an antimicrobial lining. It can hang, stand up, or lie flat and has several convenient internal pockets and an external zipped pouch. It's a lot of money for a toiletry bag with many of the same features as ones half the price, but if you're a Tumi fan and need a toiletry bag to match your luggage, you could do worse than this model.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBeautifect Go Mini for $177: WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe loved the larger Beautifect Box, and I tested the Mini to see if it would work for travel. While the smaller size does make it more portable (along with a purse-like carry strap), the multifunction lighted mirror and its battery made the lid top-heavy, so it kept flopping forward when I tried to use it on a soft, uneven surface like my lap or a bed. It's also got a very hard case and is a bit heavy at almost 2.5 pounds, so as much as I wanted to take it with me on a plane, I ended up bringing a smaller bag instead. Worth a buy if you want a makeup case with a lighted mirror, but it's definitely best for day trips.\n\nFjallraven Kanken Toiletry Bag for $60: I love this thing, which makes me feel like a Red Cross nurse on the battlefields of World War II. It’s made from a proprietary Fjallraven fabric blend that combines organic cotton with recycled polyester, so it feels like fabric but is more waterproof and durable. It has a clamshell design with a sturdy interior plastic hook. My quart bag of bottles goes into the enormous lower zip compartment, my toothbrush and deodorant in the top compartment, and there are mesh pockets and MOLLE webbing so that your tiny things are easily visible. However, its dimensions are very large, so this might not be for you if you’re a minimalist with just a toothbrush and a comb. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nTom Beckbe Canvas Dopp Kit for $195: Known for its high-end jackets, field hats, and vests for fishing and waterfowl hunting, Birmingham, Alabama-based sports outfitter Tom Beckbe also makes a Dopp kit made of full-grain distressed leather and the brand’s proprietary Field Canvas. It matches the genteel Southern vibe of Tom Beckbe’s collection of other travel bags and related accessories like camo whiskey totes and insulated shooting gloves. If the Marlboro Man ever left the ranch, this is definitely the Dopp kit he would have used. The only downside is that the bag is relatively large—and dark inside—for what’s essentially one compartment.\n\nEagle Creek Pack-It Isolate Quick Trip for $25: This little bag is a simple design, made from recycled bottles, with a zipper on the top and on the side. However, its light weight and semi-structured shape make it perfect for holding a wallet and keys at the gym, or even as a tech pouch for work purposes.\n\nKusshi Neoprene Wristlet Clutch for $39: It's a purse! It's a toiletry bag! It's a purse that doubles as a toiletry bag! This clutch is the perfect size for a larger phone, e-reader, or small tablet, with a couple of mesh pockets for makeup. I used it to tote a day's worth of makeup and skincare around town and found it was just heavy enough to be burdensome, but if you like the neoprene look and your essentials are lightweight, this clutch, like most Kusshi products, is sturdy and well-made.\n\nSympl Dopp Kit for $75: I liked this bag’s durable Cordura exterior and stow-away clip for hanging, as well as the fact it has a lifetime warranty. The bag opens clamshell-style to reveal four simple waterproof zip pockets—two thin and horizontal, one small rectangle, and one larger rectangle. It's an interesting idea, but in practice, this severely limits utility since a user is restricted to specific toiletry-sized products that fit the shape of each of the pockets. (My deodorant did not fit, nor did a toothbrush in a case.)\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBagsmart Paz Hanging Toiletry Bag for $35: With its stylish, padded exterior; generously sized carry handle; and ability to transport up to eight full-sized products, this one had me reaching for it long after the testing period was over. The thin, tipped metal hanger makes it easy to hang anywhere, and there's an easy-access compartment on the front with loops for makeup brushes or other long, thin items. In fact, this is almost a small toiletry briefcase rather than a bag—the whole thing unfurls into a 33-inch-long organizer with four separate compartments (two with sections to hold full-sized products). It will almost certainly be too much for anyone who likes to travel light, but if you check your luggage, will be on the road for a long time, or just don't want to deal with decanting your personal care products, this is a well-designed and easy-to-use solution.\n\nSaltyface Everywhere Bag for $36: Technically designed to store Saltyface self-tanners and bronzers, this puffy black fabric bag spent an indordinate amount of time on my counter, simply because I liked how it looked. Practically speaking, though, the handle was too small for an adult-sized hand, and I found myself becoming irritated with the single zipper pull, so it's not ideal as a general-purpose travel toiletry bag.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow I Test Toiletry Bags AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron For bags our team hasn’t already been using for years, I spend a four-week period rotating new toiletry bags during my morning routine. I note any annoyances or unique details, volume, how easy it is to store and retrieve items, how much space each one takes up on the vanity, how they survive being splashed with water and soap, and, if the bag can hang, how easy it is to retrieve items once hanging. About every three months, my family goes on trips that require stays in hotels. I always take different groups of bags and determine how easy it is to use multiple bags at once in a small space, if hook designs allowed for multiple places to hang, and whether the contents spilled in or otherwise dirtied the bags, and if so, how easy they are to clean. For bags I am not able to take on trips, I lend them to friends and family members who are traveling and take down their notes to consider alongside my own home testing. How Does WIRED Obtain Toiletry Bags for Testing? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Some toiletry bags are review samples requested from the manufacturer, while others are purchased and expensed. Review samples are only accepted without promise of editorial coverage. Toiletry bags chosen as picks are reused for durability testing purposes, while all other bags are donated upon completion of testing. What Kind of Toiletry Bag Do You Need? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Dopp kits, cosmetics cases, hanging bags … the differences between categories aren’t always clear. Here are some of the more common types of toiletry bags you'll come across, and what to consider with each. Dopp kit: Named for leather craftsman Charles Doppelt, who provided “Dopps,” or toiletry kits, for WWII soldiers. “Dopp kit” has evolved over time to indicate any kind of portable toiletry organizer, but commercially, toiletry bags labeled “Dopp kits” tend to be smaller and hold just a handful of necessities for short trips as opposed to larger fold-up hanging bags and cosmetics cases. Cosmetics case: Designed for those who need more than just the necessities, a cosmetics case is usually a much larger boxlike container with specialized compartments for makeup, skin care, hair care, and other necessities. They often come with extras like brush holders and mirrors. Hanging toiletry bag: A bag that, as the name indicates, comes with a hook so that it can be hung on a hook, towel rack, tree, or someplace it won’t take up space on the counter. Often, the user needs to hang them to be able to access all the storage compartments. Something to consider is that hooks can be used up quite quickly if everyone in your hotel room has a hanging bag. All the hooks in our bathroom were taken almost immediately, so my husband ended up having to hang his bag over the toilet, which he wasn’t thrilled about. A good hanging toiletry bag will also have a hook that's thin enough to slip over just about any hook, and be rubber-tipped so it won't slide off.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "Shopping for a MicroSD card can be a little daunting. There are a ton of numbers to consider, a huge number of brands producing cards with similar-sounding features and names, and words like Pro, Extreme, and Express getting thrown around everywhere.\n\nTo make a long story short, unless you're shooting a ton of photos and videos, and doing so even semiprofessionally where losing those shots might be detrimental to your professional reputation, you're fine to buy a MicroSD card from any company whose name you've heard before. I prefer cards from PNY, SanDisk, and Lexar. Keep an eye out for the “U” symbol with a 3 inside, or a “V30” on the card for the best balance of speed and price. There are two exceptions to that suggestion:\n\nIf you're shooting on a high-end camera, you should consider a V60 MicroSD card, if you can find one for a reasonable price. Some cameras have extra video features you can enable with a faster MicroSD card, so check your manual for more info on whether you need to upgrade.\n\nIf you're buying for a Nintendo Switch 2, you'll need an unfortunately more expensive MicroSD Express card. While you can transfer images and videos from your Switch 2 with most regular MicroSD cards, you'll need an Express version to use it for actually running games.\n\nCapacity\n\nHow much storage you need will largely depend on your needs, but there are a few things to consider when debating between 128 GB and 1 TB. The first is that MicroSD cards are tiny, and having to swap them out on the road can be a risky proposition. Costs tend to go up exponentially for 1 TB and 2 TB cards, but the gap between 256 GB and 512 GB isn't that large, so I recommend sizing up a bit.\n\nThe other factor is that storage sizes are also separated into different standards, so you'll want to make sure your device actually supports that larger card. Cards that are 64 GB are higher are technically “SDXC” for Extended Capacity, and are currently the most common type, and you should be able to use them in most modern situations.\n\nSpeed\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about MicroSD speeds, we have a write-up with a full explanation of the different speeds and how they interact, but I'll give you the quick rundown here too.\n\nEach MicroSD card will have its actual minimum sequential write speed indicated by a letter and number on the card. The number indicates the speed in MB/s, with the letter representing the generation. A C10, U1, and V10 are all essentially the same speed, just written differently, so you're likely to see multiple symbols printed on each card. I'd recommend checking out the SD Association's page on speeds with a handy chart showing the full comparison.\n\nIn practice, you have to go out of your way to find a MicroSD card that's slower than V30/U3 at most retailers, though you may find them included with some electronics that don't require anything more substantial."

            "content": "The idea of using a laptop cooling pad feels antiquated. These days, laptop chips have become extremely efficient. The fans on MacBooks (if they even have them) are barely used, and both Intel and Qualcomm are pushing efficiency on the Windows front.\n\nBut people keep buying laptop cooling pads, so surely there is a use case in 2026 that actually makes sense, right? I tried out a couple cooling pads paired with a couple of different gaming laptops, and walked away surprised at how effective they could be.\n\nDo Cooling Pads Actually Work?\n\nPhotograph: Luke Larsen\n\nLaptop cooling pads have been around for decades, and the idea has always been simple: provide extra air to blow through a laptop that’s otherwise restricted by its own cooling system. In theory, more air means lower temperatures—and, ultimately, better performance. This is the whole idea of the power modes that exist in Windows, which ramp up the RPMs (rotations per minute) of the fans to add more air to both improve performance. More than that, less heat also means a longer-lasting laptop that doesn't degrade as quickly over time. It’s by that same logic that laptop cooling pads offer help.\n\nThe problem, however, is that a cooling pad is a rather inefficient way of transferring air into your device. Most laptop cooling pads, including the two that I tested, use one large fan or two smaller fans to blast cold air across the bottom of the laptop. This is the first reason why the vast majority of modern laptops won’t benefit much from a cooling pad, as these laptops tend to only have vents along the hinge. Without vents or open holes, blowing air across a sheet of metal or plastic isn't going to do anything to cool the components on the other side. It'll only generate a bunch of fan noise.\n\nGaming laptops are the main exception, though, which is why they are the primary use case for such an accessory. Most gaming laptops have a few open vents, usually above the fans, like the Razer Blade 16, which is one of the laptops I used to test these cooling pads. Laptops like the Blade 16 are designed for intensive tasks like gaming, video editing, or local AI processing—and use a high-wattage GPU and CPU to get the kind of performance you need. My model has two of the most powerful laptop components on the market: the RTX 5090 and Ryzen 9 HX 370. As you might guess, they generate a lot of heat when cranked up. Modern chips tend to max out at 100 degrees Celsius, before throttling back performance to bring down temperatures.\n\nMost laptops use fans to cool these components, but the thickness of the laptop chassis is also a determining factor in how much the system will need to throttle back performance to keep temperatures down. In the end, it's geometry and physics, and every millimeter of space in the laptop chassis has an effect on how cool it can keep its internal components. And unlike in a large desktop PC, you have very restricted space. That's especially true in the modern era, where even gaming laptops have become increasingly thin."

            "content": "Congressional Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee released a report this week pinpointing more than $20.9 billion in consumer losses stemming from identity theft that came out of four major breaches of data broker firms. US senator Maggie Hassan launched the investigation in August after an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, copublished by WIRED, found that some data brokers were hiding opt-out tools from Google and other search engines.\n\nThe US Department of Justice’s recent release of 3 million documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein included grand jury subpoenas to Google that shed light on how federal investigators interact with tech companies and how they respond to government requests for information.\n\nThe Mexican drug cartel CJNG may survive the killing of its longtime leader Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes in part thanks to its prolific use of technologies like drones, social media, and AI. Meanwhile, the Mexican Navy announced on Thursday that it had seized a semi-submersible vessel carrying nearly 4 tons of cocaine as part of a recent initiative to deter drug trafficking in the Pacific Ocean. The effort comes as the US has launched its own purported campaign against maritime trafficking via a series of deadly attacks on boats in the Caribbean.\n\nMeanwhile, as AI assistant agents like OpenClaw explode in popularity—and sow chaos around the web—a new open source project called IronCurtain is using a unique design to secure and constrain agentic AI before it can go rogue.\n\nAnd there’s more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nSetting an autonomous internet-enabled robot loose in your house should give anyone a moment’s pause. When that robot is a roving vacuum cleaner equipped with a camera and microphone that could be hijacked from anywhere in the world with nothing more than its serial number, it becomes an actual privacy horror story.\n\nOne such robovac owner, Sammy Azdoufal, discovered that absurd security vulnerability while attempting an experiment in piloting his DJI Romo robot vacuum cleaner with a PS5 controller. He found that he could instead control 6,700 of the robots in 24 countries around the world, with full access to the floor plans they generated of their owners’ homes and their video and audio feeds. When The Verge contacted Azdoufal, he was able to instantly access a Romo owned by a staffer at the tech news outlet just by knowing its 14-digit serial number. DJI has now fixed the vulnerability in response to Azdoufal essentially live-tweeting his findings. But the story nonetheless raises serious questions about the security of other audio- or video-enabled internet-of-things gadgets—not to mention ones capable of freely roaming your home.\n\nWhile the Department of Homeland has been hugely empowered under the Trump administration in its mission to deport millions of immigrants, the organization within DHS that serves as the United States’ primary cyber defender, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, has been neglected. Now its acting director, Madhu Gottumukkala, has been replaced as CISA seeks to find new footing.\n\nEven before that news, CyberScoop this week reported on the crises that have plagued the agency for the entire first year since Trump’s inauguration: A third of the staff has been laid off and entire divisions of the agency have been closed. Nominations for a permanent director have been blocked in Congress. Its capabilities have withered, and organizations that had sought out CISA for assistance and partnerships have looked elsewhere. Gottumukkala has suffered his own more personal scandals such as ousting security personnel after he failed a polygraph test and sharing sensitive contracts on ChatGPT. Now Nick Andersen, who has served as CISA’s executive director for cybersecurity, will replace Gottumukkala at the beleaguered agency.\n\nA researcher at King’s College London pitted three popular large language models against each other in simulated war game scenarios and found that, 95 percent of the time, at least one of the models opted to deploy tactical nuclear weapons. The researcher also found, when an AI model deployed a tactical nuclear weapon, its AI opponent only deescalated a fourth of the time. None of the companies behind the three models—OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic—responded to New Scientist’s request for comment.\n\nAI’s role in war-fighting has lurched into the spotlight this week. Anthropic and the Department of War are embroiled in a contract dispute over whether Anthropic’s AI models can be used to power fully autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance. Dario Amodei, Anthropic’s CEO, wrote in a statement that these types of use cases “can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.” In turn, President Donald Trump has threatened to ban the use of Anthropic products, including its Claude chatbot, within the US government. Meanwhile, hundreds of Google and OpenAI employees have signed an open letter asking for their bosses to “put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War's current demands for permission to use our models for domestic mass surveillance and autonomously killing people without human oversight.”\n\nA new app for Android phones called Nearby Glasses lets users scan for smart glasses in your vicinity, revealing the presence of the wearable gadgets, which are sometimes indistinguishable from normal glasses and let wearers record people without their knowledge. The app scans for the unique Bluetooth signatures that the glasses emit, and sends users a notification if it detects a nearby source.\n\nThe developer told 404 Media that he was inspired to build the app after reading about several incidents involving smart glasses. Over the summer, 404 Media reported that a Customs and Border Protection agent had donned a pair during an immigration raid, and this fall the outlet also reported that men were using smart glasses to film massage parlor workers, seemingly without their knowledge or consent. In February, The New York Times reported that one smart-glasses developer, Meta, had plans to integrate face recognition into its glasses, spurring fresh concerns among privacy experts."

            "content": "As a vegan, my choices for plant-centric meal kits are, let's say, limited, compared to the extremely omnivorous WIRED reviewer Matthew Korfhage, who has tested nearly two dozen meal kits with everything from spicy shrimp to garlic filet mignon and plum pork loin.\n\nI've tested several plant-based meal kits, which, unlike normal meal kits, are often much more expensive than my usual produce-heavy weekly grocery haul, and also seriously limited in their rotating plant-based or vegetarian options.\n\nAll this to say, I was pleasantly surprised when I tried EveryPlate's vegetarian fare for a week. Each meal came to $7 per serving for two people for four meals, but oftentimes the leftovers ended up stretching over several meals. (There's a discount running at the time of writing, with each serving going for $3—which is almost ramen pricing these days.) In total, my first box of four meals ended up being $56 without discount and $24 with the first-time discount (not including shipping cost of $11), and fed me for almost the entire week. That's cheaper than my usual weekly grocery bill at Trader Joe's in NYC.\n\nAlthough EveryPlate meals could be boring, with a pasta or rice base and lots of cheese, each was tasty enough that I actually looked forward to eating the leftovers. I was actually excited to make (and eat) the next planned meal—a rarity in my time testing meal kits, to be honest.\n\nPlan, Preferences, and Picking Process\n\nCourtesy of EveryPlate\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist EveryPlate Meal Kit Shop at EveryPlate\n\nAfter testing many meal kits, one thing I've grown to appreciate is transparency when it comes to meal choices and price. EveryPlate has both. At a regular price of $7 a serving plus shipping, HelloFresh's budget offering, EveryPlate, is still the lowest-cost meal kit either Korfhage or I have tested; it's cheaper than other budget choices, and even meal kits for toddlers.\n\nEveryPlate is much like parent HelloFresh, but stays cheaper by relying more on simple, grain-heavy dishes, like pasta or rice with a hero flavor. EveryPlate's choices leaned more safe and appealing to the masses; no meal was as adventurous as Purple Carrot, or as health-conscious as Thistle. Each meal I tested took about one hour to prep and cook, although the directions said it would take only 20 to 30 minutes (except for the pizzas I made). And each meal was listed in the 500- to 1,200-calorie range. Because there was limited information on the recipe card (more on that below), it was unclear if the calorie count was total or per serving.\n\nWhen you order, you start out selecting meal type preferences, like Smart & Fit (calorie-conscious meals), Quick & Easy, Family Faves, and Veggie, so that EveryPlate shows you the most relevant recipes first. You can also see EveryPlate's weekly menu to get a better idea of future meal selections and weekly choices. I appreciated EveryPlate's transparency, considering about half of the meal kits I've tested don't allow you to see selections until after you sign up and input payment information. If you don't like their choices after you've paid, you're SOL."

            "content": "It's boom time for water filters, ever since the EPA announced that as many as 10 percent of US water systems may have unsafe levels of PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals,” in the water. Lead pipes are still all over the place, even if they're no longer in Flint, Michigan, as of July 2025. Heck, there are maybe heavy metals in the groundwater, depending where you are, and bottled water risks excess microplastics.\n\nI don't say this to panic you. Your drinking water is probably in compliance with federal standards, and only around 4 percent of water systems end up with unsafe contaminant levels, according to an EPA study in 2020. This said, local water systems won't have to comply with the new federal PFAS and PFOA maximums for drinking water until 2031.\n\nIn response to worries about the water supply, a whole new generation of water filters are making wondrous promises about reductions in contaminants: chlorine, PFAS, heavy metals, stray pharmaceuticals like acetaminophen, fluoride if that's a worry for you. Some of these are whole-home or under-sink reverse osmosis systems. Others are simple countertop systems, gravity-fed through mesh or carbon or other filters.\n\nSo how do you sort out which water claims are credible? I've been testing water filters since 2024, often using chemical indicators and equipment, and can attest that it isn't always easy. Here's a quick guide to checking up on that water filter that caught your eye.\n\nWhat Are NSF/ANSI Water Filter Standards?\n\nThe first main sources of comfort for me when assessing water filters are certifications and independent testing. Vague claims of 99 percent reduction in chlorine or PFAS or arsenic are harder to trust if the testing is internal to the company itself. To be credible, any claims of third-party testing should also clearly identify the lab that conducted the testing.\n\nThe most reliable, standardized form of certification is testing against NSF/ANSI standards. The NSF, formerly called the National Sanitation Foundation, is a Michigan-based, nongovernmental nonprofit founded in 1944 that develops and verifies adherence to a number of different testing standards—including those for water filters. ANSI, or the American National Standards Institute, is an independent nonprofit that accredits accreditation and testing organizations like the NSF.\n\nThere are three main NSF/ANSI standards that apply to filters for home drinking water.\n\nNSF-ANSI 42: Drinking Water Treatment Units—Aesthetic Effects.\n\nThis certifies removal of substances that aren't considered harmful but may affect cosmetics or taste of the water. This includes the chlorine and chloramine used by cities to disinfect drinking water.\n\nThis certifies removal of substances that aren't considered harmful but may affect cosmetics or taste of the water.

NSF/ANSI 53: Drinking Water Treatment Units—Health Effects\n\nThis certifies removal of any number of compounds thought to be harmful, including lead, arsenic, PFAS, and others. Each compound is tested individually, among more than 50 possible contaminants.\n\nThis certifies removal of any number of compounds thought to be harmful, including lead, arsenic, PFAS, and others. Each compound is tested individually, among more than 50 possible contaminants. NSF/ANSI 401: Emerging Compounds/Incidental Contaminants\n\nThis certifies filtering of compounds that are “emerging” as potential concerns, including pharmaceuticals, herbicides, and pesticides.\n\nIf you have the item in hand, these may be marked on the box. But don't assume certification is the norm. Among shower water filters in particular, only one filter received certification from NSF for free chlorine removal: the Weddell Duo."

            "content": "“I don't like talking to you wearing that. It's intimidating.”\n\nA friend said this to me—and he's not joking. His name is Stuart. Stuart is about as affable a person as you could wish to meet, and we have skied together three or four times. Now, however, he doesn't want anything to do with me. I haven't upset him, we are on good terms—but he hates what I've got on my head. By the end of the week, so do I.\n\nThe intimidating headgear I'm wearing is the Ruroc RG2. It is, according to Ruroc, the world’s only full-face snowsports helmet—and now I can fully understand why, despite initially thinking it looked like the ideal lid to replace my aging POC. On paper, the RG2 should be a winner, despite a starting price of $379 (making it more expensive than nearly all of WIRED's picks in our ski helmet guide). Only when you wear it do the drawbacks become abundantly clear.\n\nThe RG2 is actually an ISPO Award-winning helmet. It has a built-in Twiceme NFC chip, so you can store critical medical information that can be easily accessed by first responders in emergencies. To protect your noggin, it's lined with Rheon, a breathable, energy-absorbing polymer (originally conceived from a NASA project looking at space shuttle foam replacements) that's flexible in its natural state but instantly stiffens on impact.\n\nFor even more outlay, there's an optional JBL-powered Cardo Communication System that lets you stream music, take calls, connect with a GoPro, and chat with up to 15 other equally intimidating Ruroc users on a mesh network.\n\nThe big boon of the RG2 over the original RG1, however, comes down to a simple tweak in this updated design. In the RG1, you secured the lower face plate using plastic clips that slid—usually unwillingly—into place. It worked, but any supposed cool factor for wearers was immediately ruined as others watched them attempt to wrestle those clips into place with no helpful mirrors on hand outside your average ski lift or mountain restaurant. The solution? Magnets. Ruroc finally made that call after sifting through “15 years of direct feedback.\"\n\nSloping off: The RG2's full-face setup proved to be a look not conducive to social skiing. Photograph: Jeremy White\n\nGone are the plastic clips and in comes the Magnetic Mask System, which “lets users easily remove the helmet’s chin piece while wearing gloves.” Trouble is, taking the chin piece off was never the problem. Putting the darn thing on was the issue. Still, this new magnetic system is definitely easier, but it's by no means foolproof, and you will still likely have to take two or three stabs at getting it locked in each time you want to add it to the helmet."

Explosions have subsequently been heard in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, in what appeared to be retaliatory Iranian strikes.\n\nIn an eight-minute video posted to Truth Social and X, Trump said the operation’s objective was to “defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement confirming the military operation and said Israel was aiming to “remove the existential threat posed” by Iran.\n\nThe strikes on Iran, which have been called Operation Epic Fury by the so-called US Department of War and Operation Roaring Lion by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), reportedly hit multiple cities across the country.

            "content": "I could go on for hours about all the latest high-tech features in security cameras, including AI summaries, magnetic mounts and privacy zones. But all those extras can get overwhelming, especially if you're trying to ignore the clutter and save money.\n\nDespite all their advances, security cameras still come with unnecessary features, and that's an advantage if you know where to look. You can simplify your setup and save cash by ignoring add-ons, no matter how much they're advertised. Here's my take on the least useful home security camera features -- and why you can skip them.\n\nPan/tilt capabilities\n\nI've seen good pan/tilt cameras, but it's not a feature most homes need. Tyler Lacoma/CNET\n\nPan/tilt features aren't always bad news -- some of my top-reviewed cameras include the ability, giving them nearly 360 degrees of viewing range and tracking. The problem is that most home cameras don't actually need that capability.\n\nUnless you're watching over a very, very large space or have your camera set up in the middle of an open floor plan (a very awkward placement for homes), you don't really need pan/tilt options. Today's cameras typically offer fields of view wider than 130 degrees, so with the right placement, you can capture most of a large room or backyard.\n\nSkipping pan/tilt features can make cameras both more affordable and more durable. Add in motion detection with person recognition, and you should be set with a watchful cam that lets you know what's going on. Pan/tilt is a better option only if the camera is wired -- such as to a junction box or outdoor outlet -- and doesn't have a clear view of your access points.\n\nNVR support\n\nThere are many wireless and wired security cameras that not longer need or benefit from NVRs. Eufy\n\nNVRs -- or network video recorders -- were common parts of very early security systems because they didn't really have any other way to capture and manage lots of video footage. Today, an NVR for home security cameras is largely unnecessary and, I'd argue, a significant drawback.\n\nNot only are these extra hubs bulky, expensive and limited in what they can do, they're also outclassed by today's microSD cards for local storage, which can hold over 1TB of video. Add the wireless video management that mobile apps offer, and NVRs are best reserved for specific commercial applications.\n\nPlus, NVR systems are often designed to use a PoE camera system, which requires much more installation work and isn't suitable for the average home unless you really want to avoid all wireless signals.\n\nProtective enclosures\n\nUnless you live very, very far north, a camera enclosure won't do you much good. Andrew Wevers/Stringer via Getty Images\n\nToday's outdoor security cameras typically have IP64/IP65 weather resistance ratings, which means they can handle most outside conditions. An enclosure to protect the camera is both more work to clean and unnecessary in all but the most blizzardy climates. Also, it can be difficult to find a camera housing that fits your specific model.\n\nIf you're worried about someone damaging your home security camera -- say, with a baseball bat -- that scenario is so rare it's not worth paying extra for a protective enclosure unless you have evidence it's happening in your neighborhood. A nearby family of starlings is likely to cause more problems, in which case you may want a camera cover for around $20.\n\nLTE connections\n\nLTE cameras work well in remote locations, but they're unnecessary for most homes. John Larsen/CNET\n\nLTE cameras have built-in SIM card slots, allowing them -- like your phone -- to connect to cell towers and use a data plan to transmit video (along with the added fees). That's a great option for remote locations, but probably not necessary for your home.\n\nToday's wireless security cameras offer very healthy Wi-Fi ranges suitable for all kinds of homes and Wi-Fi routers. The extra costs of an LTE camera are worth it for construction sites or off-grid cabins, but a poor fit for your backyard. If you get very frequent blackouts that knock out your Wi-Fi, you're better off investing in a powerful home backup battery than spending money on an LTE cam.\n\n4K resolution\n\nGenerally, a 2K camera is the most resolution your home needs. Lorex\n\nA 4K camera offers much higher resolution, which means more detail on your security videos. I know that sounds like a high-value upgrade -- I even have a list of the best 4K cameras for those interested -- but it's not beneficial in the same way as 4K resolution is in your monitor or TV screen.\n\nI'd skip 4K not just to save money, but because it consumes more bandwidth for live viewing and often requires additional storage for video clips. It can also introduce higher latency, which may lead to lag or visual glitches. Many cameras let you switch to a lower resolution to address those issues, but at that point, what's the benefit of paying for 4K in the first place?\n\nThat's why some of the latest and most powerful cameras I've tested, including late 2025 models from Google Nest, Arlo and Blink, stick with a 2K resolution, which I'd say is the sweet spot for security cam resolution. Save 4K for commercial cameras or very specific use cases where lots of detail is mandatory.\n\nSpotlights\n\nSpotlights are usually outclassed by floodlights, making it smarter to either upgrade or skip the feature entirely. Ring\n\nSpotlights occupy an awkward space in home security. Security cameras are often installed in areas that already have porch lights or other nearby illumination. And if not, modern night vision typically delivers excellent results without added lighting. If you do want illumination -- or the \"scare\" factor to deter trespassers -- a floodlight camera is almost always the better option. Battery-powered spotlight cams also tend to drain much faster when the light repeatedly triggers.\n\nThose factors mean it's usually better to choose a floodlight camera, opt for a model without a spotlight or simply turn the light off altogether. There aren't many situations where a spotlight is truly necessary. It could make sense for a dark entryway or a set of shadowy patio steps as a safety feature, but in most cases, it's an add-on you can skip.\n\nWhat about cloud storage?\n\nCloud storage and local storage both have their place. Tapo\n\nCloud storage isn't a useless feature, but its value depends heavily on your camera and your preferred setup. Some cameras rely solely on cloud storage, which may offer only limited access -- such as Nest's six-hour event history -- or require a subscription to unlock full functionality, such as Arlo's $8-per-month Secure plan. Others include a microSD card slot or an optional hub for local storage, which carries a higher upfront cost but avoids ongoing fees. And some cameras offer both options.\n\nCloud and local storage each have their benefits. Local storage is cheaper in the long run and better for privacy, but it's more difficult to share, and you'll have to clear out your local storage occasionally. Cloud storage is convenient, enables more advanced AI features like video searches and lets you download any video you want, but it comes at a higher price. People may also worry about security companies sharing cloud videos with law enforcement or getting hacked, which are legitimate concerns.\n\nOkay, what about the new AI features?\n\nWhen enabled, Gemini for Home adds a new type of watchfulness to security cameras. Tyler Lacoma/CNET\n\nSince advanced generative AI features -- such as object recognition that creates video summaries -- are currently limited to higher-tier subscriptions, they aren't the focus of this list. Instead, I've focused on the more tangible features you'll see on a security camera's box or product page, and which of those don't add much value.\n\nFor more info, check out the worst places to put your camera and what useless features to avoid if you want a full security system, too."

            "content": "Most receivers over $500 include Dolby Atmos capability, but you don’t need to buy height speakers straight away. You can always add them later.\n\nAll modern components use the universal HDMI standard and so you should choose a receiver that has as many of these inputs as possible. If you’re a gamer choose one which has HDMI 2.1 so it can transmit 4K/120Hz to a TV as well.\n\nIf you’re looking for a Dolby Atmos receiver, the minimum number of channels is seven -- which is written as either 7.1 or 5.1.2 channels). Power specs are mostly made up, but anything over 100 watts per channel in stereo is good.\n\nCNET staff -- not advertisers, partners or business interests -- determine how we review products and services. If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nIf you’re serious about bringing theater-like sound into your home, an AV receiver is the best choice. A receiver has many roles: It acts as an HDMI switch between components like a streaming box or gaming console and your TV, and it also decodes and amplifies audio signals so you can hear them through your speakers.\n\nThe best receivers offer excellent sound quality and come equipped with features like 8K video, Dolby Atmos and music streaming capabilities. You don't need to go for the full surround sound system, either, as you can start with as little as a pair of stereo speakers and then add rear speakers and a subwoofer later. This will enable you to get the best movie, TV show and music performance to suit your budget.\n\nI've tested many of the big-name brands in sound, including Denon, Sony and Yamaha, to discover which receivers deliver the best sound. With more than 20 years of home entertainment experience, I've personally had hands-on time with each of the models included on this list and reviewed them based on price, features, sound quality and performance.\n\nBest AV receivers of 2026\n\nTy Pendlebury/CNET Photo Gallery 1/1 Ty Pendlebury/CNET Best AV receiver overall Onkyo TX-NR6100 8.3 /10 SCORE Pros One of the best music streaming suites\n\nExcellent home theater performance\n\nFun to use\n\nCompatible with Xbox Series X/4K 120Hz signals Cons Not as dynamic with music The Onkyo TX-NR6100 is my top choice because it's an excellent-sounding receiver at an affordable price. It has a particular knack for Dolby Atmos soundtracks with an expansive, yet detailed sound, and it's also very good at playing back music. It also offers plenty of streaming audio support, so it's ready to entertain as soon as you hook up the Wi-Fi. The TX-NR6100 is a 7 x 100-watt-per-channel receiver with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support. It includes six HDMI inputs at the back, with three able to pass 8K video; the remaining three ports include HDR10 and Dolby Vision compatibility. Vinyl is still in the middle of a revival, and the NR6100 enables users to take advantage thanks to a dedicated phono input for turntables and record players that lack an onboard phono preamp. Streaming options include Google Cast, DTS Play-Fi, Spotify Connect, Sonos, AirPlay and Bluetooth. Though you can pay much more, or even much less, the Onkyo TX-6100 offers the best mix of usability and performance for the money. ...

Like its budget-oriented label mate, the TX-NR6100, it's stacked with features including the audiophile-level calibration called Dirac Live, as well as the best streaming suite offered in an AV receiver. On that point, being able to request songs directly from Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa is a real boon. What improvements does the $1,699 TX-RZ50 offer over the $800 TX-NR6100? Firstly, it offers double the number of 8K compatible inputs (six versus three) plus it boasts more power (120 watts versus 100 watts). It also has two-way Bluetooth for streaming as well as listening on wireless headphones. The TX-RZ50's performance was excellent, whether listening to streamed music or watching a movie: I hadn't heard Dolby Atmos sound this convincing in a long time. The addition of Dirac Live does pose its own complexities in setup -- please, only use the Onkyo Controller mobile app in combination with the supplied microphone -- but doing so rewards with a highly involving performance. ...

As it turns out, this Yamaha offers even better build quality and a huge, cinematic sound. Look through the fancy top grille and you'll see neatly packed components and a distinguished, stamped transformer. The system is capable of a beefy 110 watts per channel (stereo) and has seven HDMI ports for your connectivity needs. I tested the Yamaha A4A against the Onkyo RZ50 and the older Denon X3700. The Yamaha's sound quality tended toward the cinematic rather than the musical, and it offered a big, roomy sound perfect for blockbusters or conspiracy thriller TV shows. What was surprising is that the onboard phono preamp was even better than the one on the rival Onkyo RZ50, so I can recommend the Yamaha for people who don't want a separate preamp for their turntable. The Yamaha is great as a home theater receiver but doesn't sound as good with music streaming. Still, as the Onkyo offers balanced performance across both, it's my current favorite. ...

The Sony STR-AN1000 is a 7.2-channel Dolby Atmos receiver that offers a whole host of new features, including HDMI 2.1 (4K/120Hz) support and Sony's own 360 Reality Audio. It boasts superb connectivity with six HDMI inputs (two with 8K compatibility) and two 8K outputs. The receiver also includes support for video standards such as Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG for high-resolution gaming. As far as analog inputs, the Sony offers four, though it does lack a dedicated phono input. The Sony also has one of the most sophisticated setup routines yet, so dialing in great sound is even easier. It offers an upgraded version of its calibration routine, now called Digital Cinema Auto Calibration IX. This involves a new stereo microphone and a natty plastic stand -- where competitors' are cardboard -- and it now accommodates multiple seating positions. If you prefer to do a manual AV receiver calibration, then the system is quite powerful, as it now lets you set the height of the screen and speakers; most receivers do not let you do this. But the main reason to buy it is its outstanding performance, especially for video games. ...

The Onkyo TX-NR6100 is the best receiver for most needs Ty Pendlebury/CNET If you're spending under $1,000, there are four main receivers to choose from -- the Sony STR-AN1000, the Yamaha RX-V6A, the Onkyo TX-NR6100 and the Denon AVR-970H. All offer excellent performance, so the short answer about which to buy is whichever is available for the lowest price. At the moment, that is either the Denon or the Onkyo, and I especially recommend the Onkyo TX-NR6100 for its combination of excellent performance and connectivity. The Onkyo offers easy setup, excellent usability, solid looks and useful features, including the best streaming suite (alongside Sony). As an added plus, the Onkyo was never prone to the 4K issue that plagued early versions of the Yamaha RX-V6A. Meanwhile, the step-up Onkyo TX-RZ50 is an excellent receiver if you're looking for the next level of features and a performance bump over sub-$1,000 models. It offers an excellent, if slightly scary, calibration routine from Dirac Live and the best number of streaming features on the market. It sounds great with music and movies alike. Lastly, if it's home theater thrills you're after, the Yamaha RX-A4A offers crisp, dynamic sound and fantastic build quality for $1,300.\n\nFactors to consider when buying an AV receiver AV receivers are notoriously complex, with reams of features and confusing technical specifications. (For example, what's 4K/120Hz anyway?) Yet, what are the things that really matter when buying a new model? I'm going to sum up the most important ones right here. HDMI inputs With most TVs and set-top boxes supporting HDMI, you should buy a receiver that has as many of these HDMI input ports and outputs as possible. Front-mounted HDMI ports are kind of like a human appendix -- unneeded, because most users don't hot-plug HDMI devices -- making the number of rear inputs what's most important. (How else are you going to connect your Roku, Blu-ray player, Nintendo Switch and all your other devices?) The Onkyo TX-NR6100 and Denon AVR-S970H have six rear-mounted HDMI inputs, while the Yamaha RX-V6A goes one better with seven. If you want to connect two different displays -- a TV and a projector, for example -- all but the Yamaha offer a second HDMI output. You should also be sure you have an extra HDMI cable or two on hand -- these things are like the second sock of a pair as you can never find them when you need them. Dolby Atmos capability Most receivers in the $500-and-above price range include Dolby Atmos capability and DTS:X, but the effect these formats have on your home theater movie-watching can be subtle, or in most movies, nonexistent. In other words, don't worry about missing out on these formats by not installing a ceiling-pointing speaker or two. Mounting your rear surround speakers high on the wall will get you halfway there in terms of quality, immersive sound. WiFi music streaming Most midrange receivers have onboard Wi-Fi network connectivity for wireless music streaming via your speaker system. There are plenty of standards for wireless streaming services, but the most universal are Spotify Connect, Apple AirPlay and Google Cast. If you're looking to build a multiroom system with a variety of AV systems and speakers with wireless connectivity, these are the three flavors to aim for. Onkyo and Sony are the only devices to support all three. The Denon receiver model lacks wireless streaming via Google but ups the ante to AirPlay 2 and the proprietary HEOS system. Meanwhile, Yamaha has its own MusicCast system.\n\nHow CNET tests AV receivers The CNET Audio Lab in downtown Manhattan where I test turntables, soundbars, and AV receivers side-by-side Ty Pendlebury At CNET, I test audio equipment from compact soundbars to surround sound systems, but regardless of the device, my methodology is the same. I always compare products against one or more reference devices that offer the best performance at a similar price. When it comes to receivers I want to see how well a system performs with music and movies, as most people will want to do both. I watch test scenes from 4K Blu-ray or streamed from a 4K streaming service (Fandango at Home, for example) and evaluate aspects such as Dolby Atmos surround sound performance and dialog clarity. I also use several test music tracks and test streaming features such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Systems that can perform well with both types of entertainment inevitably score the highest. Check out CNET's receiver buying guide for more about the features and things you should consider when looking for a new system.\n\nOther AV receivers I tested The Denon AVR A10H is a 13.4-channel receiver. Ty Pendlebury/CNET Denon AVR-A10H ($5,199): If you hear the words \"home theater\" and think \"dedicated room with a screen and leather recliners,\" then the AVR-A10H is the kind of receiver you would use to power it. It has all of the features you need, including Dolby Atmos, music streaming, 4K/120Hz on all seven HDMI inputs and more. While it sounds good -- I tested it powering a set of Klipsch Fortes -- the combination of a high price and 13(!) powered channels may be too much for most living rooms. Yamaha RX-V6A Ty Pendlebury/CNET Yamaha RX-V6A ($599): This Yamaha RX-V6A offers a fresh look at AV receiver design, with its futuristic edges and simple controls, while maximizing sound quality. The Yamaha might even make you forget about visiting a cinema ever again, and it's no slouch with music, either. It offers plenty of connectivity with Wi-Fi bringing AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, Bluetooth and Yamaha's MusicCast system for streaming from your devices. Notably, the TSR-700 is identical, and it was an exclusive model for some outlets. Find out more in CNET's Yamaha RX-V6A review. Denon AVR-X3800 ($1,699) Denon has a reputation for quality sound and powerful amplification, and the AVR-X3800 will be able to power most systems with ease. In terms of features, the Denon has everything you need in a modern receiver including Dolby Atmos and six 8K HDMI inputs. Based on my head-to-head testing, I found that the Denon was even-handed with movies and music, but not as good as the equivalent Marantz SR6015 with music or as good at home theater as my current pick, the Onkyo RZ50. Read CNET's first take on the Denon AVR-X3800."

            "content": "Every year, the moment we witness the very earliest signs of spring, CNET takes its cue to decamp to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress.\n\nThis is the world's most important mobile show, and one of the most exciting events in the tech calendar. This year, we're sending a bigger team to bring you all the news from the show as it happens.\n\nIt's set to be a bonanza of new phones and wearables, with the odd robot thrown in for good measure. Sure, some of the fun tech we see at MWC never makes it out into the wider world, but we've also seen some of our most beloved tech debut at the show over the years -- so expect a little of both.\n\nBig themes are set to include AI and 6G, and with keynotes from SpaceX and Qualcomm, we'll no doubt get a solid glimpse of the future of mobile. With Gemini in everything and satellite dominance on the horizon, it's an exciting time for the industry.\n\nHere's more of what we expect to see.\n\nWhat are the key dates for MWC?\n\nMWC 2026 is set to run from March 2 to 5, although we'll be in town a couple of days beforehand to report on some of the big launch events scheduled for this weekend. Don't miss Xiaomi's launch event on Feb. 28 and Honor's event on March 1.\n\nHow to watch along\n\nNo matter how far away you live from Spain, there's no need to feel like you're missing out. The best place for all the latest MWC news is on our CNET live blog.\n\nWe've been attending this show for decades (this is MWC's 20th year in Barcelona, by the way), and we have a team of experienced reporters and reviewers on the ground.\n\nWe'll show you everything we deem interesting and important, and we're not just admiring new products from afar. We're touching, tinkering with and trying not to drop them, so be sure to follow us across Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, X and YouTube, too.\n\nWhat phones to expect at MWC 2026\n\nFor the past few years, Chinese phone-makers have dominated MWC, and 2026 looks to be no different.\n\nThe first big phone launch event is scheduled for 6 a.m. PT Saturday, Feb. 28, when we expect Xiaomi to unveil its latest camera-focused flagship. We loved the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and the 14 Ultra before it, so we're excited to see what the company has in store for us. A teaser image hints at its partnership with premium camera brand Leica and promises a \"new wave of imagery.\"\n\nThe Honor Magic V6 will be available in red. Honor\n\nNext up, we have Honor on Sunday, March 1, when the company has said it will unveil its Magic V6 phone, alongside the MagicPad 4 and MagicBook Pro 14. Perhaps more exciting still, Honor has said it will give us a first glimpse of a working version of its Robot Phone, and will also unveil a humanoid robot at its event.\n\nFor other phone-makers, MWC is likely to serve as more of a victory lap for its existing devices -- particularly Samsung, which held its own event in San Francisco this week to unveil the flagship S26 series. Motorola will be in town, likely showing off its Razr, which just like the Samsung Galaxy TriFold, has yet to be seen much in Europe.\n\nOn the whole, MWC 2026 is likely to be a big show for foldable phones, which, according to Ben Wood, CMO and chief analyst at CCS Insight, \"is now becoming quite a mature category.\"\n\nAnother major trend in the phone space is likely to be a focus on batteries, particularly silicon carbon-based tech, Wood said in an MWC preview session. \"We're expecting to see phones with some of the biggest batteries we've seen for a long time, [with] fast charging -- perhaps 300-watt charging -- being introduced,\" he added.\n\nWhat other tech to expect at MWC 2026\n\nAfter the early flops that were the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1, we're seeing more companies moving to jump on the wearable AI bandwagon. We expect to see a number of devices and demos pop up at MWC -- perhaps trying to beat OpenAI and Jony Ive to the punch.\n\nThis will include AI- and AR-based glasses, said CCS Insight analyst Ben Hatton during the firm's briefing session. \"We are expecting to see a huge number of glasses on show this year, not just from Meta, but also from the smaller players, [like] TCL and Oppo, looking to take a slice of the pie,\" he said.\n\nOne of the key challenges for these companies will be differentiation, Hatton said. \"Ultimately, there's still a long way to go before these become generally mass market products,\" he added, pointing out that at this stage, compelling use cases are still a bit thin on the ground.\n\nIt's been two years since Samsung launched the Galaxy Ring at MWC, and smart rings have been fairly thin on the ground ever since -- although Oura CEO Tom Hale is slated to speak at the show. We're not necessarily expecting to see any new rings this year, but there's always an outside chance.\n\nMuch more likely to show up are a slew of new laptops and tablets. They rarely get top billing at MWC, but we'll keep an eye out for the most exciting launches. There's also likely to be some intriguing concepts on show from the likes of Lenovo and Samsung Display, which is responsible for the tech behind the new Galaxy S26 Ultra's scene-stealing Privacy Display.\n\nThe big themes: AI, 6G and beyond\n\nNo surprises here that AI will, of course, be a major theme at MWC. For the past few years, Google has dominated the AI conversation at the event by showcasing Gemini's capabilities and its widespread integration. Will this year be any different? Probably not, but that doesn't mean the AI conversation has stalled.\n\nWe expect to see more sophisticated AI agents that are more deeply integrated into wearables, offering live translation, more actionable health insights and more personalized experiences. Some of the biggest players in the AI game will be present, including Nvidia and Qualcomm, on the hardware side. They'll likely have saved some juicy announcements for the show and, hopefully, have some exciting demos we can try out.\n\nWind the clock back a decade, and everyone was talking about 5G and what a dramatic difference it was going to make to our lives. Now that 5G is old news, we're looking forward to 6G. Most discussions about 6G so far have focused on its impact on the industry, but that doesn't mean there's nothing to be excited about.\n\nAt the Web Summit in November, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told me that 6G will make our phones faster than ever and connect us to an \"always-sensing network.\" This could include wearables, smart devices, cars and even robots. No doubt, Amon will expound on this subject further during his MWC keynote, which is all about 6G and AI.\n\nAnother theme likely to be prevalent at the show is the role of satellites in enhancing network connectivity. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell will be on stage to talk about Starlink, and all the world's biggest carriers will have their own booths where they'll show us what they're doing to tap into the latest network technologies."
