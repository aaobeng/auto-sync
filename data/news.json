            "content": "THE Man Utd Files are back – bigger and better than ever! SunSport’s United reporters Samuel Luckhurst and Katherine Walsh lift the lid on all the gossip inside Old Trafford.\n\nThis week we reveal in the Fact Files how CEO Omar Berrarda was denied the chance to meet Julia Roberts and Senne Lammens’ school trip; we have the weird and wonderful in our X-Files as well as the latest from the Academy in the Youth Files. PLUS we have a new weekly quiz, a tactical breakdown and a full stat attack for the Crystal Palace game.\n\n\n\n\n\nFACT FILES\n\nJulia’s Snub\n\nPretty woman, the kind I’d like to meet, so the song goes.\n\nBut United chief executive Omar Berrada was denied the chance to meet Julia Roberts at Old Trafford last year.\n\nRoberts was a special guest at United’s stadium for the annual Soccer Aid charity match in June and Berrada was also in attendance.\n\nBerrada, like many 40-somethings, is a fan of the Oscar-winning actress and brought his family in the hope of meeting Roberts.\n\nRoberts, 58, had previously visited for United’s 1-1 draw with West Ham in November 2016 and met the players and their families after the game.\n\nBerrada was not as lucky, though.\n\nAs the Soccer Aid event was not run by United and Berrada was only present in a personal capacity, he was denied entry to the hospitality suite that housed Roberts for the match between England and the Rest of the World.\n\n\n\nSo the man who is effectively front-of-house at Old Trafford was turned away from one of his own doors.\n\nBerrada not the only football man to have been left broken-hearted by the A-List actress. Pep Guardiola was also devastated that Julia chose Old Trafford over the Etihad years ago.\n\nGuardiola said in a 2016 press conference: “And she went to visit Man United. She didn’t come to see us.\n\n“That’s why even if I win the Champions League it will not compare for the fact that Julia came to Manchester and didn’t come to see us. Even if I win the Champions League it will not compare to this disappointment I had.”\n\nHeaven Senne\n\nSenne Lammens conducted himself as impressively at Partington Central Academy on Wednesday as he did at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\n\n\nThere were screams of delight from pupils when Lammens entered the classroom and he spent time doing activities with the children ahead of World Book Day next week.\n\nThe goalkeeper then sat down for his first interview with the Manchester pack and his maturity, for a 23-year-old playing in one of the most pressurised positions in football, is remarkable.\n\nLammens said how much Tom Heaton has helped him and United sources say the two goalies have “hit it off”.\n\nThe goalkeeping contingent at the club believe Lammens can be a top-level goalkeeper for a long time.\n\nThey are particularly impressed by his handling of the ball and believe the next area for him to improve on is pulling off ‘unsaveable’ stops.\n\n\n\nGood as Nou\n\nNoussair Mazraoui sat down with fans for a Q&A at Old Trafford this week during United’s biggest Ramadan Iftar event.\n\nAround 200 people gathered for United’s second fan Iftar meal, in collaboration with its Muslim Supporters’ Club.\n\nMorocco full back Mazraoui mingled with guests and helped guide several academy players through the event, before breaking fast with dates, sweet cones and a Halal buffet.\n\nCarrick said he was “proud” of the culture and diversity at United in the wake of Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s immigration remarks, which the club distanced themselves from in a statement.\n\n\n\nUnited’s stadium CEO Colette Roche attended on behalf of the club.\n\nX-FILES\n\nKnow Way\n\nAmid the plethora of supposed ‘in-the-know’ United accounts on X, one has the same name as the nickname of a freelancer at the club.\n\nThe well-known Carrington attendant seriously approached someone at the club off his own back to assure them that the account does not belong to him.\n\nSesko Help\n\nBenjamin Sesko has invited people from Slovenia and other territories to become bone marrow donors.\n\n\n\nSesko is not an ambassador of the organisation but a family member of his was diagnosed with leukaemia, which prompted this message.\n\nRuff Break\n\nWork followed one of SunSport’s United correspondents during their week off as they came across Thomas Tuchel in London.\n\nTuchel had signed a new England contract only a week earlier to rule him out of the running to potentially take charge of United after the World Cup finals.\n\nThe German was walking his dog on a stroll down Portobello Road, where he was admiring a stall near the shopfront that appeared in the Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts (her again) film Notting Hill.\n\nWith its soft-pastel coloured houses, a George Orwell plaque and the delightful Electric Cinema, it is difficult to think of a similar street in Manchester that Tuchel could leisurely wander down.\n\n\n\nYOUTH FILES\n\nCome and Fletch Me\n\nDarren Fletcher is one of the most outgoing staff members at United but he remains off-limits amid the club’s Youth Cup progression.\n\nLike Travis Binnion earlier in the season, Fletcher has been asked not to do any press after United’s Youth Cup ties.\n\nThe United U18s beat Oxford United to qualify for the quarter-finals last week and they will take on Sunderland next month.\n\nShould they advance to the final, the chances are Fletcher will be ‘ungagged’. United did a media day when they reached the 2022 final and eight players spoke.\n\n\n\nKobbie Mainoo, who had just turned 17 at the time, was off-limits as he was too young. United usually wait until an academy talent has turned 18 before they do any external media duties.\n\nNoah’s Arc\n\nIt’s time for another academy prospect to get some well-deserved praise alongside JJ Gabriel.\n\nLeft winger Noah Ajayi is climbing out of Gabriel’s shadow after a brilliant month for the Under 18s.\n\nThe German teenager’s skilful solo run was the standout goal of the 6-1 victory over Derby on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nIt capped off a stunning display after he scored in the first-half, won the penalty dispatched by Gabriel and created the most chances in the match where striker Louie Bradbury also scored two.\n\nAjayi’s lethal partnership with Gabriel showed he was knocking on the door, but his performances in early 2026 have kicked it wide open.\n\nUnited feel Ajayi, who stands at 6 ‘2’’ and is among the best dribblers in the youth set up, has taken massive strides since Darren Fletcher‘s arrival last summer.\n\nAjayi is a strong ball carrier with a larger physical frame than most wingers, also having the end product to score or assist.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the player of the match award could have gone to either Ajayi, Gabriel or Chido Obi in the 3-1 win over City on Valentine’s Day.\n\nAjayi was the only one of the trio not to get on the scoresheet in the derby, but his ball carrying runs and link-up play with left back Godwill Kukonki caused chaos at the City Football Academy.\n\nA City supporter sitting in front of a few reporters could be heard praising Ajayi at half-time.\n\nFletcher initially rested him for the Youth Cup trip to Oxford, but he came off the bench to score a slick fourth goal in a 4-1 victory.\n\nAjayi is just as important to the U18s quest for the treble this season – in the league, Youth Cup and Premier League Cup.\n\n\n\nTEAM FILES\n\nPredicted XI\n\nThe question on everybody’s lips is whether Benjamin Sesko will start his first game under Carrick scoring four goals in six games from the bench in 2026.\n\nThe £74m striker has earned a start against Palace this Sunday and it coincides with a severe drop off in form from Amad Diallo in a false No9 system fronted by Bryan Mbeumo.\n\nCarrick has played down the severity of Lisandro Martinez’s injury which caused him to miss the win over Everton, but will be without the centre-back against Palace.\n\nThat means Leny Yoro will start again as a right-sided centre-back. Carrick has only made changes to his best XI in the wake of injuries, the first being when Patrick Dorgu was ruled out for 10 weeks.\n\n\n\nDEANO’S TACTICS – MAN UTD EXPOSED\n\nSunSport’s tactics guru Dean Scoggins has broken out the Tic Tacs to run through Man Utd’s big clash against Crystal Palace.\n\nWatch the video breakdown above.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nQUIZ TIME!\n\nTest your Man Utd knowledge with our new weekly club quiz below:\n\nSTAT ATTACK"

            "content": "WEST HAM have warned of the “serious” and “severe” financial consequence of relegation after announcing a staggering £104.2million loss.\n\nIt is the biggest loss the club have suffered since returning to the Premier League in 2012, with officials blaming the loss on a lower profit from players sales alongside poor performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Ham finished 14th and did not have European football to bolster their accounts after three years in either the Europa League or Conference League.\n\nTurnover, broadcast revenue, match and retail income all fell resulting in a dramatic drop from a profit of £57.2m in 2024. Commercial income rose by £300k to £42.2m.\n\nWest Ham’s wage bill rose by nine per cent to £176m following significant arrivals such as Nicklas Fullkrug and Aaron Wan-Bissaka.\n\nWith the Hammers now in the relegation zone, the accounts also warn that dropping to the Championship would be a “severe scenario” that would come with serious financial problems.\n\n\n\nHowever, the accounts confirm that the club are in line with financial fair play rules and are confident they will continue to comply.\n\nThe group accounts state: “The Group’s principal business risk remains that of the men’s football club being relegated from the Premier League with the serious financial consequences which follow.\n\n“The Club continues to comply with Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules and expects to do so in the future as the new Squad Cost Ratio (SCR) rules are introduced in the forthcoming years.”\n\nThe accounts state that the club would have to address any financial concerns from relegation by selling star names and potential further investment from owners and directors.\n\n\n\nWest Ham are currently 18th in the Premier League, two points from safety.\n\nThe accounts cover the period in which former manager Julen Lopetegui was sacked and replaced by Graham Potter, while director of football Tim Steidten also left his post following clashes with successive managers.\n\nCompensation paid to either Lopetegui or Steidten is not noted in the accounts."

            "content": "A SMALL town has found itself at the center of World Cup chaos after refusing to grant a license for matches to be played at the New England Patriots’ stadium until someone else foots a $8million security bill.\n\nA worried local business owner has told The U.S. Sun that the town fears being left bankrupt if expected to cover the multi-million-dollar tab, as they beg Pats owner Robert Kraft to intervene.\n\n\n\n\n\nGillette Stadium is due to stage seven matches, including marquee knockout games, during Fifa’s global showpiece event, which starts on June 11.\n\nThe first match is slated for June 13 when Scotland face Haiti.\n\nBut in Foxborough, the tiny town of 18,000 residents 22 miles from Boston where the 65,000-seat stadium stands, resentment is growing over the massive funds needed to cover police and public safety costs.\n\n\n\nA five-person, locally-run select board has refused to approve the event license without financial guarantees from tournament organizers.\n\nUnless resolved, the home of the Pats, which will be called Boston Stadium during the tournament, and its doors may remain closed.\n\nTerri Lawton, whose Oake Knoll family farm sits in the shadows of the stadium, told The U.S. Sun that the tension is real.\n\n“I think the select board is doing a great job trying to protect residents,” she said.\n\n\n\n“We’re a very small town. We don’t have $8million to front — and even if we did, we shouldn’t. As far as I know, there aren’t any assets backing it.”\n\nLawton hopes Kraft — whose personal wealth is estimated at over $13billion — will cover the costs, fearing the local economy could crumble if residents are forced to foot the bill.\n\n“The reality is the Kraft family will earn more this year than most people in town will make in their lifetimes,” she continued.\n\n“If they want this to happen, the Kraft Group can simply write a check. They probably spend more than that in a month on payroll alone.”\n\nThe board has set a March 17 deadline for license approval, emphasizing that security planning and equipment must be secured months in advance.\n\n\n\nDuring the NFL season, billionaire owner Kraft and the Kraft Group handle these licenses.\n\nFor soccer’s World Cup, however, the stadium has been leased to Fifa under a new agreement, which requires cities to cover the costs of policing, security, and public safety.\n\nFifa requires venues to be secured for all 39 days of the tournament, not just matchdays, increasing costs.\n\nBill Yunka, vice Chairman of the Foxborough select board, described staging the soccer matches as “an NFL game on steroids” and the equivalent of “39 Super Bowls,” according to local outlet WCVB.\n\nHis fellow board member, Stephanie McGowan, added that the World Cup is “probably more of a headache than it’s worth.”\n\n\n\nBoston was allocated $46million last year – from the $625million plan under President Donald Trump’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill – that could be used toward the security fees.\n\nBut bureaucratic delays have left a significant gap for town officials.\n\nA February federal government shutdown has further delayed processing of funds promised to host cities through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nYukna also said the Kraft Group is willing to front money equivalent to the expected grant, but it doesn’t cover the full difference and Foxborough would still have to hand over millions.\n\n\n\nMoney issues\n\nFarmer Lawton notes that under the current stadium lease, the town receives only 67 cents per ticket sold, the same rate set in 2000 when tickets were $60.\n\nToday, tickets cost a minimum of $100, and police salaries and road wear have increased, but town revenue hasn’t.\n\n“The Krafts are entrepreneurs,” she said\n\n“Their goal is to keep as much revenue as possible. The selectmen’s job is to protect residents. That’s difficult when you’re negotiating with an $11billion company.”\n\n\n\nShe added, “I hope the Kraft family will cover the cost, because I don’t want taxpayers paying it.\n\n“If they want the World Cup here, they’ll gain more financially than anyone else. As a business owner, I remove obstacles to make deals happen. I don’t understand the hesitation.\n\n“Spreading the $8million across 18,000 residents would have serious effects. We wouldn’t be able to pay teachers, police, or firefighters. This isn’t emotional — it’s business. We have to fund essential services.\n\n“The selectmen have told the Kraft Group and the Boston organizing committee for over a year that the town wouldn’t front the money. We’re a town, not a bank. The Kraft Group has invested heavily to bring it to Foxborough.”\n\nShared costs\n\nUnder Fifa’s hosting agreements, the organization takes the lion’s share of revenue—ticketing, broadcast rights, sponsorships, and parking.\n\n\n\nHost cities handle security, public safety, transportation hubs, and protection for officials, including Fifa president Gianni Infantino. Infantino predicts tournament revenues topping $11billion and a U.S. economic impact of $30billion.\n\nLawton said despite the claims the tournament will bring in a profit for the area, local businesses may struggle during the tournament.\n\n“Traffic is so heavy that locals stay home,” she noted.\n\n“Chase Lumber on Route One could have a tough June because no one wants to fight traffic. It’s congestion, not government restrictions.”\n\nThe dispute over the license has overshadowed any excitement in Foxborough before soccer’s biggest stars descend.\n\n\n\n“The bottom line,” Lawton said, “is the Kraft Group will make substantial money from this event. The town just needs to protect itself.\n\n“This isn’t about spite. The town simply doesn’t have the money and has to protect itself.”\n\nThe World Cup is just over 100 days away, yet organizational problems have already begun.\n\nA six-week fan fest in New Jersey has been scrapped due to financial issues, and a similar event in Miami faces funding problems.\n\nMeanwhile, violence in Mexico following the killing of cartel boss Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes has raised questions about staging crucial qualifying matches in the country later this month.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe opening game is scheduled to be in Mexico City.\n\nThe U.S. Sun reached out to Fifa and the Kraft Group for comment, but neither has responded."

Keith Andrews’ side also boast a phenomenal record on the road, having won six of their last seven in all competitions – losing only to Chelsea. Burnley, meanwhile, have won just four of their last 34 Premier League home games, those victories coming against Sheffield United, Leeds and Sunderland.\n\nIpswich vs Swansea: Ipswich win at 3/5\n\nI’m all aboard the Ipswich Town strong-finish-to-the-season bandwagon.\n\nKieran McKenna’s expensively assembled side sit third in the Championship and will be desperate to make their games in hand count. That starts against a Swansea side they’ve beaten in each of their last three meetings – including a 4-1 win away earlier this season. The Tractor Boys have won seven of their last eight on home turf and should have enough to see off their low-scoring opponents, who have netted just 14 times in 16 away games and possess the third-worst away record in the division.\n\nWycombe vs Burton: Wycombe win at 3/4\n\nI just love Wycombe at home.\n\nOnly two League One sides – Cardiff and Lincoln – have scored more home goals than Michael Duff’s men this season, and they currently occupy the automatic promotion spots. The Chairboys have won four of their last five on home soil by an aggregate score of 11-1 and look well placed to secure another three points this weekend. Burton did enjoy a thumping win over Stockport in midweek, but that came on their own patch rather than on the road – where they’ve won just one of their last eight and conceded two or more goals on six occasions.\n\n\n\nColchester vs Salford: Colchester win at 5/4\n\nThis might have been a controversial pick a month ago, but Salford are now in a death spiral, having lost each of their last five in succession – including a 3-1 defeat to rock-bottom Newport County on home turf.\n\nManager Karl Robinson admitted his side were enduring a “horror run”, with the players feeling “low”. We think that gets worse this weekend with a trip to Colchester, who bagged an impressive 4-1 win over Barnet in midweek and have won five of their last six at home.\n\nLincoln vs Blackpool: Lincoln win at 4/9\n\nI don’t think a huge explanation is required for this selection.\n\nLincoln are League One’s most in-form side, having taken 13 points from a possible 15 over their last five games. Only Cardiff and Bradford boast better home records this season, while Lincoln haven’t tasted defeat there since a shock loss to Exeter back in October 2025. They’ve also found their shooting boots in recent weeks, scoring 15 in their last five at home. Blackpool? They’ve lost four of their last six on their travels and hold the second-worst away record in the division.\n\n18+. New customers only. Football Accas only. 5 legs or more.

The Gunners remain firmly positioned at the top of the table, holding a four-point advantage over rivals Manchester City.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, Pep Guardiola's outfit have a game in hand and could narrow the deficit to merely one point with victory away to Leeds United on Saturday evening.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThroughout recent campaigns, Arsenal supporters have become familiar with topping the league only to surrender the title during the final stretch. This has left numerous fans anxious about the forthcoming weeks, and Parlour believes his former club has the mettle to ultimately get the glory.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Arsenal icon told the Metro of his verdict on the league leaders' remaining fixtures and claims they have a more favourable schedule than City.\n\nViktor Gyokeres could force Arsenal to make immediate payout after Chelsea game READ MORE :\n\nFor the final ten matches, Arsenal have six at home and four away, beginning with a London derby against Chelsea at the Emirates on Sunday. Concerning the Blues' threat, Parlour said: \"These will have been two big games, against Tottenham and Chelsea in a week.

This will be the first weekend in a long time where they have had a week off too so they should start brightly. If you score first against Chelsea, they can crumble. They are a bit flaky at the back and they will give up opportunities. I don't think too many of their players get into this Arsenal side.\"\n\nAcross the remainder of March, there's a journey to mid-table Brighton followed by a home encounter with Everton - two match-ups that Parlour thinks Arsenal will achieve maximum points from. He suggested the \"safe\" nature of the Seagulls' league standing removes them as a threat and when addressing the Toffees, he added: \"You've got to have that as a win.\"\n\nView 3 Images The Gunners are closing in on the title (Image: David Price, Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA home meeting with Bournemouth in April is earmarked as another victory for the Gunners before a crucial showdown a week afterwards with title contenders City at the Etihad Stadium. Parlour said: \"I always say, against your rivals, and this is what we always tried to do against Man United, win at home and draw away.\n\n\"So I'll go for a draw. City will need to go out and win the game and we know Arsenal can hit you on the break.\"\n\nTwo home fixtures against Newcastle and Fulham end April and launch the final month of the campaign and the 52-year-old is optimistic about this \"good run-in.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAddressing the Magpies, Parlour said: \"Newcastle aren't great away from home and we've had good results against them recently. I look at those home games and they have to be wins.\"\n\nView 3 Images But can they end the season with an almost flawless run?

He said: \"That could be tricky. A lot depends on where West Ham are by then and if they still have a chance to stay up.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It could be tricky. I might put a draw down for that one but it is hard to call at this point.\"\n\nParlour predicts the penultimate game against Burnley will be a straightforward victory as they'll \"probably be down by then,\" before the final day at Selhurst Park. Weighing up Crystal Palace's predicament with outgoing manager Oliver Glasner, he said: \"Oliver Glasner will be leaving so I suppose maybe he will want to go out on a high, especially at Selhurst Park.\"\n\nFOLLOW OUR ARSENAL FB PAGE!

He added: \"If it goes down to the last day of the season, I would be delighted.\n\n\"I know how hard it is to win the league, but the run in does favour Arsenal slightly.

Is it any wonder why he is still defying the odds at the grand old age of 40?\n\nBrighton veteran Milner overtook Gareth Barry's record of 653 Premier League appearances in Brighton’s 2-0 win at Brentford last Saturday and the most overall top-flight appearances now sits at 654.\n\nHe also set two other records, which now means he holds the longest gap between his first and last Premier League goals (22 years 248 days) and for the most consecutive Premier League seasons played (24).\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe former England midfielder started his Premier League career at 16 with Leeds, had a loan spell at Swindon, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Liverpool followed.\n\nView 4 Images James Milner is still going strong at 40 (Image: Getty Images)\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt has been a career and a half. Literally. Three Premier League titles, two FA Cups and one European Cup And still an incredible energy and a humble person who admitted his “phone blew up” last weekend but it did not really bother him that much.\n\nHe laughed about the little gimmick on Google when you do a search for his name and a load of balloons come up.\n\n“Gareth Barry sent me a message after the game and then it was his birthday yesterday, so I sent him a message saying happy birthday,” said Milner. \"He just said congrats, and he said he's going away and golfing somewhere, so that sounded good to me.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“I suppose like I've always just tried to get on with my job and keep my head down really. I know obviously there's been a lot of talk around this sort of thing, but for me, I just want to do my job and I was especially pleased to get the win, that was so important for us at the weekend.”\n\nView 4 Images Milner started his career with Leeds United (Image: Getty Images)\n\nMilner slipped into Boring James Milner speak, the alter ego character on social media which, even he as an old school pro who avoids things like Instagram and X, even enjoyed. Ice baths, supplements, being teetotal and strict diet have all helped prolong his career, he says.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLast season, it did look all over when he was plagued by injury and he says he could barely lift his foot let alone play in the Premier League. But there it was again: a determination to prove people wrong.\n\n“I think most people, the surgeon, the physio, people who knew what I had, probably every single person thought I was finished - at my age being a footballer and what I had,” said Milner.\n\n“So it was probably that same thing that meant I'm still playing now really to be honest, to just prove and not finish your career in a way that wasn't really in your control.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images James Milner has enjoyed a trophy-laden career (Image: Getty Images)\n\nThere is one last record to be broken. Teddy Sheringham played as an outfield player in the Premier League aged 40 years 272 days. Milner’s birthday was on January 4 so that means he would have to carry on for another year.\n\nEven though he says the decision has yet to be taken, it is clear that he is enjoying life to the full at Brighton where manager Fabian Hurzeler is only 33.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMilner added: “I'm pretty open at this moment in time, whether I will or whether I won't, I'm not sure. The club, we haven't had any conversations, so obviously the club have to be interested as well. It's all right me saying I want to play another year if the club don't want you.\n\n“I said earlier in the season, let's get to February and see where we're at, and I know we're there now, so we'll see what happens.\n\n“But like I say, at this moment in time, I'm just doing my work every day, and like I said, things can change quickly. So at this moment in time, I'm very open to it, and hopefully the last few games have proved that I can still contribute on the field.”\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Onana is spending the 2025/26 season on loan with Trabzonspor, with Senne Lammens impressing as United's new No.1 goalkeeper.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLammens arrived in a £18million move from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day in September and United then decided to send Onana on loan to Turkey. Trabzonspor do not have the option to sign the Cameroon international permanently, meaning Onana will return to his parent club this summer, where he has played 72 times.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe has made 20 appearances for the Turkish side, yet his performances may well be of little interest to United given Lammens' form. The Belgian has been an assured presence in between the posts, starting 21 consecutive games under Amorim, Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLammens has kept five clean sheets for United so far and is part of an improving defence under Carrick. Altay Bayindir is the number two goalkeeper behind Lammens currently, with veteran Tom Heaton also part of the goalkeeping group.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!

Instead of creating the chaos, you want them to take the chaos away and calm things down I think Senne is that,\" he said after his man of the match performance in the 1-0 win over Everton.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“He’s quite quiet at times and unassuming, but he’s got a real steel in this.

That is expected to change if the franchise invest a high NFL Draft pick in a quarterback.\n\nWhile Brady was not present in Indianapolis, 22-year-old Mendoza said they had spoken on the phone briefly, and was asked what he would think of working with the NFL legend.\n\nImage: Tom Brady is a minority owner for the Las Vegas Raiders and would be expected to help develop a young quarterback\n\nHe said: \"Yeah, I mean, who hasn't admired Tom Brady? I mean, more Super Bowl rings than anybody ... anybody!\n\n\"So, that opportunity would be fantastic.\n\n\"Brady, I believe, is the greatest quarterback of all time - by a wide margin - and to be able to have the opportunity to be mentored by him would mean so much.\n\n\"Especially to learn, and I'm all about learning. So from day one, I've got to learn a lot.\n\n\"It's going to be a long journey, and to potentially have a mentor like that, it would be pretty impressive and pretty meaningful.\"\n\nImage: Mendoza was a winner in college but will likely begin his NFL career on one of the worst teams in the league\n\nMendoza revealed that he had a \"great\" meeting with the Raiders, who appointed Super Bowl-winning Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak as their head coach earlier this month as they look to rebuild after a fourth straight losing season.\n\nAlthough he admitted there's no guarantee he will end up in Las Vegas after April's event in Pittsburgh, Mendoza was enthused about his meeting with the team.\n\n\"It was a fantastic interview,\" he said.\n\n\"The coaching staff were in there. We went over some of my previous plays and drew some plays on the board.\n\n\"I thought it was a great meeting, and I know they have the prospective No 1 pick, but anything can happen in the draft. I'm just excited for the opportunity.\n\n\"Whatever team drafts me, I'm just going to give everything I have to them.\""

Will Jacks (2-23), Adil Rashid (2-28), Rehan Ahmed (2-28) England 16-1 in 19.3 overs (target 160): Tom Banton (33 off 24 balls) Will Jacks (32no off 18), Harry Brook (26 off 24), Sam Curran (24 off 22);

There's a combination of horses that have been walloped for wins last time out and horses who are not well-handicapped. I kept going further and further down and ended up with Josh The Boss for two reasons.\n\n\"Firstly, he's a novice and is unexposed to a degree over fences. He's had more runs than I've had hot dinners this year. This will be his seventh start of the season. He is backing up after running at Newcastle last week but he clearly takes his racing well. He jumps well for a novice and I thought last time out he had the run of the race and jumped well aside from nodding on the back of four out.\n\n\"His old nemesis Prairie Wolf will not be in to beat him this day and although it's a worry that he won't be able to dominate this field, I do believe he wants a good, even gallop over this trip because he'll probably stay a little further. If he's bounced out of the race alright, with Jamie Neild taking 7lbs off he has got a handicapping chance.\"\n\nKate Tracey\n\n\"Vincenzo is a standout for me, he looks as if he's got so much more to come. Last time out at Ascot he won by two lengths from Bad. It was a messy race overall but it was really good form in terms of talented horses and a testament to him that he can still produce this kind of effort, sticking to his task really well after hitting the front at the last.\n\n\"He's only been given a 2lb rise for that and I thought that was very fair and he could be even better going back left-handed, which suits him really well. I hope he's got plenty more mileage in his mark.\"\n\nSam Boswell\n\n\"The good news about Heltenham, if you like him like I do, is he loves it around Newbury. He's had one bad run from about six efforts, with three wins and a second to his name. His second was on seasonal reappearance this year against Twinjets. He got beaten by 10 lengths but there's a stone in favour today in favour of Heltenham, which is a massive plus point.\n\n\"I know we don't get the services of Harry Skelton but these are the types of races they're winning en route to a championship and Heltenham is going to be a massive plus point through the spring. He obviously went up against Jonbon last time, which was effectively a run to get round - he managed that.\n\n\"I do hope going back to his favoured Newbury will bring out the best in him. Charlie Todd has ridden the horse before to reasonably good effect when finishing third. We're a double digit price and he's an each-way play, I don't know why he won't be all out to take a really valuable prize.\"\n\nWatch Weekend Winners in full on the At The Races YouTube channel..."

Two years on from a dramatic penalty shoot-out win against Lille in the Conference League, the two sides meet again.\n\nPantomime villain Emiliano Martinez starred on that day, saving the decisive penalty after avoiding a red card midway through the shoot-out, despite receiving his second booking of the game.\n\nTrademark celebrations soon followed as he soaked up the animosity from the French crowd. That, coupled with his antics from the World Cup triumph with Argentina over France, could create quite the cauldron at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy when he returns.\n\nImage: Emi Martinez celebrates Aston Villa's ECL victory over Lille in 2024\n\nVilla will be tasked with replicating the same success over two legs to continue their quest to end their 30-year wait for a trophy and if they do achieve that, the drama won't stop there.\n\nA meeting with Roma and on-loan striker Donyell Malen could then await, should they be successful in the tie against Bologna. UEFA rules state no team can influence what line-up their opponent selects and that would allow Malen to face off against his parent club in a bid to dump them out of the competition.\n\nPorto, Nottingham Forest, Midtjylland and Stuttgart make up the rest of that side of the bracket. Villa were undoubtedly handed a harder route to glory; the storylines running alongside it just add to the drama.\n\nHome advantage in second legs for seeded teams\n\nThe top eight teams from the league phase in both competitions are seeded and will have home advantage in the second leg of their round of 16 games.\n\nThis will extend to the quarter-finals for the teams that finished in the top four of the league phase if they progress.\n\nThe top two will also have home advantage in the second leg of their semi-final if successful.\n\nAny team that eliminates a seeded team will take their privileges.\n\nWhen are the 2025/26 knockout stages?\n\nRound of 16: March 12 and 19\n\nQuarter-finals: April 9 and 16\n\nSemi-finals: April 30 and May 7\n\nFinal: May 20\n\nWhere are the finals?\n\nThe Europa League final will be held at Besiktas Park in Istanbul on May 20.\n\nThe Conference League final will be one week later at the Leipzig Stadium on May 27."

Rodrigo Gomes and Angel Gomes are on the bench for Wolves so we could see four men named Gomes on the pitch at the same time tonight, what a prospect.\n\nSo Unai Emery reacts to the draw with Leeds by making three changes to his Villa starting XI. Pau Torres, Lucas Digne and Jadon Sancho come in for Tyrone Mings, Ian Maatsen and Leon Bailey.\n\nAston Villa fans are nervous about this one. Wolves have not lost at home against their Midlands rivals since 2020 and generally have a decent record in this fixture when it’s played at Molineux. After a slump in form Unai Emery’s side are no longer looking up the table and instead have a resurgent Manchester United breathing uncomfortably down their neck like an unwanted admirer on a sweaty dancefloor. With others in the hunt for Europe starting to appear in Villa’s rearview mirror, it is a bad time for the goals to have dried up, but that they have. Four goals in their last five games have been enough to earn one two draws, two defeats and one win.\n\nOut of the FA Cup and handed a testing tie against Lille in the Europa League, the next month is going to be crucial in determining the outcome of Villa’s season. In theory this is exactly the kind of fixture they would want right now, a struggling opponent with one of the league’s worst defences, but Wolves will be up for this.\n\nFor Rob Edwards’ team, the rest of this season should be about creating enough of a platform to come straight back up. Edwards needs to find positivity in performances and get as many points on the board as possible, even if it all feels a little futile. Eight of their 10 points this season have been earned over the past 10 matches, which is encouraging. Emery said Villa’s win in the reverse fixture was one his team “didn’t deserve” in his pre-match briefing before the short trip to Wolverhampton, which is interesting motivational material to say the least.\n\nRoss Barkley, Jadon Sancho and Tammy Abraham may come into the Villa side, who are missing John McGinn and Youri Tielemans, as well as Boubacar Kamara, who is done for the rest of the season. Hwang Hee-chan is missing for Wolves due to a calf problem and Ladislav Krejci is suspended.\n\nJanuary window arrival Angel Gomes could make a return to a starting XI where Mateus Mané, the eye-catching 18-year-old forward, will likely continue his run of starts."

            "content": "The draw for the Champions League last 16 has produced some intriguing, heavyweight clashes featuring the renewal of old rivalries. If Manchester City’s meeting with Real Madrid arguably ranks foremost among them, Chelsea’s engagement with the holders, Paris Saint-Germain, and Newcastle’s duel with Barcelona are certainly not lacking in glamour.\n\nOr, in the case of Chelsea and PSG in particular, edge. The tie is a repeat of last summer’s Club World Cup final in New Jersey, which Chelsea won 3-0 thanks to two goals from Cole Palmer and with a team under the management of Enzo Maresca.\n\n“I’m so excited,” said Liam Rosenior, Maresca’s successor. “PSG are fantastic. I’ve experience of playing them in France [as Strasbourg manager] and I’ve always admired them. Luis Enrique has done a fantastic job there.\n\n“These are the games you live for, games that you come into football for. It’s going to be a great tie.”\n\nIn Rosenior’s three fixtures against PSG at Strasbourg he won one, drew one and lost one.\n\nLiverpool, meanwhile, will return to Istanbul as part of a tricky rematch with Galatasaray. Arne Slot’s side lost 1-0 in Turkey in a September league-phase meeting.\n\nArsenal have been handed a somewhat kinder draw in Bayer Leverkusen as they continue to compete on four fronts “We’re really excited,” said Mikel Arteta. “Let’s try to be there until the last stage of every competition. And then we’ll see what happens.”\n\nA Tottenham team likely to be prioritising Premier League survival will meet Atlético Madrid, meaning a swift reunion for Conor Gallagher, who joined Spurs from the Spanish club in January. With all 16 teams provided with a route map to the semi-finals, Atlético’s Diego Simeone and Tottenham’s Igor Tudor also know their sides are playing for a quarter-final date against either Barcelona or Newcastle. Should Spurs keep progressing, a north London semi-final against Arsenal is a possibility.\n\nIf Arsenal overcome Leverkusen, they will meet the winner of Bodø/Glimt versus Sporting in the last eight while Liverpool could face Chelsea, which would no doubt reignite memories of their Champions League battles from previous decades.\n\nShould Manchester City make it past Madrid in what will be a fifth Champions League knockout meeting in five years, Pep Guardiola could be set for a potential reunion with Bayern Munich on the basis that they overcome Atalanta, Italy’s remain representative in the competition, in the last 16.\n\nNewcastle’s meeting with Barcelona will reprise evocative memories of Sir Bobby Robson, who managed both clubs, as well as Faustino Asprilla’s treble at St James’ Park during a 3-2 Champions League win over the Spanish giants in 1997. The two sides also met at St James’ Park in September, with Hansi Flick’s side winning the league-phase encounter 2-1 thanks to two goals from Marcus Rashford.\n\nIn the Europa League, Nottingham Forest have been drawn against Midtjylland with the Danes doubtless bolstered by memories of their 3-2 win at the City Ground in the league phase in October. With Aston Villa, who face Lille, in the same side of the draw as Forest, there is no prospect of an all-English final, although they could clash in the semis.\n\nVilla and Lille crossed swords in a Conference League quarter-final two years ago, with Villa prevailing follow a rather chaotic penalty shootout featuring some theatrics from Argentinian goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez.\n\nCrystal Palace will face AEK Larnaca of Cyprus in the last 16 of the Conference League."

            "content": "Being teetotal, always asking questions and taking up yoga in his early 30s after a recommendation from Gareth Barry have played their part. But if one thing inspired James Milner to break the Premier League’s appearance mark then it is a trait honed during his formative years in Yorkshire: sheer bloody-mindedness.\n\n“Some things don’t change,” Milner says with a chuckle when asked whether his desire to prove people wrong was as strong as ever after his 40th birthday last month. “There’s people who are always going to doubt you but that’s always something that’s been at my forefront: to prove them wrong.”\n\nMilner credits his father for instilling the fighting spirit that has carried him through a remarkable 24 seasons in English football’s top flight. He started as a 16-year-old with Leeds under the watchful eye of Terry Venables, and has had spells at Newcastle, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Liverpool and now Brighton.\n\n“He knew what I was like and he used to say: ‘You don’t work hard enough, you’re not going to make it,’” he says of his father. “He’d never say it in a horrible way or anything like that. But he’d be like: ‘You got no chance of scoring the goal from there.’ And then [I would] take free-kicks and two shots later it’s in the top corner. He knew how to get the best of me.”\n\nThe same desire provided motivation after it seemed Milner’s career was finished in 2024 when he was unable to walk following knee surgery. He spent nine months on the sidelines before returning at the end of last season.\n\n“I think most people – the surgeon, the physio, people who knew what I had, probably every single person – thought I was finished; at my age being a footballer and what I had,” he says. “So it was probably that same thing that meant I’m still playing now: not to finish your career in a way that wasn’t really in your control. That was the drive really. I wanted to try to prove that I could get back from that because I don’t think many people could.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner salutes the fans after the final whistle in Leeds’ victory over Chelsea in December 2002, a month after his Premier League debut as a 16-year-old. Photograph: Gareth Copley/PA\n\nIt has been particularly satisfying for Milner that, having come off the bench more than 200 times in the Premier League, he started on his 654th appearance to break his former Villa teammate Barry’s record when Brighton overcame Brentford last week. “My body doesn’t agree to sitting still, so that’s why I don’t like being on the bench so much,” he says.\n\nHe relishes his role as the elder statesman of the Brighton squad and reveals that the teenage striker Charalampos Kostoulas has been joining him for yoga sessions. “I probably started maybe eight or nine years ago now, which I think Gareth put me on to actually,” he says. “We’re passing it down, so I’ve passed it on to Babis [Kostoulas] at this moment. He’s only 18, so he’s starting young.”\n\nMilner, whose rippling muscles bulge as he holds court at Brighton’s training ground in Lancing, recognises he has been fortunate that his career coincided with the rapid growth of sports science. He uses strengthening techniques created by the celebrated German athletics coach Frans Bosch to counteract injuries that have included a fractured ankle at Newcastle and 12 hamstring problems, meticulously tracks his sleep patterns and takes magnesium to boost a natural shortfall in his body. Milner believes the decision to never drink alcohol, made during his schooldays in Horsforth, outside Leeds, is another of the secrets to his longevity.\n\n“I’ve never had a problem with people drinking at all – I think it’s healthy,” he says. “Like if that’s the right time to do it and if that’s your thing to get away from football and go have a blast, then I’ve no problems with it all. But it’s just a decision I made that if it would help me, I wouldn’t do it.\n\n“When I first started playing you had maybe one or two physios, maybe a part-time masseur, one fitness coach. Now you’ve got five or six fitness coaches, you’ve got seven or eight in the medical team. So that’s been to my advantage that I’ve managed to learn from that to ask questions early.\n\n“I always ask questions: ‘Why are we doing this?’ Or: ‘Explain it to me so I understand and then I decide if it is the right thing to do. I’m not just going to do it because you say. Give me the information why. Give me the science behind it.’ It was interesting, a few of the messages I had over the weekend were: ‘You were a nightmare to work with,’ or ‘challenging to work with’. But I take that as a compliment that I push them to be better and ask questions and challenge them. The best people always come out and give you the exact reason why you’re doing it.”\n\nThings have changed from his youth, when Milner recalls “teacups flying and walls being punched” at half-time by irate managers. “You don’t see much of that now,” he says. “I just feel fortunate. I played through two eras; one when I was emerging and now another.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner, with then teammate Jordan Henderson, holds the FA Cup after Liverpool’s win in 2022. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nMilner was presented this week with three Guinness world records: one for the appearances, another for most consecutive Premier League seasons (23) and the third for the longest gap between his first and last Premier League goals (22 years and 248 days). The next milestone on the horizon is surpassing Teddy Sheringham’s record as the Premier League’s oldest outfield player at 40 years 272 days, though Milner has never been inspired by chasing records.\n\nHe is yet to open discussions with Brighton about extending his stay beyond this season – a prospect recently welcomed by his 33-year‑old head coach, Fabian Hürzeler – but is keen to stay and he denies fearing what retirement may bring.\n\n“When we have some days off I look forward to that: go and play golf, spend time with the family. So I feel whenever I finish, I’ll probably have a break and a rest because I’ve been so 100% for so long.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner with his three Guinness World Records certificates. Photograph: Paul Hazlewood\n\nHaving worked under Venables, Sir Bobby Robson, Roberto Mancini, Jürgen Klopp and many other of the game’s finest managers, Milner is well placed to judge what makes a good one. He rates his two seasons as a central midfielder at Martin O’Neill’s Villa as his best from an individual perspective, and has especially fond memories of winning City’s and Liverpool’s first league titles for a generation. There are doubts about his prospects of making the transition to the dugout when he hangs up his boots.\n\n“It’s such a hard gig, innit? You see managers getting a new contract and getting sacked in two months. People don’t get the time they deserve now. But the competitive guy in you thinks: ‘Yeah, I wouldn’t mind giving that a go.’\n\n“I’ve got a great array of different managers from different countries and different personalities to lean back on, so in one way I think it’d be a big shame to lose all that knowledge and experience I’ve built up, to not be able to use that.”"

            "content": "Liverpool had the highest wage bill in the Premier League when winning their 20th league title last season, the club’s latest set of accounts show.\n\nLiverpool’s wage bill increased by £42m to £428m in the year ending 31 May 2025, when a Premier League title triumph in Arne Slot’s debut season as head coach and a return to the Champions League increased revenue to a record £703m. The club’s wages-to-revenue ratio stood at a healthy 61%. It was the biggest wage bill in the division, ahead of Manchester City on £408m, and included bonuses for the record-equalling title triumph.\n\nCommercial revenue increased by £15m to £323m and matchday revenue by £14m to £116m. The figures contributed to an increase of £89m in revenue for the highest-ranked Premier League club in the Deloitte Football Money League. But the rise in wages, which pushed administrative costs up by £57m to £657m, resulted in a relatively modest post-tax profit of £8m. Liverpool had a £57m loss in 2023-24 after failing to qualify for the Champions League.\n\n“We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it,” said Liverpool’s chief financial officer, Jenny Beacham. “The 2024-25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men’s team winning our 20th league title.\n\n“The club does face significant cost challenges, including rises in administrative, staffing and operational costs, alongside the need for us to compete at the highest level of the game, across our men and women’s teams.”\n\nLiverpool’s latest set of published accounts do not include last summer’s record spend of almost £450m on new players, including the British record signing of Alexander Isak for £125m from Newcastle. Slot said recently that failure to qualify for the Champions League would be unacceptable for Liverpool this season and the competition “does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run”.\n\nOn Friday Slot said it was not difficult to resist the clamour to start Rio Ngumoha because the level-headed teenager had not been carried away by the hype. The 17-year-old made a huge contribution to Liverpool’s late win at Nottingham Forest last weekend after his 77th-minute introduction, especially after switching wings to replace Mohamed Salah on the right. That has prompted calls for Ngumoha to start against West Ham on Saturday, when Florian Wirtz will again be absent through injury, but Slot will continue to develop the youngster carefully.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rio Ngumoha made a big impact for Liverpool from the bench against Nottingham Forest. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\n“It’s totally not difficult because of how he is,” Slot said of putting Ngumoha on the bench. “And that is something special for a 17-year-old who has been hyped like he is throughout his whole career.\n\n“There has been a lot of talk about him because we can all see how special he is and his talent. He is handling that situation really well, which is a big compliment to him but also to his parents, who raised him that he is down to earth, works really hard, keeps going and doesn’t lose his head because a few pundits have given positive feedback about his game. If you start believing how special you are after a few comments from pundits, that is probably not the way to become the player he wants to become.\n\n“We have to keep his special quality and that is beating players in one v one. That is not 10 out of 10 times working, and it doesn’t have to be, but he has to keep trying. There are not many players in modern football that can take on one-v-ones on a regular basis and beat their opponents a lot of times. That is a special quality and that is why we want to take such good care of him because we have a lot of belief in how special he is.”"

            "content": "THE CLASS(IC) SYSTEM\n\nLa Liga has El Clásico, France has Le Classique, and Argentina goes full gun with its Superclásico. English football has no true equivalent, with Liverpool and Manchester United fans unable to agree on a name for their grand-slam meetings. Up in the land of fitba, there’s this weekend’s 450th Old Firm/Glasgow derby (delete as applicable according to your stringency on Scottish company law). And Germany has Der Klassiker, between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. The Bundesliga marketing suits have been out in force this week for the one game, played on Saturday evening, that brings extra eyeballs. Though questions are often raised over whether this is a true, classic rivalry; Dortmund have not won a league title since Jürgen Klopp was making his rounds in 2012.\n\nSince then, Bayern have celebrated a league title with lashings of weissbier outside the Rathaus every year save for 2024, when Xabi Alonso’s Bayer Leverkusen went unbeaten to wear the crown. Dortmund v Bayern, is it a historic rivalry? Well, not really, since Bayern’s dominance of the Bundesliga goes back to 1968-69, when they succeeded Eintracht Braunschweig and Nürnberg as champions. The 1970s took in Borussia Mönchengladbach as their chief rivals, what with Günter Netzer, Allan Simonsen and all that.\n\nIt was not until the mid-90s that Dortmund, with two domestic titles and a Big Cup in 1997 (run Lars Ricken VT) realised the dreams of their vast fanbase. Here is where the needle began, with a spat between all-round nice guys Lothar Matthäus and Andy Möller in 1996 and then Oliver Kahn’s flying kick on Stéphane Chapuisat before biting Heiko Herrlich’s ear in 1999. All good stuff if you want to build up a deep-seated rivalry. After near-bankruptcy followed their 2002 Bundesliga triumph, it took Klopp’s heavy-metal thunder for Dortmund to upend Bayern. Since then, while FC Hollywood strut to repeated titles, Dortmund have become football’s leading kindergarten, a finishing school rather than a credible challenger.\n\nThis season, Bayern are eight points clear of Dortmund at the top, and only a win at the Westfalenstadion will prevent another procession. “For me, it’s always a title in its own right, even if people say we can’t win anything more now,” roared Vincent Kompany, ever the hype man. “These games are also important to the masses.” Kompany’s Bayern face a Dortmund team probably unable to believe what happened against Atalanta in Bigger Cup, Ramy Bensebaini’s swinging heel into Nikola Krstovic’s head a moment to have them waking up screaming in the night for decades. What might also keep Dortmund coach Niko Kovac awake is the prospect of facing Harry Kane, living up to the standards set by Robert Lewandowski in modern times and Gerd Müller in Bayern’s first golden era, scoring 45 goals in 37 matches for club and country this season.

The style needs to be in the second moment, because now it’s a question of life and death if I can say that in that way sportingly” – Igor Tudor, there, channelling Bill Shankly as he explains why Tottenham might not be wowing the league with whizzy play as they fight for top-flight survival.\n\nView image in fullscreen Igor Tudor: maybe he’ll talk about socialism next week. Photograph: John Walton/PA\n\ndouble quotation mark I just hope the hapless Dortmund defender Ramy Bensebaini (yesterday’s Football Daily) does not follow my path. I too was directly responsible for four opposition goals in one game: one came from my taking a corner that curved behind every one of my teammates, allowing five of the other lot to advance on our puffing centre-back; another was me slicing a clearance so badly that instead of arcing down the touchline, it went at 90 degrees, landing at the feet of an opponent with enough time and space at the edge of our box for his own Grand Designs project. I never again played any form of competitive sport” – Michael Hann.\n\ndouble quotation mark I feel compelled to point out that Ramy Bensebaini played left-sided centre-back of a back three against Atalanta rather than left-back (yesterday’s Football Daily). I noticed this because of the body language of his teammate Daniel Svensson each time Bensebaini recklessly served a goal up on Wednesday. Svensson was the recovering left wing-back at the Algerian’s side, head bowed and shoulders increasingly drooping” – Matthew Parham.\n\ndouble quotation mark I’ve come to the conclusion that the collection of words at the bottom of Football Daily’s full email edition (that rarely makes any sense to me) are a form of the popular location app what3words and give the venue of that evening’s secret ‘drinks’ for the hard-working hacks. It hasn’t escaped me that, when there are more than three words, my theory sheds more water than something that sheds water” – Shaun.\n\ndouble quotation mark Regarding yesterday’s last line ‘Hot Parents’ Chat Ahoy’ (full email edition), am I the only one wondering if it is the chat or the parents that are hot?

In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on direct rivals. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season.

Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea, where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in matchday chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) as they sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL interpreters will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here.

We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left-winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German, who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire on Saturday. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track after a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croat’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and, considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance.

The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third goal in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes after the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "A European occasion that appeared ominous for Celtic instead provided evidence that it is never wise to write off Martin O’Neill. His side exited the Europa League in Stuttgart but the scale of spirit and togetherness visible during their 1-0, playoff second-leg victory emphasised that tales of their demise may be overstated.\n\nCeltic’s key attribute during a critical week, which begins at Ibrox on Sunday, is course and distance specialism. The shortcomings within, and patched-up nature of, O’Neill’s squad are blindingly obvious. This is, however, a club that has become accustomed to dominating Scottish football over more than a decade. Much earlier, O’Neill had demonstrated he could emerge successful from title scraps. Contrary to giddy analysis, there is nothing miraculous or remarkable about O’Neill’s work during his second short-term stint of the season. It is, though, immediately striking how a 73-year-old can achieve such buy-in from players. Faith in O’Neill within Celtic is absolute.\n\nThis Celtic season, typified by managerial upheaval and protesting supporters, retains a pulse. Stuttgart felt significant because Celtic, in makeshift form, displayed character. The easier option would have been to limp out of the Europa League. Instead, there was an unwillingness to concede an equaliser that reflects positively on O’Neill and his squad.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill (left) is in his second interim stint of the season at Celtic and has galvanised the players after a rocky period. Photograph: DPA/PA\n\nOn Sunday they face a Rangers team who are under considerable pressure to prove they will not deliver another campaign typified by false dawns. Rangers’ home form is strong but Danny Röhl’s team are yet to remove the sense of a soft underbelly, demonstrated by draws at Hibernian, Motherwell and Livingston. The most recent of those, last Sunday, was a horrendous result; Livingston had not won in 25 league matches. The stakes are huge for Rangers, who should be embarrassed if a net spend of about £30m is not sufficient to prise the title from Celtic – at one point managed by Wilfried Nancy – and a Hearts side assembled for buttons in comparison. Celtic’s seven Premiership losses to date match their combined tally from the previous two seasons.\n\nA Rangers win would place Celtic in tricky territory, five points behind their oldest foes. Celtic’s game in hand will be played in Aberdeen on Wednesday, before a return to Ibrox on Scottish Cup business. Hearts hope to extend their lead at the top to seven points on Saturday when Aberdeen visit Edinburgh. An Old Firm draw would suit Hearts perfectly.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rangers’ Danny Röhl speaks to the media on Friday – his side are four points behind Hearts and two above Celtic. Photograph: Luke Nickerson/Rangers FC/Shutterstock\n\nStuttgart gave O’Neill plenty food for thought. Luke McCowan’s terrific performance in midfield should afford him a start at Ibrox. O’Neill’s public backing of Kasper Schmeichel suggests he will restore the veteran goalkeeper despite almost weekly errors. Schmeichel’s deputy, Viljami Sinisalo, repelled Stuttgart. Auston Trusty’s suspension leaves Celtic weak in central defence. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was not in Celtic’s European squad, was surely signed to play in fixtures such as the derby.\n\nO’Neill is aware of a bigger picture, despite that hardly being his concern given he is due to leave in the summer. “European football is what big clubs in Scotland should be aiming for,” he said. “Not for the coefficient points to be dropping out of sight. It’s ridiculous. This is what it’s all about.”\n\nHis regular reference to the country’s coefficient, which is indeed dipping to a worrying level, is intriguing. There is a theory Celtic’s reluctance to spend heavily on players is linked at least in part to knowledge that their potential lack of access to European revenue in upcoming years could swallow up cash reserves. In a worst-case but feasible situation, Celtic could be staring at Conference League football. This does not, however, explain the horrendous lack of preparation for this season’s Champions League playoff tie. Sensible investment would have been sufficient to topple Kairat Almaty, who instead left Celtic with red faces.\n\nThe shadow boxing has started. McCowan has asserted no team in the league can touch Celtic when at their best. In truth, it would be more of a story had McCowan stipulated Celtic are also-rans. Röhl cast aspersions on Celtic’s approach in Stuttgart; this was amusing, given Rangers finished 32nd out of 36 in the Europa League table.\n\nAll Old Firm jousts are fascinating. This one carries more meaning than most. Events in Germany suggested Celtic are formed of the kind of substance that Rangers must be wary of."

            "content": "TALIBAN’S long-serving terror chief has mysteriously vanished amid claims the tyrant was targeted in deadly airstrikes from Pakistan.\n\nHibatullah Akhundzada hasn’t been seen or heard from since overnight strikes reportedly wiped out at least 264 Taliban militants as Pakistan declared an “open war”.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shady leader in Afghanistan, believed to be in his 60s, rarely makes public appearances, has no digital footprint, and is believed to command his henchmen via secret networks.\n\nThis allows him to work in the shadows, directing his terrorist brutes on how to carry out attacks and how to lay down the law on civilians.\n\nEven his name strikes fear with Hibatullah in Arabic meaning “gift from God”.\n\n\n\nSince taking over as the Taliban kingpin in 2016, Akhundzada has overseen some major developments for the group.\n\nTaliban, under his rule, came back to power in Afghanistan in 2021 following the bungled withdrawal of US and Nato troops from Kabul.\n\nHis low profile keeps him shrouded in mystery – but often sparks speculation and rumours that he is in declining health or dead.\n\nHe is believed to reside in Kandahar, but his exact whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\n\n\nFormer British Army officer General Sir Richard Barrons, who served in Afghanistan, told The Sun: “He’s an extremely influential figure but he’s also secretive, he’s always been secretive and this helps keep him extremely powerful in running a conservative faction.\n\n“The fact that he lives in this isolated way, in many ways, in many eyes, earns him a lot of respect as well as security.”\n\nHis whereabouts are always a mystery so any foreign intelligence can’t track him down and make him a target.\n\nOnly one image has ever been made public of him too.\n\nThis has led many of his supporters saying there is no chance he would have been killed in the Pakistan strikes.\n\n\n\nShould he ever die, it remains unclear when the Taliban would announce it to the world.\n\nThe terror group have previously hidden the truth over a leader’s death.\n\nTaliban founder Mullah Omar is suspected of staying in power for two entire years after his death, Afghanistan’s government and security services believe.\n\nAkhundzada, a hardline religious scholar, has served as the head of the Taliban since 2016 since moving on from a ruthless Sharia court chief.\n\nHis reign of power over the Afghan courts saw him oversee years of brutal punishments handed out to those breaking Islamic law.\n\n\n\nHe is believed to have issued rulings which saw convicted murderers and adulterers be publicly executed and thieves have their hands chopped off.\n\nOne of the most disturbing new laws in Afghanistan was announced earlier this month.\n\n\n\nThe Taliban has officially legalised domestic violence in Afghanistan in a terrifying new assault on women’s rights.\n\nA 90-page criminal code was signed off which allows husbands to physically abuse their wives and children – so long as it does not result in “broken bones or open wounds”.\n\nAfghanistan is “a pure patriarchy” with its values forced onto people through Akhundzada’s Taliban, Sir Barrons says.\n\nHe added: “For many Western people, this is outrageous, but the point is it’s not outrageous to many Afghans.\n\n“One of the reasons Akhundzada is powerful is that they actually genuinely support what he does.\n\n\n\n“He commands widespread support amongst the Taliban men and women.\n\n“He is this unpronounceable leader, he is really clear about how life should be led in Afghanistan and it is this strict interpretation of Sharia law.\n\n“The role of women in society and all of those things, there is no bending him on this.”\n\nRumours of Akhundzada going missing came after tit-for-tat strikes between Afghanistan and Pakistan on Thursday.\n\nKabul was rocked by “deadly” blitzes overnight after the Taliban attacked border troops hours earlier.\n\n\n\nPakistan‘s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said 274 Taliban regime members and terrorists were killed with 12 Pakistani troops lost in the operation.\n\nYet Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed his forces killed 55 Pakistani soldiers and captured others.\n\nHe said that just 13 Afghan troops had been killed.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe cross border fighting has now escalated with Pakistani defence minister Khawaja ‌Muhammad Asif declaring: “Our cup of patience has ⁠overflowed.\n\n“Now ​it is ​open war between ​us and ⁠you.”"

            "content": "THE mother of a 17-year-old killed in a drug-driving horror crash says no jail term is long enough for the man who killed her “best friend.”\n\nKeilan Roberts, then 21, had taken ketamine, cocaine, ecstasy and had been drinking when he killed passenger Chloe Hayman in Fochriw, South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the car hit a cattle grid, a railing pierced the windscreen and tragically killed Chloe instantly.\n\nChloe’s bereaved mother has called for young people to learn from the tragedy, and even hugged the man who killed her, according to the BBC.\n\nDevastated Danielle O’Halloran, 37, from Mountain Ash, said Chloe was her best friend and someone who “always saw the good in everyone.”\n\nRoberts had met Chloe in a nightclub just hours before and offered her a lift home with his friends.\n\n\n\nHe had intended to drop Chloe off the following morning but changed his mind and asked his pals to leave him and Chloe where his Skoda Octavia was parked.\n\nHours after the crash, Danielle was told the news — a moment she described as “too painful to relive.”\n\nShe said: “Your body can’t cope with the fact that they’re not there.\n\n“Like at that moment, I was just in shock.”\n\n\n\nRoberts, from Rhymney, Caerphilly county, admitted four charges linked to Chloe’s death.\n\nFootage captured on the bodycam of a police officer after the crash shows the immediate aftermath of the horror smash.\n\nRoberts can be seen standing on the side of the road, looking dazed and confused while holding a Peroni bottle.\n\n\n\nIn June 2023, he was sentenced, and following a family appeal, his prison term was increased to five years and three months with a 12-year driving ban.\n\nChloe’s mum had slammed Robert’s jail term as an “insult” after losing her “kind, loving, beautiful” daughter.\n\nDanielle said she was consumed by anger and hate: “I wished so many bad things upon him, I wanted him to stay there forever.\n\n“But I felt ill inside with the amount of anger I had. I just couldn’t let it eat me up any more.”\n\nThrough the restorative justice process, Danielle met Roberts, who was then 22, in prison — hugging him and confronting the man who took her daughter’s life.\n\n\n\nShe said: “We were both emotional when he walked in.”\n\nMeeting him face to face, Danielle says she realised that he had not meant to kill her daughter, but was “just a 21-year-old” who had made the “wrong choice.”\n\nNow, heartbroken Danielle hopes they can one day speak together in schools to warn young people about the devastating consequences of drink and drug driving.\n\nShe said: “I want young people to understand the lives that are shattered by one wrong choice.\n\n\n\nNo jail term is ever going to be long enough for what he did.”\n\nShe added: “I hugged him and said, I’m sorry you’re the one who has to live with this.”\n\nDanielle believes no jail sentence can outweigh the lifelong regret and guilt Roberts now carries.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“Coming back into the community is actually harder because you have to face people,” she said.\n\n\n\nShe added that society must do more to prevent risky behaviour, provide community support, and protect young people from the “glamorisation” of drinking and dangerous choices."

            "content": "SPOTTING Saul Murray’s flashy designer watch on Instagram, scheming Surpreet Dhillon quickly devised a deadly plot to steal it, luring in her victim with the promise of sex before he was drugged and killed.\n\nNow behind bars, she is seemingly just one of a growing number of women prepared to act as bait for gangs, as one expert exclusively reveals to The Sun why “honey-trapping” is becoming such a popular tactic used among criminals to target unsuspecting prey.\n\n\n\nFor victim Saul, 33, it was flashing his seemingly expensive timepiece online which made him a target to Dhillon, 36, who flirted with him on social media before arranging to meet him for sex with accomplice Temidayo Awe, 21.\n\nThe women headed to Saul’s flat in Luton, Beds, where they drank brandy before “sexual activity” occurred, and Dhillon secretly laced Saul’s glass with a date rape sedative to “knock him out”.\n\n\n\nWhen that didn’t work, male accomplices Ikem Affia, 31, and Cleon Brown, 29, were seen entering the property on CCTV brandishing a knife.\n\nTragically, his body was found in his block of flats the following day, after dying as a result of heavy bleeding from a stab wound to his thigh, which had pierced an artery.\n\nAnd it was all for nothing as the “Rolex” watch the dad-of-six was targeted for was later revealed to be fake.\n\nCriminology professor David Wilson says he has increasingly heard more and more cases like this, where honey-trapping is utilised as a method to hoodwink unwitting victims.\n\nHe explains: “Honey trapping is essentially a form of fraud. You’re presenting yourself as something that you’re not, in the hope that you’ll encourage a relationship to develop.\n\n\n\n“You’re going to present yourself in the most ‘ideal’ form you possibly can – having attributes and personal qualities or a personality that you know will culturally be attractive to the person that you’re trying to trap.\n\n“There is a stereotypical view that women will be less dangerous than men.\n\n“By and large, people would trust a woman rather than a man, so using a young woman as bait would be seen as easier than using a young man by a criminal gang.\n\n“There is always a hare and tortoise race going on when we talk about a crime and the police – the hare is the offender, and the tortoise is the criminal justice system.\n\n“Basically, the justice system hasn’t fully caught up to that technique yet. When they do, the [criminals] will move on [to another technique].”\n\n\n\nFor her role in the botched plot, Dhillon, from East London, was sentenced to ten years for manslaughter and conspiracy to commit robbery at Luton Crown Court, but this is far from an isolated case.\n\n\n\n£30k ‘orgy’ robbery plot\n\nIn another horrifying example, Vishal Gohel, 44, from Bushey, Herts, was expecting to have sex with three women in January 2022 before he was murdered.\n\nGeorgia Bruce-Annan, a 22-year-old Coutts Bank apprentice, first made contact with Vishal on classifieds site Craigslist before arranging the bogus liaison.\n\nDad-of-two Vishal was seen on a shop’s CCTV buying drinks, cigarettes and condoms ahead of the meet, borrowing £100 in cash from his mother and withdrawing £100 from a cash machine.\n\nBruce-Annan, who joked Vishal was her “sugar daddy” and Faith Hoppie, 22, headed to the victim’s property in a plot to rob him of possessions totalling £30,000.\n\nThey later let Tevin Leslie, 23, Sakeen Gordon, 22, and Brandon Browne, 23, into the home and when Vishal could or would not transfer them any cash, he was fatally beaten and throttled.\n\n\n\nIt’s a method that criminals use because it elicits quick compliance — the victim doesn’t see the threat coming until it’s too late. Dr Daniel Glazer ,\n\nThe next morning, Vishal’s neighbour found him lifeless on his bedroom floor, with gaffer tape around the lower part of his face.\n\nHis watch, the £200 cash and his iPhone had been stolen and a post-mortem found he had suffered a significant blow or blows to the head.\n\nBruce-Annan, from East London, received a life sentence for murder at St Albans Crown Court and Hoppie, from East London, was sentenced to eight years for manslaughter and conspiracy to rob.\n\nThe promise of a “sexual transaction”, David says, is “instrumental” in many cases like this.\n\nHe adds: “It’s a means to an end, to get access to more resources – the victim’s home for example, and the victim’s life. It’s very invasive. The victim has exposed themselves as who they are to somebody they believe was being honest.\n\n\n\n“That has a huge psychological impact in terms of their willingness to trust somebody again – and relationships are about trust at the end of the day. The stakes are actually incredibly high emotionally and psychologically.”\n\nClinical psychologist Dr. Daniel Glazer adds: “Most often, the victim is being promised a desired personal reward or fantasy.\n\n“It’s a method that criminals use because it elicits quick compliance — the victim doesn’t see the threat coming until it’s too late.”\n\nIt’s a horrifying scenario playing out in incidents across the country.\n\nIn Birmingham, gleeful Shannon Wolleter acted as bait so she could join her boyfriend and his two pals in launching a vile assault on their supposed friend, charity worker Anthony Cooper.\n\n\n\nThis honey trap plot wasn’t for money in this case, it was for revenge – the gang believed Anthony owed them £150 and disapproved of his partner.\n\n\n\nAfter pretending she was romantically interested in Anthony, Woolleter, 30, arranged to meet him for sex before texting her boyfriend Daniel Aston, 33, saying “got him”.\n\nIn a terrifying ordeal lasting four hours, Anthony was beaten by Steven Baker, 61, with his son Matthew Baker, 29, threatening to cut off his legs.\n\nThe gang also threatened to chop off their victim’s tongue, stamped on his genitals and struck him with an iron bar in the October 2021 attack.\n\nHoney trapper Wolleter, from Wilts, was sentenced to two years and ten months behind bars for kidnap and unlawful wounding.\n\nIn another revenge plot, Mundill Mahil was convicted in 2012 of grievous bodily harm with intent for her part in the killing of a TV executive and given six years inside, of which she served three.\n\n\n\nShe was found to have lured Gagandip Singh, 21, to her student flat in Brighton pretending she wanted to talk to him.\n\nInstead, two men waited for him in her bedroom, viciously beating him before leaving him to die in the boot of his burning car in 2011.\n\nWhile Mahil argued she had no idea he was in danger, prosecutors argued the motivation in this case was revenge after Mahil claimed he had previously attempted to rape her.\n\n\n\nHarinder Shoker, 20, was given a life sentence for murder and Darren Peters, also 20, was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter.\n\nMahil, then just 19, was jailed for six years.\n\nAfter her release she married a leading Labour councillor Varinder Singh Bola who was forced to quit as a mayor-elect of Redbridge, London when her previous convictions emerged.\n\nWhether they’re successful plots or not, using women as bait to lure in victims is a typically a carefully orchestrated crime.\n\nDavid says: “This isn’t random. It’s very constructed and carefully thought through. Fraudsters like this are very ‘good’ because they do their homework.\n\n\n\n“They are looking at the sorts of things that [victims] post on their social media, on their facebook page.\n\n“They are listening very carefully or reading very carefully and interpreting how you write about yourself and the kind of person that you might be seeking.”\n\nTeen honey-trapper\n\nTake Roani da Silva Sampaio, for example, who knew exactly how to portray herself to lure in exactly who she was looking for.\n\nPosing in a bikini on social media, she looked like she was living the influencer dream – but her lifestyle was simply bait for a high-stakes honey-trapping plot.\n\nAccording to reports, Sampaio was just 19 years old when she arranged to meet businessman Abel Landim for sex at his luxury apartment in Teresina, Brazil, in February 2021.\n\n\n\nWhile the temptress kept him busy in the shower, her boyfriend Francisco Moises Sousa Batista Jr and two accomplices broke into his property.\n\nTerrifying CCTV footage showed the three gang members kick down the door of the apartment before bursting into the home armed with a .38 revolver and an automatic pistol.\n\nBatista handcuffed victim Abel with plastic zip ties before beating him and holding a gun to his head for a terrifying game of Russian roulette, using a revolver with two bullets to terrify him into revealing where his valuables were stashed.\n\nThe gang stole cash, cameras, valuables and plundered the businessman’s bank accounts after forcing him to hand over his passwords and PINs.\n\n\n\nIncredibly, stricken Abel managed to call the cops as they ransacked his home, with the honey trapper and her boyfriend arrested on the spot.\n\nSampaio was jailed for 23 years and four months, while the three men – Batista, Jean Carlos and Thiago Ruan Martins de Sousa – were caged for 20 years.\n\nFrom the promise of a romantic relationship to a thrilling threesome, there’s no denying female honey trappers are currently seen as an easy way to gain the trust of innocent targets.\n\nBut, as David adds, nothing lasts forever – and as we become more aware of the techniques used by perpetrators, the less likely we are to fall victim.\n\n\n\nFinally he adds: “Honeytrapping will eventually fall out of fashion.\n\n“It will fall out of fashion because of articles like this – by drawing attention to it the public become more aware they have to be careful.\n\n“I always say if something looks too good to be true, it is too good to be true – you need to know the red flags.”"

            "content": "VLADIMIR Putin’s gymnast lover allegedly pocketed a staggering £63million in “leftover funds” from the construction of the tyrant’s £1billion Black Sea mega-palace.\n\nA bombshell probe claims cash that should have been accounted for after the despot’s lavish lair was built instead flowed straight into charities run by Alina Kabaeva – widely believed to be Putin’s secret partner.\n\n\n\n\n\nKabaeva, 42, is a former Olympic gold medallist long rumoured to share two sons with Putin, born in 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe explosive findings come from the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), set up by late opposition hero Alexei Navalny.\n\nThe vast estate near the resort town of Gelendzhik was first exposed by FBK in 2021.\n\nPutin and the Kremlin deny the clifftop compound belongs to him.\n\nOn paper, it is owned by a firm called Investment Solutions, allegedly buried in a web of shell companies.\n\nBut bank records reportedly showed Investment Solutions received loans from offshore entities in the British Virgin Islands, with the money filtered down the chain to fund construction.\n\n\n\nWhen work wrapped in 2023, investigators claim 6.5 billion rubles – around £63million – was left sitting in excess.\n\nAccording to the new FBK investigation, that eye-watering “surplus” was then donated to two non-profits controlled by Kabaeva.\n\nSome £29million allegedly went to the Alina Kabaeva Charitable Foundation, which publicly supports female athletes, runs a gymnastics festival and helped restore a church in occupied Crimea.\n\nBut Navalny’s team claims the charity‘s actual spending amounted to only tens of millions of rubles – with the rest reportedly parked in a deposit account.\n\nThe remaining £34million was funnelled to another Kabaeva outfit, Heavenly Grace.\n\n\n\nThat organisation reportedly splashed £288,000 at the Imperial Peterhof luxury watch factory, according to independent outlet Meduza.\n\nCash also went on gymnastics camps in the Novgorod region – which FBK claims were a cover so Putin and Kabaeva’s children could “play with others their own age”.\n\n\n\nThe bulk of the money, however, was allegedly stashed away, earning a reported 435 million rubles – roughly £4million – in interest in 2024 alone.\n\nNavalny’s group concluded the charities were nothing more than “slush funds” used to finance Putin and his secret family’s lifestyle “under the guise of philanthropy.”\n\nThe Gelendzhik mega-mansion has long been compared to a James Bond villain’s hideout.\n\nOne construction worker claimed it featured “a balcony hanging over the sea” where the owner could sip wine from palace stocks.\n\nBefore a revamp, it allegedly boasted a striptease stage and pole-dancing hookah hall.\n\n\n\nA May 2024 FBK probe found the palace had since been remodelled to include a church, complete with a wooden throne reportedly made for Putin, plus sacred icons and images.\n\nThree of Putin’s close associates – former classmate Viktor Khmarin, lawyer Nikolai Egorov and businessman Ilham Rahimov – are said to be shareholders in the official owner.\n\nThe palace cash storm erupts just weeks after Putin made a rare admission about his private life.\n\nIn a cringeworthy end-of-year Q&A, the divorced dictator was asked if he was in love.\n\n\n\n“Yes,” he replied.\n\n“That answers the final part of your question.”\n\nHe refused to name the mystery woman, but speculation instantly swirled around Kabaeva.\n\nIt comes as the Kremlin tyrant was accused in December of secretly grabbing an ultra-luxury £100million palace at Cape Aya in occupied Crimea – originally built for ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.\n\n\n\nThe sprawling compound reportedly includes a private hospital, operating theatre, cryochamber and gold-plated bathroom fittings.\n\nThe main house measures almost 97,000 square feet, with a second cliffside building hidden beneath landscaped gardens.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThere is also a private promenade, pier, artificial white-sand beach and helipad.\n\nFinancial records examined by Navalny’s team reportedly show the same funding network used for the Gelendzhik estate was also behind the Crimea complex."

            "content": "EMILE MYSTERY Five unanswered questions in Emile Soleil murder riddle from crucial 15 mins before vanishing to sudden mass DNA test\n\nMAJOR questions still hang over the death of toddler Emile Soleil more than two years after he disappeared.\n\nThe two-year-old vanished from his grandparents’ isolated holiday home in the French Alps on July 8, 2023 – and was found dead 266 days later.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis remains, including a fractured skull, were discovered in March 2024 by a rambler just 25 minutes from the Alpine hamlet of Haut-Vernet, south of Grenoble.\n\nProsecutors say he suffered “violent facial trauma” and claim his body was moved after death.\n\nNow, with locals reportedly being asked to give DNA samples in a huge new testing drive, five huge questions still hang over the case.\n\n\n\nWhy DNA testing three years after disappearance?\n\nIn a dramatic new development, cops have launched a mass DNA testing effort in Haut-Vernet.\n\nAround 100 villagers will reportedly have samples taken as detectives hunt what they believe could be the toddler’s killer.\n\nEmile’s grandparents, Philippe and Anne Vedovini, both 59, had their DNA taken at the start of the investigation.\n\nInvestigators have revealed the body had been moved when the child was already dead.\n\n\n\nEven more chillingly, Emile had not died in the clothes he was wearing when he was discovered.\n\nPublic prosecutor Jean-Luc Blachon said: “These elements allow us to consider that the body did not remain in the same place and in the same biotope during the decomposition process.”\n\nThe decomposition reportedly suggests the body may have been preserved in a protected environment, such as a freezer.\n\nThe fact his remains were found in an area already thoroughly searched has fuelled claims someone brought him back.\n\nIs the DNA sweep a sign detectives believe the answer lies within the tiny Alpine community?\n\n\n\nWhy were grandparents arrested?\n\nEmile’s grandparents were dramatically arrested in dawn raids along with two of their adult children – identified as the boy’s aunt and uncle.\n\nAll four faced charges of ‘intentional homicide’ and ‘concealing a corpse’, according to a statement from Aix-an-Provence prosecutors.\n\n\n\nThey were quizzed for 17 hours but later released.\n\nLead prosecutor Jean-Luc Bachon said the charges were “not sufficient to warrant an indictment”.\n\nHe added that all four had answered questions “put to them”.\n\nEnquiry sources confirmed the grandparents were detained following months of police wire taps.\n\nConversations between them and other family members were secretly listened to.\n\n\n\nPhilippe Vedovini is also under investigation in an entirely separate case relating to alleged sexual abuse at a Roman Catholic school in the 1990s.\n\nHe has always denied the claims and insisted he did nothing wrong.\n\nWhy did priest who baptised Emile ‘die by suicide’?\n\nIn another shocking twist, Father Claude Gilliot, who baptised Emile, allegedly died by suicide in recent weeks.\n\nThe 85-year-old reportedly left a suicide note when he was found after “a massive overdose”, according to an investigation source.\n\nThe priest had been close to Emile’s grandparents but is believed to have fallen out with them in recent years.\n\n\n\nHe even provided a photo of Emile to the media when the boy was missing – only to be condemned by the family.\n\nThe Vedovini family later boycotted his chapel.\n\nHis death has stunned locals, as under Catholic teaching, suicide is viewed as a mortal sin on par with murder.\n\nPolice have not publicly linked his death to the investigation.\n\nWhy was Emile left alone before disappearance?\n\nOn the day he vanished, Emile was last seen with his grandfather.\n\n\n\nPhilippe later admitted he had left the toddler alone in the garden during what he described as “fifteen minutes of inattention”.\n\nTwo witnesses claimed they saw the child wandering alone while Philippe was chopping wood.\n\nA source close to the investigation told La Depeche the pair who “confirmed that they saw the child walking alone at the time of his disappearance” are “reliable people” who they “trust completely”.\n\nEmile was wearing a yellow top, white shorts with a green pattern, and hiking shoes.\n\nHis parents were not in the village at the time.\n\n\n\nWhy did it take 266 days to find remains?\n\nEmile’s remains were discovered 266 days after he vanished – in an area already searched by cops, soldiers, sniffer dogs, volunteers, helicopters and drones.\n\nHow was he not found sooner?\n\n\n\nProsecutors confirmed the remains had been moved just before they were discovered.\n\nBlachon also said Emile’s body did not decompose in the clothes he was found in.\n\nLocals previously floated a wolf attack theory.\n\nOne person told Le Parisien at the time: “The little one must have been the victim of an animal. And I only see the wolf as the culprit.\n\n“They say wolves are afraid of people, but with a little boy like that, a big boy, the wolf would have seen him as another prey.”\n\n\n\nFrançois Balique, the mayor of Vernet, also reportedly appeared to believe the theory.\n\nBut the evidence now appears to point elsewhere.\n\nIt comes as disturbing background details about the family have also emerged.\n\nEmile’s father, Colomban, was arrested in 2018 over an alleged “attack on foreigners” before being released after agreeing to maintain the peace.\n\nHe was reportedly linked to Action Francaise and the neofascist Bastion Social.\n\n\n\nThree years later, he and Emile’s mother stood in a local election and were said to support Éric Zemmour.\n\nMeanwhile, Philippe Vedovini was previously implicated as an “assisted witness” in an enquiry into alleged abuse at the Riaumont boarding school in Pas-de-Calais.\n\nIn 2018, he admitted to administering “somewhat harsh” physical discipline but has always denied breaking the law.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nDespite the arrests, the raids, the wire taps and now the sweeping DNA dragnet, no one has been charged over Emile’s death.\n\nThe investigation continues."

I'll never give up on that. It is truly the most devastating thing to happen to our most sacred of places.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDenise said their charity was contacted yesterday and told James' grave was vandalised.

I was and am absolutely devastated.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe mum also revealed how the disgusting act has ruined her family's \"sacred day\" at the grave on March 16 - James' birthday - where they gather to remember him.\n\nShe added: \"One of the most upsetting things for us is that it is James' birthday in just a couple of weeks' time. We are meeting someone today to see what can be done to fix it, if anything. But the sad thing is every year on his birthday our family spends very important time going down there, being together and remembering my James.\n\nView 5 Images Pieces of the destroyed grave on the floor (Image: James Bulger Memorial Trust / SWNS)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"This year will not be the same.

It is yet another awful blow for us.\n\n\"That is our sacred place, a place where we can mourn, a place where I can reflect, remember my boy, but somebody is taking that away for us.\"\n\nTwo-year-old James was murdered by Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, both aged 10, in Liverpool in 1993.

As soon as we became aware of an isolated issue outside Morrisons Daily Nitshill on Wednesday we took immediate action. We are urgently investigating this and are taking appropriate measures to manage the situation.\"\n\nThis week, Glasgow Live reported that rats continue to plague streets across the city, with the rodent population having soared for nearly the seventh year in a row. A Freedom of Information Request (FOI) has revealed that in 2025, there were 12,155 reports of rats both inside homes and on streets, up from 10,341 in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, a pest controller said that rats are becoming more of a problem on UK streets due to food waste. Mick Muldoon of Pestforce, who operates in north London said it's not uncommon to see 40 rats in one bin in broad daylight these days.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHe emphasised it wasn't too long ago bin collections were once a week - now it's once a fortnight. He said this results in local residents essentially “fly tipping.” This creates a lot of food waste which attracts rodents.\n\nHe said that a good warning sign of rats in your property is birds of prey circling your garden - this means there are rats below it. Mick told The Mirror : “We are in a perpetual cycle - the conditions are just so. Rats in particular are a very clever and adaptable animal. There are a lot of construction works that disturb rat nests - we are disrupting them and providing them with more food and harbourage.”"

After his violent rampage, he started a new life with another partner\n\nView 7 Images Jenson-Lee Dougal died after being shook to death (Image: PA)\n\nLittle Jesen-Lee's smile lit up every room before his life was cruelly stamped out by the man tasked with protecting him.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA \"really happy baby\" adored by his family, the five-month-old was murdered by his mother's boyfriend in a \"rage filled attack\" while she was out at work.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThomas Morgan, 29, shook baby Jensen-Lee Dougal so violently that he ended up with injuries that experts described as the worst they had ever seen. This week, he was sentenced to a minimum of 19 years in prison.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJurors at Swansea Crown Court had to watch \"horrific\" and \"unforgettable\" CCTV of the tot looking \"limp and lifeless\" as he was carried out of the family home in Clydach, Swansea. Morgan brazenly lied about his actions to a 999 operator while a neighbour desperately tried to save the tot.\n\nThe killer embedded himself into the family quickly - striking up a relationship with Jensen-Lee's mum, Jordan Dougal, in December 2024 and moving in by January 2024, just two months before the assault.\n\nSobbing stepdad's horror 999 call after violently shaking baby boy to death READ MORE :\n\nView 7 Images Thomas Morgan has been jailed for at least 19 years (Image: PA)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJensen-Lee's distraught mother told the court that she \"never had any issues\" with Morgan caring for her baby and viewed him as his step-father. Heartbreakingly, she believed that she had found their family.\n\nHer baby suffered catastrophic brain injuries that Morgan sickeningly claimed were as a result of his stepson choking on sick and the efforts made to save him. He even feigned sobbing down the phone when he called 999 after a neighbour tried to treat the helpless baby.\n\nHis web of lies soon unravelled when the prosecution showed that the tot suffered injuries akin to those found in high velocity road traffic collisions or a fall from height.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe trial heard that on the day of Jensen-Lee's murder, Morgan, who has two of his own children, became involved in a 90-minute abusive text message argument with his ex-partner Georgia Griffiths - during which he called her a \"stinking little rat\", a \"coked-up whore\", and a \"deluded c***\".\n\nView 7 Images Jensen-Lee Dougal was just five-months-old when he died (Image: South Wales Police/Athena Pictures)\n\nSeething with anger, he texted the woman even while he was driving his car with a sleeping Jensen-Lee in the back, Wales Online reports. After arriving in Clydach, the thug went to buy some weed from a contact and then bought a case of larger and some pasties from a shop. All the while, the five-month baby was in the car. When they got home, Morgan turned on the TV to watch football.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJensen-Lee's family will never know exactly what happened between the time Morgan arrived home at 4:30pm and first called Jordan at 5:20pm. The thug was home alone with the youngster, and told a whole host of lies about what really went on.\n\nBut what we do know for certain is that the baby was shaken so violently he suffered catastrophic bleeding on the brain, bleeding in the spinal column, and bleeding behind the eyes along with multiple rib fractures. Damage was also found to an elbow joint and to the ankle joints.\n\nThe vile step-dad quickly started spinning tales after the attack. He claimed the tot vomited and also needed a new nappy and that when he returned to the living room with a clean babygrow, he found Jensen-Lee limp and unresponsive. Morgan claimed he thought the baby was choking and shook him to revive him before tapping him on the back, clearing his airways, and performing CPR.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 7 Images Jordan Dougal pregnant with Jensen-Lee (Image: WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\nThe brazen thug said he couldn't call 999 when Jensen-Lee became unresponsive, because of a 'problem' with the speaker on his phone. But he managed to call the baby's mother Jordan, who was at work, telling her the he was choking and had stopped breathing. Morgan took the infant outside and handed him to neighbour Hayley Evans who was first-aid trained. But tragically, it was too late.\n\nFollowing the sentencing hearing on Wednesday, South Wales Police released audio footage of Morgan speaking to a 999 operator. The operator said: \"Hello there, right. Are you there at the moment with the baby?\" Morgan said: \"Pardon.\" The operator said: \"How old is the baby?\" Morgan said: \"He's six months.\" The operator said: \"Six months olds - Is the baby male or female?\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMorgan said: \"He's male.\" The operator said: \"OK, is he breathing?\" Morgan said: \"He's like, he's getting deep breaths like here or there, but he wasn't, I don't know what he's doing now, there's someone doing CPR on him.\"\n\nOf the incessant abusive messages Morgan sent before the murder, Prosecutor Caroline Rees KC said: \"It is clear that this abusive exchange had flipped some kind of switch in Thomas Morgan. By the time he was alone with Jenson-Lee, he was angry and aggressive and in no state of mind to be caring for a young baby on his own...We have no way of knowing exactly what happened as you have lied to the police and to everyone that you have spoken to since.\" She added: \"Morgan has spun a web of lies and deceit in an attempt to cover up his guilt.\"\n\nView 7 Images Jordan had to make the devastating decision to turn her baby's life support off (Image: WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAfter neighbours called 999, paramedics spent 45 minutes performing CPR on Jensen-Lee and managed to re-establish a pulse. The tot was then was taken to University Hospital Wales in Cardiff where CT scans showed the extent and severity of his brain injuries. The next day, his mum Jordan made the impossible decision of switching off her baby's life support machine, and he died in her arms.\n\n\"He would just be stuck to a machine for the rest of his life\", she told jurors of her heartbreaking decision, adding \"I didn't want to remember him like that when he was such a happy baby.\"\n\nProfessor Stavros Stivaros from Royal Manchester Children Hospital, said there was catastrophic bleeding to Jensen-Lee's brain as well as the spinal cord even though there were no outward signs of any injuries.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe said the shaking would have been so violent that anybody witnessing it \"would have crossed a street to stop it happening\". The doctor also said Jensen-Lee would have been rendered unconscious almost immediately by the severity of the shaking, and it could not be as a result of rough play or an attempt at resuscitation.\n\nIn a devastating statement, Jensen-Lee's mother Jordan said: \"Jensen-Lee was just five months old when his life was taken. He was completely innocent and entirely dependent on the adults around him to keep him safe.\n\nView 7 Images Thomas Morgan was in a fit of rage before killing the tot (Image: WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Since Jensen-Lee's death, my life has been permanently changed. I live with overwhelming grief, trauma and emotional pain. I never had the chance to hear Jensen-Lee say he loved me. I will never hear him call me 'mammy'. I will never see him take his first steps, speak his first words, start school, or grow into the person he was meant to be. Those moments were not just lost – they were taken.\n\n\"Due to what Thomas Morgan did, I have also received a life sentence, but mine is one of grief. Jensen-Lee will never be forgotten. I love you, Jensen-Lee.\"\n\nHeartbroken Jordan told jurors that she feels the Morgan hasn't shown any genuine remorse since the murder, and has continued living his life like normal. In another unimaginably cruel blow, the child killer announced the gender of his new partner's baby on the anniversary of Jensen-Lee's death.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSentencing the thug to life with a minimum of 18 years and 136 days before can apply for parole, Mrs Justice Stacey told Morgan he had murdered an \"utterly defenceless baby\" who weighed just 12 and a half pounds (6kg).\n\nShe said: \"After you had dropped Ms Dougal off at work and returned your own children, you became embroiled in an increasingly heated row conducted over WhatsApp with the mother of your children.\n\nView 7 Images Jensen-Lee was known as a 'very happy baby' (Image: WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It began as you were driving home with Jensen-Lee asleep in his car seat and continued for 90 minutes. I am sure that the message exchange of 82 abusive messages between you made you angry and annoyed.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Detective Chief Inspector Lianne Rees said: \"With today's sentencing, we finally have justice for the terrible crime carried out by Thomas Morgan upon a defenceless baby boy.\n\n\"Thomas Morgan may now finally and rightfully be going to prison, but this will do little to alleviate the grief experienced by Jensen-Lee's family, and especially his mother Jordan, who placed her trust into her then-partner Thomas Morgan to take care of Jensen-Lee, only to experience the ultimate betrayal.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"I want to pay tribute to the members of the public, first responders and everyone involved in the desperate efforts to save Jensen-Lee's life, when faced with the most unimaginable and tragic circumstances back in March 2024. I also want to acknowledge the incredible dignity and strength shown by Jensen-Lee's family throughout this painful journey.\n\n\"Lastly, I would like to thank the investigation team, Crown Prosecution Service and Prosecution Counsel for their continued hard work throughout what has been a very difficult investigation and trial.\""

He died in jail aged 37 in 1982 but British Transport Police detectives are questioning witnesses and victims as they investigate his ex-associates.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEx-detective Graham Satchwell has found evidence indicating Ridgewell targeted more than 100 people. Mr Satchwell, who researched his book, Rot at the Core, with victim Winston Trew, suspects there were up to 18 bent cops implicated in the scandal.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Criminal Cases Review Commission said on Friday that the 50-year-old case of Christopher Poulter is the latest to be sent to the Court of Appeal.\n\nMr Poulter was 21 when he was convicted, alongside two others, of stealing mailbags from a railway goods yard in Clapham, south London. He was jailed for a year. Co-defendant Stephen Simmons, a businessman from Dorking, Surrey, was the first to have his conviction quashed in 2018.\n\nRapist talked parole board into freedom - then attacked woman with knife READ MORE :\n\nView 4 Images Winston Trew, a member of the 'Oval Four', who were framed by Ridgewell (Image: Phil Harris)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as your Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\nIn 2013, Simmons was advised by a barrister on LBC radio to Google the name of his arresting officer. He did so and found Ridgewell had been jailed for seven years for mailbag thefts. The April 1976 prosecution relied heavily on the evidence of Ridgewell despite the fact that by that time he had already been accused of corruption.\n\nBut instead of investigating the allegations, senior BTP officers moved him from the force’s “anti-mugging squad” to tackle postage thefts. In 1980 Ridgewell was jailed after stealing more than £1million of goods in transit.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images The 'Oval Four' were fitted up by Ridgewell (Image: Phil Harris)\n\nDespite Ridgewell being convicted in 1980, and Mr Simmons coming forward in 2013, it took until 2024 for the BTP to finally begin investigating. Mr Poulter's solicitor Jenny Wiltshire, of Hickman & Rose, said: “Even though half a century has passed since Mr Poulter was convicted of a crime which he did not commit, the CCRC’s referral of his case is a welcome development.\n\nView 4 Images Smirking Ridgewell was later jailed (Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nArticle continues below\n\n“Mr Poulter’s life has been profoundly altered by the ordeal of being set up, convicted, and imprisoned on the word of a police officer who was known at the time as being corrupt. While BTP has been criticised for doing too little to right Ridgewell’s wrongs, it is good news that the force is now finally taking active steps to track down his victims.”\n\nRidgewell arrested Mr Trew and four others at Oval tube station, South London, in 1972. They were beaten and jailed for eight months for assaulting an officer, with their convictions quashed 47 years later."

I’m so egotistical!”\n\nView 6 Images Alison Hammond, Noel Fielding, Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood (Image: Channel 4 / Love Productions)\n\nAs well as brushing up on her grandparenting skills, Dame Prue is keen to spend plenty of time holidaying, now she’s quit Bake Off. She says: “One of the chief reasons I gave up is because it’s filmed in the summer. I want a European summer holiday. I’m South African, I have to get near the sun. I’ve had lovely holidays in Africa, Australia. But I suddenly realised I might never have another holiday in Spain, or Italy, France, or Greece. I’ve cajoled the whole family to come away with me this summer.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOne family member unlikely to be invited is her new Main Coon cat called Sophisticat, or Sophie for short. Displaying hands that have been scratched to pieces, she laughs: “My birthday present from John. I’ve got a kitten now who is an escape artist, and has the sharpest claws in the world and loves to play. I’m completely shredded.\n\n“I’ve been texting Paul Hollywood non stop because he and his wife Mellissa have two Maine Coon cats too. He was the only person I told [she was leaving]. We’re such good friends and we’ve been a double act all this time - he needed to know first.”\n\n6 View 6 Images Prue Leith and John Playfair (Image: Getty Images for Pimm's) 6 View 6 Images Cook, writer and broadcaster Prue Leith (2nd-L), with daughter Li-Da Kruger (L), her son Danny Kruger and his wife Emma pose after she became a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRemaining in constant contact with Paul, she has been touched by the positive reaction to her departure. She says: “Nobody has said ‘good riddance’ - not one person! It’s extraordinary - it’s a cake show for goodness sake. There have been waves and waves of distress at my leaving, which is complete nonsense.”\n\nVery fond of her replacement, Nigella Lawson, 66, she says: “She’s terrific.” But Dame Prue, who invites film crews into her Cotswolds home for the popular ITV show Prue Leith’s Cotswold Kitchen, is not retiring yet. She says: “I love filming at home - I barely need to get out of bed,” quips Prue. “And I get to spend time with John, who tells me I’m too busy and never stop, which to some extent is true. I do like being busy.”\n\nDressed in characteristically colourful bold striped trousers and matching specs, she adds: “My husband buys all my clothes. He’s got great taste.” With her inspiring joie de vivre, fans may be surprised to hear that, at any given moment, Dame Prue is probably thinking about death. She says: “I think about death a lot. I look ahead and see death. Funnily enough I think it’s something that old people do.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 6 Images Prue with late husband Rayne and adopted daughter Li-Da (Image: Prue Leith)\n\n“I never thought about it in my 60s, but now it pops into my head most days. Just passing thoughts. The world is going to hell in a hand cart. Either AI will see us off, or war. I was born during the Second World War, and when it stopped we had 70/80 years of peace. But I think, ‘Oh well I won't be here - let them carry on.’ It’s quite comforting - I won't have to worry about that. I don’t have long left. Ten years if I’m lucky. I need to use them well.”\n\nA keen advocate for assisted dying, while she is still “relatively healthy,” to the horror of her MP son, she has decided exactly how she’d like to go. She says: “I would like to go in my bed, surrounded by my family, at a time of my choosing. “When I’ve had enough, I just want to be able to take some drug, have someone inject me with something or other, and plan it.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“I want to be ready, I won't be frightened, my family will know what I’m doing, there will be no surprises, nobody is going to have to find me dead in a heap or something. I’m up against some really strong opposition. My son leads the opposition. And he’s an incredibly formidable opponent. But I think assisted dying, while it might sound extreme, is sensible. A lot of people have an absolutely horrible death, and unnecessarily so.”\n\n6 View 6 Images The Mirror's Hannah Britt meets Prue Leith 6 View 6 Images Hannah and Prue\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe blames opposition to choosing when to die on serial killer Harold Shipman. She says: “Harold Shipman - I bet you didn’t think we’d be talking about him this afternoon - changed everything, because he killed a lot of old ladies. But it’s possible to have a good death. Lots of countries have passed this law and nobody has ever tried to rescind it. Four per cent of people in Canada are dying now in this way, and I think it's proof that it’s a popular bill. I wouldn't be surprised if it was 50% when word gets around how much nicer it is. I feel quite strongly about it.”\n\nYet, despite all the talk of death, Prue isn’t planning to go quite yet. In fact, she isn’t even considering settling into her dotage. She says: “I don’t like the word ‘retire’. But then I have always loved to work. Though I’m rather hoping this book will be my last. It’s amazing to be 86. It’s a vast old age and I’m quite astonished to be there. People think of old age as such a tragedy. But, honestly, for a lot of people it’s just like the rest of life.\n\n“I have no reason to be unhappy. If I wasn’t happy I think it would be disgracefully ungrateful, because I have all the things that make you happy. I’m comparatively healthy for my age. I sleep well. I eat well. I love well. I’ve had two happy marriages and the second one is still going strong. Both my children are fine, all my grandchildren are healthy. I’ve had a successful career. What is there to complain about? Nothing.”\n\nArticle continues below\n\n*Being Old and Learning to Love it by Prue Leith, published by Short Books £20, is out now"

He was left in a pool of blood in a workshop at HMP Frankland on Thursday morning.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPolice and prison authorities have not confirmed the identity of the suspect, named as triple killer Anthony Russell. Huntley, who worked as a cleaner on A wing at Frankland, had given up prison food because he was so convinced his fellow inmates were \"out to get him.\"\n\nHe had been attacked before at Frankland, and HMP Wakefield, where he also attempted to take his own life in 2005.\n\nView 7 Images Ian Huntley after a failed suicide bid in Wakefield jail in 2005 (Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

So he bought snack food from the shop so he knew exactly what he was eating.\"\n\nDurham Police said there has been no change in the 52-year-old’s condition overnight. \"He remains in hospital in a serious condition,\" said their spokesperson.\n\nView 7 Images Huntley was attacked on Thursday morning (Image: Unknown)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHuntley is serving a life sentence for the murders of 10-year-olds Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman after they left a family barbecue to buy sweets in Soham, Cambridgeshire, on August 4 2002.\n\nHe dumped their bodies in a ditch and fell under suspicion after giving media interviews about the police investigation. He is serving a minimum 40-year term and has become an increasingly isolated figure behind bars.\n\nView 7 Images Anthony Russell reportedly attacked Ian Huntley at HMP Frankland (Image: West Midlands Police)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"He does not look like the man we saw on TV all those years ago,\" the source added. \"He is much, much heavier, his weight has ballooned because of his diet.\" Huntley, like many long term prisoners, had tried various ploys to improve his regime.\n\nHe worked as a cleaner on the wing so that staff could closely monitor him. He is held alongside others at risk of attack and kept apart from the rest of the prison population. But his attacker struck \"when it was least expected\", according to insiders.\n\nView 7 Images Durham's Frankland jail (Image: PA)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Huntley's wing is like a prison within a prison,\" they added. \"Some inmates there convert to Islam because the food is meant to be better. They also think the regime allows more time out of the cell to pray. They say the food is like having a takeaway.\"\n\nHuntley was attacked with a 'heavy metal bar' just after 9am on Thursday. He was battered so violently around the head that there were fears for his life. He has been attacked three times while behind bars and has twice attempted suicide.\n\nView 7 Images Huntley was jailed for the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in 2002 (Image: Shutterstock)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe bodies of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman were found two weeks after they disappeared in August 2002.\n\nHuntley was convicted in December 2003 following a trial at the Old Bailey. His girlfriend Maxine Carr, a teaching assistant at the girls' primary school, was also jailed in 2003 after being found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice.\n\nView 7 Images Police sealed off Huntley's home, which he shared with Maxine Carr (Image: PA)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nShe was freed from jail and given a new identity in May 2004. After his arrest, it emerged Huntley had been able to work with children despite facing rape and sexual assault complaints.\n\nHe had been the subject of a series of allegations made to police in Humberside, where he previously worked. A subsequent inquiry led to criminal checks on anyone working with children.\n\nHuntley was scalded with boiling water at HMP Wakefield in 2005. He was moved to Frankland, where robber Damien Fowkes slashed him in 2010. The wound was 7in (18cm) long and required 21 stitches. Fowkes asked a prison officer: \"Is he dead? I hope so.\""

            "content": "Conor Benn is set for a return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after agreeing to share top billing with Tyson Fury and Arslan Makhmudov and fight Regis Prograis in his first outing for new promotion Zuffa Boxing.\n\nThe British fighter announced his split with long-time promoter Eddie Hearn last week after 10 years of working together, with Benn instead joining Hearn's rival Dana White's fledgling company in an eight-figure deal.\n\nHearn revealed that he was 'devastated' by the defection, not least because he stood by the boxing dynasty scion throughout his ordeal over two failed drug tests in 2022.\n\nBenn previously fought in north London when he faced off with Chris Eubank Jr last year, with the fighter gaining his revenge after first being defeated by Eubank Jr in their initial meeting at the stadium.\n\nHis match-up with US light welterweight Prograis is set to take place on Saturday April 11, with their main event coming ahead of Fury's return to the ring after his retirement last year.\n\nThe evening is also set to be Netflix's first-ever live broadcast, following a number of events shown from the United States - including Anthony Joshua's meeting with Jake Paul last December - by the streaming giant.\n\nConor Benn will fight Regis Prograis on April 11 on the same card as the returning Tyson Fury\n\nFormer world champion Prograis last faced off with Jack Catterall on British soil at the Co-op Live in October 2024, with the Louisiana native losing to the Englishman by unanimous decision.\n\nBenn's decision to desert Hearn cast ripples through the boxing world, with Frank Warren sharing his comment in the form of a quote first made by former US President Harry S. Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

            "content": "Frank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\n\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "Opta supercomputer reveals the favourite to win the Champions League - as one Premier League club has a slim ONE per cent chance of glory after knock-out stage draw\n\nThe Opta supercomputer has confirmed that Arsenal remain the favourites to claim their maiden Champions League trophy after the final draw for the knockout stages of the competition took place on Friday morning.\n\nMikel Arteta's side - who are still Premier League frontrunners after navigating a challenging winter spell - are in contention for an unprecedented quadruple this season after a run of consecutive near-misses in recent years.\n\nWhile chasing the league remains a priority for many Gunners fans after successive second-place finishes, the chance to gain major European silverware for the first time is a tempting motivation for the squad as they enter the business end of the season.\n\nAnd following Friday's draw, chances of making the final in Budapest appear to have only intensified, after the north London team were drawn against Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nShould they progress, their Blue pathway would see them then meet either Bodo/Glimt or Sporting Lisbon in the quarter-finals.\n\nTheir semi-final opponent could be one of the winners of either Newcastle versus Barcelona, or Atletico Madrid's meeting with Tottenham.\n\nArsenal remain on-track to break new ground at Europe's top table at the end of the season\n\nConveniently, the last 10 winners of the Champions League - Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid - are on the other 'Silver' pathway.\n\nDespite being drawn amongst a pack with a stronger European pedigree however, Bayern Munich are the closest contenders to spoil Arsenal's path, with Opta grading their 14.28 per cent chance of lifting the trophy second to the Gunners' 27.40 per cent chance.\n\nFans of the English game will be pleased to note that four of the top six clubs with the highest chance of claiming glory in Hungary are from the Premier League with Liverpool and Manchester City - who play Galatasaray and Real Madrid in the round of 16 respectively - the third and fourth-likeliest to win the Champions League.\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE PREDICTIONS Arsenal - 27.40 per cent chance Bayern Munich - 14.28 per cent chance Liverpool - 12.83 per cent chance Man City - 10.79 per cent chance Barcelona - 7.72 per cent chance Chelsea - 6.86 per cent chance Newcastle - 4.66 per cent chance Paris Saint-Germain - 4.64 per cent chance Real Madrid - 2.78 per cent chance Sporting Lisbon - 2.73 per cent chance Atletico Madrid - 2.00 per cent chance Tottenham - 1.22 per cent chance\n\nLiverpool, who would then play the winner of Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, have a 12.83 per cent chance, narrowly edging Man City, who have a 10.79 per cent chance.\n\nChelsea round out the cohort, with a significantly smaller 6.86 per cent chance, but the Blues will be confident heading into their match-up with the title-holders having beaten them roundly in the Club World Cup final last July.\n\nNewcastle just miss out on making the top six with their 4.66 per cent chance of winning the trophy, having navigated their way through a one-sided play-off match-up with Azerbaijan side Qarabag.\n\nThe remaining Premier League team still in play in Europe's top club competition, Tottenham, have a slender 1.22 per cent chance.\n\nIgor Tudor's injury-ravaged squad will likely throw full focus onto avoiding relegation one season on from winning the Europa League, with Atletico - who have a 2.00 per cent chance of winning the trophy - the favourites to make it into the quarter-finals.\n\nArsenal romped through the league phase to finish top of the table in the new-look model, with Liverpool, Man City, and Chelsea also qualifying automatically.\n\n\n\nOf the favourites for the title, only PSG were forced to endure a more arduous route to the round of 16, sneaking a win over two legs against Ligue 1 rivals Monaco 5-4 on aggregate."

            "content": "The previously unseen reaction from Geri Halliwell to her husband Christian Horner being booed by fans in the wake of his sex texting scandal has been revealed.\n\nHalliwell, 53, was a semi-regular fixture on race weekends alongside her husband, often appearing in the paddock at prominent races such as the British Grand Prix, before he was sacked as Red Bull chief during the last season.\n\nIn February 2024, the paddock was stunned by a leaked cache of suggestive messages purporting to be from Horner. Horner was later accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour by a female member of staff, with an internal investigation led by KCs twice clearing him of wrongdoing. Halliwell supported him throughout.\n\nRed Bull GmbH in Salzburg - the world champion team's parent company - said in a statement: 'The independent investigation into the allegations made against Mr Horner is complete, and Red Bull can confirm that the grievance has been dismissed.\n\n'The complainant has a right of appeal. Red Bull is confident that the investigation has been fair, rigorous and impartial.\n\n'The investigation report is confidential and contains the private information of the parties and third parties who assisted in the investigation, and, therefore, we will not be commenting further out of respect for all concerned. Red Bull will continue striving to meet the highest workplace standards.'\n\nGeri Halliwell's previously unseen reaction to Christian Horner being booed after his sex text scandal engulfed Formula One\n\nSpice Girl Halliwell stood by her husband (right) as he was subject to an internal investigation\n\nThe exact nature of the complaints remain unknown, but Horner was questioned by a KC for a full day at a secret location last year as the barrister gathered evidence that he wrote up in 150 pages for the Red Bull board's determination. Horner always denied the accusations.\n\nStill, at the F1 72 launch event at the O2 in February last year, fans opted to boo him vigorously as he took to the stage to carry out his speech.\n\nHe wore a grin, and said: 'It's a pleasure to be at the O2, anyway. I hope everyone is having a good night.'\n\nNetflix cameras, meanwhile, captured the reaction of Halliwell. The Spice Girl could be seen watching on, also smiling, but seemingly concerned for her husband.\n\nHorner told the documentary: 'When you become a serial winner the crowd and the audience, they don't wanna see that. In Formula One, there's this element of pantomime, we're now like the Kardashians on wheels.\n\n'But I'm way past even caring what other people think.\n\nHe later added: 'You have to be the pantomime villain. We are different, and that's what makes us who we are. This isn't a popularity contest it's Formula One and you're judged on the result sheets at the end of the day.\n\n'It's easier to be the hunter than the hunted and of course, for us, anything outside of total domination, is not good enough.'\n\nHorner was sacked from his role at Red Bull amid a suspected power struggle at the Thai-Austrian constructor\n\nAfter his speech, Horner was seen awkwardly looking for directions to his seat in the audience.\n\nAs Horner was booed, Ferrari duo Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc watched on, as did Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Liam Lawson.\n\nHamilton, stunned, could be seen backstage saying 's***.' Lawson, meanwhile, said: 'I think we are going to get a lot of boos,' to which Verstappen replied: 'I don't give a f***.'\n\nHorner was also present at Red Bull's new car launch on February 15 - three days before the event at the O2 - and spoke for the first time since allegations came to light, claiming Geri had been 'very supportive' before insisting he would be present at the Bahrain curtain-raiser.\n\n'I have a very supportive family and a very supportive wife,' he said. 'My focus has been on the job and the season ahead.\n\n'There's been a day job to be getting on with. I feel the support within the business and our partners, and within the industry. It is overwhelming.\n\n'There's a process that's ongoing at the moment. Some allegations have been made, which I fully deny and I have fully complied with that process and will continue to do so until it's dealt with.\n\n'Everybody's focused on one thing, which is the performance of that car to go out and defend both the world titles that we've worked so hard to achieve over the last couple of years.\n\nA shocked Lewis Hamilton said 's***' as he heard the reaction to Horner's entrance at the O2\n\n'So the car is what everybody is invested in and I look forward to seeing it in action in Bahrain next week.'\n\nHorner won 13 world championships in charge of the team since taking over as a 31-year-old in 2005. Mid-way through the 2025 season, however, amid a suspected power struggle at the Thai-Austrian constructor - and one year on from his sex texting scandal - he was sacked, and eventually left the team in July after receiving an £80million package."

One user posted: 'Looks nothing like him,' accompanied by a laughing face emoji, while another wrote: 'Maybe to a blind person.'\n\nThe post has now been deleted from West Midlands Police's social media.\n\nThe real Gerrard, meanwhile, made his name with his midfield performances for club and country until his retirement in 2016.\n\nAfter he hung up his boots, he took up coaching, and has had spells with Rangers, Aston Villa and Al-Ettifaq.\n\nRecently, though, after little success in his last two jobs, he has been back on screen analysing games with the likes of TNT Sports.\n\n\n\nAs a player, he made 710 appearances for Liverpool, and a further 114 for England."

Being blunt about everything that everyone thought wasn't right,' he added.\n\n'If you're five or six weeks in and you think he's not delivering, okay, then you have a point. But to throw out such strong opinions based on his first half hour, I thought, was inappropriate.'\n\nAfter Sterling's cameo appearance last Sunday, one Instagram account called FootballPark, boasting almost 100k followers, wrote that the ex-England international looked like 'Bambi on Ice' and even suggested he should consider retiring.\n\nThe author, who was by no means the only social media account ripping into the footballer, posted: 'Raheem Sterling's debut for Feyenoord was not exactly a success story – in fact, it looked like a veritable disaster from the Dutch club's point of view.\n\n'The English winger looked like Bambi on ice. On a downward spiral since 2022, lacking motivation, and seemingly unable to play under anyone who isn't named Pep Guardiola, Sterling is well and truly into his twilight years. Is it time to hang the boots up once and for all?'\n\nSterling's former Manchester City team-mate Jack Grealish jumped in to defend the 31-year-old star online, taking issue with the post.\n\n'What a f*****g stupid Instagram post man what's wrong with you guys. Guy hasn't played or trained for so long. Ppl like u guys is what wrong with the world. Have some respect,' he wrote."

            "content": "James Milner opens up on career-threatening injury that left him unable to lift his foot for SIX months last season - as he reveals future plans after breaking Premier League appearance record\n\nAs James Milner reflected on becoming the Premier League's record appearance holder last weekend, his mind may have wondered back to last season - when a milestone that has long seemed inevitable felt like a distant dream.\n\nMilner was expected to be sidelined for only a few weeks after limping out of a draw with Arsenal in August 2024. However, complications with a routine knee operation meant that six months later he was still unable to lift his foot or toes.\n\n'Things change quickly in football, especially when you get to my age,' Milner recalled at Brighton's training ground this week, speaking to a group of reporters at a briefing to mark his incredible achievement.\n\n'When I look at where I was last year, not being able to lift my foot for six months...\n\n'I think most people, including the surgeon, the physio and those who understood the injury thought I was finished at my age.'\n\nAfter an arduous, near nine-month recovery, the 40-year-old - who celebrated his record with characteristic humility - returned from the bench for the final minutes of Brighton's game at Tottenham on the last day of the season.\n\nJames Milner became the Premier League's record appearance holder (654) last weekend\n\nMilner is now in his 24th consecutive Premier League season and is a legend of the league (pictured as a 16-year-old during his debut campaign for Leeds back in 2002-03)\n\nThe determination, professionalism and resilience required to battle back from a career-threatening injury are hallmarks of a man who made the first of his 654 Premier League appearances as a 16-year-old for Leeds United on November 10, 2002. That was nearly three years before his current midfield colleague, Jack Hinshelwood, was born.\n\n'It was that desire to prove people wrong that probably means I'm still playing now,' added Milner, who managed only four appearances in 2024-25.\n\n'I wanted to prove that I could recover from the injury and not let my career end in a way that wasn't in my control.\n\n'It might still might happen, but that was the drive. I don't think many people believed I could return.'\n\nMilner, who surpassed his former England, Man City and Aston Villa team-mate Gareth Barry to claim the record, boasts a resume that includes 61 England caps and impressive spells at Leeds, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Man City, Liverpool and Brighton - plus a brief loan stint at Swindon as a 17-year-old.\n\nHis enduring popularity and respect within the game was evident in the tributes that poured in last Saturday, and you'd be hard pressed to find fans of any of his former clubs with a negative word to say about him.\n\nMilner admitted his phone 'blew up' with messages, including one exchange with Barry, who he credits for encouraging him to take up yoga during the latter part of his career.\n\nDespite his age, Milner remains in exceptional condition, with no grey hairs in sight. His triceps strain against his training top, though he jokes his ankles crack when he tries to sneak quietly into his children's rooms to kiss them goodnight.\n\nHe is engaging company too, frequently drawing laughter with his self-deprecating humour.\n\nMilner pictured with previous record holder Gareth Barry in 2005 during their Aston Villa days\n\nHe suffered a career-threatening injury last season but battled back to take the record\n\nMilner's desire to prove doubters wrong has been a recurring theme throughout his career.\n\nPerhaps most notably, when Graeme Souness - then Newcastle manager - loaned him to Aston Villa for the 2005-06 campaign, he said: 'You won't win the league with James Milners'.\n\nSouness was dismissed the following February and Milner has gone on to win three Premier League titles - twice with Man City and once with Liverpool, where he also lifted the Champions League.\n\nIn spite of his achievements, the motivation burns as strongly as ever in a player who has worked under 21 managers.\n\n'You always have your doubters no matter what you achieve,' added Milner, who credits his father Peter for instilling that mentality. 'You want to be the best, and proving people wrong has always been at the forefront of my mind.'\n\nThis week, Milner was presented with three Guinness World Records; the most Premier League appearances (654), most consecutive Premier League seasons played (24), and the longest period between a player's first and last Premier League goals (22 years and 248 days).\n\nMilner has won three Premier League titles despite previously facing doubts over his ability\n\nMilner said he is 'very open' to signing a new contract at Brighton and playing another season\n\nHe may now have his sights on surpassing Teddy Sheringham's record as the oldest outfield player in Premier League history (40 years and 272 days). Milner is currently 40 years and 54 days old.\n\nThe midfielder is out of contract this summer, although Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has expressed a desire to keep him for another season. So what does the future hold?\n\n'I'm very open to playing another year,' Milner explained. 'Whether I will or not, I'm not sure. I haven't had any conversations with the club yet and they have to want me as well.\n\n'Earlier in the season, I said let's get to February and see where we're at. We're there now, so we'll see what happens. I'm just doing my work every day, and hopefully the last few games showed I can still contribute on the pitch.'\n\nMilner is undecided about moving into coaching when he eventually hangs up his boots, saying he plans to rest and take a break first. He insists he doesn't fear retirement, though he may miss the structure of professional football and could turn to marathons to give himself a new challenge.\n\nAs the conversation draws to a close, Milner believes the best individual season of his career came at Aston Villa. He ranks being part of the beginning of Man City's era of dominance and helping restore Liverpool to glory as his proudest achievements.\n\nAbove all, however, Milner is grateful.\n\n'When I was younger, if there was a bad first half, there could be teacups flying and walls punched in the dressing room,' he said.\n\n'Things have changed, but there's so much good in the game now as well. I just feel fortunate and lucky that I've played through, and been a part of, two eras.'\n\n\n\nYou would be foolish to write Milner off just yet."

Dressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, he sinks into a plush seat with the same composed demeanour that has defined his game. Afterwards, he says with a smile, the plan is simple: take a nap.\n\nThat understated presence has long shaped Wan-Bissaka’s identity, a player more comfortable letting performances speak for themselves than seeking attention. Now with West Ham after a formative spell at Manchester United, he is in reflective mood, revisiting a journey that has carried him from London estates to Old Trafford and back again.\n\nAs the conversation unfolds, the story is as much about family and sacrifice as it is about football. Long before the bright lights of the Premier League, Wan-Bissaka’s football education began on the patch of grass outside his childhood home.\n\n'I was probably age five when I first fell in love with football,' he says. 'It was just me and my brother in the estate playing around with a ball. We would go out to the green opposite our house to play. We'd call it our Wembley.\n\n'It didn’t really click until around 16, when I realised there was a genuine chance of becoming a professional. That’s when I saw the opportunity to put my foot down and properly chase the dream.'\n\nDressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, Aaron Wan-Bissaka is in reflective mood when he meets Daily Mail Sport\n\nThough Wan-Bissaka grew up idolising Thierry Henry, he has grown into a highly dependable, no-nonsense full back\n\nLike many London kids of his generation, his first football idol was Thierry Henry. 'I always wanted to be him,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'Honestly, I used to have this vision of me being him, and growing up to be that sort of player. He was my idol. I think it was because of his composure. He scored lots of goals but he also carried the team. He was a leader. My whole family were Arsenal fans when I was growing up, too.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s boyhood dream contrasts with his reputation as a no-nonsense defender, and the 28-year-old’s career was ultimately forged through family resilience and a demanding relationship with his father.\n\n'I didn't realise how much my parents were sacrificing for my dream to begin with,' he says. 'When I got into secondary school, which is the age when you start to want things like trainers and boots, I was quite demanding. But they would brush it aside and be like, \"You have to wait a couple of months\". That's when I realised that it wasn't easy for my parents to give me the things I was asking for.\n\n'They worked cleaning jobs to afford my boots and my dad would get in trouble for leaving work early to bring me to training.'\n\nHis father Ambrose’s influence came through discipline rather than praise. 'It was difficult because there was a language barrier between us. His English wasn't great and my French wasn't great so there were only a few words exchanged at times,' recalls Wan-Bissaka, who has now played nine times for the country of his father's birth, DR Congo. They will face either New Caledonia or Jamaica next month in FIFA's inter-confederation play-offs in Zapopan, Mexico, for a place at this summer's World Cup.\n\n'We mainly spoke about football. But he was always critiquing me or telling me what I could do better. It was never praise. I have to say, I found it confusing at the time. I always wondered why he wouldn't praise me. I used to question myself: \"Am I not doing enough?\"'\n\n'Even after I scored, I would come off the pitch and he wouldn't be pleased. I used to just think to myself, \"Is one goal not enough?\" But then as I got older I started to understand it. He just wanted me to test myself and become the best version of myself.'\n\nAfter taking to Premier League life with ease at Crystal Palace, where he won player of the year in his first full season in senior football, a £50million move to United soon followed. It was the biggest step of Wan-Bissaka's career - and one of the most challenging periods of his life.\n\nWan-Bissaka felt extremely homesick after making a big-money move to Manchester United. 'Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep,' he admits\n\nThe defender's positive relationship with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a source of reassurance. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well,' says Wan-Bissaka of his former boss\n\n'When I moved to United, I really missed home, my family and friends especially,' he reveals. 'After training, I used to take the train back to London almost every day. It’s only about two hours, but it’s still a big commitment, and eventually it became exhausting, so I knew I had to stop.\n\n'It was something I wasn’t used to at all. I’d always been comfortable at home in London, surrounded by familiar people and places, so for everything to change overnight was difficult to adapt to. Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep. I struggled. It was probably the lowest I’d felt.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s big-money arrival from Palace in 2019 - which coincided with a first England call-up, though he was never capped due to injury - came with a mountain of expectation. But he quickly became a fixture in the United XI, starting more matches than any player across Europe’s top-five leagues in 2020-21.\n\nHis early relationship with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer offered reassurance amid his struggles off the pitch.\n\n'My relationship with Ole was good from the start,' he recalls. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well, and I think the rest of the players felt the same about him. He’s the kind of manager who backs you straight away. Once he gives you a job to do, it’s up to you to trust yourself and go out and deliver it.'\n\nManagerial turnover would later test that security, particularly under Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag.\n\n'Obviously, it’s football, every manager has their preferences,' he says. 'They might like you or they might not, and that’s just part of the game. When he (Rangnick) came in, it wasn’t the best period for me and there was a lot of criticism around…\n\n'It was difficult when Erik ten Hag arrived - as soon as he did, he told me I wasn’t in his plans. But when I tried to leave, he said he didn’t want me to go. I couldn't understand it. That was tough mentally, because it left me wondering what I was supposed to do next.\n\nWan-Bissaka initially struggled to gel as effectively with Solskjaer's successors, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag\n\nHis relationship with Ten Hag ultimately improved, and the pair lifted the Carabao Cup with United in 2023\n\n'I just kept my head down and told myself to keep training, keep improving, and play my game. Staying motivated was hard though, especially when you’re training without the clear goal of playing.\n\n'But the people around me guided me in the right way and encouraged me to keep going. Eventually things turned around and started to improve. You could say I changed or developed tactically under him, because that was something he wanted.'\n\nClarity, he says, is invaluable. And something the right back received from Michael Carrick. He speaks highly of United's recently-appointed interim boss, praising the simplicity of his messaging during his previous caretaker spell in 2021.\n\nNo wonder, then, that he backs Carrick to be given the permanent job after such an impressive start second time around.\n\n'He's someone you can trust,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'He will also trust you back if you buy into him and what he's looking to do. If you trust him, he will trust you.\n\n'He was quite simple in what he wanted from you. The boys were happy with him and the games he had when he was the manager. With him back at the club now, they are in a good place as a team. I think he should be given the full-time role. I think he deserves it.'\n\nIf Manchester represented pressure and growth, West Ham has provided renewal. The move back to London offered proximity to family and a fresh football environment.\n\nHis impressive form in his debut season saw him named 'Hammer of the Year' in May, beating out fan favourite Jarrod Bowen to the award.\n\nWan-Bissaka opens up to Daily Mail Sport's Charlotte Daly about his career - both the highs and the lows\n\n'At West Ham, I’ve been really happy with how things have been going,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'You can probably tell from the smile on my face'\n\nThough the club have struggled this season - sitting in the relegation zone with 11 games to go, despite an upturn in form under Nuno Espirito Santo - he has no regrets about making the move.\n\n'I was in two minds (about moving initially), to be honest,' he says. 'I had a year left on my contract, but I felt I needed to get back on my feet and start playing regularly - not just every couple of games.\n\n'Looking back on my time at Manchester United, I’m grateful for it. Those experiences made me who I am today and helped me both on and off the pitch, especially mentally.\n\n'With all the noise and scrutiny at a club like United, a change of environment can make a big difference. At West Ham, it’s not as intense… I’ve been really happy with how things have been going. You can probably tell from the smile on my face every day. I am playing with a smile too.'"

            "content": "Former Barcelona defender Jeremy Mathieu has explained the painful reasons behind him working in a French sport shop just six years after retiring.\n\nThe 42-year-old was once one of his country's finest centre-backs and helped the Catalan club to two LaLiga titles, two Spanish Cups and European glory during a successful career.\n\nBut Mathieu's life is drastically different now to the one he lived as a top footballer.\n\nLast year, fans were shocked to see him working at Intersport, a major chain of sport shops in his homeland, as a manager in their football department in a branch between Aix-en-Provence and Marseille.\n\nA photograph of the ex-Barcelona defender wearing company uniform and pictured with customers was shared online, prompting hordes of fans to visit the shop to see him.\n\nMathieu reportedly earned £100,000-a-week at Barcelona, so it was a surprise to see him working a normal job after hanging up his boots.\n\nFormer Barcelona defender Jeremy Mathieu (centre) now works as a shop assistant in France\n\nBut he has now spoken to beIN Sports about how he has struggled in his life after football, alluding to financial difficulties and admitting his mental health deteriorated.\n\nMathieu said: 'If I'm working at Intersport, it's because something's going on that's causing me a lot of problems.\n\n'I can only say that I'm in the middle of a lawsuit. I will not do it forever. It was to have a social life.'\n\nThe Frenchman has also been battling depression and said it is something he has not 'fully' recovered from.\n\nA former team-mate of Mathieu, Loïc Loval-Landré, was able to help him find the job to get him out of the house and in a social environment.\n\nMathieu revealed: 'He knew I wanted to leave the house for a bit, I had been doing nothing for a while. We were chatting, and he told me there was a vacant position.'\n\nHe called time on his career after a nasty knee injury while playing for Sporting Lisbon at the age of 36 in 2020.\n\nMathieu came off the bench during Barcelona's Champions League final triumph against Juventus in 2015, helping his side to a 3-1 victory which confirmed an iconic Treble under former manager Luis Enrique.\n\nMathieu, pictured with Luis Suarez, also won two LaLiga titles during his three years at Barca\n\nAlthough he was primarily used as back-up for first team centre-halves Javier Mascherano and Gerard Pique, the Frenchman's versatility and experience was valued hugely by Enrique, who often used him as cover for Jordi Alba at left-back too.\n\nWhen asked about his time at the club, he reflected that his abiding memory was of Lionel Messi's genius.\n\n'Messi was incredible. In training, you couldn’t do anything. I think I was a better free-kick taker,' he added with a smile.\n\nDespite winning the majority of his honours at Barcelona, Mathieu played much of his career at fellow LaLiga outfit Valencia — where he made 177 appearances in all competitions."

It is understood that he moved forwards into the shaft without realising the car wasn't there.\n\nPavan is said to have sustained multiple injuries, revealing on Friday that he has had shoulder and back surgery, and a former coach has said he feels 'lucky to be alive.'\n\n'I would like to say a big thank you for all the kind words and wishes I have received over the last 48 hours,' Pavan said in a statement released by the DP World Tour. 'I had surgery on my shoulder and my back on Wednesday evening and I am currently recovering in hospital.\n\n'I now have a lot of rehab and hard work ahead of me, but the care I have received so far from the Mediclinic hospital staff has been incredible, as has the support from the DP World Tour, the Sunshine Tour and all their staff here in Stellenbosch. I am also very grateful for all the help Johann Rupert and his wife Gaynor have given me.\n\nHarrowing details have emerged of the freak incident that saw Italian golfer Andrea Pavan fall down a lift shaft\n\nPavan, pictured with his family, is said to have tumbled down two to three floors in the terrifying fall\n\n'The last two days have been difficult, but I am in very good hands and to have so many players, caddies and staff visit and contact me has meant a lot to me.\n\n'Grazie mille everyone, from me, my wife Audra, and my entire family.'\n\nJT Higgins, who is a former college coach of Pavan's, meanwhile, told Golf Channel: 'By all accounts, he's in good spirits, thankful to be alive and FaceTiming with his kids.'\n\nBoth players and friends are said to have visited the star in hospital, with his wife, Audra, travelling from Texas to be by his side.\n\n\n\nPavan's Texas A&M team-mate Matt Van Zandt has set up a GoFundMe page to help the expenses facing the Italian and his family, and said that he expects the golfer 'to remain in South Africa for many weeks before he can be safely evaluated for travel back to the U.S.'"

Dutch kickboxing legend Verhoeven had been a potential opponent for Anthony Joshua before the Brit's return to the ring was delayed when he was involved in a fatal car crash last December.\n\nUsyk will take on Verhoeven in Egypt on May 23 with his WBC heavyweight title on the line. The Ukrainian said: “I truly respect people who reach the very top in their sport. Rico is one of them — a powerful athlete and a great champion. Being a champion isn’t just about belts. It’s about years of hard work, discipline, and belief.\n\nFOLLOW OUR FIGHTING FB PAGE! Latest boxing and MMA news, analysis and much more via our dedicated Facebook page\n\n\"I respect his journey — he’s truly the King of Kickboxing. But this is boxing — a different game, with its own rules and its own kings. I’m ready and really looking forward to meeting him in the ring. It’s going to be a unique experience for both of us, and I know the fans are excited too. A big night is coming!”\n\nVerhoeven, who has had just one professional boxing fight 12 years ago, added: “I spent 12 years as the undisputed heavyweight kickboxing champion and accomplished everything I set out to accomplish. But staying at the top for that long didn't take away the hunger, it strengthened it.\n\n\"I wasn’t looking for comfort, so I started looking for the highest challenge available in another world. Usyk is undisputed in boxing. That’s the kind of challenge that motivates me. Undisputed versus undisputed. The best facing the best.”\n\nVerhoeven defended his heavyweight title in June last year, defeating former two-time light heavyweight champion Artem Vakhitov by unanimous decision before announcing his departure from the sport in November after 76 fights and 66 wins."

Player safety is still vital in that space so we’re going to remain vigilant around the safety aspect and what that contest in the air looks like. But there’s been a broad appreciation for the changes, the players have adapted brilliantly, and it’s opened up space in the game, so there’s no desire to change anything.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt had been reported in France that Australia and New Zealand were in favour of minimising the influence of scrums in matches but Robinson allayed fears of any imminent alterations at the set piece.\n\nHe added: “There’s be in no way any discussions about depowering the scrum. The principles of contest, and the primacy of contest is everything; the principles of all body shapes and sizes being able to take part. We had John Eales in the room this week towering over people, and we need a game that enables us all to be able to participate. That contest is at the heart of things.”\n\nGilpin and Robinson were speaking during a wide-ranging press conference during the Shape of the Game week, where an agreement has been made to focus more on the fan experience and a greater alignment in the application of law by officials at every level of the game.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nOther topics of discussion looked at how better to celebrate the sport and how to continue the growth of the women’s game.\n\nRobinson said: “The feedback from around the world is that the game on the field is broadly in a positive place. We’ve been guilty in the past of being too keen to play and tinker with laws. The message this week is to focus on better explaining, selling and celebrating our sport in what is an ever more competitive environment.\n\n“Our heritage and our values are strengths, and so too is our capacity to innovate. By continuing to enhance the rugby experience – how we present the game, how we tell our stories, how we connect with fans and how we protect our players – we will futureproof the sport and unlock even greater global relevance and value.”"

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe 2025-26 men's college basketball season has been defined by the stars who have turned it into one of the most exciting for the sport in recent memory. The freshman class has an abundance of talent, and there are transfers who have transformed programs, with multiple from either category emerging as household names.\n\nWho else should be on your radar, though?\n\nWe've identified 25 breakout stars to know -- players who have bounced back from injuries, returnees who have made significant strides with the same program, and prospects who weren't projected to have the immediate impacts they have had in their first seasons of Division I basketball.\n\nLast season, Haugh was a key reserve for the Florida team that cut down the nets in San Antonio. This season, he is a bona fide All-America candidate and first-round NBA draft prospect who could lead the Gators to their second back-to-back national title reign in program history. His scoring average has increased from 9.8 to 16.9 points while maintaining a similar impact on the glass with 6.0 rebounds per game.\n\nLast season, Anderson was a star in the Sweet 16. This season, he has taken advantage of a bigger workload -- jumping from 30.5 to 38.7 minutes per game -- to emerge as an All-America candidate with 19.6 PPG, 7.7 APG and a 43.9% 3-point shooting rate. With teammate JT Toppin out for the season, Anderson will have to be both Batman and Robin for the Red Raiders come March.\n\nNate Oats coached Alabama to top-five finishes in offensive efficiency with former All-America guard Mark Sears running the show the previous two seasons. Now Philon is the catalyst who has helped the Crimson Tide sustain that production. He's averaging 21.3 points as a sophomore, effectively doubling his 10.6 PPG mark as a freshman.\n\nThough MaxPreps named Wagler its Kansas High School Player of the Year for 2024-25, the 6-foot-6 guard didn't receive many scholarship offers -- Illinois was only one of two high-major programs to extend him one. But the Fighting Illini found an unheralded freshman who could lead them to their first Final Four since 2005, win Big Ten Player of the Year and secure an NBA draft lottery spot.\n\nAfter not starting a single game as a freshman, Tanner is in contention for SEC Player of the Year, averaging 18.5 points while leading Vanderbilt to what will be only its second NCAA tournament appearance since 2017. He's the reason Mark Byington is a national Coach of the Year candidate.\n\nMomcilovich was a contributor (11.5 PPG) on the 2024-25 Iowa State team that earned a 3-seed before losing in the second round of the NCAA tournament. Now he's averaging a career-high 17.4 points and is one of the greatest 3-point shooters (50.7%, No. 1 in the nation) in recent college basketball history. The 6-foot-8 forward is the catalyst for a top-20 offense.\n\nAmid the ups and downs of Darryn Peterson's availability, Kansas has relied on the consistency of Bidunga. The Jayhawks are plus-28.7 points per 100 possessions better when he's on the court, per advanced analytics site EvanMiya, and have benefitted from his defensive presence (9.2 RPG).\n\nMen's Tournament Challenge Sign up now to play the #1 Men's bracket game for FREE! $125,000 in prizes.\n\nPlay Men's Tournament Challenge\n\nThe 6-foot-10 big man is arguably UConn's most important player. After making only one start last season, Reed has started every game he has been healthy for this season (24). The Huskies are at their best when he plays -- they're plus-11.5 points per 100 possessions better with him on the court, according to EvanMiya.\n\nThe defending national champion Gators have lost only two games since Dec. 9, featuring the No. 3 defense in America over that stretch. Chinyelu's contribution to that rise? Opposing players have made just 37% of their shots around the rim against him.\n\nMark Few has said Huff could return from a left knee injury in time for the NCAA tournament, which makes the 6-foot-10 star eligible for this list. Since he last played on Jan. 8, Gonzaga's offense has dropped to 62nd in adjusted efficiency -- a sign of the impact that he and his 17.8 PPG have had in a breakout season that has been affected by injury.\n\nMast sat out the 2023-24 season because of a knee injury before returning this season to lead Nebraska's historic 20-0 start. The 6-foot-10 center has demonstrated that few big men in America can match his well-rounded game: He is top-three in points (13.8), rebounds (6.1) and assists (3.1) for the Cornhuskers.\n\nCameron Boozer is the leader of a strong Duke team -- that much is clear -- but Evans is a critical catalyst for the Blue Devils. He has connected on 44.4% of his 3-point attempts during their five-game winning streak, a sign of a significant turn for a player who has gone from 6.8 points to 14.7 season over season.\n\n13. Aden Holloway, G, Alabama\n\nAs the backup for All-America point guard Mark Sears last season, Holloway looked the part of a future leader for an Alabama team that reached the Elite Eight a year ago. He has become much more than that, as evidenced by the 16.4 points and 4.9 assists he has averaged over the Tide's current seven-game winning streak.\n\nA lower leg injury cost Krivas the bulk of last season; he played in only eight games. He has since returned as one of the anchors of an Arizona team that won its first 23 games. Averaging 10.6 points, 8.5 rebounds and 1.9 blocks, Krivas is rated as an excellent offensive and defensive player by Synergy Sports in his comeback season.\n\nIn high school, the 6-foot-2 guard wasn't even ranked as a top-three prospect in the state of New Hampshire. Now, Okorie is fifth in the country in scoring (22.8) in one of the season's most surprising rises for a freshman who wasn't even on the national radar before this season. He has scored 30 or more points five times in 2025-26.\n\nNgongba has become one of Duke's top contributors, seemingly betting better with each passing game. The 6-foot-11 center helped the Blue Devils conquer one of the most dominant frontcourts in America when they beat then-No. 1 Michigan on Saturday. And he has made 60.2% of shots while holding opponents to a 52% mark around the rim.\n\nChandler has been a consistent starter for Kentucky a season after averaging 10.4 minutes. The 6-foot-5 guard has made one of the nation's most impressive leaps as a shooter over the last year, jumping from a 34.7% clip from 3-point range a season ago to 43.1% this season (including 46.1% in SEC play).\n\nThe leap by Miller over the past year -- from 13.2 PPG and 34.1% from 3 to 18.6 and 41.9% -- is the reason SMU could earn an at-large NCAA tournament bid for the first time in nearly a decade. In his team's biggest wins of the season, against North Carolina and Louisville, the 6-foot guard scored 50 total points.\n\nWhen first-year head coach Ryan Odom announced the signing of the 6-foot-9 forward from Belgium, he said the freshman would \"have an immediate impact in our frontcourt.\" Ridder has lived up to that expectation with his production (15.9 PPG, 6.4 RPG). With the first-year standout on the court, Virginia has registered 121.3 points per 100 possessions.\n\nIt's not easy to project the impact young European prospects can have in college, but New Mexico could win the Mountain West in Eric Olen's first season at the helm as a result of his recruitment of Buljan. The Croatian standout is nearly averaging a double-double (11.9 points, 9.8 rebounds).\n\nHill averaged just 6.2 minutes a season ago and is now the leading scorer -- 14.3 on 36.5% shooting from 3 -- for a VCU team that's chasing Saint Louis for the Atlantic 10 title and its third NCAA tournament appearance in four years.\n\nAt 5-foot-11, Johnson is one of the top players in America. He is also one of the most improved, going from 6.6 PPG last season to 17.4 this season -- and that's in addition to 3.5 APG and 2.6 SPG while shooting 40.9% from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Spartans' standout has made significant strides in scoring (12.3 PPG), on the glass (9.3 RPG) and at the free throw line (86%). But the 6-foot-9 forward's transformation as a deep-ball, high-volume threat (40% on 4.1 3-point attempts per game) has given Tom Izzo's squad a significant boost in its pursuit of another deep tournament run.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 sophomore forward, who has made 59% of his shots inside the arc, is a two-way threat for Josh Schertz's squad. McCottry is listed as a \"very good\" defensive player for a Billikens squad that has played top-25 defense this season. Robbie Avila is the face of the program, but McCottry is an essential component in this team's success in 2025-26.\n\nThe 6-foot-2 freshman wasn't bombarded with scholarship offers after winning Pennsylvania Player of the Year. Averaging 18.3 points for a Merrimack school seeking the first Division I NCAA tournament appearance in school history, the five-time MAAC Rookie of the Week has made a lot of the schools who passed on him look foolish."

The Heisman runner-up had to issue an apology after posting a message that included \"F-All THE VOTERS\" on social media.\n\nBut Pavia said his demeanor and approach are what made him a good leader at Vanderbilt. And his confidence, he said, comes from being constantly counted out in life, including when he started his career in junior college.\n\nThat has turned out to be a credit to him in his quest to make it in the NFL, he said.\n\n\"I feel like a lot of teams love the tenacity, the fight,\" he said. \"The life of an underdog, that's for sure. And, so, they ask questions. But you go back, you look at my record, ain't nothing on my record.\"\n\nHe added, \"I just want everyone to know what's true about me is I'm humble and I get my confidence from my process. And if you saw how much I put into this, you would see where I get my confidence.\"\n\nAnother thing NFL teams will need to weigh is Pavia's lack of size. He measures under 5-foot-10, a big detriment at the position in the NFL. But playing at that size against elite competition is nothing new, he said.\n\n\"I would just say turn on the tape,\" Pavia said. \"It's not like we're not playing these guys that are going first-round, second-round [picks] on Saturdays in the SEC. So, the SEC and the Big Ten probably have the most guys getting drafted in the first, second round. So, we're playing those guys and ain't nothing going to change.\""

            "content": "Louis Riddick raves about why he thinks Ty Simpson has earned a spot as a top-15 pick in the 2026 NFL draft. (0:57)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Former Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson said Friday at the NFL combine that he is prepared to show NFL talent evaluators that he is a \"franchise quarterback.''\n\nSimpson is the No. 25 player overall on ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr.'s Big Board and the No. 2 quarterback behind Indiana's Fernando Mendoza (the No. 1 player overall). Simpson was asked at the combine Friday about his readiness to be an NFL starter. He said he has conveyed his confidence in his abilities to team personnel during the sit-down interviews in Indianapolis.\n\n\"First off, I think I'm ready, I'm a franchise quarterback,'' Simpson said. \"Alabama prepares you the most for the NFL ... The Alabama locker room is as close to an NFL locker room as you can get.''\n\nSimpson said he is healthy after battling some nagging injuries down the stretch this past season, including to his lower back and elbow as well as a fractured rib. He plans to throw Saturday during the on-field workout for quarterbacks. Mendoza is not expected to throw Saturday, so Simpson will be Kiper's highest-ranked quarterback to participate in the combine workout.\n\n\"It's why I decided to throw and why I'm excited about it,'' Simpson said of his health.\n\nHe also addressed his significant weight loss toward the end of the season -- he went from about 210 pounds to just over 190 pounds due to what some in the league have said was a case of gastritis -- and outlined his pre-combine regimen to be prepared for the combine and the draft.\n\n\"Lot of eating, lot of three meals, four meals a day,'' Simpson said of his combine prep. \"Lot of shakes, just getting in a routine of getting up in the morning, eating, drinking chocolate milk, eating lunch, eating the right meal, adding a shake to that, dinner, eating, adding a salad, just sticking to that.''\n\nHe was a one-year starter for the Crimson Tide (11-4) and finished with 3,567 yards passing with 28 touchdowns and five interceptions. But Simpson had 21 of his touchdown passes without an interception over his first eight games of the season and struggled some, including with the injuries. over the second half of the season as well as in the postseason with seven touchdowns to go with the five interceptions over the last six games.\n\nSome scouts have pointed to some struggles in the SEC championship game, a 28-7 loss to Georgia when Simpson was 19-of-39 passing as well as a 38-3 loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff when Simpson was 12-of-16 for 67 yards.\n\nBut Simpson said Friday he has met with most teams who have needs at quarterback, including the Steelers, Arizona Cardinals and New York Jets. And when asked about the second half of last season, he has been direct in his responses with scouts and coaches.\n\nOn his meeting with the Steelers, Simpson said \"I love Coach [Mike] McCarthy, I love the Steelers.'' He added he hasn't paid much attention to player rankings or quarterback rankings as the draft approaches.\n\n\"It matters what happens April 24th and 25th,'' Simpson said. \"Knowing no matter where I'm projected, where I go, they're going to get the best Ty Simpson.''"

            "content": "Stephen A. Smith sounds off on the Cowboys' decision to franchise-tag George Pickens, calling it a \"huge mistake.\" (2:57)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFRISCO, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys did what they were long expected to Friday, placing the franchise tag on wide receiver George Pickens to secure his rights at least through 2026, the team announced Friday.\n\nThe tag will guarantees Pickens at least $28 million with Dallas in 2026, but working out a long-term deal remains a possibility. The two sides have until July 15 to sign a long-term contract or, by NFL rule, the player will play on the one-year deal or choose to hold out.\n\nThe team used the nonexclusive designation on Pickens, sources told ESPN, which allows him to talk to other teams when free agency begins March 11. Should Pickens sign an offer sheet with another team, the Cowboys will have the right to match the offer or decline to do so and receive two first-round draft picks as compensation.\n\nThe Cowboys met with Pickens' representatives Thursday at the NFL scouting combine. The talks were described as more general than in-depth.\n\nEarlier in the week, executive vice president Stephen Jones said the Cowboys were \"leaning\" toward using the tag on Pickens. Asked Thursday whether Pickens could be a Cowboy for the long term, coach Brian Schottenheimer said, \"I hope so.\"\n\nPickens' first season with the Cowboys could not have gone better.\n\nAcquired along with a 2027 sixth-round pick from the Pittsburgh Steelers for a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round selection, Pickens put up career highs in catches (93), yards (1,429) and touchdowns (nine) while playing every game, being named to the Pro Bowl for the first time and earning second-team All-Pro honors.\n\nPickens, 24, had five games with more than 100 yards receiving, including two that came when CeeDee Lamb was out of the lineup because of a high ankle sprain. Pickens set a franchise record with five games of at least 130 yards receiving and a touchdown catch.\n\nHis 13 catches of at least 25 yards and 73 first-down receptions ranked in the top five in the NFL.\n\nHe and Dak Prescott had an instant chemistry in their first season, much like Prescott developed with Lamb and former Pro Bowler Amari Cooper.\n\nKeeping Pickens on a long-term deal could be dicey.\n\nThe Cowboys signed Lamb to an extension in 2024 that pays him $34 million annually and included $100 million in guaranteed money. While the Cowboys could match or even exceed Lamb's numbers, they might be reluctant to do so for long-term cap issues and how they want to build their roster over the next few seasons.\n\nThey already have the highest-paid player, Prescott ($60 million), the highest-paid interior offensive lineman, Tyler Smith ($23.4 million), and the third-highest-paid receiver (Lamb). If they sign Pro Bowl kicker Brandon Aubrey, a restricted free agent, to an extension, he would likely be the highest paid at his position.\n\nAnd the Cowboys have work to do on a defense that allowed the most points in franchise history in 2025 (511).\n\nThe last player the Cowboys signed on a first-time franchise tag to a multiyear deal before the July 15 deadline was Dez Bryant in 2015. The Cowboys signed defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence (2019) and Prescott (2021) to extensions after they placed the tag on them the second time.\n\nThis is the 11th time the Cowboys have used the franchise tag, and Pickens is the eighth different player. Anthony Spencer, Lawrence and Prescott were tagged twice. Since 2020, the Cowboys have used the tag every year but 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe past two times they used the tag came in 2022 and 2023 on tight end Dalton Schultz and running back Tony Pollard, who ultimately left as free agents the following season.\n\nAdding further spice to contract negotiations is the history between the team and one of Pickens' agents, David Mulugheta, who also represents pass rusher Micah Parsons.\n\nLast year, Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he and Parsons reached an agreement on a deal that would have made Parsons the highest-paid defensive player in the NFL. When Mulugheta balked at the agreement, talks between the sides cooled and never really rekindled.\n\nParsons did not take part in the offseason program and went through a hold-in during training camp, attending meetings while in Oxnard, California, but he did not practice.\n\nA week before the 2025 season began, Parsons was traded to the Green Bay Packers for two first-round picks, and he signed a four-year, $188 million deal that included $120 million guaranteed.\n\nSpeaking on \"First Take\" after the Parsons trade in September, Mulugheta said talks regarding a potential Pickens deal would not be impacted by what happened last summer. Asked late in the season if he would talk directly with Jones on a contract, Pickens said he would let his agent do the deal.\n\nTheoretically, Pickens could follow the similar offseason and training camp path that Parsons chose last summer if the sides are not able to work out a long-term extension."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

Prof Hamidatu Saaka Darimani, revealed that for the first time in the institution's history, the university has admitted 17 differently-abled students into various academic programs.\n\nIn a major step toward inclusive higher education, the educational expenses for all 17 students will be fully absorbed under the free tertiary and persons with disabilities policy.\n\nThe university experienced a massive influx of interest this academic year, receiving a total of 2,575 applications. Out of that applicant pool, 1,967 candidates were offered admission.\n\nBreakdown the admissions data, the university admitted:\n\n768 students into Higher National Diploma (HND) programs.\n\n665 students into BTech/MSc programs.\n\n487 students into BTech/BSc programs.\n\n35 students into postgraduate programs.\n\nAddressing the economic hurdles of tertiary education, the Vice-Chancellor noted that 906 of the newly admitted Level 100 students have already successfully enrolled under the government's \"no fees stress policy,\" with others still undergoing documentation scrutiny.\n\nTo accommodate this 17% surge in the student population and ease the burden of off-campus housing, the university has commenced the construction of a 400-bed hostel facility aimed at providing a safe, conducive on-campus residential environment.\n\nOther major campus upgrades are currently underway to support the growing student body.\n\nThe vice chancellor highlighted the ongoing construction of the main entrance and access roads, the installation of solar street lights to boost campus security, and the outfitting of state-of-the-art laboratories to strengthen practical, industry-relevant training.\n\nIn a major demonstration of this commitment to practical skills, the matriculation ceremony was followed by the official commissioning of a state-of-the-art Cosmetology Laboratory.\n\nThe facility stands as the first of its kind in the entire region, specifically established to create direct employment pathways and equip students with high-level cosmetic science and practical skills.\n\nThe cosmetology department, currently operating with three staff members, is designed to offer specialised BTech and certificate courses. University management indicated that intensive recruitment efforts are underway to secure additional cosmetology faculty, allowing for the full enrollment of students into the program by the start of the next academic year.\n\nBeyond student training, the laboratory has been outfitted to offer premium, first-class cosmetology services to the general public, serving as both an educational hub and a revenue-generating enterprise for the university.\n\nClosing the ceremony, university management issued a stern warning regarding campus discipline and the student code of conduct.\n\nStressing that \"ignorance of these regulations would not be accepted as an excuse,” Prof Hamidatu urged matriculants to familiarise themselves with the rules and prioritise moral character alongside their studies.\n\n\"Remember that character and competence must go hand in hand,\" the Vice-Chancellor stated, reminding the students that \"academic excellence without integrity is incomplete\"\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Under the theme 20 Years of Connecting Africa to the World, the event reflected both how far the platform has come and where it is headed next.\n\nFrom foundations to lasting value\n\nReflecting on the show’s early years, Miller Matola, CEO of Millvest Advisory, said the real legacy of Meetings Africa has always been the relationships it nurtured.\n\n“Twenty years ago, when Meetings Africa was starting out, one of the greatest things was the networks and relationships that were built, which in years to come translated into big business for South Africa,” he said. “Today, we are reaping the benefits of those early efforts. What I always remember are the connections - the people and the relationships - which have endured even up to now. That is what this industry is all about.”\n\nMatola added that the growth of the MICE sector across South Africa and the continent has been both visible and gratifying, underscoring Meetings Africa’s role as a catalyst rather than just a marketplace.\n\nA platform refined by structure and scale\n\nFor Nomasonto Ndlovu, CEO of Beacon Africa Tourism and former Acting CEO of South African Tourism, Meetings Africa has been a constant presence throughout her professional journey in business events.\n\n“I was involved in the early conceptualisation stages of Meetings Africa, and it has remained a constant in my career,” she noted. “The development of the buyer selection model and the match-making diary system was a standout moment. That structured approach to curated appointments fundamentally strengthened the value proposition of the show.”\n\nEconomic impact and confidence from leadership\n\nOpening the trade floor on Tuesday, South Africa’s Minister of Tourism, Patricia de Lille, placed strong emphasis on the measurable economic impact of Meetings Africa.\n\n“Over the past three years alone, the economic impact of Meetings Africa on our GDP has nearly doubled - from R371 million in 2023 to R690 million in 2025,” she said. “During this period, the show has created and sustained more than 2,600 jobs.”\n\nShe also highlighted the scale of participation at the 2026 edition, noting that buyers from 53 countries were in attendance, alongside 375 hosted buyers, 325 exhibitors and more than 6,400 confirmed business meetings.\n\nGhana and the West African Vision\n\nThe event also provided a platform for West African leaders to share their strategic roadmaps. Gilbert Abeiku Aggrey, Deputy CEO (Marketing and Special Duties) of the Ghana Tourism Authority, underscored the importance of industry intelligence as a precursor to physical development.\n\n“We need to study the model of this business of meeting conversations and understand how it works so that when our government builds the infrastructure, we will be able to run it,\" Aggrey stated. \"In West Africa, we have already built huge structures that we've not been able to sustain; so, the knowledge of the industry or the market is crucial before you develop. We are selling the beauty of West Africa here; we must build capacity so that when the investors come, we can solve our own employment issues.”\n\nAggrey noted that while Ghana often feels a sense of \"lone\" leadership in the sub-regional MICE sector, the focus at Meetings Africa 2026 was on a harmonised West African effort to tackle issues like high air connectivity costs and capacity building.\n\nAfrica’s growing voice in global business events\n\nThe continent’s growing influence was further reinforced by Senthil Gopinath, CEO of ICCA, who praised the momentum he continues to see across African destinations.\n\n“Africa is not just growing in numbers; it is growing in confidence, capability and purpose,” he said. “Platforms like Meetings Africa are critical in nurturing new destinations, developing skills and taking Africa’s business events message to the rest of the world.”\n\nBeyond the exhibition floor\n\nAs Meetings Africa 2026 concludes, the 20th anniversary edition stands as a testament to what deliberate planning, collaboration and consistency can achieve. More importantly, it signals a future in which Africa is not merely participating in global business events, but confidently shaping them.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Petrol price and oil crisis concept.\n\nPrices of petroleum products are set to increase marginally from March 1, 2026.\n\nThat is according to the latest outlook report by the Chamber of Oil Marketing Companies (COMAC), which guides pricing decisions for oil marketing companies and was seen by Joy Business.\n\nThis marks the third time since January this year that fuel prices are projected to rise.\n\nHowever, this time, the spike has been influenced and driven largely by rising crude oil prices on the international market, as well as increases in finished petroleum product prices.\n\nOur checks show that the rate of increase could have been higher if the cedi had not posted some marginal appreciation against major trading currencies over the past two weeks.\n\nAccording to the Chamber of Oil Marketing Companies, the Ghana cedi appreciated marginally against major trading currencies.\n\nFor instance, during the March 1, 2026, Databank pricing window, the currency moved from GHS 11.09 to 11.04 per US dollar, representing a 0.45 percent surge.\n\nDatabank, in its market research report, noted that the cedi’s recent appreciation aligns with gains in other major sub-Saharan African currencies, reflecting broad external support driven by sustained dollar weakness.\n\nExpected Price Hikes\n\nCOMAC's data shows that petrol prices are expected to increase by 2.89 percent and could result in a price of GHC 12.04 per litre.\n\nDiesel prices are projected to rise by 0.86 percent, with a litre likely to sell for around GHS13.22.\n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), for the first time this year, is expected to go down marginally and, from March 1, should sell at the pumps at GHS 13.87 per kilogram.\n\nHowever, based on current market conditions, not all major oil marketing companies may move quickly to increase prices from this weekend or from March 1, 2026.\n\nReasons\n\nCOMAC's data indicate that the projected price increases are largely driven by rising prices of finished petroleum products as well as crude oil prices.\n\nOil prices are trading near a seven-month high amid speculation of potential US military action against Iran. Brent crude closed at about 71 dollars a barrel.\n\nSome energy analysts have projected that crude prices could hit 100 dollars a barrel.\n\nOn the other hand, finished petroleum products recorded mixed movements. Petrol increased by 4.58 percent, and gas by 1.66 percent, while LPG fell by 1.05 percent.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Accra came alive this weekend as Aduberks, one of Ghana’s most acclaimed drum artists, made history by headlining his own concert, Aduberks Live In Concert, marking five years of percussive artistry, his birthday, and a celebration of the growing role of drummers in contemporary live music entertainment.\n\nThe event, staged at the prestigious Alliance Française d’Accra, brought together a star-studded lineup of musicians and performers.\n\nFor the past five years, Aduberks has quietly built an enviable résumé, lending his precision and musical intuition to some of Africa’s most celebrated names, including Reggie Rockstone, R2Bees, Wizkid, King Promise, FRA!, Samini, Efya, Gyakie, Team Eternity Ghana, Gyedu-Blay Ambolley, and Pat Thomas.\n\n“This show isn’t just about me, it’s about how far drummers have come in Ghana’s entertainment landscape,” Aduberks said in an interview before the show. “To stand here as a headliner, especially as a drummer, is rare, and it speaks to how much the culture of rhythm and live instrumentation has evolved.”\n\nMore than just a concert, the night was positioned as a milestone for independent musicians, particularly percussionists who have historically played support roles in live shows. By placing drums and rhythm at the center of the concert experience, the event challenged traditional norms of Ghana’s live music scene. It highlighted Aduberks’ role as a pioneer in drum-led live performance in the country.\n\nBacked by the Apogee Band, Aduberks electrified fans at Alliance Française Accra, where music lovers gathered from 6 PM to 11 PM for an evening that blended musicianship with showmanship.\n\nThe set unfolded like a journey through Ghana’s contemporary soundscape, with the drummer leading every transition with flair and authority. Furthermore, he introduced the audience to a new sound he is pioneering, which he calls HausLife - a purée of Highlife and House traditions.\n\nThe energy only grew as guest performers joined the celebration.\n\nActs including Ayisi, Wanlov the Kubolor, Josh Blakk, Reynolds the Gentleman, FRA!, and the dynamic dance collective DWP Academy added layers of excitement, turning the concert into a full-bodied artistic experience rather than just a performance.\n\nMusic industry observers noted that bringing a drummer to headline an event of this scale was both bold and inspiring. “For too long, drummers have been in the background,” one fan said. “Tonight proves they can be the story too.”\n\nBeyond entertainment, the concert also showcased Ghana’s rich musical diversity, from highlife to contemporary fusion, and highlighted the potential of percussion-centered performances to create more employment and opportunities for instrumentalists and live music creators in Ghana.\n\nOrganizers confirmed that the show was fully attended, with fans and music lovers packing the venue to celebrate Aduberks’ career and contributions to the creative arts.\n\nAduberks also hinted at new music and upcoming shows, promising that fresh sounds from his camp will continue to push boundaries and expand the footprint of Ghanaian live performance.\n\nAduberks staging his own concert is more than a personal victory. It signals a shift, proof that so-called background musicians can headline, build their own audiences, and shape their own narratives.\n\nIn a music culture often dominated by vocalists, Friday night was a reminder that sometimes, it is the heartbeat behind the music that deserves the loudest applause.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

The University recognised her appointment as Chancellor of the Women's University in Africa in Zimbabwe, a role she held from 2018 to 2024. In that capacity, she demonstrated sustained commitment to advancing women’s access to higher education and promoting academic excellence across Africa.\n\nProfessor Opoku-Agyemang’s association with the University of Cape Coast is both longstanding and historic. As an alumna, she later returned to serve as Vice-Chancellor from 2008 to 2012, becoming the first female Vice-Chancellor of a public university in Ghana — another landmark achievement in her career.\n\nThe University described her journey from student to Vice-Chancellor and now Vice President as emblematic of visionary leadership, academic excellence and dedicated public service.\n\nThe Distinguished Fellow Award ceremony is scheduled to take place on Friday, March 13, 2026, at 2:00 p.m. at the New Examination Centre (NEC) of the University of Cape Coast.\n\nThe University congratulated Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang on the honour, describing it as a fitting recognition of her exceptional contributions to education, governance and national development.\n\n\"The University of Cape Coast congratulates Her Excellency Prof. Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang on this distinguished award,\" the statement concluded.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Thank you, Right Honourable Speaker\n\nHonourable Members of the August House\n\nYour Excellency, Vice President Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang\n\nYour Excellency, the First Lady, Mrs Lordina Dramani Mahama\n\nYour Lordship, the Chief Justice\n\nThe good people of Ghana\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nIt is both a profound honour and a constitutional duty to appear before the House to deliver a message on the State of the Nation, as required by Article 67 of our Constitution.\n\nI do so with the perspective earned through decades of public service, including my time in this very Chamber as a Member of Parliament and my previous term as President from 2012 to 2017. My journey in public service, like that of our nation, has not followed a straight path. It has been marked by periods of steady progress, by setbacks, and by determined recovery.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nThat pattern of resilience mirrors the national experience. And today, I stand before you to speak to another such defining moment, a moment of rebound, of national renewal, and of restored hope in our country's history. This moment is being shaped by hard choices, institutional resolve, and a renewed commitment to stability and national purpose.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nIn just a few days, on 6th March 2026, Ghana will celebrate 69 years of independence on the theme \"Building Prosperity, Restoring Hope.\" This theme is not merely ceremonial. It is the blueprint that guides my administration's vision and action. It reflects where we have been, acknowledges the difficulties we have endured, and confidently declares where we are headed. At the heart of this vision are two complementary and mutually reinforcing agendas: the Resetting Ghana Agenda and the Accra Reset.\n\nThe Resetting Ghana Agenda is our national commitment to restore economic stability, rebuild public trust, strengthen institutions, and deliver tangible improvements in the lives of ordinary Ghanaians. It is about turning the page on years of mismanagement, confronting our challenges with honesty, and charting a new course anchored in fiscal discipline, transparency, and sustainable development.\n\nThe Accra Reset, on the other hand, is our continental commitment. It recognises that Ghana's prosperity cannot be separated from Africa's progress. It calls for a fundamental shift in how African nations relate to one another and to the world, from dependence to self-reliance, from fragmentation to integration, and from reactive postures to strategic leadership.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nThese two agendas are deeply interlinked. We cannot build lasting prosperity at home without contributing to stability and growth across our continent. Equally, we cannot lead effectively on the continental stage if our own house is not in order.\n\nTogether, these frameworks demonstrate our determination to restore hope, not merely as a promise but as a lived reality for Ghanaians and Africans alike. As we build on the foundation laid in 2025, the first year of my return to the Presidency, we do so with clarity of purpose, unity of action, and confidence in our ability to deliver a future worthy of our people's sacrifices and aspirations.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nThis moment of national renewal unfolds against the backdrop of a world in profound flux. The global order we once knew is being rapidly reshaped, and the so-called \"rules-based international system\" endures only as long as it protects the advantages of those who designed it.\n\nOnce emerging nations begin to operate within those same rules to rebalance power, the very architects of that order prove willing to relax their commitments. Ghana, like many nations, has learned this hard truth. We cannot respond to this new reality with fragmentation, hesitation, or continued dependence. History has long taught us that resilience and prosperity will not be handed to us—they must be built deliberately through cooperation, self-belief, and strategic alignment. The era ahead demands that Africa move from a posture of dependence to one of collective self-reliance.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nIt is in this spirit that Ghana has sought to play a convening and catalytic role on the continent. In the middle of last year, our capital, Accra, hosted African Heads of State, policymakers, and development partners for a landmark Health Sovereignty Summit.\n\nTogether, we charted a new roadmap for healthcare financing and collaboration among African nations. The message was clear: Africa must take ownership of its health security, pool its resources, deepen collaboration, and design financing solutions that reflect our realities rather than external prescriptions.\n\nStrong economies require healthy populations, and health sovereignty is inseparable from economic sovereignty. The same logic applies to trade, industry, and growth. Africa's future lies in dismantling artificial borders, removing bottlenecks that stifle commerce, and fully activating a common market that allows our goods, services, capital, and ideas to move freely across the continent.\n\nNo single African country, no matter how well-endowed, can thrive alone in this new global environment. Rather, when we work together, our combined markets, youthful population, natural resources, and creativity will constitute one of the greatest economic opportunities of this century. Africa must summon the courage to shape its own destiny. Building genuine sovereignty across Africa. The Global South requires a deliberate and disciplined plan, one that begins with:\n\nUnlocking the immense human and creative potential of our young people;\n\nStrengthening regional value chains to add value to what we produce;\n\nMobilising domestic capital to finance our own development, and\n\nSpeaking with a single, coordinated, and confident voice in global affairs.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nThis is how Africa can move from promise to power, from participation to leadership, and from dependence to dignity. The path forward is clear. Africa must rise with confidence, unity, and purpose. Ghana stands ready not only to rebuild at home but also to work hand in hand with our African brothers and sisters to shape a future defined by shared strength, dignity, and prosperity.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nWe have resolved here in Ghana to operate with our eyes open to protect our sovereignty and to design policies that place our people first. We will continue to engage with the world, but on terms that reflect our interests. We will uphold global norms, but we will not outsource our judgment. And we will build resilience at home so that shifts in external power do not translate into hardship for our citizens.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nWhen I last came before this House, I spoke candidly about the depth of the challenges we had inherited across all facets of our nation. Nowhere was this national malaise more evident than in the economy. We inherited an economy in severe crisis—burdened by unsustainable debt, high inflation, a rapidly depreciating currency, and an escalating cost-of-living crisis that had left our citizens reeling from unimaginable hardship caused by years of general imprudence and reckless management of the economy.\n\nI was clear from the outset that recovery would not come easily. I was also clear that I would stop at nothing to turn the situation around and bring relief to Ghanaians. I promised that, just as I have confronted and overcome crises in the past, I would reset our economy and return us to a path of growth, progress, and development.\n\nI told this August House when I appeared before you last year that we would have to take tough, prudent, and necessary decisions to restore stability and credibility. Today, I can say with confidence: Ghana is back. Ghana is working again and is open for business. The fundamentals are improving, and the path to sustained acceleration is clear.\n\nFrom the outset, we resolved to choose discipline over waste, reform over excuses, and stability over speculation. As a responsible government, our first order of business was to halt the economic haemorrhage and restore order to our public finances. We tightened expenditure and commitment controls, improved payables reporting, and conducted a comprehensive audit of 2024 commitments to restore credibility and discipline.\n\nThese measures have begun to deliver some of the most remarkable economic outcomes in decades.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nAs we approach the celebration of our 69th Independence Anniversary, we do so not only with pride in our past but also with renewed hope for our future. We are Building Prosperity through sound policy, responsible governance, and inclusive growth. We are Restoring Hope by delivering on our promises and proving that good leadership makes a measurable difference in people's lives.\n\nThe Resetting Ghana Agenda is working. The Accra Reset is gaining momentum. And together, they are laying the foundation for a stronger, more resilient, and more prosperous Ghana.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nOur nation is on the runway. It is in take-off mode, and you are all advised to fasten your seatbelts. The journey continues. But the direction is set. And the hope is real. Our theme today, Building Prosperity, Restoring Hope, is not merely aspirational. It reflects the tangible transformation we have delivered for the Ghanaian people.\n\nOur economy has grown significantly. In 2025, Ghana’s GDP is expected to reach $113 billion, up from $83 billion at the end of 2024. This has placed Ghana among the top 10 largest economies in Africa. Average GDP growth for the first 3 quarters of 2025 is reported at 6.1%. But growth means nothing without discipline. Our primary surplus reached 2.6% of GDP, far exceeding our 1.5% target. Our fiscal deficit closed at 3.1%, well below the projected 3.8%.\n\nThis is not just prudent governance; it is promise-keeping. It has benefited households and businesses because we have borrowed less and spent more responsibly, interest rates have fallen, confidence has returned, and private businesses are breathing again.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nThe 19th of December 2022 will go down as one of the darkest days in Ghana’s economic history. Ghana declared its inability to honour its debt obligations. We declared a debt default and placed a moratorium on both domestic and foreign debt repayments. Following this, we entered a protracted and complex debt restructuring process. Ghana’s debt became a shackle on our economic progress, dragging our nation into hardship and despair\n\nLooking at Ghana’s restructured debt profile, it is clear the negotiators on our side were intent on kicking the can down the road, with the largest repayments scheduled between 2025 and 2028. We confronted this crisis with action, not rhetoric. We established sinking funds, restructured obligations, and pursued bilateral agreements.\n\nThe result? Public debt fell by GH¢82.1 billion, from 61.8% to 45.3% of GDP. This is one of the sharpest reductions in our history. We settled a US$709 million Eurobond ahead of schedule, completing US$1.4 billion in debt service for 2025. And the world noticed. Fitch, Moody's, and S&P all upgraded Ghana's credit ratings—the first triple upgrade in years.\n\nGhana’s credibility is restored. Ghana is rising. The heaviest burden we inherited was the very high inflation, which was silently eroding every household’s purchasing power. It peaked at 54.1% at the end of 2022 and declined to 23.5% by the end of 2024. We treated it as the emergency it was. Through fiscal consolidation, currency stabilisation, and disciplined monetary policy, inflation fell from 23.5% to 3.8% over 13 consecutive months by January 2026.\n\nFood inflation fell by 26.6 percentage points. Inflation for locally produced goods fell by 22.6 points. These are not statistics, Mr Speaker. They translate into the reality of parents being able to put meals on the table for their children, and into the reality of businesses thriving and creating opportunities for Ghana’s youth. Petrol prices dropped from GHS15.20 to GHS10.70 per litre.\n\nIt recently dipped below the GHS10 mark for the first time in many years. Diesel fell from GHS15.40 to GHS11.30. This brought relief to our nation's 3.7 million car owners and tens of millions who depend on transportation daily.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nExchange rate volatility has long been at the heart of the hardship Ghanaian households face. We made currency stability a priority, and we have delivered. We did not arrest the dollar; we strengthened the cedi to put up a good fight against the other currencies.\n\nI am pleased to report to this House that the cedi appreciated by 40.7% against the US dollar, 30.9% against the pound, and 24% against the euro.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nGhana’s economic turnaround is broad-based and comprehensive. All sectors of the Ghanaian economy have witnessed remarkable improvement in the first year of my return to the Presidency. Most importantly, Ghana’s economy has surpassed the $100 billion mark and is projected to place Ghana among the top 10 economies in Africa.\n\nOur reserves currently stand at $13.8 billion, covering 5.7 months of imports. A key driver of this development has been the establishment of the Ghana Gold Board. By formalising gold exports, we reduced smuggling, increased recorded exports in the artisanal and small-scale mining sector from 63.6 to 103 tonnes, and channelled foreign exchange into our economy. When the cedi stabilises, imported inflation falls. Businesses can plan more effectively, and household incomes improve.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nAs global uncertainty grows, it is necessary to reduce our country’s exposure to external shocks, break the cycle of economic downturns, and safeguard macroeconomic stability. Just last Wednesday, 25th February 2026, the Minister for Finance presented the Ghana Accelerated National Reserve Accumulation Policy to this House. The policy seeks to strengthen our country’s external resilience by increasing our international reserves to 15 months of import cover by the end of 2028, supporting long-term structural transformation while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nWe have an opportunity to build an economic war chest to withstand global economic shocks, secure macroeconomic stability, improve the standard of living for Ghanaians, and build lasting prosperity for future generations. This is what the policy seeks to achieve. We abolished the nuisance taxes levied on us between 2017 and 2024. These include the E-Levy, Betting Tax, and Emission Tax.\n\nWe have reformed VAT comprehensively by:\n\n1. Abolishing the 1% COVID-19 Levy\n\n2. Decoupling GETFund and NHIL from VAT\n\n3. Reducing VAT from 21.9% to 20%\n\n4. Raising the VAT threshold to GH¢750,000\n\n5. Extending zero-rating on textiles to 2028\n\nThese fiscal reforms have effectively put GH¢6 billion back into the pockets of the Ghanaian. Interest rates have fallen from above 30% to about 18%, freeing up credit for businesses and households. According to the Ghana Statistical Service, over one million Ghanaians found employment between Quarter 1 and Quarter 3 of 2025, and 950,000 people escaped multidimensional poverty in the same period.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nI am pleased to report that our external position has strengthened significantly. By December 2025, our current account recorded a surplus of $9.1 billion, representing 8.1% of GDP. This is a remarkable increase from $1.5 billion, or 1.8% of GDP, a year earlier. This achievement has been driven by robust gold and cocoa exports and increased remittance inflows. This improvement demonstrates that our economy is gaining strength and resilience on the global stage.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nWe have moved decisively from planning to action on our flagship 24-Hour Economy and Accelerated Export Development Programme.\n\nOfficially launched in 2025, this transformative initiative is designed to:\n\n1. Unlock round-the-clock economic activity\n\n2. Deepen value chains across key sectors\n\n3. Boost productivity and support export growth, and\n\n4. Create quality jobs in agriculture, manufacturing, logistics, and services.\n\nOn 6th February 2026, this august House passed the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill, establishing the regulatory framework and legal mandate necessary for full implementation. Last week, at cabinet, I had the honour of signing this historic legislation into law. All is now set for take-off. This is the boldest economic transformation initiative in recent years.\n\nGHS 110 million has been allocated in the 2026 Budget to begin implementation. These resources will enable businesses to operate beyond traditional business hours, attract private investment through strategic partnerships with the Development Bank of Ghana and the Ghana Infrastructure Investment Fund, and strengthen the foundations for sustained growth and job creation, especially for our youth.\n\nThis is about building prosperity and restoring hope through concrete action.\n\nMr Speaker, a nation that does not learn from past mistakes cannot get out of the cycle of problems that impose hardship on its citizens. We have just begun to emerge from the most devastating economic crisis in our nation's recent history. This crisis was triggered by general financial indiscipline, huge deficits and massive debt occasioned by persistent unbudgeted expenditure to meet the ends of convenient politicking.\n\nIn the last few weeks, we have had to take the painful but necessary decision to revise the producer price of Cocoa to achieve competitive pricing and resolve acute liquidity challenges in the sector.\n\nFailure to do so would have meant pumping in billions of borrowed funds. This unplanned expenditure would have taken us right back to the very devastating economic problems we have only recently begun to escape.\n\nSo, while fully understanding the concerns and protests of our farmers, I can firmly assure them that the reforms announced by the government will bring about a total transformation of the sector and guarantee them a fair price that enables them to cover the cost of producing the commodity and make decent margins.\n\nThe difference between facing economic hardships and avoiding them is the exercise of sound economic judgement, and I am determined to make decisions that ensure our collective well-being and avoid suffering for all our citizens.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nWe are bringing legislation to this House to tighten our procurement processes by banning sole-sourced contracts, except in exceptional circumstances. We will also bring legislation to this House to make it mandatory to seek Parliament's prior approval before any government asset or property is leased or sold.\n\nLast Tuesday, I caused the Minister for Finance to lay the Value for Money Office Bill before this august house. This is a landmark measure, a fulfilment of yet another campaign promise to the good people of Ghana, designed to decisively end waste, inflated contracts, abandoned projects, and chronic cost overruns that have, for far too long, drained the public purse.\n\nAll these measures are intended to improve public trust and accountability.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nIn January 2025, we inherited an energy sector on the brink of collapse and precipitated by a severe financial crisis. The sector was burdened with a staggering GHS 80 billion in legacy debts, threatening the operational viability of key power producers. The $500 million World Bank Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG), a critical risk-mitigation instrument established in 2015 during my first term to safeguard nearly $8 billion of private-sector investment in the Offshore Cape Three Points (OCTP) field, had been fully exhausted due to prolonged non-payment for gas supplied.\n\nAt the distribution level, the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) was plagued by high commercial and technical losses, collecting only 62% of the energy it purchased and declaring less than 50% of its collections into the Cash Waterfall Mechanism (CWM). This resulted in severe liquidity shortfalls and power supply challenges throughout 2024. In the petroleum sector, years of policy inconsistency, regulatory inefficiencies, a lack of transparency, prolonged licensing processes, and unresolved legal disputes over field unitisation had eroded investor confidence.\n\nConsequently, crude oil production declined by approximately 32% between 2019 and 2024, falling from 71.4 million barrels to 48.2 million barrels.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nI am pleased to announce that, as of December 31, 2025, the Government has fully repaid and restored the entire $500 million World Bank PRG, including interest. This has reinstated the facility in full and reaffirmed Ghana's standing as a credible and reliable partner on the global stage.\n\nIn addition, between January and December 2025, through carefully coordinated policy actions, the Government settled all outstanding gas invoices owed to ENI and Vitol, amounting to approximately $500 million. Ghana is now fully up to date with its gas consumption obligations to the Sankofa partners. The 2026 Budget has made adequate provision to ensure timely payments for all LNG going forward.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nTo ensure equity and fairness, the Government has also held constructive engagements with Tullow Oil and the Jubilee Field partners and reached a comprehensive roadmap to guarantee full payment for all gas consumed. This approach supports reliable nationwide electricity generation and accelerates industrial growth. Engagement with upstream partners has resulted in increased gas production, guided by a clear national vision to rapidly scale up domestic gas supply and reduce reliance on expensive liquid fuels.\n\nBeyond clearing inherited arrears, a robust framework has been established to strengthen monitoring and implementation of the Cash Waterfall Mechanism. Another major milestone was the operationalisation of the ECG Single Holding Account, overseen jointly by the Ministry and the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC). This intervention has significantly reduced revenue leakage and enhanced ECG's capacity to meet its payment obligations.\n\nTo address the high cost of power, the government has successfully renegotiated existing Power Purchase Agreements. Engagements with nine (9) Independent Power Producers (IPPs) have resulted in $250 million in immediate savings and $1.1 billion of debt restructured for payment in the period 2026–2028. The revised agreements will be submitted to Cabinet and Parliament for approval and ratification.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nUnder the Rural Electrification Programme, 200 out of 400 communities have been connected to the national grid, with a further 100 at various stages of completion. The national electricity access rate now stands at 89.05%. We are committed to ensuring that every Ghanaian has access to reliable, affordable electricity. It is worrying that the Electricity Company of Ghana continues to experience high power losses, with reports indicating that around 25% of generated power is lost.\n\nTo address this phenomenon and anchor the gains we have made, adopting private-sector involvement, particularly in billing and collections, is the most effective way to significantly reduce these losses. Cabinet has approved the Multiple Lease Method for concessions in the distribution utilities, and work is ongoing to implement this critical reform.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nThe Bui Power Authority has completed an additional 50MW of solar plant. In the distributed solar sector, 30MW was achieved through rooftop installations, bringing the total installed capacity to 285MW and representing 5% of renewable energy in our generation mix. A few months ago, I broke ground for a 200 MWp solar power project at the Dawa Industrial Zone, with the first 100 MWp scheduled for completion in December 2026.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nThe Ministry of Energy and Green Transition is constructing 35 mini-grids to serve 47 islands and lakeside communities in the Oti, Savannah, and Bono East regions. The ministry will also supply 12,000 new smart net meters from the end of the first quarter of this year, 2026.\n\nUnder the off-grid solar home systems for public institutions, delivery of materials for the first phase of 350 systems has commenced.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nAs part of the last-mile electrification effort to achieve 99.98% universal access by 2030, the ministry has mainstreamed mini-grids into the National Electrification Scheme (NES). Consequently, a feasibility study for the Afram Plains North District was completed for 100 communities, bringing the total number of islands and lakeside communities in the Afram Plains North and South to 150, ready for mini-grid electrification.\n\nThe African Development Bank has committed to providing $100 million to fund the construction of renewable energy-based mini grids for these communities.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nI am pleased to announce that we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Jubilee and TEN Field partners to commit $2 billion to additional investment in the Jubilee field. This will include drilling up to 20 new wells. There’s a second Memorandum of Intent with the OCTP Partners to commit $1.5 billion to additional investment in the OCTP field, the Cape Three Points Block 4 Contract Area, among others. This agreement will significantly increase Ghana's oil and gas production, thereby enhancing energy security, domestic demand, and infrastructure development.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nI am happy to announce that the government is on course to revitalise the Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing Company through a strategic partnership with the National Petroleum Authority, Ghana Gas, and the Ghana Commercial Bank (GCB). This will boost production, ensure a steady supply of safe LPG cylinders, and strengthen local manufacturing.\n\nAs you all know, the Tema Oil Refinery is back. The new management of the refinery has successfully completed extensive Turnaround Maintenance, and I am pleased to inform this August House that, for the first time since 2018, the refinery has commenced processing of crude oil.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nLet me assure our countrymen and women that the energy sector reform continues unabated. I remain fully committed to turning around the sector, strengthening its foundations, and ensuring reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy security for our nation.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nAgriculture remains central to our national renewal. Since January 2025, this administration has embarked on a decisive reset of Ghana’s agricultural sector under the Agriculture for Economic Transformation Agenda, with the Feed Ghana Programme serving as the flagship vehicle for implementation.\n\nOur objective is clear: to restore food sovereignty, stabilise food prices, reduce import dependence, create decent jobs, especially for the youth, and reposition agriculture as a strategic growth sector under our 24-Hour economy policy. In January 2025, food inflation stood at 28.3 per cent, following an unprecedented peak of 61 per cent in January 2023. This situation placed severe pressure on households and undermined national stability. Today, food inflation has declined significantly to 4.9%, providing relief to Ghanaian families and businesses.\n\nIn addition, we have committed GHS 300 million to the National Food Buffer Stock Company to mop up excess produce, stabilise prices, and build a strategic national food buffer against emergencies, marking the first time Ghana has deliberately built a food reserve for national resilience. Over 413 institutions, from basic schools through to tertiary institutions, have been registered and are actively participating in the Feed Ghana Programme. Institutional farming is currently being undertaken by the Ghana Armed Forces, the Ghana Prisons Service, the National Service Authority, basic and second-cycle schools, public universities, and faith-based organisations, including churches and mosques.\n\nA key pillar of the Feed Ghana Programme is the Home Gardening Initiative. Across the country, families are encouraged to grow vegetables at home and in their communities to reduce food expenditure, improve household nutrition, and enhance food availability. The Feed Ghana Programme is firmly anchored on Irrigation for Wealth Creation. The government is deliberately shifting agriculture from rain-fed dependence to irrigation-based farming to support year-round production and strengthen climate resilience.\n\nOver the past months, processes have begun for the following interventions: the construction of 10 new small dams, the rehabilitation of 8 existing irrigation dams, and the construction of 250 solar-powered boreholes for farming communities and schools across the northern belt, Bono, and Ahafo regions. In addition, major irrigation schemes, including Vea, Weta, Tanoso, Kpong, Ashaiman, and Aveyime, are undergoing rehabilitation, while new inland valleys covering over 1,300 hectares are being developed to expand rice production.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nUnder the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme (GAFSP), we have launched a $20 million Agro-Input Distribution Project to strengthen food and nutrition security across the Northern Savannah Ecological Zone. The project is being implemented in 12 districts across six regions with a target of 50,000 farming households, including 30,000 women and youth. It will support the production of key staples: maize, rice, soybeans, cowpeas, and groundnuts, while promoting year-round vegetable cultivation through solar-powered micro-irrigation schemes for farmer groups and selected schools.\n\nThe project is also supporting backyard and commercial poultry production, as well as the distribution of fertiliser and certified seeds to participating districts. This will help strengthen the poultry value chain. We are working to fulfil the promise of establishing Farmer Services Centres across the country to modernise agriculture. Procurement processes are underway for a total of 660 tractors, 400 combine harvesters and more than 4,000 agricultural machines and implements.\n\nThe first 11 centres to be constructed this year will provide affordable access to land preparation, harvesting, storage, input supply, extension services, and equipment leasing, especially for smallholder farmers.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nAgricultural extension remains the backbone of productivity, and to address the current gap between farmers and extension officers, 540 motorbikes are being procured to improve extension coverage. 150 of the bikes have already been distributed. We are employing 400 Feed Ghana District Coordinators nationwide, while 10,000 young Ghanaians are being enrolled under a four-year National Service Agripreneur Programme, with annual absorption into permanent service. So far, 3,000 youth have been posted by the National Service Authority under the Agripreneur Programme.\n\n\n\nThis intervention is strengthening frontline service delivery and creating employment opportunities for young people. We are also placing farmer cooperatives at the centre of our agricultural transformation plan. As of October 2025, 70,000 Community Commodity-Focused Farmer Cooperatives had been established nationwide. They are serving as platforms for access to inputs, mechanisation, extension services, climate advisories, aggregation, and fair market negotiation.\n\n\n\nThe Government is actively linking farmers to agro-industrial investments to stabilise prices, create jobs, and accelerate Ghana’s journey towards food security. A major highlight of this effort is a €154 million Italy–Ghana irrigated commercial farming project to establish a 10,000-hectare irrigated model farm to produce rice, maize, soya, and tomatoes.\n\nAll produce from this project will be sold locally. This intervention is strategically designed to fast-track progress towards food security, ensure a reliable supply of raw materials for agro-processing, and reduce Ghana’s dependence on food imports.\n\nOther key initiatives under the value-addition and agro-industrialisation drive include rice processing facilities in the Upper East Region, poultry feed production facilities in the Ashanti Region, and cashew and onion processing facilities in the Bono East Region. In addition, a 40-tonne-per-day soya processing plant is being established in Northern Ghana to support soybean farmers and reduce feed costs. The shea industry is also being revived through secured export contracts and measures to protect local raw material supplies.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nTo reduce Ghana’s $300 to $400 million annual poultry import bill, the government has launched a comprehensive Poultry Farm-to-Table Project. These comprise 50 Anchor or Commercial Farmers producing 4 million birds, 500 SMEs producing 3 million birds, and a small-scale (Nkoko Nketenkete) backyard poultry Programme, targeting 3 million birds nationwide, with emphasis on women and youth.\n\nThe Nkoko Nketenkete Programme is underway. The target is to reach 60,000 households. Even before the launch, 720,000 birds were distributed during the pilot phase to 13,000 farmers in 12 districts. A poultry processing factory is under construction in Bechem to support expected production growth.\n\nMr Speaker, education remains pivotal to our national transformation agenda. In this regard, the year 2025 was both eventful and momentous for Ghana’s education sector. I am pleased to report that all flagship initiatives and commitments contained in our Reset Manifesto were faithfully honoured during the year under review. The No-Fees-Stress Initiative was successfully launched in Koforidua and has benefited over 152,698 duly validated first-year students in public tertiary institutions. The number of beneficiaries is projected to exceed 220,000 first-year students in the 2026 academic year.\n\nIn collaboration with the Student Loan Trust Fund, law students in Ghana can now access the student loan scheme to pursue legal education. The Free Tertiary Education Policy for Persons with Disabilities has also been launched and is now fully benefiting all eligible persons with disabilities enrolled in our tertiary institutions nationwide.\n\nThe 2025 academic year saw a stable, uninterrupted supply of quality food to all schools under the Free Senior High School Programme.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nTo further deepen coordination, accountability, and effectiveness in the education sector, this honourable house passed several important pieces of legislation in 2025. These include:\n\n1. The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology Bill, 2025,\n\n2. The Ghana Scholarship Authority Bill, 2025,\n\n3. The Change of Universities’ Names Bills, 2025,\n\n4. The University for Development Studies Bill, 2025, and\n\n5. The Ghana Education Trust Fund Bill, 2025.\n\nTo enhance private-sector participation in the tertiary education sector, new legislation will be introduced to ease regulatory bottlenecks and remove the requirement to charter, making it optional.\n\n\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nBasic education remains the critical entry point into our education system. It is at this level that children acquire foundational literacy, numeracy, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills upon which all future learning depends. The government is, therefore, undertaking a major policy shift to rebalance our education investments in favour of basic education. As part of this shift, the Standards-Based Curriculum from Kindergarten to Primary Six is currently under review to incorporate robotics, coding, and the responsible integration of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nAdditionally, as part of the ongoing curriculum review, artificial intelligence education will be introduced in an age-appropriate and developmentally sensitive manner, with a strong emphasis on ethical use, digital responsibility, critical thinking, and human values.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nIn response to the persisting challenge of schools under trees, the Government has programmed a bold and decisive intervention for the 2026 financial year. This includes the construction of 200 kindergarten blocks, 200 primary school blocks, and 200 junior high school blocks nationwide.\n\nI am further pleased to inform this Honourable House that the Government has fully cleared all outstanding Capitation Grant arrears owed to public basic schools, as well as all outstanding BECE registration subsidies due to the West African Examinations Council for previous academic years.\n\nMr Speaker, education for learners with special needs is not only a moral right but also a sound, pragmatic investment that promotes equity and strengthens social cohesion. In recognition of this, the amended GETFund Act has established a dedicated, sustainable funding framework to implement Free Education for learners with special needs, beginning in the 2026 academic year.\n\nThe government has also increased the daily feeding grant for students in public Special Schools from GHS 8.00 to GHS 15.00 for the 2025/2026 academic year. This significant increment reflects our resolve to address the unique nutritional and health needs of learners with disabilities. In addition, Mr Speaker, we will construct a modern, state-of-the-art Special Needs School in Ho in the Volta Region, and rehabilitate and upgrade the existing Special Needs School in Akropong, Akuapem.\n\nIn fulfilment of our pledge to provide free sanitary pads to schoolgirls as part of efforts to improve menstrual hygiene and reduce absenteeism among female learners, a total of 12.2 million packs of sanitary pads were distributed to girls in public schools across the country in 2025.\n\nWe allocated GHS 292.4 million in the 2026 Budget to sustain this initiative. This commitment aims to remove gender-specific barriers to education and ensure that no girl’s education is interrupted due to challenges related to menstrual hygiene.\n\nMr Speaker, as part of efforts to decongest Senior High Schools, increase access and ensure parity in educational opportunities, the government will convert and upgrade 30 Category C schools to Category B, and 10 Category B schools to Category A. In addition, facilities in existing Category A schools will be upgraded and expanded.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nTechnical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) remain a critical pillar of our strategy to address youth unemployment and accelerate skills development. The government will construct six Regional TVET Centres of Excellence across the country to equip young people with practical, industry-relevant skills aligned with the demands of the evolving labour market.\n\nThere is also an ongoing review of the national curriculum to align with the OECD Future of Education and Skills framework. This will make TVET education more adaptive and resilient.\n\nMr Speaker, to expand access to higher education, support balanced regional growth, and meet the rising demand for quality tertiary education, we have entered international partnerships to establish two public universities—one in Kintampo, Bono East Region, and another in Jasikan, Oti Region. A grant has also been secured from China to establish a new public university in Damongo, enhancing access to tertiary education in underserved areas.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nTechnical Universities play a critical role in closing skills gaps and reducing youth unemployment by delivering high-quality, industry-aligned, and practice-oriented training within a broader policy framework that stimulates labour demand. In this regard, the Government will establish three (3) new Technical Universities to strengthen skills development, enhance innovation, and support national industrialisation efforts.\n\nThe teacher’s housing initiative is a joint effort involving the District Assemblies’ common fund, GETfund, GNAT, and GESOPS to build 50,000 housing units for teachers. This partnership demonstrates our collective dedication to enhancing teachers’ living conditions, boosting retention—especially in rural and remote areas—and ensuring educators can live, work, and retire with dignity and security.\n\nMr Speaker, by prioritising equitable access and expanding infrastructure, we are investing in human capital and laying the foundation for a Ghana where every child can learn, grow, and succeed. Mr Speaker, by January 2025, Ghana’s health system was under severe strain. Ageing and deteriorating equipment, stalled hospital projects, amounting to GHS 15 billion in liabilities, and growing workforce pressures had weakened service delivery.\n\nOver the past year, donor support declined sharply from 19% of total health spending three years ago to just 2.2% today, creating an annual financing gap of more than GHS 2.4 billion.\n\nThe withdrawal of support from programmes previously financed by partners such as USAID exposed vulnerabilities in essential supplies and services, particularly in remote and underserved communities. Faced with these realities, my government chose to act decisively.\n\nIn 2026, direct government funding will account for about 72% of total health spending, up from 56.8% in 2023. Core health allocations have risen to GHS 23.3 billion, and with National Health Insurance resources included, total health financing now stands at GHS 34.7 billion. This reflects our clear commitment to domestic financing and health sovereignty. At the same time, we have faced the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. Today, NCDs account for over 40% of all deaths in Ghana and remain a major cause of household poverty.\n\nTo address this, the government established the Ghana Medical Trust Fund (MahamaCares), the first nationwide financing mechanism dedicated to chronic and non-communicable diseases. Mr Speaker, the National Health Insurance Levy has been uncapped.\n\nClaims payments are now timed, with facilities no longer waiting more than half a year for payment.\n\nWe have also finalised measures to increase provider tariffs by over 100% to reflect realistic costs. As a result of the increased trust, NHIS enrolment has risen from 57% at the start of 2025 to 66% today. Over the past two decades, Ghana’s health workforce density has risen from 16.6 per 10,000 people in 2005 to nearly 42 per 10,000 today, while public-sector health employment has doubled to approximately 200,000 workers. Yet significant challenges remain.\n\nAt the beginning of 2025, 103,000 trained health workers were still awaiting placement, employment, or enrolment on the payroll. Over the past year, 13,500 nurses and midwives, along with hundreds of doctors and pharmacists, were absorbed into the public payroll. Nursing trainee allowances have been regularised, application fees reduced, and the no-fee stress initiative introduced to ease access to training. Service conditions are being implemented to boost morale and retention.\n\nLooking ahead, the government will expand recruitment and take necessary actions to add more health workers to the payroll. We will correct the maldistribution of health workers through targeted incentives for underserved areas. Let me use this opportunity to appeal to our gallant health workers to accept postings to our underserved areas, seeing it as a call to national duty, while we work to ensure they have an enabling environment.\n\nMr Speaker, we will also scale up specialist and advanced nursing training to match the country’s changing disease burden. New post-basic nursing programmes in Cardiology, Nephrology, Endocrinology, and Oncology Nursing will be introduced this year, while two existing ones – Emergency and Critical Care – will be scaled up. At least 30 nursing training institutions will transition to a competency-based degree curriculum, supported by new scholarship opportunities for PhD-level training for nurses and allied health professionals.\n\nMr Speaker, on health infrastructure, my government remains firm in its commitment not to abandon unfinished projects. We will continue to retool facilities, strengthen emergency and disease surveillance systems, and ensure that health infrastructure is properly aligned with staffing, equipment, and financing. In the 2026 Budget, provision has been made to commence Regional Hospitals in the Oti, Savannah, and Western North Regions, expanding access to quality care.\n\nAligned with the RESET Agenda, we are making strategic investments in local pharmaceutical and vaccine production. The government has allocated USD 50 million in seed funding to the National Vaccine Institute. In 2025, a local manufacturer secured market authorisation for a snake venom antiserum produced in Ghana. We are also finalising steps to implement an Advanced Market Commitment to prioritise locally manufactured vaccines, sera, and pharmaceuticals in public procurement.\n\nProduction of the Tetanus-Diphtheria vaccine is expected to commence this year through a partnership with an Indonesian pharmaceutical firm. Disease control remains a priority in our country. Immunisation financing has been strengthened. In 2025, the vaccine budget for children and pregnant women increased by 46%, exceeding GHS 171 million, enabling Ghana to fully and promptly finance its vaccines and reduce the risk of preventable outbreaks.\n\nIn 2025, we also introduced the HPV vaccine to protect girls and women against cervical cancer. Ghana’s HIV prevalence is estimated at 1.6%. There are about 350,000 people living with HIV/AIDS. Although prevalence is low, some population segments and regions have significantly higher incidence than the national average. The Ghana AIDS Commission has been tasked with ensuring the availability of testing and antiretroviral treatment.\n\nThis year, my government will fully roll out a Free Primary Health Care programme, removing cost barriers at the primary level where most health needs are met, while strengthening prevention, screening, and health promotion, especially for non-communicable diseases.\n\nThe Ghana Medical Trust Fund will be scaled up, and access to advanced cardiac care, including cardiac catheterisation services at Tamale Teaching Hospital, Korlebu Teaching Hospital and Komfo Anokye Hospital, will be expanded to reduce overseas referrals and position Ghana as a centre for specialised care in the sub-region, in line with our Medical Tourism agenda.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is expected to issue guidelines to eliminate the unacceptable “no-bed” syndrome observed in some of our health facilities. Patients facing medical emergencies must be received and given help, even under makeshift conditions. Government will expand capacity by implementing the Ridge Hospital phase II, completing the Police Hospital project and the La General Hospital. In the Ashanti region, the completion of the Sewua Hospital, the Aferi Military Hospital and the KATH Maternal and Children’s Block is on course.\n\nMr Speaker, we remain on course to build a stronger, more resilient, and more self-reliant health system for all Ghanaians.\n\nIn the road sector, we inherited a burden of significant financial obligations and structural pressures accumulated over the years. As of December 2024, outstanding payments on road projects financed through the Consolidated Fund stood at GHS 21 billion. These were certified works executed by contractors across the country for which payment had not been made.\n\nIn addition, indebtedness to contractors lodged with the Ghana Road Fund Secretariat and awaiting payment totaled GHS 5.43 billion. This figure excludes accruing interest charges, which continue to compound the State’s financial exposure. Beyond these arrears, we inherited contractual commitments totalling more than GHS 104 billion. These commitments represent signed contracts for road projects at various stages of execution - many without corresponding secured funding to guarantee timely completion.\n\nMr Speaker, by the end of 2025, the ministries of finance and roads had cleared arrears amounting to GHS 10 billion owed to road contractors, and they are steadily continuing to reduce sector debts. The Big Push Infrastructure Programme is my vision for a national infrastructure drive to restore critical roads, open economic corridors, create jobs, and reduce the cost of doing business.\n\nWork has started on 50 road projects spanning 1,144 km under the Big Push initiative. The total estimated cost for these projects is GHS 50 billion. Meanwhile, government is also completing 23 projects awarded by the previous administration that were underfunded. These projects cover 573 km and are estimated to cost GHS 15 billion.\n\nAcross all 16 regions, 73 projects are advancing, with significant, visible progress expected by year-end. Some of the critical projects currently ongoing include:\n\n1. Tepa-Mabang-Goaso\n\n2. Kumasi by-pass road\n\n3. Suame Interchange and local roads\n\n4. Sunyani Outer Ring Road\n\n5. Sampa-Jinijini Road\n\n6. Techiman-Nkonsia-Wenchi\n\n7. Dualization of Winneba-Cape Coast Road\n\n8. Kwahu Tafo-Adawso Road\n\n9. Dodowa-Afienya-Dawhenya Road\n\n10. Gbintiri-Nakpanduri Road\n\n11. Tamale Outer Ring Road\n\n12. Wenchi-Sawla Road\n\n13. Sawla-Wa Road\n\n14. Bole-Chache and Bole Town Roads\n\n15. Navrongo-Tumu Road\n\n16. Tumu-Han-Lawra Road\n\n17. Atimpoku-Ho Road\n\n18. Ho -Denu Road\n\n19. Dualization of Accra-Aflao Road Phase I\n\n20. Dualization of Cape Coast-Takoradi Road\n\n21. Dadieso Akontombra Road\n\nAlso, feeder roads like:\n\n1. Akosombo-Gyakiti-Kudikope\n\n2. Yeniam Junction-Sedorm\n\n3. Apeguso-Mpakadan\n\n4. Todome-Toh Kpalime-Dzemeni\n\nIndeed, there are many other roads, too numerous to mention. As I said at the launch of the Big Push Programme, the whole of Ghana will be a construction site, and Ghanaians can testify that serious roadworks are underway across the country.\n\nMr Speaker, the Accra-Kumasi Expressway is a 198.7 km, six-lane, high-speed motorway designed to connect Ghana's two largest cities and is expected to reduce travel time to approximately 2.5 hours. This new alignment, with eight interchanges, will be Ghana's first true expressway.\n\nThe government has established the Accra-Kumasi Expressway Limited, a subsidiary of the Ghana Infrastructure Investment Fund, as the Concessionaire, mandated to design, finance, construct, operate, and maintain the Expressway and associated facilities, with the Ministry of Roads and Highways as the Contracting Authority. Project delivery is structured as a long-term concession of up to 50 years.\n\nThe Accra–Kumasi Expressway Project will be Ghana’s first purpose-built expressway, with limited access points, higher speed limits, and modern safety infrastructure to reduce travel time and improve road safety. Preparatory activities, including feasibility studies, detailed designs, and cost assessments, are underway.\n\nThis major road construction work aims to improve mobility, safety, and trade while connecting communities to markets and essential services. Now to the Eastern Corridor Road. We aim to complete all unfinished segments of that road by the end of 2027.\n\nWe will continue and complete the 27.7km Accra-Tema Motorway and Extension Project. This includes reconstructing the Accra-Tema Motorway into a four-lane expressway with a three-lane service road in both directions, and interchanges at the Ashaiman under-bridge, Community 18, and Teshie Link. It also involves remodelling the Tetteh Quarshie Interchange. Construction works are ongoing, and progress is 32%.\n\nOther important projects include the Kumasi Inner Ring Road, the Volivo Bridge over the Southern Volta River, the Dambai Bridge over the River Oti, and the Adawso Bridge across the Afram River at Adawso.\n\nThe Ministry has received Cabinet approval to reintroduce tolling on roads and bridges nationwide, using advanced technology to improve efficiency, transparency, and revenue generation. Preparatory work is underway to ensure the reintroduction of tolling operations this year.\n\nMr Speaker, there is no doubt that an effective and efficient transport system is integral to any economic development plan. To improve public transport services in the country, government is supporting Intercity STC Coaches Limited (ISTC), Metro Mass Transit Limited (MMTL), and Private Road Transport Operators in renewing their fleets.\n\nA total of 300 buses have been purchased to improve road transport. The initial batch of 100 buses is scheduled to arrive in the country by the end of the first quarter of this year.\n\nMr Speaker, in fulfilment of my pledge to re-establish a national airline, a ten-member task force established to oversee this initiative has submitted a business model and operational framework to guide the selection of a strategic partner for the National Airline. And it shall surely come to pass soon.\n\nPassenger traffic handled by the Ghana Airports Company increased to 3.625 million in 2025, from 3.4 million in 2024. In response to rising passenger traffic and congestion at Accra International Airport's new Terminal 3, we are remodelling Terminal 2 into a dual-purpose facility to serve both domestic and international flights, thereby improving operational efficiency and enhancing the overall passenger experience.\n\nTerminal 3 remains among the best in Africa. A new concourse will link Terminal 2 to Terminal 3, supported by a multi-tier 7-floor car park, an airport hotel, and retail amenities, as well as runway expansion and overlay.\n\nWe will begin work on new regional airports in Sunyani, Bolgatanga and Wa.\n\nMr Speaker, we are working to fully operationalise the Tema-Mpakadan rail line to maximise passenger and freight traffic between Tema and the North using the Volta Lake waterway. The Western and Eastern Railway Lines will continue to be modernised in partnership with the private sector. These projects aim to support the efficient transport of containers and bulk cargo to and from the ports, as well as to facilitate the efficient haulage of minerals from the mines in Nsuta, Awaso, and Nyinahin to the Takoradi Port, while providing passenger transport along the respective corridors.\n\nMr Speaker, as part of the 24-Hour Economy initiative, a new 24-hour operation has started at Tema Port, allowing access to port services around the clock. This development enables importers to clear goods at any time, significantly easing congestion at terminals like Transit, Reefer, and the Golden Jubilee Terminal. The initiative brings together customs, banking, and other relevant agencies to enhance efficiency, lower transaction costs, and boost Ghana's competitiveness as a major trade hub.\n\nCabinet has reviewed the designs and the feasibility study for the Keta Port and directed the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority to present an action plan and a roadmap for the realisation of the project at the earliest possible time. Similarly, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority, as part of its expansion effort, has established a new operational office at the Adenta Bus Terminal in Accra. This modern facility operates around the clock, providing continuous services to improve accessibility and convenience for motorists in the Adentan Municipality and nearby areas.\n\nMr Speaker, under the Rural Telephony and Digital Inclusion Project, implemented through the Ghana Investment Fund for Electronic Communication (GIFEC) to extend voice and data connectivity to unserved and underserved communities, we targeted the construction of 2,016 Cell Sites. 1,561 Cell Sites have been constructed. Of this number, 1,144 have been activated. Work is ongoing to activate the remaining 417 Sites. Preparations are also well underway to commence construction of the remaining 455 Sites.\n\nUnder the School Connectivity Initiative, over 62,000 digital resources have been uploaded to the Ghana Knowledge & Skills Bank, enabling seamless access across multiple devices—PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones—for more than 600,000 users including teachers, students, and researchers.\n\nMr Speaker, as part of the Government’s Reset Agenda to ensure Ghanaian youth acquire essential digital skills for the modern global economy, I launched the One Million Coders Programme in March 2025. The initiative aims to train 1 million Ghanaians in key digital areas, including Data Analytics, Data Protection, Cyber Security, the Metaverse, and Artificial Intelligence, over four years. Phase one of the Programme, the Pilot Phase, saw hundreds of trainees complete their training programmes in person across four training centres in Accra, Kumasi, Sunyani and Bolgatanga. Phase two, which will include virtual sessions, is set to commence this year, with expanded training centres and an increased number of beneficiaries. It is projected that 400,000 Ghanaians will be trained this year.\n\nFight against corruption.\n\nMr Speaker, this remains a defining priority of my government and represents a central pillar of our commitment to good governance, accountability, and the prudent management of public resources.\n\nWe have made progress through strengthened collaboration among law enforcement agencies, financial intelligence institutions, and prosecutors. These efforts have led to the initiation of criminal proceedings and asset forfeiture proceedings against some individuals and entities implicated in financial crimes against the State. But yes, I agree with the sentiments of Ghanaians that we must press harder on the accelerator.\n\nAs of December 2025, EOCO had recovered more than GHS 600 million. The Office has investigated 462 cases, with 15 currently under prosecution, and dismantled transnational car-jacking syndicates, recovering 29 luxury vehicles.\n\nMr Speaker, the Government remains resolute that corruption will not be tolerated, regardless of status or political affiliation. The Attorney General’s Office will continue to use both criminal prosecution and non-conviction-based asset recovery mechanisms to ensure that stolen public resources are returned for national development.\n\nI understand that a large majority of Ghanaians are impatient to see those who abused their trust in office held to account.\n\nThere were periods when, under military regimes and unconstitutional governments, extrajudicial means could be used to exact retribution against persons perceived as corrupt or who had abused the public trust. This may have appeared as swift justice, but many regrettable excesses were recorded.\n\nIn 1992, we overwhelmingly adopted the 1992 constitution to accept governance by the rule of law. On 7th January 2025, I swore before the people of Ghana to uphold the 1992 Constitution. I may be as impatient as everyone else to see justice done, but painstaking investigations must be conducted, dockets must be prepared, charges must be filed, and the accused must have their day in court, including appealing even the smallest points of law to higher courts. This process is necessary to protect us all against abuse or ill-treatment of citizens and to ensure that only those guilty of offences against the state are punished.\n\nAs President Mills of blessed memory said, “The wheels of Justice grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine.”\n\nLet me reassert my determination to uphold the accountability of public office holders to the people of Ghana. We have laid the Public Officers Code of Conduct Bill before Parliament. This bill codifies the conduct of public officers and makes breaches thereof punishable. I wish, at this juncture, to thank the Chief Justice for establishing specialised High Courts to address breaches identified in the Auditor General's report.\n\nThe constitution review process was conducted in a transparent, consultative, and participatory manner, drawing on input from constitutional experts, civil society organisations, traditional authorities, political parties, and the public. The review committee has submitted its comprehensive report, containing detailed proposals to amend the Constitution to address identified weaknesses and make it more welfare-enhancing.\n\nThe Attorney General’s Office is working closely with relevant stakeholders to translate the recommendations into implementable legal and constitutional proposals, which will be presented to Parliament in accordance with constitutional procedures.\n\nMr Speaker, illegal mining continues to pose a grave threat to our environment, water bodies, public health, and national security. Prosecution of persons engaged in illegal mining has been intensified with a renewed focus on dismantling organised criminal networks behind galamsey operations rather than targeting only low-level offenders.\n\nIn total, over 114 case dockets involving hundreds of accused persons are pending in various courts across the country, particularly in towns and villages prone to illegal mining. Specialised prosecutorial teams have been deployed to fast-track illegal mining cases, ensure the effective presentation of evidence, and pursue the confiscation and forfeiture of equipment and proceeds used in or derived from illegal mining.\n\nMr Speaker, my government will continue to ensure gender equality and equity, promote the welfare and protection of children's rights, and empower the vulnerable, the aged, and persons with disabilities for sustainable national development.\n\nWork is well advanced on the Women’s Development Bank, for which a total of GHS 401 million has been allocated in the 2026 Budget. The coming months should see a full rollout of this monumental policy to empower Ghanaian women and women-owned businesses economically and financially.\n\nMr Speaker, the Ministry of Gender and Social Protection has successfully honoured the LEAP payment cycles for 2025, reaching 1.5 million people. It ensures the full implementation of the Ghana School Feeding Programme in over 12,000 public schools across all 261 districts of the country.\n\nThe number of beneficiary pupils has increased from three million, eight hundred and one thousand, four hundred and ninety-one (3,801,491) for the 2023/2024 academic year to four million, two hundred and thirty-one thousand, and fifty-nine (4,231,059) for the 2024/2025 academic year. The programme is providing gainful employment to 34,000 caterers and cooks nationwide.\n\nMr Speaker, in the security sector, Ghana faces evolving security threats. Our troops, services and agencies have, however, remained firmly committed to strengthening national peace and security, which underpin our democracy, development, and social cohesion. This commitment encompasses internal security operations, international peace support missions, strategic investments in infrastructure and retooling, and improvements in troop welfare, recruitment, and capacity development.\n\nTwo recent incidents are evidence of the increasing dangers we face as a nation. The killing of eight of our citizens who had gone to our neighbouring country to purchase tomatoes, and an attack yesterday on Ghanaian fishermen in our waters by pirates, reinforce the need for us to retool and adequately equip our security services.\n\nI wish to commend the Ghana Armed Forces for conducting a successful medical evacuation of our injured compatriots from Burkina Faso. I also commend the Ghana Navy and Air Force, the National Security Council Secretariat, the Chief of Staff’s Operations Team, the MP for Awutu Senya, the Chief Fisherman and the people of Senya Bereku for the combined effort that successfully rescued the stranded 71 fishermen yesterday.\n\nI have asked the National Security Coordinator to assist the affected fishermen and replace the stolen outboard motors and fishing gear.\n\nThe Armed Forces continues to play a key role in containing illegal small-scale mining (galamsey) through the deployment of River Guards, support for the National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS), and assistance to Special Courts for the swift prosecution of offenders.\n\nMr Speaker, during the year, the Ghana Armed Forces had 2,199 troops with requisite equipment deployed to various peacekeeping missions, reinforcing Ghana’s reputation as a dependable and professional contributor to international peace operations. While Ghana continues to maintain an enviable reputation in international peacekeeping, we note that many of the theatres where we have operated are winding down due to reduced budgets for UN Peace Support Operations.\n\nAs our troops return home, we must create opportunities for them to train, remain active, and stay engaged. Mr Speaker, beyond peacekeeping operations, Ghana continues to demonstrate its strong commitment to international solidarity, humanitarian assistance, and South–South cooperation. In December 2025, the Government deployed 54 personnel from the 14 Engineers Brigade to Jamaica to support national reconstruction efforts following the devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, which claimed over 40 lives.\n\nIn recognition of the scale of the recovery effort, the Government approved a request from the Government of Jamaica to extend Operation BOAFO, Ghana’s humanitarian deployment, from its initial 30-day mandate to 90 days.\n\nMr Speaker, to further improve operational readiness, the Government will continue to invest in vital defence infrastructure and retooling. The construction of a Forward Operating Base at Ezinlibo, situated along the western maritime corridor, is ongoing. This facility aims to boost maritime surveillance and better protect offshore oil and gas installations. The Northern Border Security Project, initiated to counter terrorism and transnational crime, is advancing decisively. This project constitutes the first line of defence against infiltration and extremist threats, significantly strengthening surveillance.\n\nPlans are well advanced to establish 2 additional military barracks in Ajumako, Central Region, and Dambai, Oti Region, to address emerging security concerns and strengthen state presence in these areas. To further support retooling efforts, agreements have been signed to procure and deliver four helicopters and one jet for the Ghana Air Force, aimed at replacing the ageing fleet and modernising our air capabilities.\n\nThe Ghana Armed Forces is carrying out a thorough overhaul of previously grounded aircraft, which involves replacing essential components. This aims to quickly restore operational readiness and maximise fleet availability.\n\nMr Speaker, I am pleased to announce that I have commissioned 50 vehicles for the Ghana Armed Forces to enhance operational mobility and boost troop morale. It forms part of a broader government programme to retool the military and improve logistics across the services. Plans are underway to acquire two offshore patrol vessels, armoured personnel carriers, protective gear, ammunition, vehicles, strategic drones, and advanced communication systems to enhance the operational capabilities of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n\nMr Speaker, we will continue to prioritise human capital development within the Forces. A progressive recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Ghana Armed Forces by 12,000 personnel over four years to support expansion and operational demands is ongoing. In line with the Government’s reset agenda, the recruitment process has been decentralised to regional capitals, with selected recruits reporting directly from their regions to training schools, marking a significant shift from the previous Accra-centred system.\n\nI wish to express my condolences to the families of our young daughters who died during the stampede at the El Wak Stadium. May their memory be blessed and may they rest in perfect peace. Following the revised gratuity regime introduced in 2020 under Constitutional Instrument 129, arrears have accumulated because no budgetary provision was made in the four years that followed. This has resulted in over one billion Ghana cedis owed to approximately three thousand personnel across different ranks.\n\nMr Speaker, as part of our commitment to fairness and the resolution of long-standing legacy issues, the Government will soon commence payment of gratuity arrears under CI 129. Following engagements initiated by the current Military High Command with the Ministry of Finance and Defence, a structured implementation plan has been agreed upon. This will bring closure to an issue that has been outstanding since 2020 and ensure that affected personnel receive their rightful entitlements.\n\nThe Ghana Police Service has also received 40 armoured vehicles and 100 pick-up trucks to enhance its operations. Other security agencies, such as the Fire, Prisons, Immigration, BNI and the Narcotics Control Commission, will also be retooled to enhance their efficiency. I wish to commend the IGP and his men for the recent major success in bringing dangerous criminals to justice. The trust of Ghanaians in their police service is rising, and I urge you to keep up the standard.\n\nMr Speaker, Ghana’s foreign policy remains a central instrument for advancing our national development, safeguarding our sovereignty and projecting our values on the global stage. At a time when the global environment is characterised by profound geopolitical shifts, economic uncertainty, climate-related challenges, and evolving security concerns within our sub-region, the Government has taken deliberate steps to ensure that Ghana’s engagement with the world is purposeful, strategic, and responsive to the needs of our people.\n\nIn this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stepped up efforts to align Ghana’s external relations with our domestic development priorities.\n\nMr Speaker, in West Africa, Ghana continues to pursue a policy of good neighbourliness, solidarity and constructive cooperation with all countries in the sub-region. We remain firmly committed to the vision of a peaceful, stable, prosperous and integrated West Africa, grounded in mutual respect, dialogue and collective responsibility.\n\nWe must sustain engagement and deepen relations with the AES member states, particularly following their withdrawal from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Ghana believes that continued dialogue and cooperation are indispensable to regional stability and that disengagement only deepens vulnerabilities.\n\nAt the continental level, Ghana continues to play an active, principled and forward-looking role in advancing the African Union’s strategic priorities. Ghana currently holds the following prestigious positions: AU Champion on Reparations and AU Champion for African Financial Institutions. Ghana is also the AU Champion for gender equality and women's empowerment.\n\nMr Speaker, I am humbled by Ghana’s election as the First Vice Chairperson of the African Union (AU) at the 39th Ordinary Session of the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It is also gratifying to note that my colleague leaders in West Africa have declared me, John Dramani Mahama, the region’s sole candidate for the position of Chairperson of the African Union when the rotating chairmanship returns to West Africa in 2027.\n\nMr Speaker, during the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, I raised Ghana’s voice to call for a comprehensive ‘reset’ of the United Nations to better reflect current realities, particularly the role of Africa in global governance and fairness in international financial systems. In line with our multilateral commitments, Ghana announced plans to table a UN resolution recognising the Transatlantic Slave Trade as the greatest crime against humanity and promoting an agenda of acknowledgement, reparative justice, and cultural restitution.\n\nI will formally present the resolution, which has been endorsed and adopted by the African Union, to the UN in March this year for consideration by the UN General Assembly. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established 7 new Passport Application Centres in the Upper East, Oti, Ahafo, Bono East, North East, Savannah and Western North Regions. With this expansion, all sixteen (16) regional capitals now host passport application centres, marking a major milestone in the decentralisation of passport services.\n\nMr Speaker, to address systemic delays, the ministry implemented a 24-hour passport production operation at the Head Office, enabling the clearance of an inherited backlog of over 40,000 passport applications. As a result of these reforms, Ghana’s passport administration now operates with zero backlog, guaranteeing passport delivery within 15 working days nationwide. To facilitate travel, boost tourism and ease business mobility, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs implemented a five-day visa processing service across Ghana’s Missions abroad.\n\nConcurrently, significant progress has been made in the design and procurement phases of a national electronic visa (e-Visa) platform, with a targeted rollout planned for 2026. Ghana has also secured new visa waiver agreements with 11 countries to facilitate people-to-people exchanges, trade, and investment.\n\nMr Speaker, to highlight Ghana’s ongoing commitments to international solidarity, we made significant humanitarian donations to Jamaica, Cuba, Sudan, and Palestine to support disaster relief and conflict-related crises. These donations, amounting to millions of cedis, included food, medicine, clothing, and cocoa products.\n\nMr Speaker, I am pleased to report that remittances from Ghanaians abroad reached a historic high of $7.8 billion in 2025. This is the largest annual inflow ever recorded. This reflects not only confidence in our economy but the enduring patriotism of our citizens living and working across the world.\n\nThese remittances support households, finance education, build homes, seed businesses, and stabilise our foreign exchange position. In many respects, our diaspora has become one of the country’s most reliable development partners, without contracts, conditionalities, or fanfare.\n\nWe must intentionally ensure that citizenship, rather than place of residence, determines one’s right to serve the Republic. Ghanaians worldwide who pledge allegiance to this country and make substantial contributions to its development should not be barred from active participation in public affairs, including the opportunity to hold public office, provided there are appropriate measures to ensure loyalty and accountability.\n\nI am, personally, in support of the bipartisan bill currently before Parliament seeking to address this matter.\n\nMr Speaker, youth development and empowerment are at the core of everything we are trying to achieve. We are implementing many policies to develop our youth's capacity and to create as many jobs as possible to address the major unemployment problem. All our youth activities and job creation programmes are ongoing. In 2025, 10,887 young people were trained in entrepreneurship programmes and job creation under the Adwumawura programme. In 2026, an additional 10,000 young people will receive similar support under the programme.\n\nThe National Apprenticeship Programme onboarded 14,000 young people during the pilot phase, and they have started receiving start-up kits. Training is ongoing across the regions, and when completed, the trainees will be certified by the Commission for TVET to facilitate access to employment.\n\nMr Speaker, this year, the target for the National Apprenticeship Programme has been increased from 10,000 to 100,000 young people, offering many more young people the opportunity to acquire the skills needed for sustainable employment.\n\nIn 2025, 86,000 young people were engaged through the Youth Employment Agency (YEA)'s various employment modules. This year, I have directed the Ministry of Youth Development and Empowerment to, as a matter of urgency, review all the youth employment modules under the YEA to reduce duplication and ensure value for money. This is important to channel the resources to the advantage of the teeming youth waiting for opportunities.\n\nThe National Service Authority has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Defence to commence military training for 10,000 National Service Personnel in the 2025/2026 service year. This was a programme our late Minister for Defence, Dr Edward Omane Boamah, was desirous of seeing to full execution. I charge the NSA and the GAF to bring life into the exercise for the benefit of the personnel and the training of our youth.\n\nMr. Speaker, my government has launched a wide range of initiatives aimed at transforming Ghana’s trade, agribusiness, and industrial sectors to boost our competitiveness in export markets, encourage value addition, and generate employment for Ghana's large youth population. My recent visit with the Minister for Trade, Agribusiness and Industry, to inaugurate new factories and expansion works, convinced me that Ghana is on the right track for industrial transformation.\n\nThe ministry has begun implementing policies in the areas of textiles and garment manufacturing, pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturing, automotive and component manufacturing, and contract farming and agro-processing. As a first step, we are collaborating with the private sector to establish three garment factories in the Eastern, Central, and Bono East regions, creating an estimated 27,000 jobs.\n\nMr Speaker, this government will fulfil its commitment to revive key state-owned enterprises. The Ministry is in the process of sourcing strategic investors to operationalise the Komenda Sugar Factory, Volta Star Textiles, Pwalugu Tomato Factory, Zuarungu Meat Factory and the Akosombo Textiles Limited.\n\nGhana’s Non-Traditional Exports recorded a 27.04% growth in 2025 with total earnings of $4.87 billion, up from $3.83 billion in 2024. This reflects a very early impact of the Accelerated Export Development Programme (AEDP), launched only last year, and demonstrates the continued resilience and expanding contribution of the Non-Traditional Exports sector to Ghana’s export economy.\n\nMr Speaker, the mining sub-sector remains a cornerstone of Ghana’s economic development, making substantial contributions to employment creation, export earnings, and government revenue. According to the Ghana Statistical Service, the mining and quarrying sub-sector accounted for 17.4 per cent of the overall 33.8 per cent industry share of Gross Domestic Product in 2025, emerging as the leading contributor within the industrial sector. The sector generated export earnings of approximately $15.25 billion, accounting for 65.37 per cent of Ghana’s total export receipts, out of a total of $23.33 billion.\n\nThe abolition of Value Added Tax (VAT) on mineral exploration activities is expected to significantly reduce upfront costs for investors, improve project economics, and stimulate increased greenfield and brownfield exploration across the country\n\nMr Speaker, the fight against galamsey remains complex and demands a multidimensional response that integrates strong enforcement, the application of technology, sound regulation, and active community participation. The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, the Ghana Revenue Authority (Customs), and the Ministry of Finance, has registered 1,808 pieces of earth-moving and mining equipment at the port, of which 1,033 are being tracked.\n\nThe protection of our water bodies and forest reserves is ongoing with the deployment of 1,634 Blue Water Guards across the Western, Western North, Savannah, Upper West, Bono, Eastern, Ashanti, Central, Volta and Northern Regions. This nationwide deployment aims to strengthen surveillance, improve rapid response, and enhance on-the-ground enforcement against illegal mining activities that threaten critical water sources, forest ecosystems and livelihoods. NAIMOS will maintain regular, coordinated operations across all twenty-one (21) identified hotspots to prevent re-entry. While temporary deployments yielded positive results, they proved insufficient for sustained enforcement.\n\nMr Speaker, the Works, Housing and Water sub-sectors are vital pillars of Ghana’s national development, shaping sustainable livelihoods through a reliable water supply and affordable housing that enhance citizens' well-being. Sea defence works are ongoing. We have successfully completed works at Komenda, Ningo–Prampram and Elmina. Together, these three projects have protected approximately 15 km of coastline and safeguarded lives, livelihoods and property.\n\nIn March 2025, I visited Solakope, Agavedzi, and Amutinu in the Ketu South Municipality, where tidal waves had displaced thousands of residents. We made a firm commitment to address the devastation. True to that promise, the contract for Phase 2 of the Blekusu Coastal Protection Project was awarded, and in August last year, I officially broke ground to commence the project. The project is currently 25% complete, and calm has already been restored along the coastline.\n\nNotwithstanding these actions, flooding remains a major infrastructural challenge in the country and a top priority for this government. A task force on flooding is in place and coordinating the national mitigation efforts.\n\nMr Speaker, Ghana continues to grapple with a housing deficit currently estimated at over 1.8 million units. Some significant strides have been made in the housing sector. In line with the Government's earlier commitments to complete all ongoing housing initiatives, we have successfully concluded the Joint Venture arrangement for the completion of the Saglemi Housing Project.\n\nThe Attorney General is reviewing all related documentation to finalise and commence the project. TDC Ghana is also steadily advancing work on 800 housing units under the Kpone Affordable Housing Project at Tema Community 26.\n\nTo position TDC Ghana as a key player in Ghana’s housing industry, I performed the sod-cutting ceremony last year for the Oxygen City Housing Project in Ho. That project seeks to address Ghana’s housing deficit by developing 1,000 affordable housing units. We have also continued with our resettlement housing efforts for the victims of the Akosombo Dam Spillage, with 251 of the planned 1,010 housing units in critical impact zones already under construction. Collectively, these initiatives demonstrate the government’s continued resolve to expand access to affordable housing, strengthen urban planning, and provide relief to affected communities.\n\nMr Speaker, Ghana’s renewable water resources are estimated at about 54 billion cubic meters, with over 70% derived from the Volta Basin shared among six riparian nations. We are implementing key interventions to expand and improve water services nationwide. The following urban water supply projects are at various stages of completion: the Keta Water Supply Project, the Wenchi Water Supply Project, and the Sekondi-Takoradi Water Supply Project.\n\nI am happy to announce that Anyako has good, clean drinking water today, and the Community Water and Sanitation Agency will commission the project next week. It will also serve the island community of Seva.\n\nWe will begin preparatory work on the Damango and Sunyani Water Supply Expansion Projects and seek to finalise all financing arrangements for other water supply projects in Tamale, Yendi, Techiman, and Tarkwa. The Danish Government has allocated grant support to improve water supply services in low-income and high-density areas in Wa and Bolgatanga, aiming to address water challenges and provide relief to vulnerable populations.\n\nMr Speaker, the following Rural Water Supply Projects are ongoing: Asankragwa, Sefwi Wiawso, Duadaso, Kweiman Danfa, Goaso, Juaben, Aveyime, and Adum Banso.\n\nTo strictly follow the Resetting Agenda and secure sufficient funding, the Ministry of Finance has allocated GHS 6.3 billion to the District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF). This amount covers four quarters of the 2025 fiscal year and is allocated to all 261 Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies (MMDAs) to execute their activities outlined in the Medium-Term Development Plans and Annual Action Plans (AAPs). Out of the amount released, a total of GHS 4.3 billion has been disbursed to all MMDAs. The 4th Quarter instalment is being processed for disbursement.\n\nIn fulfilment of the Government’s commitment to strengthen local governance and decentralisation, the Ministry has, for the first time in the history of local governance, disbursed a total of GHS 100 million in monthly allowances to all Assembly Members. The Ministry of Local Government, Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, has finalised the designs for the 24-Hour Economy Modern Markets to be adopted and constructed by all MMDAs. Procurement processes are far advanced to commence the construction of the 24-Hour Markets.\n\nTourism and Culture. Our creative arts sector has so much to offer. Creatives using new media are giving our nation greater prominence than we could achieve through any first-class media outlet.\n\nOur economy will not be built only by traditional sectors but also by human-creativity sectors that will absorb those displaced from the shop floor by new AI technologies.\n\nGhana has become a favourite tourist destination because of our history, culture, arts, music, fashion, and food. The government has allocated GHS 20 million to the film sector alone and another GHS 20 million to the broader creative sector. I will be your personal ambassador for the tourism and creative sector.\n\nGovernment will, in line with a new national MICE and Creative Events strategy, undertake the refurbishment of the Accra International Conference Centre to restore it to its iconic status as the country’s national and international events and conference venue.\n\nThe original contractors of the Centre, EnergoProjekt Ghana Limited, have conducted a structural integrity assessment at the request of the Chief of Staff and made recommendations for the facility's renovation and refurbishment. They will commence the works in the next few weeks.\n\nBut, Mr Speaker, the AICC is not enough for a country seeking to develop its creative sector and become West Africa’s destination for meetings, musical concerts, entertainment, and conferences. Working with the private sector, work will also commence this year on a befitting Convention and Creative Events Centre to position Ghana as West Africa’s leading hub for Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions, and Creative Events. The government will also begin this year the renovation of the State Banquet Hall, which has been closed for a couple of years.\n\nMr Speaker, this year, we will strengthen Ghana’s standing in major global and continental sports events. We will make our 5th FIFA World Cup appearance, and for us, this is an opportunity to boost national branding and the economy beyond just sports. The Black Queens will compete at the 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, building on their bronze medal finish in Morocco. At the youth level, Ghana will participate in the 2026 Youth Olympic Games in Dakar with a multi-disciplinary team aimed at strengthening long-term elite pathways. We will also compete at the Commonwealth Games 2026 in Glasgow, reinforcing Ghana’s presence across the Commonwealth sporting landscape.\n\nMr Speaker, as a member of the Ghana Journalist Association, I have been deeply concerned about abuses suffered by journalists at the hands of some errant security personnel. I have asked the leadership of the security agencies to take firm action and to reorient their men and women on the need to be accommodating to journalists who are only doing their job of keeping citizens informed. I have also been concerned about the state of the State-owned media, almost all of which have suffered from historical underfunding and are grappling with deteriorating infrastructure and facilities.\n\nI recently toured these media houses to learn about their challenges, and we are currently putting together a revitalisation plan to leverage their valuable assets and reinject life into their operations. The reintroduction of the Media Development Fund is also being reconsidered to support the Ghanaian media.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMr Speaker, during my recent trip to Zambia, we saw what a united Ghana can achieve on the global stage. A simple mislabeling of our culture could have reduced us to a punchline. Instead, we moved with speed and confidence. We corrected the record. We turned ridicule into reach. We turned confusion into connection. We turned what could have been a negative social media trend into a handshake of friendship with our Zambian brothers and sisters.\n\nFor most, that episode was just a fleeting social media frenzy. Yet it served a greater purpose. It showed a nation that understands its brand equity. It showed citizens aligned around a common identity. It showed a country that knows who we are and refuses to be defined by others. But let us be honest. Unity in moments of cultural pride has proved easier than unity in moments of political disagreement. If we can mobilise that same collective resolve for our development agenda, we will see real progress.\n\nThat mobilisation is possible. We are the descendants of a people who united against political subjugation, resisted economic exploitation, and fought oppression.\n\nMr Speaker, our pursuit of national development today demands the same unity. We must reject misrepresentation and distortion that detract from our collective progress. We must guard our development as firmly as we guard our identity. And we must act as one people with one purpose.\n\nMr Speaker, in public life, there is a simple maxim we are all very familiar with: the buck stops with the President. I not only agree with this; every day I hold the office of President, I live by it. The ultimate responsibility for the direction of this nation rests with the office I hold, and I would never shirk that duty. But nation-building is not merely a question of who provides strategic direction and who bears final responsibility.\n\nIt is the long chain of effort that carries intent into reality — from policy conception to laws enacted, to resources mobilised, to services delivered, to value created on farms, in workshops, in classrooms, in markets, and in enterprises across our land. It is here that the strength of a Republic reveals itself: in the countless acts of competence, integrity, and industry by citizens of every calling, whose work turns national purpose into lived reality.\n\nWhile the buck may stop at the Presidency, the work of nation-building goes beyond it; through the labour, enterprise, and civic spirit of millions of Ghanaians, whose daily efforts give policy life. I will continue to carry the weight of final accountability. And I ask, in equal measure, that our citizens bring their full measure of energy, skill, and patriotism to the common task of advancing our country.\n\nThat is how nations build influence. That is how economies grow. No policy can substitute for civic duty. No programme can replace the quiet discipline with which millions of Ghanaians sustain their families, serve their communities, and carry this Republic forward each day.\n\nMr Speaker, we are sometimes tempted to judge our nation only by the failures and difficulties we face. But a country is not defined solely by its burdens. It is defined by the choices its people make in response to them. Repeatedly throughout our history, Ghanaians have chosen steadiness over despair, cooperation over division, and purpose over cynicism. That is the deeper strength on which our future rests. We have faced testing moments before. Periods of economic strain. Transitions that have demanded much from our citizens and public servants alike.\n\nMr Speaker, there is an old African proverb, (QUOTE) “However long the night, the dawn will break.” (UNQUOTE)\n\nThe dawn is breaking for Ghana. The moment we are in requires not only endurance but also action. It reminds us that renewal belongs to those who prepare for the morning, while others still speak of darkness. For Ghana today, that dawn is not a promise we recite. It is a reality we must build into our institutions, in our economy, and in the ethic of responsibility we pass on to the next generation.\n\nSo let us live each day, mindful that the Republic is larger than any one political party, any office, or any moment. This Republic belongs equally to the farmer and the trader, the teacher and the nurse, the artisan and the entrepreneur, the young citizen just finding her voice and the elder who has carried faith in this nation for decades. Each has a stake. Each has a duty. Each has a claim on the future we shape together.\n\nMr Speaker, nations endure not because they are spared trial, but because their people refuse surrender. Ghana has been tested before. We did not yield then. We will not yield now. And so, with gratitude for how far we have come, and with resolve for the work ahead, I say, Mr Speaker, the State of our Nation is resilient, the state of our nation is renewing, and our nation is firmly in the hands of its people.\n\nI thank you for your attention.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Mayor of Accra, Michael Kpakpo Allotey, has assured traders at Makola No. 2 Market that a proposed rent increase and a disputed 20 per cent charge will not take effect for now, as the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) begins discussions with the facility’s managers to address concerns raised by the traders.\n\nThe assurance came during a working visit to the market on Thursday, February 26, after traders closed their shops in protest. The action disrupted business at one of Accra’s busiest commercial centres.\n\nThe traders said they were protesting what they described as unfair rent conditions and the imposition of a 20 per cent charge at the facility, which they have occupied for more than 30 years. The market is reported to be owned by SSNIT.\n\nThey also complained that parts of the rent, including sanitation and maintenance fees, were not reflected in visible improvements at the market. According to them, conditions at the facility have deteriorated even as charges continue to rise.\n\nAddressing the traders, the Mayor clarified that the proposed rent increment was not directed by the President or the central government. He stressed that he had not authorised any rent increase.\n\nHe acknowledged the economic difficulties facing traders and said the government understands their situation. He assured them that the AMA would engage the facility’s management to review the matter and work towards an amicable solution.\n\nUntil those discussions are concluded, he said, rent levels should remain unchanged.\n\nThe Mayor added that any future rent adjustment must be linked to clear improvements in the market’s infrastructure and services. He indicated that increases would not be justified if conditions at the facility do not improve.\n\nAs part of immediate steps to improve the trading environment, he announced that the AMA would take over sanitation management in the area. This includes clearing accumulated refuse around the market.\n\nHe encouraged traders to channel their concerns through the AMA, noting that he operates an open-door policy and remains accessible to all residents, including the vulnerable.\n\nThe Mayor appealed for calm and patience, assuring the traders that their concerns had been heard and that steps were being taken to resolve the issue through dialogue.\n\nSome traders who spoke after the engagement expressed appreciation for the intervention.\n\nThey thanked President John Dramani Mahama and the Mayor for what they described as a responsive approach, saying the visit had renewed their hope that the matter would be resolved and their businesses protected from what they consider excessive charges.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "The Supreme Court ruling comes after Israel said it would ban 37 aid groups from Gaza for failing to follow new rules.\n\nIsrael’s Supreme Court has ruled that dozens of international aid agencies can continue to operate in the Gaza Strip and other Palestinian territories, freezing an earlier government decision that barred aid groups that failed to comply with new rules.\n\nIn a ruling on Friday, Israel’s top court issued a temporary injunction to allow the NGOs to continue most of their activities while it considers a petition from 17 aid agencies against the government ban.\n\nIsrael had announced it will ban 37 aid groups from war-torn Gaza, the occupied West Bank, and occupied East Jerusalem on March 1, a move that experts warned could have potentially devastating consequences for Palestinians.\n\nAid agencies – including Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE – were notified by Israeli authorities in December that their Israeli work registrations had expired and that they had 60 days to renew them and provide lists containing personal details on their Palestinian staff.\n\nThe organisations say compliance with the Israeli orders would expose their Palestinian staff to potential retaliation, undermine the principle of humanitarian neutrality and violate European data protection law.\n\nIn a statement after Friday’s ruling, Shaina Low, communication adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said the decision was welcome, but pointed to the difficulties that aid agencies continue to face in Gaza.\n\n“The injunction pauses immediate closure. It does not restore visas, reopen access or resolve the wider restrictions that continue to affect aid delivery.\n\n\n\n“Despite a ceasefire agreement, conditions in Gaza remain catastrophic, and humanitarian needs in the West Bank continue to grow,” said Low.\n\nAthena Rayburn, executive director for the Association of International Development Agencies, said they were “still waiting to see how the injunction will be interpreted by the state and whether or not this will mean an increase in our ability to operate,” adding that the situation inside Gaza remained “catastrophic”.\n\nIsraeli attacks continue in Gaza\n\nIn Gaza, at least six Palestinians were killed in Israeli drone attacks targeting two police posts in the Bureij refugee camp in the central Strip and the al-Mawasi area in Khan Younis in the south on Friday.\n\nMedical sources at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis reported the arrival of four bodies and several wounded individuals following an Israeli military strike on a police checkpoint at the al-Maslakh intersection in al-Mawasi.\n\nThe sources said that the strike occurred in an area outside the Israeli military’s control, and described the condition of some of the wounded as critical.\n\nIn the central Gaza Strip, two Palestinians were killed, and others were injured, in a similar Israeli drone strike that targeted a police post at the entrance to the Bureij refugee camp.\n\nThe attacks overnight into Friday were condemned by Hamas as undermining mediator efforts during a “ceasefire” phase that Israel has violated almost daily since October 10.\n\nReporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said it was a “bloody night. Israeli forces carried out a series of deadly air strikes, this time primarily focusing on police checkpoints that have been deployed too close to areas where armed militias are operating in the eastern communities of the Gaza Strip, in particular in … Khan Younis and Bureij refugee camp.\n\n“Six police members have been killed as a result … But also here, the timing and location are critically reshaping the whole equation between both sides. Israel has made clear that Israel will not be responsible for reorganising the remnants of life in Gaza. That’s why we can see that any kind of restoration of previous services, including police … will be thwarted,” he added."

            "content": "Netflix declined to raise its proposal to match a higher one from Paramount for Warner Bros, saying the deal was no longer attractive.\n\nNetflix’s stock is surging as investors applauded its decision to exit the race for Warner Bros Discovery, a months-long bidding war with Paramount Skydance for some of Hollywood’s most prized assets.\n\nThe stock jumped more than 10 percent on Friday. That came on the heels of Netflix’s decision on Thursday evening that it would not match Paramount’s latest $31 per share bid or raise its offer of $27.75 a share for Warner Bros’s studio and streaming assets, stating that the deal was “no longer financially attractive”.\n\nWarner had given Netflix four business days to come up with a counteroffer for Paramount’s latest bid — but Netflix, instead, responded less than two hours later, declining to raise its proposal. It said the new price it would have to pay made the deal “no longer financially attractive”.\n\n“We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros′ iconic brands,” Netflix’s co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a joint statement. “But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”\n\nThe decision was welcomed by investors. Shares of the streaming giant had shed more than 18 percent since Netflix announced its deal with Warner Bros on December 5.\n\nThe latest move is a “tick in the box” for discipline, said Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot.\n\n“What you want from a management team is an ability to look at acquisitions, value them, pay what they think is a fair price, but to not overpay.”\n\nAnalysts and investors had questioned whether Netflix’s bid was a defensive attempt to block a future competitor or an offensive shift away from its historically disciplined build-versus-buy approach.\n\n\n\n“A positive turn of events in our view, as we believe NFLX’s withdrawal from the race will leave it free to refocus on its business, while its closest competitors grapple with long and distracting regulatory approval and merger integration processes, and with PSKY saddled with sizable deal debts,” HSBC analysts said.\n\n‘Hollywood and ego’\n\nShares of the David Ellison-led Paramount, meanwhile, were up 17 percent.\n\nParamount’s deal, valued at $110bn, including debt, represents nearly 13 times Warner Bros’ EBITDA – earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation or core profits – this year, according to estimates from LSEG. That is well above what Paramount is worth on the same basis, which is 7 times its estimated earnings.\n\nA tie-up with Warner Bros would allow Paramount’s storied Hollywood studio to tap into Warner’s deep trove of intellectual property – including franchises such as Fantastic Beasts and The Matrix – across film, television and streaming.\n\n“WBD’s largest asset is declining, and the company is still under debt from its last failed merger. But this deal is more about Ellison taking over Hollywood and ego than it is about good business sense,” said Ross Benes, senior analyst at Emarketer.\n\nFor Paramount’s streaming unit, a combination with HBO Max and Discovery+ would reshape its position in a streaming era long dominated by Netflix.\n\n“Paramount was the streaming market laggard, and it needs Warner Bros’ content and capabilities to play catch-up. It will need more than Harry Potter for the deal to work its magic and enable Paramount to fight off Netflix, Disney and Amazon in the streaming wars,” said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell.\n\nIn the fight for Warner Bros, the Paramount consortium – backed by Larry Ellison, billionaire and ally of United States President Donald Trump, and led by his son, Paramount CEO David Ellison – also boosted its termination fee to $7bn and expanded its financing commitments, including $45.7bn in equity.\n\n“There is a right price and wrong price for any acquisition, and the pressure is now on Paramount to prove the big financial outlay is worth it,” said Coatsworth.\n\nConcerns of editorial shifts\n\nThe proposed combination, which will still need the green light from both Warner shareholders and regulators, poses both antitrust concerns and questions of political influence.\n\nA merger between the two companies would put CNN under the same roof as CBS, which has already seen significant editorial shifts under new Skydance ownership. Paramount took steps to appeal to more conservative viewers in its news operations, notably with the installation of Free Press founder Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief of CBS News. And if the company’s takeover bid of Warner is successful, critics warn similar shifts could happen to CNN, a network that has long attracted ire from Trump.\n\n\n\n“Politics are playing an outsized role in this deal, and they’ve been on Paramount’s side from the get‑go,” said Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at Forrester, a market research company.\n\nTop Democratic lawmakers have also sounded the alarm about the Republican president’s ties to companies, such as Paramount, and potential consequences of growing corporate power.\n\n“A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a longtime antitrust hawk, said in a statement on Thursday night. She also called a potential Paramount-Warner combo an “antitrust disaster”.\n\nHow regulators will respond to a Warner-Paramount deal remains to be seen. The US Department of Justice has already initiated reviews, and other countries are expected to do so, too.\n\nWarner shareholders will have to be convinced, too. But Paramount is taking on billions of dollars in debt to finance its offer — something critics have warned could only increase the likelihood of potential job losses and other restructuring down the road. Foreign sovereign wealth funds have also provided equity for the offer, drawing added scrutiny."

Carney has previously said he wanted to more than double two-way trade with India by 2030, eyeing an annual target of $51bn.\n\nIndia, for its part, is seeking to attract more overseas investments, and says Canadian pension and wealth funds have already invested $73bn.\n\nThe energy-hungry country, which is considered the world’s fastest-growing major economy, also hopes Canada can support its ambitious plan to expand nuclear power capacity.\n\n\n\nTensions at ‘forefront of minds’\n\nDuring his trip, Carney will also need to work on resetting damaged relations between the two countries, which nosedived after deadly attacks against Sikh activists in Canada several years ago.\n\nThe administration of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Modi’s government of orchestrating the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a naturalised Canadian citizen who was part of a group advocating for an independent Sikh state called Khalistan.\n\nIndia has repeatedly dismissed the allegations, which sent diplomatic relations into freefall, with both nations expelling a string of top diplomats in 2024.\n\nAsked whether Canadian concerns about transnational repression would feature at the New Delhi talks, Foreign Minister Anita Anand told reporters: “That is always at the forefront of our minds.”\n\nAfter India, Carney will visit Australia, where he will address parliament and discuss military, trade and defence links.\n\nEn route back to Ottawa, Carney will meet Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and talk about boosting trade in cars, energy and critical minerals."

Ahmed’s wrist-spin partner Adil Rashid stepped in, however, to have Tim Seifert stumped for 35 off 25, before off-spinner Will Jacks removed Finn Allen for 29 off 19.\n\nOver to Ahmed, who picked up the wicket of Rachin Ravindra with his first ball in World Cup cricket. Glenn Phillips topped up the total with 39 off 28 before he became Jacks’ second wicket, while Rashid and Ahmed also went on to claim two scalps.\n\n“We have seen what Rehan can do in the nets, and he has gone out there and taken the game away from them,” England captain Brooks said.\n\n“We said from the start of the competition that we will select players based on conditions, and we felt today was the day to bring Rehan in – he did an amazing job.”\n\nSouth Africa has already qualified from Group 1. The second spot will be decided by the result of the match between India and the West Indies on Sunday. England will face the winner of that game in the semifinals.\n\n“We’ve already played against West Indies … both teams are very strong and powerful,” Brooks added.\n\n“We still haven’t played the perfect game, nor had the starts we would like with the bat and ball, but we have got over the line in some very tight games and in World Cups that can help you.”\n\nFor Pakistan to leapfrog New Zealand and set up a semifinal against South Africa, they must either beat Sri Lanka by roughly 65 runs or more, or chase their target down in fewer than 13 overs. Both equations will be dependent on the outcome of the first innings of the game."

The leadership change comes just a month after reports that Gottumkkala uploaded sensitive documents to ChatGPT. Gottumkkala had requested special permission to use ChatGPT, despite the AI being off-limits for other DHS employees.\n\nGottumkkala’s departure follows a downturn at CISA over the past year as the agency has been “gutted and politicized” by the Trump administration, resulting in budget cuts, layoffs, and wavering trust from local leaders. CISA is also still without a Senate-confirmed director. Trump nominated Sean Plankey for the role last year, then renominated him in January. Plankey previously served in the first Trump administration."

            "content": "is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nOn Thursday morning, I attended a Q&A panel with four top Samsung smartphone executives. Until 2025, Samsung was the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer, and by association, the world’s largest maker of cameras. It’s still the second largest after Apple.\n\nSamsung handed me the microphone first. I asked:\n\nWe see a divide in society between people who want AI to do impressive things with their photos and videos, and those who don’t want AI to do anything with photos and videos because it’s eroding our ability to believe that what we have seen is real, destroying the concept of photographic evidence. Metadata tools like C2PA have utterly failed to stem the tide. Does Samsung have any new and different ideas on how to prevent AI images from taking over the world?\n\nSamsung’s four executives did not have any new and different ideas to share.\n\nI will credit Won-Joon Choi, the mobile division’s COO and R&D chief, for not dodging the question. He told the room that the erosion of reality is a problem and he wants to fix it.\n\nBut he, and other Samsung executives, suggested that the company needs to balance the desire for photographic reality with letting smartphone buyers be “more creative.” They passed the buck by suggesting it’s an industry-wide problem, one that requires a broader conversation, and suggested that Samsung has already partially solved simply by adding a watermark to AI-generated images. A watermark that can easily be removed.\n\nGiven an opening later, an exec suggested our feelings toward AI-generated content might become more favorable in the future.\n\nHere are some of those answers.\n\n“We recognize the issue, because a lot of content is generated by AI,” Choi began. “On the one hand, people want to be more creative, so we believe we have to provide a solution so people can be more creative,” he said. “On the other hand, it’s really hard nowadays to distinguish the real photos and videos from the fake ones. I think this is a problem, we recognize that, and I think it’s a problem we have to solve at an industry level.”\n\n“The C2PA, you may view it as a failure, but it’s still enough to provide a mechanism if people want to validate that those pictures and videos are made by AI. I think we have to provide a mechanism so people can use it. I think it’s an ongoing effort throughout the industry to solve this problem,” he added.\n\n“I think if we make joint efforts to solve this problem, I believe that we should be able to do it,” he concluded.\n\nAs my colleague Jess Weatherbed wrote earlier this week, we’re starting to worry that this sort of “the industry will solve this together” rhetoric, and the C2PA itself, are substitutes for actual meaningful action.\n\nPerhaps responding to our Samsung AI slop watch reporting, Samsung America exec Dave Das also chimed in to say that the company’s still learning about how much AI is acceptable when creating its own ads. He admitted that the company has “just started utilizing some AI content in our creative, and the feedback has been pretty clear.”\n\n“We’re trying to discern what is the right place to use it, and absolutely how to be very clear about when we are using AI generated content vs naturally generated content,” Das said.\n\nBut Das still frames it as a balancing act between business priorities, not a social responsibility. “It really boils down to giving the creator choice,” he said, suggesting that Samsung’s job is to find “the right balance.”\n\nLater in the morning, KTLA-TV tech reporter Rich DeMuro felt out Samsung’s stance with a very different question. He asked whether Samsung might want to make it easier for customers to remove its AI watermark from AI-generated photos.\n\nThree screenshots taken from AI-generated Samsung ads on YouTube. More on Samsung slop watch here. Image: Samsung / The Verge\n\n“If I’m making a Christmas card with all your fun tools, do I really want that to say ‘AI-generated content?’” asked DeMuro.\n\nDrew Blackard, Samsung America’s SVP of mobile product management, took that one. He concluded by saying that “If we feel like consumers really want that ability to remove watermarks, and there are other ways to address the first point around authenticity at the same time, we’ll do both things and deliver the best of what people are wanting out of the experiences.”\n\n“At least right now, there’s enough concern from consumers around authenticity that that’s the primary thing we’ve solved for, in terms of the watermarking both in the metadata and on the photo itself. Not all services do that,” he said.\n\nBlackard also suggested we might look back one day and realize that AI-generated content isn’t such a big deal, that our perceptions might change over time, the same way perceptions changed toward user-generated content to begin with. People were concerned then with “the amount of content now flowing into the system” and how it wasn’t the professional video product they were used to, he said.\n\nI wonder if Samsung and fellow smartphone makers have considered the opposite: that perceptions of AI-generated imagery might become even less favorable after people lose their jobs in favor of cheap-to-produce AI slop, and after it becomes far easier to lie and cheat and steal in the absence of reliable recorded evidence.\n\nI wonder if they’ve considered solving this problem ”at an industry level” before they break the dam, and whether perception might turn against Samsung for helping create the flood that comes after."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nFedEx plans to pass along any refunds resulting from the Supreme Court’s ruling that some of President Donald Trump’s tariffs are “illegal.” In a statement on its website, FedEx notes that while “no refund process has been established by the courts,” the company will reimburse shippers and consumers impacted by tariffs if it gets its money back.\n\nThe delivery giant issued the statement after filing a lawsuit in the US Court of International Trade, asking the Trump administration for a “full refund” of tariff payments. Though FedEx covers the cost of duties and tariffs on a customer’s behalf when packages arrive in the US, it bills customers for the fees later on.\n\n“Our intent is straightforward: if refunds are issued to FedEx, we will issue refunds to the shippers and consumers who originally bore those charges,” FedEx says. “When that will happen and the exact process for requesting and issuing refunds will depend in part on future guidance from the government and the court.”\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court determined that the levies implemented by Trump under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) exceeded the president’s powers. Trump used this law to impose sweeping fees on imported products from China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as put “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of other countries. Days after the ruling, Trump imposed a new 10 percent tariff under the Trade Act of 1974.\n\nAlong with FedEx, over 1,000 companies, including Costco, Revlon, Bausch + Lomb, Dyson, and L’Oréal, have filed lawsuits in the US Court of International Trade in an attempt to recoup the funds that went toward Trump’s tariffs, according to NBC News and CBS."

            "content": "When Amazon first showed off its redesigned Fire TV OS at CES, we were impressed. It’s faster, better organized, and feels similar to Google’s top-notch TV interface. The update is now finally rolling out to the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, making it an even better buy now that it’s on sale for $29.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target — $5 shy of its best price to date. If you want something cheaper and don’t mind waiting for the update to arrive, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Select is also on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, for $19.99 ($20 off), which is $2 more than its all-time low price.\n\nThe new Fire TV OS update makes navigating content even easier, adding tabs across the top for search, home, movies, TV shows, sports, news, and live content that pull recommendations from all of your subscriptions. Your apps now live on their own row, and you can pin up to 20 favorites instead of just six. You also get support for Alexa Plus, letting you search for specific types of content with your voice, jump to particular scenes, control compatible smart home devices, check sports scores, and more. The update also improves the remote, with a long press of the Home button opening a panel so you can quickly adjust audio or check on devices like Ring cameras.\n\nRelated Alexa Plus on the TV is made to save you from your phone\n\nThe Fire TV Stick 4K Plus is also a good streaming device on the hardware front. The middle child in the Fire TV stick lineup, it offers half the storage of the $40 Fire TV Stick 4K, but otherwise shares support for HDR10 Plus, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos. You also get an Alexa Voice Remote included, for quick access to apps and voice controls. For most people, it offers a good balance between features and price.\n\nWe’d recommend the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus overall, but if you just want a cheap and basic 4K streaming stick — maybe one for a second or third TV — the standard Fire TV Stick 4K is hard to ignore at $20. The redesigned Fire TV OS has yet to roll out to the stick, and it has half the RAM so it’s slower. It also lacks Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support, but it still supports HDR10, HDR10 Plus, and Alexa Plus while including an Alexa Voice Remote. You also get access to all the major streaming services, while Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can stream select games from the cloud as they can on Amazon’s other sticks."

Anthropic’s rivals OpenAI and xAI have reportedly agreed to the new terms, but even after a White House meeting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei is still refusing to cross his company’s red line, stating that “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.”"

There are also deals on gaming accessories like totes, controllers, and more. Through February 27th at 11:58PM CT, you can score an additional 20 percent off products looped into this sale by entering the code LEVEL20 at checkout (it caps at $30 total off your order).\n\nEveryone’s tastes are different, but some picks in this sale that especially vibe with me include Silent Hill F, which is fun and very different beast from Bloober Team’s Silent Hill 2 remake (less item hunting, more countering enemy attacks). Of course, who can argue against the pure fun contained within the Super Mario Galaxy double-pack for Switch that includes the original title and its sequel? It’s always cliché to say that there’s something for everyone here, but I think it’s actually true this time.\n\nMore deals and discounts\n\nGovee’s Pendant Light might just be the ticket. This height-adjustable smart light makes for a fun upgrade in your home, and it’s now selling at its lowest price yet at Sometimes, a rug or table can pull the room together.

It can go between 2700K and 6500K color temperatures, and it’s Matter-compatible so it ties in neatly with plenty of smart home ecosystems.\n\nSkullcandy Dime 3 earbuds , which are just $19.88 at There is always a new set of wireless earbuds to consider. Companies launching in the $200 or so price range have their work cut out for them because there are already well-established leaders, but it’s another story for the sub-$50 models. Despite the low price, they can be mighty impressive. An example of that is the, which are just $19.88 at Amazon Walmart , and Best Buy (originally $34.99) in multiple color schemes. This price has been available for much of this month, but in case the right time to buy for you is now, these offer up to 20 hours of battery life thanks to their lanyard-equipped charging case.

            "content": "is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nIt’s the day of the Pentagon’s looming ultimatum for Anthropic: allow the US military unchecked access to its technology, including for mass surveillance and fully autonomous lethal weapons, or potentially be designated a “supply chain risk” and potentially lose hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts. Amid the intensifying public statements and threats, tech workers across the industry are looking at their own companies’ government and military contracts wondering what kind of future they’re helping to build.\n\nWhile the Department of Defense has spent weeks negotiating with Anthropic over removing its guardrails, including allowing the US military to use Anthropic’s AI kill targets with no human oversight, OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to such terms, although OpenAI is reportedly attempting to adopt the same red lines in the agreements as Anthropic. The overall situation has left employees at some companies with defense contracts feeling betrayed. “When I joined the tech industry, I thought tech was about making people’s lives easier,” an Amazon Web Services employee told The Verge, “but now it seems like it’s all about making it easier to surveil and deport and kill people.”\n\nIn conversations with The Verge, current and former employees from OpenAI, xAI, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google expressed similar feelings about the changing moral landscape of their companies. Organized groups representing 700,000 tech workers at Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and more have signed a letter demanding that the companies reject the Pentagon’s demands. But many saw little chance of their employers — whether they’re directly embroiled in this conflict or not — questioning the government or pushing back.\n\n“From their perspective, they’d love to keep making money and not have to talk about it,” said a software engineer from Microsoft.\n\nSo far, Anthropic has stood its ground. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei put out a statement on Thursday that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” But he has stated that he is not at all opposed to lethal autonomous weapons sometime in the future, just that the technology was not reliable enough “today.” Amodei even offered to partner with the DoD on “R&D to improve the reliability of these systems, but they have not accepted this offer,” he wrote in the statement.\n\nIn the past few years, however, major tech companies have loosened their rules or changed their mission statements to expand into lucrative government or military contracts. In 2024, OpenAI removed a ban on “military and warfare” use cases from its terms of service; after that, it signed a deal with autonomous weapons maker Anduril and then its DoD contract, and just this week, Anthropic changed its oft-touted responsible scaling policy, dropping its longtime safety pledge in order to ensure it stayed competitive in the AI race. Big Tech players like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have also allowed defense and intelligence agencies to use their AI products, including some agreeing to work with ICE despite growing outcry from the public and employees alike.\n\nIn past years, tech workers’ resistance to partnerships and deals they deem harmful to society at large sometimes led to big change. In 2018, for instance, thousands of Google employees successfully pressured the company to end its “Project Maven” partnership with the Pentagon, and Microsoft workers presented leadership with an anti-ICE petition signed by about 500 Microsoft employees, though Microsoft still works with the agency. In 2020, after the murder of George Floyd, tech companies made public statements about and financial commitments supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. But in recent months, the industry has seen a very different reality: a culture of fear and silence, especially amid cooperation with the Trump administration and ICE, tech workers recently told The Verge.\n\nCompanies have followed in the footsteps of longtime surveillance and military tech partnerships, who have only become more hawkish. That includes the Peter Thiel-cofounded Palantir, whose CEO Alex Karp recently stated to shareholders that “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world, and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them. And we hope you’re in favor of that.” (Protect Democracy, a nonprofit, recently put out an open letter calling for Congressional oversight of the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted use of AI. )\n\nOpenAI, Google, Microsoft, xAI, and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA former xAI employee told The Verge, “Everyone is actually working on killer robots at this point,” adding that he believes everyone will follow in the footsteps of Palantir, Anduril, and xAI, since the government sentiment is that if a company doesn’t acquiesce, it’s “against the benefits of the country, in a sense.” He said there’s a “big push for working with the military, and the trend is it’s cool to do it… You’re a patriot if you do it.”\n\nA Google employee called the situation a “dominance display from Hegseth that is disgusting.” He added, “Over and over AI is presenting us with choices about who we want to be and what kind of society and future we want to have. And they’re coming at us fast and with, really, the least thoughtful and least principled leaders in power that we could imagine. I can only thank Anthropic for insisting on the decent path and using their leverage — that they are indispensable — to chart a course toward a humane world and a humane future.”\n\nThe AWS employee told The Verge that “boundaries have definitely eroded in terms of the customers big tech is willing to court” and that there’s “a deliberate whitewashing of the implications of new lucrative deals.” She recalled recently receiving an email from an AWS executive touting a more than $580 million contract with the US Air Force, among other partnerships, as a sign of Amazon’s AI successes, with no acknowledgment of the broader scope or harms involved.\n\n“If the government is hell-bent on pursuing technologies like this, they should have to build them themselves, and be answerable for those decisions,” she said.\n\nThe erosion may have extended to internal culture as well — normalizing the idea that companies should always be watching. The AWS employee said that she and her colleagues are tracked on how much they’re using AI for their jobs, how often they’re working from the office, and more. “I can see myself and my coworkers getting more desensitized to surveillance on ourselves at work, and I’m worried that means we’re obeying, complying, and giving up too much in advance,” she said.\n\nAn OpenAI employee said the general feeling within the AI industry over the last few weeks “has reopened the door to more discussion… about the values and the future of the technology.” The employee said that the Pentagon-Anthropic situation, the recent ICE headlines, and the fast advancement of AI have been some of the main factors opening up those discussions internally.\n\nEven so, people who are immigrants or in more vulnerable positions are more afraid to speak, the OpenAI employee said.\n\nAnthropic, the former xAI employee said, seems like it’s in a position where it can say no and still stay afloat. Its focus on enterprise rather than consumer AI business may make it more sustainable even without government contracts, offering it some leverage. A software engineer at Microsoft said of Anthropic, speaking generally, “I was surprised to see them stand on some form of principle. I don’t know how long it’ll last.”\n\n“Will it last?” seems to be the question on everyone’s lips. The Pentagon has already reportedly asked two major defense contractors, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to provide information about their reliance on Anthropic’s Claude, as it moves to potentially designate Anthropic a “supply chain risk,” a classification usually reserved for threats to national security and rarely, if ever, assigned to a US company. It also reportedly may be considering invoking the Defense Production Act to attempt to force Anthropic to comply with its request.\n\nJust like with any other AI company, if Anthropic folds, the Microsoft employee said, there’s little chance of it or others pulling back on killer robots and surveillance. “Once you’re in the door with the Department of Defense or whatever we’re calling it now… I think it’s probably hard for them to actually have the oversight they claim. It’s just going to be lucrative to basically give themselves permission to do the thing that makes the most money.”\n\nIn Microsoft’s own case, he said he doesn’t expect the company to adhere to any sort of ethical principles. The company has worked extensively with the Israeli Defense Forces, including for mass surveillance of Palestinians and dissidents, despite employee protest. (It said it ended some parts of the partnership last year.)\n\nAnother Microsoft employee told The Verge that although “Microsoft holds a Responsible AI ‘commitment,’… they are currently attempting to play both sides for the sake of profit rather than meaningfully commitment to Responsible AI.”\n\nBut this is nothing new, one AI startup employee said. In her eyes, the boundaries have often been “fuzzy, especially within AI,” about what kinds of things companies are willing to let their technology power. “A lot of it has been going on beneath the surface for as long as AI has been around.”\n\nThe AWS employee emphasized that “we need cross-tech solidarity and a coherent, worker-led vision for AI now more than ever.”\n\n“The safeguards that Anthropic is trying to keep in place are no mass surveillance of Americans and no fully autonomous weapons, which just means that they want a human in the loop if the machine is going to kill somebody,” she added. “Even if this technology were perfect — which it isn’t — I think most Americans don’t want machines that kill people without human oversight running around in an America that’s become an AI-powered mass surveillance state.”"

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThe US military mistakenly shot down a drone belonging to Customs and Border Protection near the Mexican border in Fort Hancock, Texas, according to reports from Reuters and The New York Times. The Thursday incident reportedly led the Federal Aviation Administration to close the airspace where the military fired the anti-drone laser.\n\nThis marks the second time this month that officials closed airspace near the US-Mexico border due to an incident involving an anti-drone laser. On February 11th, officials closed airspace around the El Paso International Airport for hours after CBP fired an anti-drone laser without coordinating with the FAA, The New York Times reported at the time. Though Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement that the FAA and Department of War moved to “address a cartel drone incursion,” it reportedly turned out to be a party balloon.\n\nNow, the FAA, CBP, and the Pentagon tell Reuters that the military “employed counter-unmanned aircraft system authorities to mitigate a seemingly threatening unmanned aerial system operating within military airspace,” adding that the incident “took place far away from populated areas and there were no commercial aircraft in the vicinity.” This most recent incident reportedly led to a smaller airspace closure and was also done without approval from the FAA, the Times reports.\n\nIn a joint statement, Reps. Bennie Thompson (D-MS), André Carson (D-IN), and Rick Larsen (D-WA) — the top Democrats on committees overseeing homeland security, aviation, and transportation — expressed outrage over the incident. “We said MONTHS ago that the White House’s decision to sidestep a bipartisan, tri-committee bill to appropriately train C-UAS [Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems] operators and address the lack of coordination between the Pentagon, DHS and the FAA was a short-sighted idea,” the statement says. “Now, we’re seeing the result of its incompetence.”"

At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.\n\nSuno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\n\nStill, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more."

It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.\n\nTechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in example workflows on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial, or legal data; creating analysis; and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations.\n\nPerplexity invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company cancelled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.\n\nThis tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.\n\nThe company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base—in the tens of millions of users—pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nNow, Perplexity executives say they are aiming for a more boutique set of users, with products that serve people making “GDP-moving decisions.” Executives in the briefing, who asked not to be identified by name, described prioritizing enterprise subscriptions, particularly for deep research.\n\n“You don’t hear us talk about MAUs ever, because we’re not actually on a mission to get as many users as possible,” one executive said.\n\nPerplexity recently released a new benchmark for complex research tasks, called Draco, where (no surprise) its own deep research offering beats out competitors like Gemini.\n\nPerplexity says it is no longer reliant on other companies’ APIs for its web index and now has its own AI-optimized search API. But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.\n\n“Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done by Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.\n\nA visualization of model usage by Perplexity users over time. Image Credits:Perplexity\n\nIf one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open-source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.\n\nThe company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear.\n\nStill, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on users fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.\n\nAnd there is more coming: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers’ conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.\n\nOne executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.\n\nHowever, the execs at the briefing dismisses such complaints. “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” an executive said."

            "content": "A new set of main series Pokémon games is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2027, marking the 10th installment in the series.\n\nIn a livestream celebrating the release of the first Pokémon games exactly 30 years ago, the company unveiled Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves, open-world games set across a vast ocean of islands.\n\nThe three new starter Pokémon were announced as well: Browt, a Grass type “bean chick” that looks like an Angry Bird; Pombon, a Pomeranian-inspired Fire type who better not evolve into a bipedal man; and Gecqua, a Water type gecko with big pink eyes.\n\nImage Credits:The Pokémon Company\n\nLeakers have rumored that the new games are set in a region inspired by Indonesia and Southeast Asia — while the trailer doesn’t explicitly confirm this, it makes a good case for proving the rumors correct, showing us lush jungles, seaside mountains, tropical towns, and even underwater reefs. Fans have also honed in on a suspicious-looking cloud in the trailer, which looks like a Gyarados-slash-Lapras flying through the sky — perhaps it’s a nod to a new legendary Pokémon?\n\nPokémon already explored a tropical island vibe in the Hawaii-inspired “Sun and Moon” games, which came out nearly 10 years ago, but there’s still a ton to explore in that sort of setting, especially now that the franchise is embracing open-world maps. Not all tropical archipelagos are alike!\n\nMain series Pokémon games usually get released in November, which would mean that we have almost two years to wait before we can explore this new region … but hopefully we’ll be surprised. It already seems like forever ago since Pokémon Scarlet and Violet came out in 2022. But when that game came out, fans criticized it for feeling rushed and being rife with glitches. So if a later release date means we’ll get something incredible, I’m happy to wait.\n\nIn the meantime, Pokémon fans can buy reissues of the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen games today for the Switch … but they cost $20. It’s too bad that there isn’t an extremely easy and legally dubious way to get those games on your phone for free."

            "content": "Anthropic has reached a stalemate with the United States Department of War over the military’s request for unrestricted access to the AI company’s technology. But as the Pentagon’s Friday afternoon deadline for Anthropic’s compliance approaches, more than 300 Google employees and over 60 OpenAI employees have signed an open letter urging the leaders of their companies to support Anthropic and refuse this unilateral use.\n\nSpecifically, Anthropic stood in opposition to the use of AI for domestic mass surveillance and autonomous weaponry. The open letter’s signatories seek to encourage their employers to “put aside their differences and stand together” to uphold the boundaries Anthropic has asserted.\n\n“They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,” the letter says. “That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.”\n\nThe letter specifically calls on executives at Google and OpenAI to maintain Anthropic’s red lines against mass surveillance and fully automated weaponry. “We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War’s current demands.”\n\nLeaders at the companies have not yet formally reponded to the letter. TechCrunch has reached out to Google and OpenAI for comment.\n\nHowever, informal statements suggest both companies are sympathetic to Anthropic’s side of the case. In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he doesn’t “personally think the Pentagon should be threatening DPA against these companies.” According to a CNN reporter, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that the company shares Anthropic’s red lines against autonomous weapons and mass surveillance.\n\nAgreed.

Now the agency has replaced its top acting leader, a CISA spokesperson tells TechCrunch.\n\nThe move to replace Madhu Gottumukkala as the acting director of CISA, an agency under the Department of Homeland Security that oversees cybersecurity and technical protection across the federal government, comes after a tumultuous year serving as the agency’s top boss.\n\nGottumukkala struggled to lead the agency during his tenure as acting director and caused security headaches, including the uploading of sensitive government documents to ChatGPT, according to reports. Staffing at the agency was slashed by one-third. Gottumukkala also reportedly failed a counterintelligence polygraph he took in order to view classified documents, and suspended several career officials in response, including the agency’s then-chief security officer.\n\nBefore being nominated to CISA as deputy director, Gottumukkala was chief technology officer of South Dakota under then-governor and current Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.\n\nABC News was first to report Gottumukkala’s departure.\n\nIn a statement shared with TechCrunch on Friday, CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy claimed Gottumukkala had done a “remarkable job.” McCarthy told TechCrunch that Nick Andersen will replace Gottumukkala as CISA’s new acting director, and that Gottumukkala has been moved to a new position as director of strategic implementation in the Department of Homeland Security, which houses CISA.\n\nPrior to his appointment as acting director to lead CISA, Andersen served as the agency’s top official overseeing its cybersecurity division.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Ron Wyden last year blocked Plankey’s nomination until the agency agreed to release an unclassified report allegedly describing cybersecurity flaws at phone and telecommunication giants. Wyden demanded the report’s release in the wake of hundreds of hacks targeting U.S. and international phone and internet providers by the China-backed hacking group known as Salt Typhoon. The Senate has yet to schedule Plankey’s nomination hearing.\n\nNextgov reported Thursday that CISA lost another top senior official, Bob Costello, the agency’s chief information officer tasked with overseeing the agency’s IT systems and data policies. The news outlet reported Gottumukkala tried to transfer Costello but was blocked by unnamed political appointees.\n\nCISA’s spokesperson McCarthy did not address Costello’s departure when asked by TechCrunch, but did not dispute the report."

            "content": "Spotify is launching Audiobook Charts for the U.S. and U.K., the company announced on Friday. Similar to the streaming giant’s Music and Podcast Charts, the Audiobook Charts will be updated weekly and highlight the top audiobooks overall and by genre. These rankings are based on listening behavior and engagement on the streaming service, the company says.\n\nThe new charts are accessible to both free and paying users within the audiobooks hub. You can find them by tapping the search button in the app and selecting the “Audiobooks” tile to enter the hub. Then, you need to scroll down to the “Dive deeper” section to find the charts.\n\nThe move marks Spotify’s latest investment in the audiobooks space, following its official support of the format in 2022.\n\nSince then, Spotify has continued investing in audiobooks with additional features like the recently launched “Page Match” tool, which lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook, and “Audiobook Recaps,” which are short audio summaries to catch you up on what you’ve already read so far.\n\nSpotify says the new Audiobook Charts will benefit both readers and authors by giving listeners a trusted way to discover popular titles, while also creating new opportunities for authors and the publishing industry to reach wider audiences.\n\n“As we’ve proven with Music and Podcasts Charts, when content is easier to access, discover, and enjoy, the demand grows,” said Duncan Bruce, Spotify’s director of Audiobook Partnerships and Licensing, in the blog post. “We are delighted to now bring that to audiobooks, to help provide even more ways for users, publishers, and authors to discover what’s trending on Spotify, and make books more connected with culture in real time.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that Spotify isn’t only interested in audiobooks, as the streaming giant also recently ventured into physical book sales. Spotify announced earlier this month that users in the U.S. and the U.K. will soon be able to purchase physical copies of books directly within the app through a partnership with Bookshop.org."

A looming Paramount Skydance merger with Warner Bros. Discovery would expand their empire even further.\n\nNow that Netflix has backed out of its bid to acquire WBD, the Ellisons stand to gain an entirely new trove of significant intellectual property, from DC Comics to Harry Potter. As part of the deal, the Ellison Trust is committing to $45.7 billion in equity and a $7 billion termination fee if federal regulators don’t approve of it, according to Reuters.\n\nParamount’s merger with Skydance has already brought about mass layoffs, including at CBS News, where Free Press founder Bari Weiss is leading a cultural overhaul as editor-in-chief. In January, Oracle became a partial owner of TikTok, giving the Ellisons even more cultural currency.\n\nHere’s everything the family would control if the WBD deal goes through.\n\nCBS and CBS News\n\nBesides its news division, which includes 60 Minutes, CBS is also home to hits like Tracker and Matlock, along with reality stalwarts Survivor and Big Brother.\n\nHBO and HBO Max\n\nAmong the most Emmy-winningest networks to exist, HBO’s library includes classics like Game of Thrones, The Wire, and Veep, as well as newer hits like The Pitt, The Gilded Age, and Thrones spinoff A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. (Outside of Canada, HBO Max is also a key distributor of hockey smut drama Heated Rivalry.)\n\nCNN\n\nWhile CNN’s ratings dipped last year, it remains a news juggernaut and a top 5 cable network, featuring household names like John King, Kaitlan Collins, and Anderson Cooper (who recently announced he will be leaving 60 Minutes at the end of the current season).\n\nDC Comics\n\nThe merger would put Paramount Skydance in control of storied comic book franchises like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nThe wizarding world of Harry Potter, including all eight fantasy films and the upcoming HBO television series slated to premiere in 2027 would also be under the Ellisons’ purview.\n\nTikTok\n\nAs of a deal finalized in January, Oracle now holds a 15 percent stake in TikTok’s US operations.\n\nStar Trek\n\nAll 13 Star Trek movies and television shows are owned by Paramount Skydance. At a press event last year, Dana Goldberg, cochair of Paramount Pictures and chair of Paramount Television, said the franchise would be a “priority across the company.”\n\nWarner Bros. Studios\n\nHome to blockbusters like Barbie, The Dark Knight, and more recently, One Battle After Another, and Sinners.\n\nComedy Central\n\nSouth Park announced a five-year, $1.5 billion deal with Paramount last July, just prior to the merger with Skydance. The show has since skewered Donald Trump and those in his administration regularly.\n\nAvatar Studios\n\nIn December, Paramount+ announced it would be the exclusive streamer of Avatar Studios content, including animated film The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender and series Avatar: Seven Havens.\n\nA Bunch of Cable Channels and Networks\n\nThe Food Network, HGTV, Discovery, TLC, OWN, Adult Swim, Showtime, TNT, and TBS are all part of WBD.\n\nOther Key Franchises\n\nOther notable titles that are or would be controlled by the Ellisons, pending the WBD takeover include: The Lord of the Rings franchise, the Mission Impossible franchise, and the distribution rights to Dune: Part Three."

            "content": "Before last week the name Alap Shah didn’t ring a bell for many people. The 45-year-old financial analyst and tech entrepreneur had spent the past two decades working in relative obscurity. Then last weekend he coauthored a blog with the research firm Citrini titled “The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis.” It was a “thought exercise” about the impacts of artificial intelligence, and it predicted that in June of that year, AI would jack up unemployment past 10 percent and force the Dow down, down, down. Writing in a confident, Nostradamic tone—as if auditioning for starring roles in the next Michael Lewis book—the authors painted a picture of a flywheel in reverse: AI agents take jobs from workers, people spend less, and struggling corporations conduct layoffs on top of layoffs.\n\nThere wasn’t much in it that hadn’t been previously heard, or speculated about. Tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have already estimated that half the entry level white collar jobs will soon be gone, and earlier this year, Anthropic’s release of new agentic tools spurred a Wall Street selloff. Nonetheless the report hit with the force of the blizzard blowing through lower Manhattan. When the closing chimes sounded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow was down 800 points. The name Alap Shah was now ringing bells.\n\nThe achievement is less impressive than it seems. Wall Street, like the rest of us, is in a persistent state of anxiety about AI, and it doesn’t take much to trigger a mini-panic. Financial markets don’t necessarily map to reality, but the jitters reflect a wider disquiet. The AI future is in a William Gibson zone—it’s here, but unevenly distributed—and the news from those already living in the agent-packed, AI code-writing universe is both exciting and unsettling. Emphasis on unsettling.\n\nNo one—no one!—knows exactly how AI will impact the economy, but clearly it will be significant. Right now stocks are soaring, so it seems to make sense to keep the party going. But then along comes the latest doom manifesto, or a paper indicating that a traditional business sector might be threatened by AI, and suddenly money managers are reminded that the biggest issue of our time is totally unresolved. Case in point: earlier this month, a tiny company (valuation under $6 million) that had previously sold karaoke machines pivoted to AI-powered shipping logistics and put out a report saying that it had discovered some efficiencies in loading semi-trucks. That was enough to erase billions of dollars from the share prices of several major logistics companies, none of which had karaoke experience.\n\nAfter it did its job on Wall Street, the Citrini report came under considerable fire. Critics climbed over each other to proclaim its flimsiness. For one thing, they pointed out, AI has had very little discernable impact on the economy so far. Others cited the long history of resilience after technological upheavals. A mocking response by the respected trading firm Citadel Securities read, “For AI to produce a sustained negative demand shock, the economy must see a material acceleration in adoption, experience near-total labor substitution, no fiscal response, negligible investment absorption, and unconstrained scaling of compute.”\n\nThe most withering critiques disputed the report’s contention that much of the economy involves non-productive “rent-seeking” by middlemen and market makers, taking advantage of the laziness of the general population. When everyone has a few dozen AI agents working on their behalf, writes Shah, consumers will be able to effortlessly find the best goods for the best prices. Apps will be rendered unnecessary—just type what you want into the LLM and an army of agents will do everything for you. The “poster child” for this phenomenon, Shah says, is DoorDash. Instead of being limited to the restaurants on the app, consumers will send out AI agents to find their ideal meal options, contracting directly with restaurants and delivery people—no apps needed. Zero friction! The DoorDashes of the world are avocado toast!"

            "content": "Belt-drive bikes offer some huge upsides. First, they usually require less maintenance, with many belts often lasting twice as long as a typical chain. Second, there’s no grease to speak of, and therefore, no black smudges on your work pants. Third, in the case of the Soltera 3, the belt comes from the Gates brand, whose drivetrain belts are as good as it gets. Belt-drive bikes are silent and often smoother than their chain-driven counterparts.\n\nThat said, the inclusion of a low-maintenance element such as a belt drive paired with hydraulic disc brakes, which require bleeding roughly every year, struck me as an odd choice. If Aventon wanted to make the Soltera 3 as hands-off as possible, cable-actuated brakes would have been a more intuitive choice.\n\nThe other thing that immediately jumps out about the Soltera 3 is its relatively light weight. At 37 pounds, the Soltera 3 is heavy for an analog bike. But it’s certainly not heavy for an ebike, and it’s nearly as stiff, nimble, and navigable as a conventional bicycle. One issue I’ve always had with ebikes is their heft. Given that they’re often made to replace a car, they’re built with load bearing in mind. Also, ebike batteries are heavy.\n\nAdding to that sense of “this is just like my other bikes,” the Soltera 3 simply looks cool, which is often not the case when it comes to ebikes. The matte black my tester bike arrived in looks cool because matte black almost never doesn’t look cool. (Additionally, the Soltera 3 is available in dark matte blue and a sleek silver.) But beyond the finish, the bike’s geometry; its wide, almost perfectly flat handlebars; and its narrow (by ebike standards) 700 x 36 tires make it feel closer in DNA to a road bike than a traditional ebike.\n\nButton Press\n\nPhotograph: Michael Venutolo-Mantovani\n\nI’m 6′4′′, and the extra large Soltera 3 that I tested was at a maximum saddle height. It was suitable for me, but I couldn’t recommend anyone bigger than me riding the Soltera 3. That said, with four sizes ranging from small to extra large, the line covers a wide swath of riders, ranging from my height all the way down to 5′ tall."

There's even a notable AI app available for podcasts too. It’s called Huxe.\n\nAt the core of Huxe is a daily brief, a sort of personal productivity podcast tailored to your tastes and requirements, generated from the sources you pick. Connect up your calendar and email account, and every morning you get a quick audio summary to get you set for the day. The idea is that a 15-minute audio podcast can replace the much longer amount of time you'd otherwise spend trying to figure out what's happening with your inbox and your schedule.\n\nThe audio emphasis of Huxe is no surprise, as the team behind the app previously worked on Google NotebookLM, a research tool that has its own podcast-style Audio Overviews feature. Huxe is similar, but it draws information from your emails and calendar entries.\n\nThere's more to Huxe as well, including audio deep dives on any topic of your choice, as well as news summaries. The app is completely free to use right now, and you can sign up through the apps for Android or iOS.\n\nGetting Started\n\nRegistering interests with Huxe. Photograph: David Nield\n\nTo start taking advantage of Huxe’s personalized audio production powers, you need to tell it a little bit about yourself. As you work through the setup process, which includes supplying an email address and your name, you'll be prompted to connect your email and calendar accounts. (Google and Outlook accounts are both supported.)\n\nYou'll also be asked to choose a few topics that you're interested in from a list, generated by what's in your inbox and on your schedule—click Edit to make changes, and Add to add interests that Huxe hasn't picked up on yet. You can specify pretty much any topic you like, and Huxe will understand what you mean.\n\nWhen you get into the app proper, you are introduced to what are called livecasts, which are like radio stations for AI-generated speech content: For me, these livecasts have titles such as Big Tech Roundup, Today in AI, and Product Drops, which gives you some idea of what to expect.

            "content": "Blood pressure is simultaneously the least exciting yet one of the most important vital signs that a fitness tracker can measure. Unlike a pedometer or sports watch, it’s not going to incentivize you to get active. Unlike a continuous glucose monitor, it’s not going to help you lose weight. A gigantic blood pressure cuff isn’t exactly a gorgeous or enticing accessory to wear. In fact, getting your arm squeezed so tight can be downright claustrophobic.\n\nBut there’s a reason why blood pressure is one of the first tests you get at the doctor’s office. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is one of the top killers in the United States. It can result in conditions like heart attacks or strokes. There are usually no symptoms; hypertension is called “the silent killer” for a reason. Nearly one in three people worldwide has it. And unlike diseases like cancer, we already have simple, readily available tools to treat it, like exercise and reducing the amount of salt that you eat.\n\nLast year, a few fitness trackers debuted hypertension notifications in their suite of features—most notably, the Apple Watch. Unlike the Apple Watch, the Aktiia Hilo band does not merely notify you when you have signs of hypertension. It monitors your blood pressure up to 25 times a day, 24 hours a day. Aktiia reached out to me for testing when it launched; WIRED is the first in the United States to test it. This device could change many lives for the better when it goes on sale in the US later this year. (It's available now in some countries.)\n\nLight and Sound\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nThe Aktiia Hilo comes in two parts—the slim, cuffless band you wear every day and a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuff you use to calibrate the device every month or so. Both have to be connected to the Hilo app (iOS, Android). Once both are connected, the app will remind you to abstain from alcohol, caffeine, and exercise for at least 30 minutes beforehand and to sit and relax with your back supported for at least five minutes."

            "content": "When Netflix dropped the first season of Love Is Blind in February 2020, it offered a reprieve from the washboard abs that normally seem like a casting requirement for reality TV shows.\n\nThe premise—that couples get engaged “sight unseen” after talking to each other through pods, then, following a big reveal, decide if they want to get married—featured just the right amount of mess. Who can forget Jessica allowing her dog to sip wine or an insulted Carlton throwing his fiancee's engagement ring into a pool? Meanwhile Lauren and Cameron's unvarnished conversations highlighted the awkwardness that sometimes accompanies interracial dating.\n\nIt was a reality show, but it seemed like a format that could actually allow people to fall in love without getting bogged down in superficial distractions and expectations. Maybe.\n\nNow in its 10th season, Love Is Blind is a cornerstone of Netflix’s reality TV cinematic universe. But while each cycle brings us standout women who earnestly buy into the show’s original conceit, it’s getting tougher to find any men to root for.\n\nWith the latest US season featuring Chris Fusco, who voluntarily compares himself to Andrew Tate and derides a fellow male cast member for being “submissive,” and Alex Henderson, a Trump-loving crypto bro with an ever-shifting backstory, increasingly the men of Love Is Blind seem to have been plucked straight from the manosphere.\n\nSeason after season, the women on the show (and viewers at home) are subjected to men who make shallow, body-shaming comments, struggle with anger and emotional regulation, and sometimes appear uncomfortable with their partner’s success.\n\nWhile race still comes up, it’s often in a superficial and offensive way. Contestants either find themselves struggling with the fact that their match is a person of color, or dealing with unaddressed internalized racism that downplays their own worth while prioritizing whiteness in a partner—a worthwhile topic that deserves far more nuance or a therapist’s involvement.\n\nBroadly, Love Is Blind seems to be pushing conservative ideals—trad wives, divorce shaming, and big families even when contestants clearly aren’t enthusiastic about the idea of having kids.\n\nKinetic Content, which produces Love Is Blind, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen 28-year-old Emma Betsinger of the current Ohio season discusses the scars on her arms—a result of surgeries due to her birthmarks—with podmate Steven Sunday, a 32-year-old who works in finance, he grills her about how she lost her virginity instead of asking thoughtful questions. Betsinger’s health issues have made her hesitant to have children, but instead of taking her at her word, the men she dates stress that she would make a great mother.\n\nThen there’s fast-talking Henderson, 31, who, despite not having a job besides the day trading he claims to do, expects his fiancée Ashley Carpenter, a 34-year-old claims manager, to pack up and move to either Arizona or Florida, her possible promotion be damned. Carpenter’s dad, a MAGA “patriarch,” barely lets his wife speak during the family’s meeting with Henderson and later touts his own daughter’s attractiveness as being “dyn-o-mite.”\n\nAt a time when women are outpacing men in obtaining college degrees and are narrowing the pay gap in some cities, some of the guys in Love Is Blind’s recent seasons also seem to react poorly to having high-achieving partners.\n\nLast year in Denver, Jordan Keltner couldn’t seem to move past his insecurities around fiancée Megan Walerius’ wealth, ultimately leading to their breakup after he said he was too “tired” to have conversations with her after work or keep up with her rich-person hobbies. This season, Fusco, a 33-year-old account executive, gets a tour of his doctor fiancée Jessica Barrett's multi-bedroom Ohio home and later demeans her for not going to pilates every day. “I don't care if she’s a neurosurgeon or if she’s a goddamn $100-million trust fund,\" he says, while complaining about their lack of sexual chemistry before spending a chunk of time trying to convince already-engaged contestant Bri McNess that she needs a “dominant” man like him."

            "content": "In late December, the 21st to be exact, my friends Amos and Clara called me 17 times. On December 22 it was eight times. The calls were short—sometimes only 30 to 45 seconds, and they usually arrived when I was doing something important: working, grocery shopping, napping. “Hi Anna,” one or both of them would say. “Hi!” I’d respond. Sometimes I worried that I sounded too eager, or like I was just sitting around waiting for their call. Sometimes I felt a little pathetic.\n\nIf anyone else called me that often I’d block their number. But Amos is 6 years old, and Clara is 9, and what happened is that on December 20, for Hanukkah, the siblings got the gift of a newly released, extremely old-school kids’ phone. And for the next week or so, the two of them couldn’t stop calling. And I, for one, couldn’t stop picking up.\n\nCalled the Tin Can, the phone came out last April and has since sold more than 100,000 units without much paid advertising. It’s basically a “dumb phone” that makes and receives calls over a Wi-Fi network—a landline without the line. It has no screen, not even a tiny one to show who’s calling; its surface has only buttons, a receiver, and a speaker. The product is marketed to parents who want to encourage their children to communicate without giving them access to web browsers and social media. (One user on X suggested, jokingly, that children start writing chain letters next.)\n\nThe standard Tin Can, which comes in four colorways and costs $100, looks like a candy-colored soup can. A “retro” model called The Flashback appears nearly identical to an old-school cradle phone and also retails at $100. Calls between Tin Cans are free, but the company charges $10 a month for users to call outside the Tin Can network. Parents get to set the rules—they add numbers to an approved caller list, and only calls to and from those numbers go through, and only in preset time frames, say, between 8 am and 8 pm. Parents can also monitor call logs. Call it spying with the implied consent of the spied upon; an electronic surveillance state in miniature.\n\nSome parents have tried to solve the problem of intrusive screens by buying their kids smartwatches; others opt for typical dumb phones. But these products are more about letting adults keep tabs on where their kids are at any given moment. The Tin Can is more about getting kids to focus on using their voices to communicate.\n\nAnd that’s about it. Tin Cans don’t show you missed calls or support text messaging. In an era in which most everyone is being nudged toward addictive, screen-based, endless-scroll engagement, giving kids the opportunity to get lost in conversation can seem incredibly appealing to parents."

            "content": "Hair loss isn’t always dramatic. It can be incremental. You start noticing a bit more scalp in harsh bathroom lighting; a tiny bald spot when you tie your hair up in a ponytail. The shower drain is more clogged than usual. Not long ago, hair loss treatments meant topical remedies, supplements, or a flight to Turkey. Luckily, red light therapy brings the potential for hair regrowth into your home—no clinical appointment required.\n\nBeyond skin rejuvenation, research suggests red light therapy can help energize hair follicles, increase blood circulation in the scalp, reduce inflammation, and lower dihydrotestosterone levels—a hormone that causes hair loss and thinning. Red light therapy also supports adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, which helps provide oxygen and blood flow to the scalp and triggers follicles to remain in the hair growth phase.\n\nTo determine the best red light therapy for hair growth, I tapped three WIRED tech reviewers who've dealt with hair loss themselves. We assessed red light therapy caps, hands-free helmets with full scalp coverage, and low-level laser therapy or photobiomodulation devices for 16 weeks. Along the way, we reviewed the research, spoke with dermatologists, and tracked ease of use. These are the favorites that produced meaningful results and earned our trust.\n\nBe sure to check out our other hair care guides, including Best Dry Shampoos, Best Heat Protectant Sprays, and Best Hair Dryers.\n\nBest Red Light Helmet\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet $860 CurrentBody WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Simple device with only one button and a charging port\n\nBluetooth-enabled so you can listen to your own tunes during treatment\n\nComes with a stand for easy storage\n\nObserved new hair on scalp after 12-ish weeks TIRED Need to use daily for at least four months to achieve results, and use regularly (nearly every day) for maintenance\n\nEven the smallest helmet size is large\n\nBuffer cups can snag and pull hair during helmet removal\n\nEar cups can be somewhat difficult to adjust while worn\n\nCurrentBody's LED Hair Growth Helmet is a wearable, cord-free, Bluetooth-enabled device aimed at improving hair’s density, thickness, and overall condition. Each panel on the helmet has 12 red lights (120 total), which are on a spectrum of 620 to 660 nanometers (nm). The 620-nm red light helps improve scalp health by promoting circulation, and the 660-nm red light penetrates deeper, reaching through the epidermis and dermis to the hypodermis, where it stimulates growth and repair at the follicle root. According to CurrentBody, you only need to use the device for 10 minutes a day, and you’ll see results within 12 weeks.\n\nMy hair grows famously slow. I got a pixie cut in the spring of 2011, and my hair did not touch my shoulders until the end of 2013. My hair is also super fine. It tangles easily and often breaks off (my ends are chronically dry and split). After 12 weeks, I didn’t notice a huge difference in length (and I got a haircut halfway through testing), but I did notice that my hair seemed to be sprouting new follicles along my scalp and sideburn area in particular. I started to see small baby hairs along my hairline that I had never seen before. My stylist commented that my hair felt thicker, and I noticed less breakage and hair caught in bristles when brushing. My balding roommate also tested it (although not daily like me) and said that his hair felt thicker and that there was new growth around the scalp.\n\nThe helmet comes in two sizes: medium for a skull circumference of 21.3 to 23.2 inches, or large, for 23.3 to 25 inches. (I opted for medium, and it was too large for my head size.) The device sits on a base and is charged via a USB-C cord. It takes about three hours to fully charge, and it stays on a single charge for about a week. The device is powered on by the press of the single button located under the charging port. The circular earmuffs protect sensitive ears with a cushy, removable faux leather cloth, and they can be adjusted several inches up or down to ensure a comfortable fit. The screen on the right earmuff indicates the time left in the treatment session, and the helmet automatically turns off when the 10 minutes are up. You can also connect the device to Bluetooth and play any type of music or video while wearing it, because God forbid I be left alone with my thoughts for 10 minutes a day. Just make sure your hair is clean and dry before use.\n\nMy only complaints are that the ear covers aren’t the easiest to adjust while wearing and would oftentimes pull out my hair while I removed or adjusted the helmet. Nevertheless, this is the best red light therapy for hair growth. Just you wait, I’ll look like Fabio on the cover of a romance novel by next year. See full review here. —Molly Higgins"

Now, for the 30th anniversary of Pokemon, Nintendo and the Pokemon Group are selling a collectible music player that looks like a tiny Game Boy and plays authentic original Pokemon Red/Blue songs on swappable cartridges, one per song.\n\nThe Game Boy Jukebox is being sold on the Pokemon Center site for a whopping $70. It's so small, it uses button batteries.\n\nThis level of absurdity is standard issue for Nintendo: Just in the last 18 months, we've had Alarmo, a talking Super Mario flower and a Virtual Boy recreation. This new collectible is so tempting precisely because it looks like a little, even more pocketable Game Boy. Except it isn't a Game Boy at all. It's just a music player. Even the dot-matrix \"screen\" is fake -- it's just an overlay that the cartridges display when they're slotted in.\n\nThe music this thing plays is Game Boy-accurate, down to the little boot-up ping. It just makes my skin itch for a new Game Boy (one that isn't already made by several other companies).\n\nBut come on. Make a real Game Boy collectible with preloaded games. One that plays Pokemon Classic games and Tetris and more. You know you want to, Nintendo. It's only a matter of time.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're desperate for all 45 Pokemon Red and Blue songs on a little Game Boy music player, now's your chance."

Below, you'll find a batch of can't-miss films and a look at new releases for the month. If you're still trying to figure out if HBO Max is right for you, skim our review of the Warner Bros. Discovery streamer.\n\nNew releases for February\n\nNote: These descriptions are taken from HBO Max statements and official websites for the films. They've been lightly edited for style.\n\nFeb. 6\n\nBoys Go to Jupiter (2024): Adult animated film. A teenager in suburban Florida desperately hustles to make $5,000 in this dreamy and surreal coming-of-age story.\n\nFeb. 20\n\nDead of Winter (2025): Psychological thriller. A grief-stricken loner (Emma Thompson) caught in a blizzard discovers a young woman imprisoned, forcing this unlikely hero into a dangerous fight for her and the victim's survival.\n\nFeb. 27\n\nChris Fleming: Live at the Palace (2026): Comedy special. Fleming bursts onto the screen with a fun and lighthearted blend of skillful storytelling and wild physicality in his first HBO stand-up special.\n\nThe best movies to watch\n\n\n\nThe films below include notable new releases and blockbusters, HBO and HBO Max originals, and Warner Bros. films made exclusively for HBO Max.\n\nDrama\n\nWarner Bros. One Battle After Another (2025) One Battle After Another won best musical or comedy film at the Golden Globes and is up for best picture at the Oscars, so it's worth noting that HBO Max is showing this collab between Paul Thomas Anderson and Leonardo DiCaprio. The political thriller introduces DiCaprio's character as part of a revolutionary group, the French 75. When the film finds him 16 years later, living off the grid with his teenage daughter and facing a threat from his past, the action doesn't let up.\n\nA24 Sing Sing (2024) Sing Sing is a subtle and impactful prison drama starring Colman Domingo -- who earned a 2025 best actor Oscar nomination for his role -- and formerly incarcerated actors. Domingo plays Divine G, who acts in a theater group while imprisoned at Sing Sing Correctional Facility. The film will surprise and uplift you.\n\nWarner Bros. Juror #2 (2024) Nicholas Hoult, J.K. Simmons and Toni Collette are in the cast of this absorbing, haunting Clint Eastwood courtroom drama. Hoult stars as Justin Kemp, who faces a moral dilemma after getting called for jury duty. He must decide whether to disclose information that would change the outcome of the high-profile trial and impact his own life. A well-acted, well-paced flick that will get you thinking.\n\nHBO Max Turtles All the Way Down (2024) Don't usually dabble in the young adult genre? You shouldn't let that keep you from taking in Turtles All the Way Down, based on a 2017 novel of the same name by John Green. The film stars Isabela Merced (The Last of Us, Alien: Romulus) as a teen who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety. With elements of romance and a captivating performance from Merced, this straight-to-streaming movie deserves more attention.\n\nWarnerMedia The Fallout (2022) After a shooting occurs at her high school, 16-year-old Vada Cavell must navigate friendships, school and her relationship with her family. The Fallout skillfully approaches serious subject matter with realistic dialogue and compassion for its characters. With strong performances from stars Jenna Ortega as Vada and Maddie Ziegler as her new friend Mia Reed, the feature will keep you glued to the screen for the entirety of its 90-minute runtime.\n\nWarner Bros. Dune (2021) and Dune: Part Two (2024) Remember 2021, when Warner Bros. movies hit HBO Max on the same day they premiered in theaters? That exciting period may be over but at least we'll always have the memory of watching Denis Villeneuve's spectacular sci-fi epic at home and still being part of the conversation. Both parts of Dune are now streaming on HBO Max.\n\nHBO Bad Education (2019) Based on a magazine article by journalist Robert Kolker, this tale about a public school embezzlement scandal and the student journalists who broke the news is captivating from start to finish. Allison Janney and Hugh Jackman are great in their roles as the school officials who took part in the scheme. The drama also won the 2020 Emmy award for Outstanding Television Movie.\n\nThriller\n\nWarner Bros. Kimi (2022) Steven Soderbergh directs this engaging tech thriller set during the COVID-19 pandemic. Angela, a Seattle tech worker played by a neon blue-haired Zoë Kravitz, has agoraphobia, a fear that prevents her from making it past the front door of her apartment. But when she uncovers an unsettling recording while doing her job, she's pushed to make the leap. Kimi is a stylish thriller complete with eye-catching cinematography, a solid score and a protagonist you'll be rooting for.\n\nHBO Max No Sudden Move (2021) A movie from Steven Soderbergh, the great director behind Erin Brockovich, Ocean's Eleven and, more recently, Logan Lucky? Twists, thrills and desperate characters populate this crime thriller set in 1950s Detroit. When a seemingly simple job gets out of hand, a group of criminals must work together to uncover what's really going on. Take in the incredible cast: Don Cheadle, Benicio del Toro, David Harbour, Jon Hamm and Amy Seimetz. While the plot can be a little convoluted and some won't be able to get past the fish-eye lens cinematography, Soderbergh's sense of humor and immersive direction make this crime caper an entertaining night in.\n\nComedy\n\nHBO Max Am I OK? (2022) This comedy-drama follows Dakota Johnson's character, 32-year-old Lucy, who tells her longtime best friend Jane that she likes women. But there's more for Lucy to navigate as that friend, played by House of the Dragon's Sonoya Mizuno, is moving far away to London. If you enjoy stories about late blooming and female friendships, it's no question -- you should check out the funny, touching Am I OK?\n\nWarner Bros. Father of the Bride (2022) HBO Max's Father of the Bride introduces a Cuban American family that includes patriarch Billy, a traditional guy who struggles to digest surprising news from his eldest daughter: She's met a guy, and she wants to marry and move away with him. The third film adaptation of a 1949 novel of the same name by Edward Streeter, the movie is an enjoyable iteration that includes stars like Andy Garcia and singer Gloria Estefan.\n\nHBO Max Let Them All Talk (2020) Meryl Streep playing an eccentric author in a Steven Soderbergh comedy. What more do you need to know? If you do want to know more: Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Alice Hughes (Streep) is struggling to finish her next book, chased by her literary agent (Gemma Chan). She boards a cruise ship with old friends, who inspired her best-known work. Tensions are strong. It looks great -- Soderbergh uses crisp, natural light -- and most of the dialogue is improvised. See how Dianne Wiest, Candice Bergen, Lucas Hedges and the rest of the impeccable cast have fun with that.\n\nSuperhero\n\nJessica Miglio/Warner Bros. Superman (2025) James Gunn's superhero epic doesn't go the origin story route, instead introducing audiences to David Corenswet's Man of Steel when Earth is already familiar with the caped hero. More specifically, the movie opens with a battered Superman having lost a battle for the first time. Nicholas Hoult plays the ever-plotting villain Lex Luthor, Rachel Brosnahan stars as reporter Lois Lane and Krypto the unruly Superdog is a chaotic addition to this charming and compelling action outing.\n\nWarner Bros. The Batman (2022) Robert Pattinson steps out as Batman in this moody superhero flick directed by Matt Reeves. The movie takes place in a perpetually gray and rain-soaked Gotham City, where Bruce Wayne starts to seek out a murderer with an affinity for riddles. Along the way, he meets Catwoman, played by a swaggering Zoë Kravitz. Catch up on the dark and satisfying mystery before you watch the HBO spinoff series, The Penguin.\n\nWarner Bros. The Suicide Squad (2021) Over-the-top violence abounds in this DC film about supervillains who agree to help the US government in exchange for some time off their prison sentences. Their mission is to destroy something alluded to as Project Starfish, harbored in the fictional island country of Corto Maltese. With a notable cast that includes Margot Robbie, Idris Elba and John Cena, 2021's The Suicide Squad is a wickedly entertaining, darkly funny bloodbath that differs from what you usually see in superhero movies. (Peacemaker, a spin-off TV series, is also available on HBO Max.)\n\nMusical\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Wonka (2023) Dune's Timothée Chalamet stars in this prequel to Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and it's a total treat. With new and familiar tunes, a committed cast and oodles and oodles of whimsy, the film allows audiences to get to know a young Willy Wonka with giraffe-sized ambition and undeniable chocolate-making skill. It's a quirky, comforting flick from Paddington director Paul King that you'll absolutely want on your plate.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures The Color Purple (2023) This movie musical version of The Color Purple is adapted from Alice Walker's 1982 novel and the Broadway play. Set in the early 1900s, the film tells the story of Celie, a Black woman living in the South who faces multiple hardships but is able to find strength in the bonds in her life. The cast includes Fantasia Barrino, Taraji P. Henson, Colman Domingo, Halle Bailey and Danielle Brooks, who received a 2023 Oscar nomination for her role as Celie's daughter-in-law, Sofia.\n\nAction and adventure\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Mickey 17 (2025) Mickey 17 comes from acclaimed director Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer, Parasite) and stars Robert Pattinson as Mickey Barnes. Barnes escapes Earth for another planet by applying to be an \"expendable.\" The role subjects him to deadly missions and experiments, with his body reprinted each time he doesn't make it. Black humor, heart, eccentricity and great performances are all on display. Even if the film doesn't surpass any of Bong's earlier works, it deservedly makes it on this list.\n\nJanus Films Flow (2024) Winner of Best Animated Feature at the 2025 Oscars, this wordless Latvian film follows a black cat after a great flood devastates his home. The brave feline bands together with a capybara, a lemur, a bird and a dog in a stunning and thought-provoking film that will appeal to adults and kids alike.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024) This thrilling prequel to the 2015 movie Mad Max: Fury Road stars Anya Taylor-Joy (The Queen's Gambit, The Menu) as a younger version of Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa. Life takes a turn for the protagonist when she finds herself in the Wasteland rather than the Green Place of Many Mothers. The resourceful heroine fights for survival, facing off with villains such as the warlord Dementus, played by Chris Hemsworth. Visually striking and intense, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is chock-full of postapocalyptic action, and you won't want to miss a minute.\n\nStudio Ghibli The Boy and the Heron (2023) Who can pass up a Studio Ghibli film? Hayao Miyazaki came out of retirement to make The Boy and the Heron, which won the award for best animated feature at the 2024 Oscars. The starry English voice cast includes Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Robert Pattinson and Florence Pugh.\n\nJaap Buitendijk/Warner Bros. Barbie (2023) Unless you've been living in Barbie Land (or another place that isn't the real world), chances are you're very familiar with this pink-coated comedy already. The flick -- Warner Bros.' highest-grossing global release of all time -- brings a long list of stars together for a hilarious and heartfelt adventure. Greta Gerwig directs, Margot Robbie plays the titular role and Ryan Gosling belts out an incredible power ballad as Ken.\n\nDocumentary\n\nHBO All That Breathes (2022) This captivating documentary is filled with images that will stick with you. It centers on two brothers in New Delhi who run a bird hospital dedicated to black kites -- birds of prey that are a staple of the sky. It was a contender for best documentary feature at the 2023 Oscars.\n\nHBO Max Tony Hawk: Until the Wheels Fall Off (2022) Tune into this HBO doc for the gravity-defying skateboard stunts, a time capsule of the '80s skateboarding scene, and a version of Hawk you've probably never seen. We get to know the renowned athlete as a lanky, stubborn but determined kid who adopted his own skateboarding style. Hawk's persistence is something to marvel at, along with all the stunning skateboard moves this film packs in. Hang on for a memorable ride.\n\nCNN/Focus Features Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain (2021) This film about beloved author, chef and globe-traveling TV host Anthony Bourdain comes from documentary filmmaker Morgan Neville, who also directed 2018's Won't You Be My Neighbor? and the Oscar-winning film Twenty Feet from Stardom. In interviews with people who knew Bourdain, like his friends, former partners and longtime colleagues, the doc tracks his career path, relationships and personal struggles. Fans and those less acquainted with the late star will likely appreciate this two-hour look at his life."

            "content": "The Clicks Communicator created a buzz after its CES reveal, with its focus on offering a communications-forward Android phone that looks like a BlackBerry, complete with a physical keyboard, prioritizing messaging and typing over everything else. It turns out the keyboard phone may have made a bigger splash than anyone realized. Clicks will offer multiple versions of the Communicator, each with a keyboard that supports a different language, in response to the overwhelming demand for the unreleased phone.\n\nThe company is expanding the Communicator to include models with keyboard layouts for Arabic, French (AZERTY), German (QWERTZ) and Korean. Clicks said interest in the Communicator was higher than the company expected, especially globally.\n\nIt's clear there are still plenty of people who yearn for compelling, straightforward devices with smartly designed hardware that aim to make texting and writing easier. The timing of Click's news strikes a stark juxtaposition, coming just days after Samsung launched its Galaxy S26 series, which features updates heavily steeped in AI.\n\nHere is the Clicks Communicator in Smoke with a keyboard for Korean. Clicks/CNET\n\n\"The response from customers around the world sends a strong signal that Communicator fills a gap for a phone purpose-built for communicating and taking action,\" Clicks CEO Adrian Li Mow Ching said in a press release.\n\nBut there's more good news ahead of MWC if you're interested in getting a Clicks Communicator. The early-bird window to reserve one now runs through March 15. The phone costs $499, but an early reservation gets you a $100 discount and, when paid in full, a bundle of the phone and two additional back covers.\n\nClicks also shared that the phone will have a Dimensity 8300 chip (MT8883), which is in phones like the Xiaomi Poco X6 Pro. The MT8883 lets the company offer OS updates to the Communicator through Android 20 and five years of security updates.\n\nI'm definitely excited to see where Clicks is headed with the Communicator, but should note that we've yet to see a working version of the phone. The Clicks Communicator will be available in Smoke, Clover and Onyx. Reservations are open, and people can select their preferred keyboard layout closer to when the phone ships later this year."

            "content": "Smart locks are a highly visible part of your home that you'll use just about every day, so it's important to find a reliable pick that meshes well with your smart home. Here are the factors you should be thinking about as you shop.\n\nA retrofit smart lock like the August lock will replace the interior of your current lock but not the exterior keyhole or the deadbolt. CNET\n\nFull deadbolt or retrofit\n\nMost smart locks will replace your existing lock, including the interior thumbturn, the exterior keyhole and the deadbolt in the middle. Locks like those will also come with their keys, replacing the ones you use now.\n\nOthers, like the August Smart Lock, and the Lockly fingerprint model, are designed instead to work with at least some of your existing lock hardware. With a retrofit lock like that, you probably won't need new keys and might not even need to swap out the deadbolt. Locks like those can sometimes be a better fit for apartments, where the building owners might not allow you to replace the entire lock.\n\nYale's smart lock can work with the Nest video doorbell. Yale\n\nModes of access\n\nDifferent smart locks will take different approaches to letting you in. On a basic level, most smart locks will let you lock and unlock the door wirelessly from your phone, using an app. Others add in keypads for coded entry, which can help you rely on your keys a little less while also making it easier to share access with others. Some lock add fingerprint or palm scanning to let you inside with biometrics. There are also keypad and NFC options, even face scanning in some cases.\n\nApple has also added a Home Key feature in iOS15 that lets you store a digital house key in your Apple Wallet, which lets you open compatible smart locks using the NFC radio in your iPhone or Apple Watch. Many other brands have followed suit with digital passes that guests can download on their phones with the right apps.\n\nSo, what's right for you? Going into an app for door access isn't ideal unless you are controlling it remotely. That's why we like Bluetooth and NFC passes that can work with a wave of your phone, as well as fingerprint sensors and similar options that are keyed to individuals and work at a touch at any time. But a keypad has its advantages as well, since it allows for temporary code handouts or limited-time access without someone needing their phone or a specific app to use.\n\nThe Schlage Encode Plus is the first smart lock to support Apple Home Key. It lets you unlock your door using an iPhone or Apple Watch. Schlage\n\nPlatform compatibility and Matter\n\nIf your household includes multiple types of smart home devices, then your best bet is to control them all from a single smart home platform. That way, you won't need to juggle multiple apps to keep everything automated. The most popular picks are Amazon Alexa, the Google Home app and the Google Assistant voice controls that come with it, and Apple HomeKit, which brings Siri into play. Samsung SmartThings is another option for a hub-centric smart home.\n\nThat brings us to Matter. Matter (and its tagalong communication protocol Thread) is an important smart home protocol designed in coordination with major brands, including Google, Amazon, Apple, and many others. It helps guarantee compatibility across different platforms and adds extra security and data transfer benefits, which buyers should definitely be watching for.\n\nCurrently, smart lock companies are still adopting the Matter standard. Our top pick uses it and is one of the best options we've found. Schlage has begun to adopt the standard for locks like its upcoming Schlage Sense Pro, but it hasn't made its way to our Schlage Smart Lever pick quite yet, and the same goes for Yale Assure. Brands like Aqara are now including built-in Matter support with their latest locks. August has also announced it's working to bring Matter to its smart locks, so in some cases, it just be a \"matter\" of waiting for the right firmware update.\n\nAqara's lock comes with many unlocking options and gets even more features if you plug in a hub. Aqara\n\nSecurity and privacy\n\nSmart locks aren't quite as data-sensitive as devices with built-in cameras and microphones, but you'll still want to make sure that you're keeping things secure. Most, if not all of your options will use some form of encryption to keep the wireless transmissions between your lock and your phone or home network secure. You should also look for locks that use two-factor authentication to keep your account safe from malicious logins. As with any connected device in your home, you'll want to be sure to keep your lock updated to the latest firmware and to set a strong password in the app.\n\nAs for lockpicking and other physical concerns, you can look for the lock's ANSI grade to get a sense of its durability, and how well it might stand up against a brute-force entry attack. ANSI grade 3 is the most basic rating, but a growing number of smart locks offer ANSI grade 2 or grade 1 ratings, which tell you that they're built with commercial-grade durability. If you're concerned about forced entries, a lock like that might be a good investment.\n\nLockin's Veno Pro 7 components John Carlsen/CNET\n\nDesign considerations\n\nYour smart lock is going to sit right on the front of your home's exterior, so it's worth aiming for something you won't hate looking at. Some smart locks go out of their way to show off their gadgety features with light-up touchscreens, color-coded LED indicator lights and tech-minded designs. Others take the opposite approach, doing their best to blend in and look just like a standard lock, from the outside at least. Picking a preference between the two approaches will help you narrow your options.\n\nYou'll also want to consider how the lock stays powered. Most smart locks will run off four AA batteries, but some take a different approach. The minimalistic Level Lock +, for instance, runs off two AA batteries that sits inside of the deadbolt itself to keep things extra compact. Meanwhile, Eufy's touchscreen smart lock runs off of a rechargeable battery pack.\n\nWi-Fi\n\nWi-Fi support has now become common for smart locks, but it's important to look at the details. Some locks don't have built-in Wi-Fi, but only support it if you buy an additional hub."

            "content": "Pokemon Winds and Waves, the first mainline games in the series to come to the Nintendo Switch 2, were announced on Friday, the franchise's 30th anniversary, on a special Pokemon Presents livestream. They will be released in 2027 exclusively on the Switch 2.\n\nFollowing the precedent set by Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, the new games seem to be set in a fully explorable open world. The new playable region is scattered across multiple islands, with wide swaths of ocean between them.\n\nThe distinct split between water and land harkens back to cherished gameplay mechanics from third-generation Pokemon games Ruby and Sapphire, which were first released in Japan in 2002.\n\nAs tradition dictates, we got our first look at the three new starter Pokemon, which are powerful pals that serve as the player's first partner in an unfamiliar new place.\n\nThe grass-type starter, Browt, is a chickadee with a head that's bulbous enough to invoke the Brain. The water-type, Gecqua, is a quadrupedal gecko with a cool attitude. And the fire-type starter, Pombon, is a super cute orange pup with a mane that eclipses its body. (I suspect Pombon will quickly become a fan favorite.)\n\nFan-favorite Pokemon from previous games were also shown off. Pikachu, Tympole, Wailord, Tropius and Frillish are in the cast of monsters to be caught in the next mainline Pokemon games, among other older creatures. Many of the returning Pokemon seem to fit into the island theme, residing in volcanic caves (where we saw Slugma), marshy swamps (Carnivine) and underwater coves (Lumineon).\n\nIt's been four years since the last mainline Pokemon games -- Pokemon Scarlet and Violet -- were released for the Nintendo Switch.\n\nWhile those games were lauded by some fans for their open world and more freeform approach to telling a Pokemon story, they were held back by poor performance and game-breaking bugs on Nintendo's first hybrid console. Pokemon Winds and Waves -- games built for, and exclusive to, the more powerful Switch 2 hardware -- need to fare better when it comes to in-game performance.\n\nPokemon Winds and Waves may be the first traditional Pokemon games for the Switch 2, but they aren't the first ventures into the world of pocket monsters for the new console. The recently released Pokemon Legends: Z-A introduced a whole new battling system, moving away from the turn-based mechanics the franchise has been known for since 1996. Pokemon Pokopia, an Animal Crossing-style game that will be released next month, is also primed to bring pocket monsters to cozy gaming spaces.\n\nNintendo also announced that the upcoming, competition-focused Pokemon Champions will be released on the Switch in April and is coming to mobile devices later this year.\n\nThese games will have to tide fans over until they can dive into the watery world of Pokemon Winds and Waves next year."

Pokemon Day is chock-full of free goodies and exciting game reveals for creature-collecting fans across the world, and this stream didn't disappoint.\n\nWhile the beginning of February's Pokemon Presents focused primarily on the plethora of pocket monster mobile games, like Pokemon Go and Pokemon TCG Pocket, we also learned about quite a few new games. The presentation culminated in the reveal of Pokemon Winds and Waves, the gen-10 mainline games and the first Pokemon games to be developed exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nHere's everything The Pokemon Company announced for 2026 and beyond during its first Pokemon Presents stream of the year. Whether you're looking to relive old games for the first time or dive into a brand-new generation of pocket monsters, there's something for every Pokemon fan to get excited about right now.\n\nBrowt, Pombon and Gecqua are the newest partner Pokemon. The Pokemon Company/Screenshot by CNET\n\nPokemon Winds and Waves\n\nThe first mainline Pokemon games developed exclusively for the Switch 2 have been revealed. Pokemon Winds and Waves are the gen-10 Pokemon games, and they take place in a new region full of volcanic crags, murky swamplands and lots of water.\n\nWe got our first look at the partner Pokemon -- Browt, Pombon and Gecqua -- but no other new Pokemon made their debut in this trailer. Keep your eyes peeled for additional information about new pocket monster species and box art legendaries in the coming months.\n\nPokemon Winds and Waves will be released in 2027. Expect our sibling site IGN to score these ones 7.8/10.\n\nDifferent generational mechanics clash in Pokemon Champions. Nintendo\n\nPokemon Champions gets a release date... sort of\n\nPokemon Champions, the competitive battling game that was revealed during the July 2025 Pokemon Presents, made a notable appearance in the latest stream. While we still don't know the exact date Pokemon Champions will become publicly available, we know it will be released for the Switch and Switch 2 sometime during April. The game will also come out on mobile devices later this year.\n\nPokemon Champions aims to standardize competitive Pokemon battling by unifying the gimmicks from all nine generations of mainline Pokemon games -- including Mega evolutions, Dynamax Pokemon, and Terastallization -- into a single format. Players will be able to transfer their favorite Pokemon from the mainline games to Pokemon Champions in order to battle one another, with cross-platform play supported between Switch and mobile devices.\n\nI could've sworn that this shadow Lugia was intimidating in 2005. The Pokemon Company/Screenshot by CNET\n\nPokemon XD: Gale of Darkness for Switch 2\n\nIt's an oldie but a goodie. Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, the game that introduced the awe-inspiring corrupted Lugia back in 2005, will be released exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 Online + Expansion Pack subscribers in March. Gale of Darkness is fondly remembered as a challenging title with plenty of fan-favorite shadow Pokemon forms, so it'll be good to have this nostalgic classic on the current generation of Nintendo hardware.\n\nA Pokemon music collection in Game Boy form? Yes. Nintendo\n\nGame Boy Jukebox featuring music from Pokemon Red and Blue\n\nThe Game Boy Advance is back. Well, not really, but a very small jukebox taking the form of the beloved handheld console will be released today. This initial Game Boy Jukebox collection comes with 45 different cartridges -- each one plays a classic chiptune song from Pokemon Red and Blue, the original gen-1 Pokemon games from 30 years ago.\n\nI think 45 different cartridges might be a little bit of overkill, but it's certainly authentic to the old console experience. It remains to be seen whether more classic GBA games will get their own chiptune cartridges for the Game Boy Jukebox. There are no pricing details for the device yet.\n\nLegendary Pokemon cards from previous runs are likely to return in a new legacy expansion set. The Pokemon Company/Screenshot by CNET\n\nA mysterious new TCG collection\n\nThe scalping will continue until morale improves. The next trading card game collection (which was teased but not named during the Pokemon Presents stream) is designed to celebrate 30 years of Pokemon's legacy.\n\nSeveral cards from different generations of the Pokemon TCG were shown off, revamped and revitalized to receive play in 2026. Notable inclusions were Pikachu and Charizard from the original base set, Palkia, Darkrai and Azelf from the Diamond and Pearl sets and the Pikachu and Zekrom tag team card from 2019. This mystery set seems to be bringing back the greatest hits -- assuming you're able to find packs in stores anywhere near you.\n\nHow to watch the Pokemon Day presentation video\n\nThe Pokemon Company is responsible for the Pokemon Presents livestreams, so the livestream aired on its YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Instagram accounts. If you want to watch the VOD and catch up on all of the latest Pokemon news for yourself, I've embedded The Pokemon Company's video of every announcement above, or you can view the announcement on any of its social media channels."

            "content": "Peloton announced today that it’s launching its first 12-week Hyrox Training Program to help members prepare for the race. Peloton previously hinted at this program when it launched its new cross-training equipment line in October.\n\nThis training program is intended to coincide with the Hyrox NYC race taking place from May 28 to May 31, and from June 4 to June 7. Hyrox has become increasingly popular among hybrid athletes (those who do strength and cardio workouts), and Peloton is leaning in to support competitive fitness athletes looking to try something new or challenge themselves.\n\nWhat is Hyrox?\n\nPeloton instructors, Andy Speer and Adrian Williams participating at a Hyrox competition. Peloton\n\nHyrox is known for its challenging courses that include eight functional workout stations and running 1 kilometer (a little over half a mile) eight times. Some people join teams, while others go at it alone. Regardless of how you sign up, it requires preparation and strategy to succeed.\n\n“This program will train your engine… train your strength, and you will train your mind to stay sharp when fatigue hits,” said Robin Arzón, Peloton head instructor and vice president of fitness programming, and a certified Hyrox performance coach. In a statement, she said that the program’s goal is to do more than just get you through the race. “We are building you to own it.”\n\nWhat Peloton Hyrox workouts will look like\n\nRobin Arzón will be one of the instructors teaching the Peloton Hyrox Training Program. Peloton\n\nIf you \n\nAerobic Power: Teaches athletes how to manage effort and build endurance.\n\nSimple Tools, High Impact: Learn how to develop hybrid endurance.\n\nEfficiency Over Speed: Use smart pacing and conserve energy during the course.\n\nProgressive Volume: Train through cumulative fatigue and intentional loading.\n\nPerformance Drivers: Recover and fuel properly during a training cycle.\n\nMembers will get to train for this race through Peloton classes they already enjoy, such as Tread bootcamps, strength, rowing and mobility/stretching. The first six weeks of the cross-training program will focus on building up your aerobic capacity and establishing threshold control.\n\nFor the second half, athletes will go through a 75-minute simulation of the race to test out pacing and transition skills. The final weeks will add another challenge by focusing on “real demand” training, which will have heavy sled pushes, wall balls and a run.\n\nThe program is designed to be customizable, whether you’re a Hyrox newbie or an experienced athlete. You’ll learn the mechanics and how to transition between stations, and get used to your race weights based on where you are in your plan.\n\nCoaches you can expect to see teaching these classes include Robin Arzón, Andy Speer, Ash Pryor, Adrian Williams, Logan Aldridge, Chelsea Jackson Roberts, Joslyn Thompson Rule and Alex Karwoski.\n\nPeloton’s Hyrox Training Program is now available on the Peloton app and hardware. You can also connect with other community members training for a Hyrox through the Official Hyrox Training Team on the Peloton app."
