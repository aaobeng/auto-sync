The Gunners remain firmly positioned at the top of the table, holding a four-point advantage over rivals Manchester City.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, Pep Guardiola's outfit have a game in hand and could narrow the deficit to merely one point with victory away to Leeds United on Saturday evening.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThroughout recent campaigns, Arsenal supporters have become familiar with topping the league only to surrender the title during the final stretch.

I don't think too many of their players get into this Arsenal side.\"\n\nAcross the remainder of March, there's a journey to mid-table Brighton followed by a home encounter with Everton - two match-ups that Parlour thinks Arsenal will achieve maximum points from. He suggested the \"safe\" nature of the Seagulls' league standing removes them as a threat and when addressing the Toffees, he added: \"You've got to have that as a win.\"\n\nView 3 Images The Gunners are closing in on the title (Image: David Price, Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA home meeting with Bournemouth in April is earmarked as another victory for the Gunners before a crucial showdown a week afterwards with title contenders City at the Etihad Stadium.

Should they advance, they'll play one of Bodo/Glimt or Sporting Lisbon in the quarter-finals.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTheir semi-final opponent would be either Tottenham, Newcastle, Barcelona or Atletico Madrid. Thanks to finishing first in the Champions League table, Arsenal will have home advantage in each second leg.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAll that is why data company Opta have given Mikel Arteta's side the best percentage chance of lifting the trophy in May.

            "content": "Fernando Mendoza - the potential No 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft - says the opportunity to be mentored by Tom Brady if he is selected by the Las Vegas Raiders would be \"fantastic\".\n\nThe former Indiana Hoosiers quarterback was attending the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis on Friday after a National Championship-winning season in college that has made him the hot favourite to be taken by the Raiders with the top selection.\n\nLas Vegas have one of the more intriguing quarterback situations in the NFL, as seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Brady became a minority owner in 2024.\n\nAlthough Brady is not directly involved in coaching, the Raiders haven't had a young, potential face of the franchise in the past two years for Brady to mentor. That is expected to change if the franchise invest a high NFL Draft pick in a quarterback.\n\nWhile Brady was not present in Indianapolis, 22-year-old Mendoza said they had spoken on the phone briefly, and was asked what he would think of working with the NFL legend.\n\nImage: Tom Brady is a minority owner for the Las Vegas Raiders and would be expected to help develop a young quarterback\n\nHe said: \"Yeah, I mean, who hasn't admired Tom Brady? I mean, more Super Bowl rings than anybody ... anybody!\n\n\"So, that opportunity would be fantastic.\n\n\"Brady, I believe, is the greatest quarterback of all time - by a wide margin - and to be able to have the opportunity to be mentored by him would mean so much.\n\n\"Especially to learn, and I'm all about learning. So from day one, I've got to learn a lot.\n\n\"It's going to be a long journey, and to potentially have a mentor like that, it would be pretty impressive and pretty meaningful.\"\n\nImage: Mendoza was a winner in college but will likely begin his NFL career on one of the worst teams in the league\n\nMendoza revealed that he had a \"great\" meeting with the Raiders, who appointed Super Bowl-winning Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak as their head coach earlier this month as they look to rebuild after a fourth straight losing season.\n\nAlthough he admitted there's no guarantee he will end up in Las Vegas after April's event in Pittsburgh, Mendoza was enthused about his meeting with the team.\n\n\"It was a fantastic interview,\" he said.\n\n\"The coaching staff were in there. We went over some of my previous plays and drew some plays on the board.\n\n\"I thought it was a great meeting, and I know they have the prospective No 1 pick, but anything can happen in the draft. I'm just excited for the opportunity.\n\n\"Whatever team drafts me, I'm just going to give everything I have to them.\""

He's had more runs than I've had hot dinners this year. This will be his seventh start of the season. He is backing up after running at Newcastle last week but he clearly takes his racing well.

If he's bounced out of the race alright, with Jamie Neild taking 7lbs off he has got a handicapping chance.\"\n\nKate Tracey\n\n\"Vincenzo is a standout for me, he looks as if he's got so much more to come. Last time out at Ascot he won by two lengths from Bad. It was a messy race overall but it was really good form in terms of talented horses and a testament to him that he can still produce this kind of effort, sticking to his task really well after hitting the front at the last.\n\n\"He's only been given a 2lb rise for that and I thought that was very fair and he could be even better going back left-handed, which suits him really well. I hope he's got plenty more mileage in his mark.\"\n\nSam Boswell\n\n\"The good news about Heltenham, if you like him like I do, is he loves it around Newbury. He's had one bad run from about six efforts, with three wins and a second to his name. His second was on seasonal reappearance this year against Twinjets. He got beaten by 10 lengths but there's a stone in favour today in favour of Heltenham, which is a massive plus point.\n\n\"I know we don't get the services of Harry Skelton but these are the types of races they're winning en route to a championship and Heltenham is going to be a massive plus point through the spring. He obviously went up against Jonbon last time, which was effectively a run to get round - he managed that.\n\n\"I do hope going back to his favoured Newbury will bring out the best in him. Charlie Todd has ridden the horse before to reasonably good effect when finishing third. We're a double digit price and he's an each-way play, I don't know why he won't be all out to take a really valuable prize.\"\n\nWatch Weekend Winners in full on the At The Races YouTube channel..."

Two years on from a dramatic penalty shoot-out win against Lille in the Conference League, the two sides meet again.\n\nPantomime villain Emiliano Martinez starred on that day, saving the decisive penalty after avoiding a red card midway through the shoot-out, despite receiving his second booking of the game.\n\nTrademark celebrations soon followed as he soaked up the animosity from the French crowd. That, coupled with his antics from the World Cup triumph with Argentina over France, could create quite the cauldron at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy when he returns.\n\nImage: Emi Martinez celebrates Aston Villa's ECL victory over Lille in 2024\n\nVilla will be tasked with replicating the same success over two legs to continue their quest to end their 30-year wait for a trophy and if they do achieve that, the drama won't stop there.\n\nA meeting with Roma and on-loan striker Donyell Malen could then await, should they be successful in the tie against Bologna. UEFA rules state no team can influence what line-up their opponent selects and that would allow Malen to face off against his parent club in a bid to dump them out of the competition.\n\nPorto, Nottingham Forest, Midtjylland and Stuttgart make up the rest of that side of the bracket. Villa were undoubtedly handed a harder route to glory; the storylines running alongside it just add to the drama.\n\nHome advantage in second legs for seeded teams\n\nThe top eight teams from the league phase in both competitions are seeded and will have home advantage in the second leg of their round of 16 games.\n\nThis will extend to the quarter-finals for the teams that finished in the top four of the league phase if they progress.\n\nThe top two will also have home advantage in the second leg of their semi-final if successful.\n\nAny team that eliminates a seeded team will take their privileges.\n\nWhen are the 2025/26 knockout stages?\n\nRound of 16: March 12 and 19\n\nQuarter-finals: April 9 and 16\n\nSemi-finals: April 30 and May 7\n\nFinal: May 20\n\nWhere are the finals?\n\nThe Europa League final will be held at Besiktas Park in Istanbul on May 20.\n\nThe Conference League final will be one week later at the Leipzig Stadium on May 27."

Season has been awful, so any tiny crumb of comfort we will take! Share\n\n4m ago 15.56 EST Couple of EFL games also going on this evening. In the Championship it’s 1-1 between Bristol City and Watford at Ashton Gate. In League Two, home-team Harrogate have just equalised against Cheltenham. A point would mean the Sulphurites (what a nickname) will remain in the bottom two, as it stands. Share\n\n12m ago 15.47 EST Half-time: Wolves 0-0 Aston Villa If I knew nothing about this season and you told me one of these teams was third and the other was bottom I wouldn’t believe you. That half was mid-table fodder at best. Boos at the break. Share\n\n15m ago 15.44 EST 43 min Bold prediction, but I don’t think we’re going to get a goal before half-time. Since the Douglas Luiz chance we’ve had very little in the way of goulmouth action. Share\n\n17m ago 15.43 EST Another live blog fan in America, thanks Rebekah: double quotation mark I agree with Mr. California. I’m a broke college student from the middle of America. If I want to watch Bayern, I have to pay for ESPN+ and Paramount+ for the Bundesliga and Champions League. If I want to watch the Prem, I have to get Peacock. That’s at least 34 dollars a month; it’s more if I opt for the ad-free subscriptions. And, well, I live off of ramen and tuna sandwiches, so that’s a hard pass for me. The Guardian is the best thing I’ve got. I appreciate everything that you and your colleagues do for me.

Share\n\n27m ago 15.32 EST 30 min It’s hammering it down in Wolverhampton and everything just looks a bit soggy. Not much happening and not a lot quality either.

He may not have hit the heights of time at Dortmund, but there have been signs of the player who had everyone so excited a few years ago. Share\n\n40m ago 15.20 EST 17 min Now it’s the turn of Douglas Luiz to miss when well-placed.

Share\n\n1h ago 14.49 EST Unai Emery has been speaking to Sky Sports pre-match: double quotation mark We are ready, we are focused. We are aware of how we must compete today. We need to be focussed tactically too, they [Wolves] have a very tactical coach in Rob Edwards. We are definitely expecting a competitive match. Wolves are playing fresh at the moment, despite being at the bottom of the table. They are playing tactically offensive and individually in defence also. They are a demanding team for their opponent. We are ready but we expect a difficult match. Emery also says the reason Mings is not in the starting XI is because he has “a niggle”. Share\n\n1h ago 14.38 EST I love it when you get a very detailed response to a simple question. Simon Rigby has emailed in: double quotation mark A lot of thought has to go into a takeaway order for the football. You don’t want something that is going to be a distraction to your viewing experience. So noodle dishes or similar are out as they require concentration. In fact you can rule out anything Asian as far as I’m concerned, it’s too fussy for this situation. I want to be able to shovel in while keeping my eyes up, which means I also swerve the chippy. Curry has a good short-distance range, but for me it’s pizza. Make sure it’s pre-cut and then it only requires a but of hand-eye to get it from box to mouth. This is truly top stuff. Thank you, Simon. Share\n\n1h ago 14.30 EST We have a Wolves prediction! Paul Haynes has emailed in: double quotation mark I’m an optimistic Wolves fan. I think we will lose by less than a three goal margin. You love to see it.

Are you going traditional with fish and chips, succumbing to whichever pizza ad you see first or going in a different direction? Now I can’t stop thinking about chippy chips… Takeaway god, Cole Palmer. Share\n\n2h ago 14.22 EST Another Villa fan has got a prediction, James Moriarty (not the fictional professor, one assumes): double quotation mark I’m a Villa fan still recovering from the Sherwood-Remi Garde years, I am optimistic this could be the game to get the season back in course after this year’s wobble. I predict a nervy game with a late goal to win from Rogers/Abraham/Mings the Merciless. I like the hedge to go with three names for potential late goalscorers! Any Wolves fans out there feeling optimistic? Share Updated at 14.22 EST\n\n2h ago 14.15 EST Antony T has emailed in: double quotation mark Great call on us being nervous. I’m hoping, like usual, I am completely wrong and to keep my mouth shut, so I’ll say Buendia is in the team based purely on that good goal v Spurs and the last min winner against Arsenal that were months ago - I’ve seen nothing since - and Ollie (he’s a Villa legend I won’t hear him being slagged off) but there are Labour MPs more confident than him right now. So yep prove me wrong lads. Buendia three assists for Ollie’s hat trick. Share\n\n2h ago 14.06 EST How do you lot see this one? There are clearly some jitters around Villa players and fans at the moment, perhaps because they know Wolves have a decent record against them at Molineux. That’s one of thise innate things you know as a fan, logically it shouldn’t have any bearing but it just does. Wolves have earned draws against Arsenal, Newcastle and Everton since the turn of the year, I wouldn’t bet against this one finishing all square either. Send me in your predictions via the email link at the top of the page. Share\n\n2h ago 13.56 EST So Unai Emery reacts to the draw with Leeds by making three changes to his Villa starting XI. Pau Torres, Lucas Digne and Jadon Sancho come in for Tyrone Mings, Ian Maatsen and Leon Bailey. On the Wolves front, it’s Toti Gomes in for suspended Krejci and João Gomes in for Tolu Arokodare. Rodrigo Gomes and Angel Gomes are on the bench for Wolves so we could see four men named Gomes on the pitch at the same time tonight, what a prospect. Share\n\n2h ago 13.49 EST Team news Wolves XI: Sá; Mosquera, Santi Bueno, Toti; Tchatchoua, Joao Gomes, Andre, Hugo Bueno; Bellegarde, Armstrong, Mané.\n\nSubs: Johnstone, Doherty, Wolfe, Lima, Gomes, Olagunju, Gomes, Arokodare, Edozie.

            "content": "Arsenal’s journey under Mikel Arteta has long been a reference point for Chelsea’s owners. It is part of the club’s shift towards youth and potential after the Roman Abramovich era. Chelsea have built with a long-term view and, seeing how Arteta has reversed Arsenal’s decline since his appointment as manager in December 2019, have been keen to find a young coach capable of becoming a similarly galvanising force at Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt is not an easy task. Chelsea briefly thought they had their rising star when they hired Graham Potter in September 2022, only for his reign to end after seven months. Now there is hope that Liam Rosenior can become Chelsea’s answer to Arteta. Rosenior is young, confident, talented and a little unconventional in the way he presents himself. It is early days but the 41-year-old has made an encouraging start, winning eight of his first 12 games, and has transmitted enough authority to keep jibes about his inexperience at bay so far.\n\nDoes he have it in him to match Arteta though? More pertinently, will he be given the time to succeed? Just over six years on from turning to Arteta after firing Unai Emery, Arsenal stand five points clear at the top of the Premier League before hosting Chelsea on Sunday. They have benefited from a stable environment. Rosenior, by contrast, is the fifth permanent head coach under the ownership of Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly. Chelsea have had nine managers, including interims, during the Arteta era. It is impossible to ignore the upheaval when it comes to working out why Chelsea have not mustered a title challenge since winning the league in 2017.\n\nThey remain a strong cup team, capable of raising their level in one-off games, but the consistency required to keep up with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City in the league has been lacking. Rosenior has already felt it. Chelsea have been at their careless worst in their past two league games, home draws with Burnley and Leeds the consequence of a repeated inability to stay focused and defend a lead in mature fashion.\n\nDropping 19 points from winning positions this season says a lot about the squad’s mentality. Rosenior has to tackle the listlessness. Behind closed doors he should make clear that he did not like Malo Gusto wasting a promising attack with a pointless no-look pass against Burnley. Chelsea cannot afford to be cocky. They have to be honest about where they are short. They have to acknowledge that they have a discipline problem. They have had eight red cards this season and were pegged back by Burnley – whose stoppage-time equaliser arrived when one of Rosenior’s players dozed off at a corner – after losing Wesley Fofana to a needless second yellow card.\n\nView image in fullscreen Liam Rosenior is young and confident, and has transmitted enough authority to keep jibes about his inexperience at bay so far. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThe frustration is that there are times when Chelsea look like a serious team. They have beaten the champions of England, Italy, Spain and France in the past 12 months. They face Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League and it would not be a surprise if they went through. Chelsea are different in the big games. They have a daunting run-in but are not fearful of top opposition. The problem is more that they switch off when expected to win.\n\nRosenior has to lift standards. He has the youngest squad in the Premier League and needs time to instil good habits. Whether Rosenior lasts, though, will partly come down to whether Chelsea are capable of leaving the chaos behind. Can they hold their nerve when results dip? It is one thing to find your Arteta but another to stand by him when the pressure rises and fans are baying for blood.\n\nIt is worth remembering that it has not always been plain sailing for Arteta. The Spaniard was 37 when he replaced Emery and earned his first managerial role. He arrived with Arsenal struggling to move on from how the Arsène Wenger era fizzled out. There was a lot of damage to repair. The squad were a mess and although Arteta ended his first season on a high, winning the FA Cup thanks to surprise victories over City and Chelsea, it was not long before he was in danger of losing his job.\n\nArsenal were 15th and winless in seven league games before beating Frank Lampard’s Chelsea on Boxing Day in 2020. Arteta was in trouble. He needed Arsenal’s trust. Even then it was not until the second half of the 2021-22 season that Arteta’s vision truly became clear. Arsenal have had to fight their way to the top. They have also stuck with Arteta through three consecutive second-placed finishes. They have had to be resolute in their belief that he is the man to win their first title since 2004.\n\nArteta has driven the process. He is the manager, not the head coach, the individual knitting everything together. Arsenal have a sporting director but Arteta is the face of the club. There is no doubt about his power. Arsenal have thrown everything into winning now. They have targeted experienced, established players in an attempt to get over the line. They have filled holes that needed filling. Signing Martín Zubimendi, Noni Madueke, Viktor Gyökeres and Eberechi Eze last summer gave them depth and quality in every position, while exposing a key point of difference with Chelsea’s model of centring recruitment around young talents who will need time to adapt to English football.\n\nIt remains an issue for Chelsea that, for every hit, there is a signing struggling to meet expectations. João Pedro has shone since signing from Brighton last summer but Liam Delap has been disappointing and Alejandro Garnacho is still the winger who blew hot and cold at Manchester United. There has been too much volatility. Erratic performances are not a surprise. Chelsea are still to prove that their project will work. Their bet is that hoovering up some of the best young talent in the world will give them a team to fear. They are convinced that their collaborative structure, with a head coaching working in tandem with five sporting directors, breeds stability.\n\nYet it will take more than handing Rosenior a six-and-a-half-year deal to show that Chelsea understand why Arteta has flourished at Arsenal. There will come a time when the heat rises. Chelsea’s faith in Rosenior will be tested. How will they react?"

            "content": "Being teetotal, always asking questions and taking up yoga in his early 30s after a recommendation from Gareth Barry have played their part. But if one thing inspired James Milner to break the Premier League’s appearance mark then it is a trait honed during his formative years in Yorkshire: sheer bloody-mindedness.\n\n“Some things don’t change,” Milner says with a chuckle when asked whether his desire to prove people wrong was as strong as ever after his 40th birthday last month. “There’s people who are always going to doubt you but that’s always something that’s been at my forefront: to prove them wrong.”\n\nMilner credits his father for instilling the fighting spirit that has carried him through a remarkable 24 seasons in English football’s top flight. He started as a 16-year-old with Leeds under the watchful eye of Terry Venables, and has had spells at Newcastle, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Liverpool and now Brighton.\n\n“He knew what I was like and he used to say: ‘You don’t work hard enough, you’re not going to make it,’” he says of his father. “He’d never say it in a horrible way or anything like that. But he’d be like: ‘You got no chance of scoring the goal from there.’ And then [I would] take free-kicks and two shots later it’s in the top corner. He knew how to get the best of me.”\n\nThe same desire provided motivation after it seemed Milner’s career was finished in 2024 when he was unable to walk following knee surgery. He spent nine months on the sidelines before returning at the end of last season.\n\n“I think most people – the surgeon, the physio, people who knew what I had, probably every single person – thought I was finished; at my age being a footballer and what I had,” he says. “So it was probably that same thing that meant I’m still playing now: not to finish your career in a way that wasn’t really in your control. That was the drive really. I wanted to try to prove that I could get back from that because I don’t think many people could.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner salutes the fans after the final whistle in Leeds’ victory over Chelsea in December 2002, a month after his Premier League debut as a 16-year-old. Photograph: Gareth Copley/PA\n\nIt has been particularly satisfying for Milner that, having come off the bench more than 200 times in the Premier League, he started on his 654th appearance to break his former Villa teammate Barry’s record when Brighton overcame Brentford last week. “My body doesn’t agree to sitting still, so that’s why I don’t like being on the bench so much,” he says.\n\nHe relishes his role as the elder statesman of the Brighton squad and reveals that the teenage striker Charalampos Kostoulas has been joining him for yoga sessions. “I probably started maybe eight or nine years ago now, which I think Gareth put me on to actually,” he says. “We’re passing it down, so I’ve passed it on to Babis [Kostoulas] at this moment. He’s only 18, so he’s starting young.”\n\nMilner, whose rippling muscles bulge as he holds court at Brighton’s training ground in Lancing, recognises he has been fortunate that his career coincided with the rapid growth of sports science. He uses strengthening techniques created by the celebrated German athletics coach Frans Bosch to counteract injuries that have included a fractured ankle at Newcastle and 12 hamstring problems, meticulously tracks his sleep patterns and takes magnesium to boost a natural shortfall in his body. Milner believes the decision to never drink alcohol, made during his schooldays in Horsforth, outside Leeds, is another of the secrets to his longevity.\n\n“I’ve never had a problem with people drinking at all – I think it’s healthy,” he says. “Like if that’s the right time to do it and if that’s your thing to get away from football and go have a blast, then I’ve no problems with it all. But it’s just a decision I made that if it would help me, I wouldn’t do it.\n\n“When I first started playing you had maybe one or two physios, maybe a part-time masseur, one fitness coach. Now you’ve got five or six fitness coaches, you’ve got seven or eight in the medical team. So that’s been to my advantage that I’ve managed to learn from that to ask questions early.\n\n“I always ask questions: ‘Why are we doing this?’ Or: ‘Explain it to me so I understand and then I decide if it is the right thing to do. I’m not just going to do it because you say. Give me the information why. Give me the science behind it.’ It was interesting, a few of the messages I had over the weekend were: ‘You were a nightmare to work with,’ or ‘challenging to work with’. But I take that as a compliment that I push them to be better and ask questions and challenge them. The best people always come out and give you the exact reason why you’re doing it.”\n\nThings have changed from his youth, when Milner recalls “teacups flying and walls being punched” at half-time by irate managers. “You don’t see much of that now,” he says. “I just feel fortunate. I played through two eras; one when I was emerging and now another.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner, with then teammate Jordan Henderson, holds the FA Cup after Liverpool’s win in 2022. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nMilner was presented this week with three Guinness world records: one for the appearances, another for most consecutive Premier League seasons (23) and the third for the longest gap between his first and last Premier League goals (22 years and 248 days). The next milestone on the horizon is surpassing Teddy Sheringham’s record as the Premier League’s oldest outfield player at 40 years 272 days, though Milner has never been inspired by chasing records.\n\nHe is yet to open discussions with Brighton about extending his stay beyond this season – a prospect recently welcomed by his 33-year‑old head coach, Fabian Hürzeler – but is keen to stay and he denies fearing what retirement may bring.\n\n“When we have some days off I look forward to that: go and play golf, spend time with the family. So I feel whenever I finish, I’ll probably have a break and a rest because I’ve been so 100% for so long.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner with his three Guinness World Records certificates. Photograph: Paul Hazlewood\n\nHaving worked under Venables, Sir Bobby Robson, Roberto Mancini, Jürgen Klopp and many other of the game’s finest managers, Milner is well placed to judge what makes a good one. He rates his two seasons as a central midfielder at Martin O’Neill’s Villa as his best from an individual perspective, and has especially fond memories of winning City’s and Liverpool’s first league titles for a generation. There are doubts about his prospects of making the transition to the dugout when he hangs up his boots.\n\n“It’s such a hard gig, innit? You see managers getting a new contract and getting sacked in two months. People don’t get the time they deserve now. But the competitive guy in you thinks: ‘Yeah, I wouldn’t mind giving that a go.’\n\n“I’ve got a great array of different managers from different countries and different personalities to lean back on, so in one way I think it’d be a big shame to lose all that knowledge and experience I’ve built up, to not be able to use that.”"

            "content": "Liverpool had the highest wage bill in the Premier League when winning their 20th league title last season, the club’s latest set of accounts show.\n\nLiverpool’s wage bill increased by £42m to £428m in the year ending 31 May 2025, when a Premier League title triumph in Arne Slot’s debut season as head coach and a return to the Champions League increased revenue to a record £703m. The club’s wages-to-revenue ratio stood at a healthy 61%. It was the biggest wage bill in the division, ahead of Manchester City on £408m, and included bonuses for the record-equalling title triumph.\n\nCommercial revenue increased by £15m to £323m and matchday revenue by £14m to £116m. The figures contributed to an increase of £89m in revenue for the highest-ranked Premier League club in the Deloitte Football Money League. But the rise in wages, which pushed administrative costs up by £57m to £657m, resulted in a relatively modest post-tax profit of £8m. Liverpool had a £57m loss in 2023-24 after failing to qualify for the Champions League.\n\n“We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it,” said Liverpool’s chief financial officer, Jenny Beacham. “The 2024-25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men’s team winning our 20th league title.\n\n“The club does face significant cost challenges, including rises in administrative, staffing and operational costs, alongside the need for us to compete at the highest level of the game, across our men and women’s teams.”\n\nLiverpool’s latest set of published accounts do not include last summer’s record spend of almost £450m on new players, including the British record signing of Alexander Isak for £125m from Newcastle. Slot said recently that failure to qualify for the Champions League would be unacceptable for Liverpool this season and the competition “does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run”.\n\nOn Friday Slot said it was not difficult to resist the clamour to start Rio Ngumoha because the level-headed teenager had not been carried away by the hype. The 17-year-old made a huge contribution to Liverpool’s late win at Nottingham Forest last weekend after his 77th-minute introduction, especially after switching wings to replace Mohamed Salah on the right. That has prompted calls for Ngumoha to start against West Ham on Saturday, when Florian Wirtz will again be absent through injury, but Slot will continue to develop the youngster carefully.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rio Ngumoha made a big impact for Liverpool from the bench against Nottingham Forest. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\n“It’s totally not difficult because of how he is,” Slot said of putting Ngumoha on the bench. “And that is something special for a 17-year-old who has been hyped like he is throughout his whole career.\n\n“There has been a lot of talk about him because we can all see how special he is and his talent. He is handling that situation really well, which is a big compliment to him but also to his parents, who raised him that he is down to earth, works really hard, keeps going and doesn’t lose his head because a few pundits have given positive feedback about his game. If you start believing how special you are after a few comments from pundits, that is probably not the way to become the player he wants to become.\n\n“We have to keep his special quality and that is beating players in one v one. That is not 10 out of 10 times working, and it doesn’t have to be, but he has to keep trying. There are not many players in modern football that can take on one-v-ones on a regular basis and beat their opponents a lot of times. That is a special quality and that is why we want to take such good care of him because we have a lot of belief in how special he is.”"

            "content": "The draw for the Champions League last 16 has produced some intriguing, heavyweight clashes featuring the renewal of old rivalries. If Manchester City’s meeting with Real Madrid arguably ranks foremost among them, Chelsea’s engagement with the holders, Paris Saint-Germain, and Newcastle’s duel with Barcelona are certainly not lacking in glamour.\n\nOr, in the case of Chelsea and PSG in particular, edge. The tie is a repeat of last summer’s Club World Cup final in New Jersey, which Chelsea won 3-0 thanks to two goals from Cole Palmer and with a team under the management of Enzo Maresca.\n\n“I’m so excited,” said Liam Rosenior, Maresca’s successor. “PSG are fantastic. I’ve experience of playing them in France [as Strasbourg manager] and I’ve always admired them. Luis Enrique has done a fantastic job there.\n\n“These are the games you live for, games that you come into football for. It’s going to be a great tie.”\n\nIn Rosenior’s three fixtures against PSG at Strasbourg he won one, drew one and lost one.\n\nLiverpool, meanwhile, will return to Istanbul as part of a tricky rematch with Galatasaray. Arne Slot’s side lost 1-0 in Turkey in a September league-phase meeting.\n\nArsenal have been handed a somewhat kinder draw in Bayer Leverkusen as they continue to compete on four fronts “We’re really excited,” said Mikel Arteta. “Let’s try to be there until the last stage of every competition. And then we’ll see what happens.”\n\nA Tottenham team likely to be prioritising Premier League survival will meet Atlético Madrid, meaning a swift reunion for Conor Gallagher, who joined Spurs from the Spanish club in January. With all 16 teams provided with a route map to the semi-finals, Atlético’s Diego Simeone and Tottenham’s Igor Tudor also know their sides are playing for a quarter-final date against either Barcelona or Newcastle. Should Spurs keep progressing, a north London semi-final against Arsenal is a possibility.\n\nIf Arsenal overcome Leverkusen, they will meet the winner of Bodø/Glimt versus Sporting in the last eight while Liverpool could face Chelsea, which would no doubt reignite memories of their Champions League battles from previous decades.\n\nShould Manchester City make it past Madrid in what will be a fifth Champions League knockout meeting in five years, Pep Guardiola could be set for a potential reunion with Bayern Munich on the basis that they overcome Atalanta, Italy’s remain representative in the competition, in the last 16.\n\nNewcastle’s meeting with Barcelona will reprise evocative memories of Sir Bobby Robson, who managed both clubs, as well as Faustino Asprilla’s treble at St James’ Park during a 3-2 Champions League win over the Spanish giants in 1997. The two sides also met at St James’ Park in September, with Hansi Flick’s side winning the league-phase encounter 2-1 thanks to two goals from Marcus Rashford.\n\nIn the Europa League, Nottingham Forest have been drawn against Midtjylland with the Danes doubtless bolstered by memories of their 3-2 win at the City Ground in the league phase in October. With Aston Villa, who face Lille, in the same side of the draw as Forest, there is no prospect of an all-English final, although they could clash in the semis.\n\nVilla and Lille crossed swords in a Conference League quarter-final two years ago, with Villa prevailing follow a rather chaotic penalty shootout featuring some theatrics from Argentinian goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez.\n\nCrystal Palace will face AEK Larnaca of Cyprus in the last 16 of the Conference League."

Only Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal have had more injuries, and those clubs have deeper squads.\n\nScott will take charge of an overhauled medical department, with the existing head of medical, Dr Prithish Narayan, understood to be leaving to return to work for the NHS.\n\nScott left Tottenham at the start of last season as part of a major restructure of Postecoglou’s backroom team, which led to the appointment of Adam Brett from Brighton as Spurs’ director of performance services. It was widely reported at the time that Scott had clashed with Postecoglou over the players’ workload and management of their recovery, with Tottenham declining to comment.\n\nTottenham’s squad has been devastated by injuries for the last two seasons under Postecoglou and Thomas Frank, with the club experiencing 41 injuries last season leading to 1,553 days out, the second-highest total in the Premier League after Brighton.\n\nForest have been drawn to face Midtjylland in the Europa League last 16.

In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on direct rivals. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season.

Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea, where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in matchday chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) as they sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL interpreters will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here.

We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left-winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German, who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire on Saturday. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track after a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croat’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and, considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance.

The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third goal in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes after the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "A European occasion that appeared ominous for Celtic instead provided evidence that it is never wise to write off Martin O’Neill. His side exited the Europa League in Stuttgart but the scale of spirit and togetherness visible during their 1-0, playoff second-leg victory emphasised that tales of their demise may be overstated.\n\nCeltic’s key attribute during a critical week, which begins at Ibrox on Sunday, is course and distance specialism. The shortcomings within, and patched-up nature of, O’Neill’s squad are blindingly obvious. This is, however, a club that has become accustomed to dominating Scottish football over more than a decade. Much earlier, O’Neill had demonstrated he could emerge successful from title scraps. Contrary to giddy analysis, there is nothing miraculous or remarkable about O’Neill’s work during his second short-term stint of the season. It is, though, immediately striking how a 73-year-old can achieve such buy-in from players. Faith in O’Neill within Celtic is absolute.\n\nThis Celtic season, typified by managerial upheaval and protesting supporters, retains a pulse. Stuttgart felt significant because Celtic, in makeshift form, displayed character. The easier option would have been to limp out of the Europa League. Instead, there was an unwillingness to concede an equaliser that reflects positively on O’Neill and his squad.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill (left) is in his second interim stint of the season at Celtic and has galvanised the players after a rocky period. Photograph: DPA/PA\n\nOn Sunday they face a Rangers team who are under considerable pressure to prove they will not deliver another campaign typified by false dawns. Rangers’ home form is strong but Danny Röhl’s team are yet to remove the sense of a soft underbelly, demonstrated by draws at Hibernian, Motherwell and Livingston. The most recent of those, last Sunday, was a horrendous result; Livingston had not won in 25 league matches. The stakes are huge for Rangers, who should be embarrassed if a net spend of about £30m is not sufficient to prise the title from Celtic – at one point managed by Wilfried Nancy – and a Hearts side assembled for buttons in comparison. Celtic’s seven Premiership losses to date match their combined tally from the previous two seasons.\n\nA Rangers win would place Celtic in tricky territory, five points behind their oldest foes. Celtic’s game in hand will be played in Aberdeen on Wednesday, before a return to Ibrox on Scottish Cup business. Hearts hope to extend their lead at the top to seven points on Saturday when Aberdeen visit Edinburgh. An Old Firm draw would suit Hearts perfectly.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rangers’ Danny Röhl speaks to the media on Friday – his side are four points behind Hearts and two above Celtic. Photograph: Luke Nickerson/Rangers FC/Shutterstock\n\nStuttgart gave O’Neill plenty food for thought. Luke McCowan’s terrific performance in midfield should afford him a start at Ibrox. O’Neill’s public backing of Kasper Schmeichel suggests he will restore the veteran goalkeeper despite almost weekly errors. Schmeichel’s deputy, Viljami Sinisalo, repelled Stuttgart. Auston Trusty’s suspension leaves Celtic weak in central defence. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was not in Celtic’s European squad, was surely signed to play in fixtures such as the derby.\n\nO’Neill is aware of a bigger picture, despite that hardly being his concern given he is due to leave in the summer. “European football is what big clubs in Scotland should be aiming for,” he said. “Not for the coefficient points to be dropping out of sight. It’s ridiculous. This is what it’s all about.”\n\nHis regular reference to the country’s coefficient, which is indeed dipping to a worrying level, is intriguing. There is a theory Celtic’s reluctance to spend heavily on players is linked at least in part to knowledge that their potential lack of access to European revenue in upcoming years could swallow up cash reserves. In a worst-case but feasible situation, Celtic could be staring at Conference League football. This does not, however, explain the horrendous lack of preparation for this season’s Champions League playoff tie. Sensible investment would have been sufficient to topple Kairat Almaty, who instead left Celtic with red faces.\n\nThe shadow boxing has started. McCowan has asserted no team in the league can touch Celtic when at their best. In truth, it would be more of a story had McCowan stipulated Celtic are also-rans. Röhl cast aspersions on Celtic’s approach in Stuttgart; this was amusing, given Rangers finished 32nd out of 36 in the Europa League table.\n\nAll Old Firm jousts are fascinating. This one carries more meaning than most. Events in Germany suggested Celtic are formed of the kind of substance that Rangers must be wary of."

            "content": "UNTIL this week, I’d never heard of Bridget Phillipson, who it turns out is two things: The Secretary of State for Education. And very annoying.\n\nIt seems she joined the Labour Party when she was 15, got some kind of second-class degree, and then worked either for a charity or local government until she became an MP.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo like all the Labourites, she has never worked in business, has no clue how the world operates and would struggle to run even a corner shop.\n\nAnd yet here she is in charge of all our schools.\n\nHer big thing this week, apart from saying that five-year-old boys can wear dresses to school — which means she doesn’t understand the concept of teasing either — is that good schools that are full of well-behaved children should be forced to take badly behaved disruptive children. So that they aren’t any good any more.\n\nThis is classic Labourite thinking. Instead of looking at the bad schools and thinking “let’s make them better”, they look at the good ones and think “let’s make them worse”.\n\nAt the moment, if you live in a nice area full of responsible parents who teach their children to have good manners and to respect their teachers, it stands to reason that your local school is going to be pretty good. Bridget doesn’t like that.\n\nShe thinks it’s unfair. She says that access to high- performing local schools should not be dependent on factors such as families’ household income or local house prices.\n\nSo she is going to introduce legislation that will allow lazy, dysfunctional parents to send their feral, knife-wielding kids to your kids’ school even if they don’t live in the area.\n\nAnd who knows? Maybe if there’s no suitable public transport to get them there, perhaps the feckless parents could be given a nice BMW.\n\nIt would be easy for Bridget to fund such a scheme. She would simply ask Rachel Reeves to tax those who’ve worked for a BMW so that everyone can have one.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Government says that 70 per cent of kids from reasonably well-off families achieve a pass at grade 4 or above in their maths and English GCSEs.\n\nA feat managed by only 44 per cent of kids from poorer families. And they think they can do something about this.\n\nBut they can’t. Because if a bright, hard-working man marries a bright, hard-working woman, it’s likely that they will be successful and that their kids will be bright and hard-working as well. Not always, I admit, but usually.\n\nWhereas if a fat thicko meets another fat thicko at the scratchcard counter in the local corner shop, it’s likely that they will not be successful and that their kids will be enormous and gormless. Again, not always, but usually.\n\nIt’s just a fact that life always has been and always will be unfair.\n\nSome people are born pretty and some aren’t.\n\nSome have loving parents and some don’t. Some are tall and some are small. Some are lucky. Some aren’t.\n\nSome will be clever and they will become rocket scientists. Some won’t, and they will become Labour MPs.\n\nFlash photo so odd\n\n\n\nHAS anyone else noticed how all the pictures we’ve seen of people in Epstein’s houses are all just snaps?\n\nNo one is posing. It’s like they were all taken without the subjects knowing.\n\nLots of people come to my house and I have never just taken pictures of them as they go about their business.\n\nI mean, that one of Mandelson looking at an iPad in his underpants. Why would you take that? It’s weird.\n\nSO to escape justice, Peter Mandelson was planning to flee to the British Virgin Islands, was he? Really?\n\nI only ask because the BVI are actually British. So it would be like going to Cheltenham. And that really doesn’t count as fleeing.\n\nGoing round U-bend I’M delighted to see that plumber lady won the by-election for the Green Party this week and some of me hopes that one day she ends up in government. Because can you imagine her in a meeting to decide the future of the Chagos Islands, or what to do about the bond markets, or any of the things that governments have to do on a daily basis. It’d be hilarious. She’s damn good at mending a broken U-bend I’m sure, but I reckon she’d be pretty hopeless at under-standing the need for geopolitical stability in the Spratlys. And watching her try would be as funny as that time when John Redwood, the former Welsh Secretary, tried to sing the Welsh national anthem. Google it. It’s brilliant.\n\nTHIS week a court heard about how a gamekeeper had shot a worker in the neck with a shotgun.\n\nOne has to presume that this would create a pretty enormous wound.\n\nHowever, police then arrived at the scene, found the body and for some extraordinary reason, announced the death was “not suspicious”.\n\nOnly when some shotgun pellets fell out of the body bag back at the mortuary was the alarm raised.\n\n\n\nMeat your match\n\nBoffins at Oxford University announced this week that if you eat meat, you are more likely to get cancer.\n\nBut on the very same day, the World Health Organisation said that if you don’t eat meat, you are more likely to get cancer.\n\nThis sounds a bit confusing but actually, it’s quite simple. Meat eaters are more likely to get cancer in the breast, the pancreas, the prostate and the kidney whereas those who prefer to live on chickpeas are more likely to get it in the bowel.\n\nSo there you are. Before deciding on what sort of diet you’d like to live on, first of all you need to decide where you’d like to get cancer.\n\nMe? I’ve decided not to read any more reports about food and what it does to us.\n\nAgeing badly I think it’s safe to say another Starmer U-turn is on the cards. Not that long ago, he announced he would lower the voting age to 16, believing people with brains that haven’t fully formed were more likely to vote Labour. But it now turns out that if a 16-year-old has the vote, they’d go for that snaggle-toothed weirdo from the Green Party. Grab that handbrake, Keir, or you’ll be toast.\n\nYou don’t need a study to get to the bottom of cats’ weird behaviour\n\nNon-cat people like me have known for years that if you have a cat and you suddenly became one inch tall, it would eat you. Eventually.\n\nTo start with, it would play with you, using its claws to tear out your insides. And then it would eat you.\n\nAnd now our opinion on the matter has been backed up by a study which has found that cats don’t need their owner because they’d be happy with anyone who has a tin opener.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the study says, cats don’t need anyone at all. They can feed themselves and are therefore perfectly happy on their own.\n\nHmmm. I’m not sure I believe this because I know for a fact cats need me.\n\nIf I go to someone’s house and they have a cat, it can sense I don’t like it, so over it comes, rubbing itself against me and leaping on to the breakfast table to show me its hideous brown pencil sharpener.\n\nI have to pretend to like it to make it go away. I did the same sort of thing with Angela Rayner at a party recently."

            "content": "DONALD Trump has refused to rule out blitzing Iran, warning that he was “not happy” with the latest round of crunch talks.\n\nThe US president blasted Tehran for failing to say the “golden words” and forswear its nuclear ambitions during negotiations in Geneva.\n\n\n\n\n\n“We haven’t made a final decision,” Trump told reporters.\n\n“They cannot have nuclear weapons, and we’re not thrilled with the way they’re negotiating.”\n\nTrump remained coy about the possibility of launching a full-scale bombardment of the rogue state in the coming days.\n\nThe biggest US military presence since the 2003 invasion of Iraq remains in the region awaiting Trump’s orders.\n\nIt includes an armada of aircraft carriers, complete with the world’s biggest warship, as well as a fleet of fighter jets primed menacingly on Tehran’s doorstep.\n\n“I’d love not to use it but sometimes you have to,” he said, stressing that the United States has the greatest military in the world.\n\nThe comments came a day after US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner held talks with Iranian officials that ended without a breakthrough.\n\n\n\nTop US defence officials were at the White House on Thursday for talks, according to officials familiar with the meetings.\n\nOman, which has been mediating between Washington and Tehran, sent its foreign minister to Washington for discussions with US Vice President JD Vance, according to a source briefed on the matter.\n\nA source familiar with internal White House deliberations said Trump, who launched a fierce bombing campaign against Iranian nuclear sites last June, is very clear-eyed on all his options.\n\nBut “nobody is super optimistic about the negotiations,” the source said.\n\nTrump was speaking as he departed the White House for events in Texas, before travelling on to Florida for the weekend.\n\n\n\nIt comes as the UK evacuated its embassy staff from Iran over fears that Trump’s first kamikaze drone squad is primed to blitz the country.\n\nTask Force Scorpion, a unit of one way attack drones, has been signed off for deployment, according to US officials.\n\n\n\nIn one of the strongest indications yet of imminent conflict, China and Canada today urged their citizens to leave the pariah state immediately.\n\nBaghdad International Airport is reportedly flooded with Americans desperately trying to escape the country.\n\nAnd the US Embassy in Jerusalem told all non-emergency government personnel and their families to leave Israel.\n\nIsrael’s deputy mayor has reportedly opened all public shelters and warned civilians to prepare.\n\nThe new squadron of drones suggests a sophisticated attack on Iran is in sight.\n\n\n\nLow-cost, unmanned and lightweight, the drones have an extensive range.\n\nThey are prime weapons for initial attacks on targets like missile production facilities, road networks and missile launch sites to blunt Iran’s ability to retaliate.\n\nProduced in Arizona – reportedly costing £25,900 per drone -they are designed for one-way attacks, reconnaissance operations and maritime strikes.\n\nAnd as the crumbling regime’s air defence weakens, the unit will be difficult to shoot down.\n\n\n\nUS Central Command spokesman Capt. Tim Hawkins told Bloomberg: “We established the squadron last year to rapidly equip our warfighters with new combat drone capabilities that continue to evolve.”\n\nOne of the drones successfully test-launched in the Arabian Gulf in mid-December.\n\nThe drone took off from the flight-deck of the USS Santa Barbara – one of the combat ships in the US armada.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nDuring his state of the union address, Trump said he favours a deal but promised to strike Iran if diplomatic talks fail.\n\nAnything less than a concrete deal agreed by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, could be the final straw."

            "content": "TALIBAN’S long-serving terror chief has mysteriously vanished amid claims the tyrant was targeted in deadly airstrikes from Pakistan.\n\nHibatullah Akhundzada hasn’t been seen or heard from since overnight strikes reportedly wiped out at least 264 Taliban militants as Pakistan declared an “open war”.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shady leader in Afghanistan, believed to be in his 60s, rarely makes public appearances, has no digital footprint, and is believed to command his henchmen via secret networks.\n\nThis allows him to work in the shadows, directing his terrorist brutes on how to carry out attacks and how to lay down the law on civilians.\n\nEven his name strikes fear with Hibatullah in Arabic meaning “gift from God”.\n\nSince taking over as the Taliban kingpin in 2016, Akhundzada has overseen some major developments for the group.\n\nTaliban, under his rule, came back to power in Afghanistan in 2021 following the bungled withdrawal of US and Nato troops from Kabul.\n\nHis low profile keeps him shrouded in mystery – but often sparks speculation and rumours that he is in declining health or dead.\n\nHe is believed to reside in Kandahar, but his exact whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\n\n\nFormer British Army officer General Sir Richard Barrons, who served in Afghanistan, told The Sun: “He’s an extremely influential figure but he’s also secretive, he’s always been secretive and this helps keep him extremely powerful in running a conservative faction.\n\n“The fact that he lives in this isolated way, in many ways, in many eyes, earns him a lot of respect as well as security.”\n\nHis whereabouts are always a mystery so any foreign intelligence can’t track him down and make him a target.\n\nOnly one image has ever been made public of him too.\n\nThis has led many of his supporters saying there is no chance he would have been killed in the Pakistan strikes.\n\n\n\nShould he ever die, it remains unclear when the Taliban would announce it to the world.\n\nThe terror group have previously hidden the truth over a leader’s death.\n\nTaliban founder Mullah Omar is suspected of staying in power for two entire years after his death, Afghanistan’s government and security services believe.\n\nAkhundzada, a hardline religious scholar, has served as the head of the Taliban since 2016 since moving on from a ruthless Sharia court chief.\n\nHis reign of power over the Afghan courts saw him oversee years of brutal punishments handed out to those breaking Islamic law.\n\n\n\nHe is believed to have issued rulings which saw convicted murderers and adulterers be publicly executed and thieves have their hands chopped off.\n\nOne of the most disturbing new laws in Afghanistan was announced earlier this month.\n\n\n\nThe Taliban has officially legalised domestic violence in Afghanistan in a terrifying new assault on women’s rights.\n\nA 90-page criminal code was signed off which allows husbands to physically abuse their wives and children – so long as it does not result in “broken bones or open wounds”.\n\nAfghanistan is “a pure patriarchy” with its values forced onto people through Akhundzada’s Taliban, Sir Barrons says.\n\nHe added: “For many Western people, this is outrageous, but the point is it’s not outrageous to many Afghans.\n\n“One of the reasons Akhundzada is powerful is that they actually genuinely support what he does.\n\n\n\n“He commands widespread support amongst the Taliban men and women.\n\n“He is this unpronounceable leader, he is really clear about how life should be led in Afghanistan and it is this strict interpretation of Sharia law.\n\n“The role of women in society and all of those things, there is no bending him on this.”\n\nRumours of Akhundzada going missing came after tit-for-tat strikes between Afghanistan and Pakistan on Thursday.\n\nKabul was rocked by “deadly” blitzes overnight after the Taliban attacked border troops hours earlier.\n\n\n\nPakistan‘s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said 274 Taliban regime members and terrorists were killed with 12 Pakistani troops lost in the operation.\n\nYet Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed his forces killed 55 Pakistani soldiers and captured others.\n\nHe said that just 13 Afghan troops had been killed.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe cross border fighting has now escalated with Pakistani defence minister Khawaja ‌Muhammad Asif declaring: “Our cup of patience has ⁠overflowed.\n\n“Now ​it is ​open war between ​us and ⁠you.”"

            "content": "THE mother of a 17-year-old killed in a drug-driving horror crash says no jail term is long enough for the man who killed her “best friend.”\n\nKeilan Roberts, then 21, had taken ketamine, cocaine, ecstasy and had been drinking when he killed passenger Chloe Hayman in Fochriw, South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the car hit a cattle grid, a railing pierced the windscreen and tragically killed Chloe instantly.\n\nChloe’s bereaved mother has called for young people to learn from the tragedy, and even hugged the man who killed her, according to the BBC.\n\nDevastated Danielle O’Halloran, 37, from Mountain Ash, said Chloe was her best friend and someone who “always saw the good in everyone.”\n\nRoberts had met Chloe in a nightclub just hours before and offered her a lift home with his friends.\n\nHe had intended to drop Chloe off the following morning but changed his mind and asked his pals to leave him and Chloe where his Skoda Octavia was parked.\n\nHours after the crash, Danielle was told the news — a moment she described as “too painful to relive.”\n\nShe said: “Your body can’t cope with the fact that they’re not there.\n\n“Like at that moment, I was just in shock.”\n\n\n\nRoberts, from Rhymney, Caerphilly county, admitted four charges linked to Chloe’s death.\n\nFootage captured on the bodycam of a police officer after the crash shows the immediate aftermath of the horror smash.\n\nRoberts can be seen standing on the side of the road, looking dazed and confused while holding a Peroni bottle.\n\n\n\nIn June 2023, he was sentenced, and following a family appeal, his prison term was increased to five years and three months with a 12-year driving ban.\n\nChloe’s mum had slammed Robert’s jail term as an “insult” after losing her “kind, loving, beautiful” daughter.\n\nDanielle said she was consumed by anger and hate: “I wished so many bad things upon him, I wanted him to stay there forever.\n\n“But I felt ill inside with the amount of anger I had. I just couldn’t let it eat me up any more.”\n\nThrough the restorative justice process, Danielle met Roberts, who was then 22, in prison — hugging him and confronting the man who took her daughter’s life.\n\n\n\nShe said: “We were both emotional when he walked in.”\n\nMeeting him face to face, Danielle says she realised that he had not meant to kill her daughter, but was “just a 21-year-old” who had made the “wrong choice.”\n\nNow, heartbroken Danielle hopes they can one day speak together in schools to warn young people about the devastating consequences of drink and drug driving.\n\nShe said: “I want young people to understand the lives that are shattered by one wrong choice.\n\n\n\nNo jail term is ever going to be long enough for what he did.”\n\nShe added: “I hugged him and said, I’m sorry you’re the one who has to live with this.”\n\nDanielle believes no jail sentence can outweigh the lifelong regret and guilt Roberts now carries.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“Coming back into the community is actually harder because you have to face people,” she said.\n\n\n\nShe added that society must do more to prevent risky behaviour, provide community support, and protect young people from the “glamorisation” of drinking and dangerous choices."

            "content": "Doctor warns of red flags for hearing loss - and what's a medical emergency\n\nDr Sooj explained that there are two main types of hearing loss - here's what you should know\n\nView 2 Images Dr Sooj explored two main types of hearing loss and what they mean (stock image) (Image: © Pablo Jeffs Munizaga/Fototrekking/Getty Images)\n\nA doctor has shed light on several warning signs of hearing loss and a 72-hour 'medical emergency' that needs addressing straight away. Dr Suraj Kukadia, also known as Dr Sooj, took to TikTok to share his insights and explained the key difference between treatable and permanent issues.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\" If you want to protect your hearing, you need to know this red flag for hearing loss,\" Dr Sooj told his followers. \" Now, there are two main types of hearing loss. There's conductive, and there's sensorineural. And the difference really does matter.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFirst, Dr Sooj highlighted conductive hearing loss, which occurs when sound can't reach the inner ear through the outer or middle ear. Causes of this generally include earwax blockage, infections, and fluid behind the eardrum, among other issues that are often treatable, allowing hearing to improve.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nMeanwhile, sensorineural hearing loss describes damage to the inner ear or auditory nerve, typically arising from noise exposure, medications, tumours, and age-related factors. These issues are deemed irreversible but can be managed with hearing aids or cochlear implants.\n\nNonetheless, if sensorineural hearing loss occurs suddenly and rapidly over hours to days, it is considered a medical emergency. Dr Sooj claimed that most patients have a 72-hour window to start treatment in order to preserve hearing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAfter that window, the outcomes are considered 'much worse'. In his video, Dr Sooj continued: \"And you can tell which type you have by humming. This is my left side, this is my right side. If we close both ears with fingers and hum like this, where do you hear the hum loudest?\n\n\"If my left side is affected and the hum is louder in this ear, the one with the hearing loss, then that suggests a conductive hearing loss. The sound is trapped in the ear canal and in the middle ear, so conduction of sound waves through the bones is enhanced and feels louder.\n\nView 2 Images Sensoerineural hearing loss is generally deemed irreversible but can be managed with hearing aids or cochlear implants (stock image) (Image: Bymuratdeniz/Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"If the hum is louder in your good ear, so the one that is not affected by the hearing loss, then that suggests some sort of sensory neural hearing loss in the affected ear. Your inner ear or nerve on the affected side is damaged, so it can't process sound properly, even when it's conducted through bone.\n\n\"Now, if the hum is equal in both ears, but you're still struggling to hear, then you might have an issue affecting both ears, or something else entirely might be going on.\"\n\nBeyond this, Dr Sooj also flagged five key red flags that need urgent assessment. These include the following:\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSudden hearing loss in one or both ears Hearing loss with dizziness or vertigo Hearing loss with a severe headache Hearing loss after a head injury Hearing loss with facial weakness\n\nHe added: \"For gradual hearing loss, you should still get assessed, but it's less urgent. You should see your GP, who can examine your ears, remove wax if needed, and refer you to audiology for proper hearing tests.\"\n\nSimilarly, official guidance from the NHS states: \"There are lots of possible causes of hearing loss. It may be caused by something treatable or it may be permanent. Your symptoms may give you an idea what could be causing it. But do not self-diagnose, see a GP for advice.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFor more information, visit the NHS website here.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

He said that he had no information of his own on the source of the drone.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he did not know about the incident. Asked by reporters about Swedish officials linking the drone to the Russian ship, Mr Peskov said that \"it's quite absurd\" to claim that the drone was Russian just because a Russian ship was nearby.\n\nWestern officials say Russia is masterminding a campaign of sabotage and disruption across Europe with well over 100 incidents reportedly documented. Not all of them are public and it can sometimes take officials months to establish a link to Moscow.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWhile officials say the campaign - waged since Russia launched an all-out war against Ukraine in 2022 - aims to deprive Kyiv of support, they believe Moscow is also trying to identify Europe's weak spots and divert law enforcement resources."

Beatrice appeared deep in conversation with the curator Carrie Scott, while Edoardo spoke with Scott's partner, Nick Lazarus.\n\nHer younger sister, Princess Eugenie, was meanwhile spotted again stepping out in the capital this week, clutching a drink and a sandwich after visiting the popular chain Joe & The Juice.\n\nTwo days earlier, she was pictured having coffee with her husband Jack Brooksbank in Notting Hill. She is believed to have been enjoying a half-term trip in the Swiss resort of Gstaad with Jack, and their children August, five, and Ernest, two, when police turned up at Andrew's home on February 19.\n\nEugenie, 37, has also appeared to pause all publicity for her charity - The Anti-Slavery Collective - in the aftermath of the Epstein Files, with no new posts made on the official social media account for several weeks.\n\nRoyal expert Jennie Bond previously told the Mirror: “For Eugenie, things are even more complicated because she is such an ardent campaigner against slavery. And yet her father has been involved with a man who trafficked sex slaves – and Andrew has not apologised to those women. I imagine she feels her own integrity is at stake.”\n\nView 3 Images Sarah Ferguson is keeping a low profile - but may have been spotted at a wellness retreat in Ireland (Image: Chris Day/The Commercial Appeal / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images)\n\nMum Sarah Ferguson has been keen remain out of the public eye after embarrassing email exchanges between her and Jeffrey Epstein emerged in the latest release of files, but was claimed this week to have been sighted at a remote wellness retreat in Donegal, Ireland.\n\nAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor has meanwhile been banned from horse riding around the Sandringham estate following his arrest, according to new reports.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nRoyal aides are said to be concerned that the former prince being pictured grinning on horseback whilst under police investigation would be a \"bad look\".\n\nAndrew was arrested last week on suspicion of misconduct in public office following allegations he shared sensitive information with Jeffrey Epstein during his time as trade envoy.\n\nThe former prince has denied any wrongdoing."

And with the beginning of the month just around the corner, it's time to get cracking.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAs part of a \"monthly gardening checklist\", BBC Gardeners' World Magazine has said that now is the time to jot down your ideas. Its website urges people to \"tidy up borders\" and \"remove established and newly-germinating weeds.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn a video on the same website, Monty Don shows how to remove weeds by hand. And in the step-by-step guide, he said that the March job is probably easier than you think.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe explained: \"The important thing to realise is that weed is simply a plant in the wrong place.\"\n\nView 3 Images The gardening expert said it's a simple method to tackling weeds (Image: Kinga Krzeminska via Getty Images)\n\nLooking at a weed amongst peonies, he notes that there are nettles, dandelions and chickweed all growing around it - and these are all types of weeds. To get rid of them, \"you need an implement of some sort.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShowing a small, curved tool, he stresses: \"Quite honestly, anything will do. What matters is getting in there.\"\n\nHe takes the sharp tool, gently goes under the plant, and pulls out its roots. Easy.\n\nWhile some weeds can take a while to appear, others can grow easily and spread quickly. On the topic of chickweed, experts at RHS note that gardeners need to remember \"chickweed seeds spread easily on muddy boots and in topsoil and garden compost, so pay attention to good garden hygiene, and avoid moving soil from a patch where you have allowed chickweed to grow.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to dandelions, the RHS suggests that gardeners with borders and beds \"might want to limit their numbers if they are growing small or young plants that could be swamped or outcompeted by dandelions.\"\n\nAnd touching on stinging nettles, the experts say there is actually some \"good news\" as people \"can easily control the spread of stinging nettles by deadheading and removing seedlings.\"\n\nMonty says: \"It’s very important to do it now so they don’t seed and they don’t take over. The other thing about weeds is to do it a little bit at a time.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Do one metre properly, and that’s far better than doing 10 metres half-heartedly.\"\n\nView 3 Images Monty Don shared his advice for what we can do in March (Image: Getty)\n\nWhen it comes to these pesky plants, the Gardeners' World website also notes that you should \"clear old crops and weeds from the veg plot, then dig over the soil, mixing in compost as you go.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAnother March job is to \"dig over any gaps in borders, removing the roots of perennial weeds.\" You can watch Monty Don's guide to weeding here.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Now, Heathrow Airport has issued a reminder about some essential new requirements now in effect.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUnder the changes, an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) has become a legal necessity for certain people from this month. This £16 charge permits travellers to enter the UK for tourism, family visits and other purposes for up to six months.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, the major airport announced this week: \"Starting tomorrow, 25 February, whether your final destination is the UK or are connecting via Heathrow, eligible visitors will need an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation).\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Find out more on http://GOV.UK.\" It then also stressed: \"From 25 February, you can't legally travel without an Electronic Travel Authorisation.

            "content": "Tragic final days of Victoria Climbie, 8, who was starved and beaten to death\n\nVictoria Climbié's tragic case of brutal abuse and torture shocked the nation and led to major child protection reforms in the UK after she suffered at the hands of those meant to protect her\n\nView 4 Images Victoria Climbie suffered 128 injuries that led to her death (Image: Press Association)\n\nMore than 25 years has passed since the nation recoiled in horror at the barbaric death of an eight year old girl who endured unspeakable cruelty from those meant to care for her.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nStarved, battered, and restrained for months on end, Victoria Climbié eventually succumbed to 128 distinct injuries caused by her carers, Marie-Thérèse Kouao and Carl Manning, on February 25, 2005. Her killing prompted one of the most sweeping reforms of child safeguarding legislation in Britain.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nVictoria Adjo Climbié was born on November 2, 1991, in Abobo, Ivory Coast. She was the fifth of seven youngsters in an affectionate and nurturing household. As with countless parents across West Africa, her mum and dad were determined to secure the brightest future possible for her.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Marie Therese Kouao was handed a life sentence (Image: Press Association)\n\nIn 1999, when Victoria was merely seven, her great-aunt, Marie-Thérèse Kouao, proposed taking her to Europe, pledging she would gain a quality education.\n\nConvinced they were acting in their daughter's best interests, Victoria's parents consented. She initially landed in France, residing with Kouao for several months.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nYet Kouao's situation proved precarious, and following accommodation troubles, she opted to relocate to Britain. In April 1999, Kouao and Victoria touched down in London, where they settled with Carl Manning, Kouao's latest partner.\n\nShortly afterwards, Victoria's existence took a nightmarish twist. Rather than receiving the support her parents had envisaged, she endured appalling brutality.\n\nKouao and Manning routinely assaulted her with bicycle chains, belts, and even a hammer.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Carl Manning also received a life sentence (Image: Press Association)\n\nThey starved her and denied her warmth, compelling her to sleep in a freezing bathtub, restrained in bin bags. She was refused basic cleanliness, frequently left in her own waste, and experienced repeated violent attacks.\n\nKouao fabricated lies to disguise the maltreatment, claiming to others that Victoria was badly behaved or inhabited by evil spirits. Manning, a bus driver, subsequently confessed that he viewed Victoria as a \"soft target\" and would frequently strike her without provocation.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMissed opportunities\n\nVictoria had numerous interactions with social workers, medics, police, and even church personnel whilst suffering abuse. In July 1999, Victoria was brought to the Central Middlesex Hospital presenting severe scalding and contusions.\n\nA consultant suspected maltreatment and passed her case to social services. Nevertheless, Kouao persuaded officials that Victoria had inflicted the injuries upon herself. No additional measures were implemented.\n\nHaringey Social Services became involved on multiple occasions but neglected to conduct proper follow-up. A social worker called on Victoria but failed to examine the household circumstances comprehensively.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images There were multiple missed opportunities to save Victoria (Image: Met Police)\n\nDocumentation was mismanaged, and vital intelligence was disregarded. At one stage, a worried churchgoer escorted Victoria to a police station, but the officers neglected to probe deeper and simply handed her back to Kouao.\n\nA medic at North Middlesex Hospital voiced concerns about Victoria's state towards the end of 1999. Regrettably, his worries were dismissed, and Victoria was discharged.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFinal days\n\nBy the start of 2000, Victoria's health had taken a severe turn for the worse. She weighed a mere three stone and was riddled with wounds and scars.\n\nShe was critically undernourished and had sustained at least 128 distinct injuries.\n\nOn 24 February 2000, an unconscious Victoria, suffering from hypothermia and organ failure, was finally rushed to hospital. Despite the best efforts of medical staff, she passed away the following day, on 25 February, aged just eight.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA post-mortem examination laid bare the shocking extent of her injuries, with the pathologist characterising her condition as one of the most severe instances of child abuse ever documented in the UK.\n\nMarie-Thérèse Kouao and Carl Manning were apprehended and charged with murder. During the trial, Manning confessed to his part in the abuse, whilst Kouao maintained her innocence.\n\nIn January 2001, both were convicted and handed life sentences.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nReform\n\nIn the wake of Victoria's death, a public inquiry headed by Lord Laming revealed extensive failings throughout child protection services. The inquiry discovered that no fewer than 12 separate agencies had been engaged with Victoria's case yet had failed to respond adequately.\n\nThe report, released in 2003, triggered significant reforms, including:\n\nThe Every Child Matters initiative, which improved safeguarding policies for children.\n\nThe creation of Local Safeguarding Children Boards, ensuring better coordination between agencies.\n\nStronger accountability for social workers and professionals in child protection."

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

            "content": "Frank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

            "content": "Tyson Fury's comeback opponent, Arslanbek Makhmudov, has sensationally been filmed wrestling a bear ahead of their April bout.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on April 11.\n\nAnd 36-year-old Makhmudov, who has a 21-2 record and a knockout ratio of over 90 per cent, has been seen going to extreme measures to train himself up ahead of their meeting, including wrestling a 'three-metre tall and 400kg' brown bear.\n\nIn the video, Makhmudov can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm. The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "Benfica suspend five fans over 'racist' behaviour aimed at Vinicius Jnr as Portuguese club FINALLY act after standing firm in defence of Gianluca Prestianni amid racism row\n\nBenfica have suspended five members over 'racist' behaviour that scarred the club's ill-tempered Champions League clash with Real Madrid at the Estadio da Luz on February 17.\n\nAlthough disciplinary proceedings are still ongoing, five supporters have had their membership passes provisionally cancelled and face lifelong bans if found guilty of racist chants and discriminatory conduct in the stands.\n\nSocial media coverage emerged after the game showing vile scenes where fans appeared to make monkey gestures towards Madrid's Brazilian winger Vinicius Junior.\n\nThe Portuguese club were heavily criticised for their handling of the fallout following allegations of racism made by Vinicius against Benfica's Argentinian midfielder Gianluca Prestianni in the first leg of the play-off tie that night.\n\nBenfica's manager Jose Mourinho pointed the finger at Vinicius for what he felt was an overly-exuberant goal celebration, suggesting it had riled fans and opponents alike.\n\nThe club also tweeted in support of Prestianni and allowed him to travel to Madrid for the second leg of the tie, that Madrid went on to win, despite a provisional one-match UEFA ban.\n\nThere will be some relief, then, that they have now acted following online footage of fans appearing to mimic monkeys, while trying to catch Vinicius' attention.\n\nBenfica have suspended five fans over 'racist' behaviour aimed at Vinicius Junior after last week's game in Portugal (Pictured: Five fans, not necessarily those banned, goading Vinicius)\n\nThe now infamous moment where Gianluca Prestianni says something to Vinicius Jnr (left) from behind his shirt, which the Brazilian insists was racist in nature\n\nThis is so disgusting. You don't need any more proof. Vinicius got punished with a yellow card for dancing infront of these racist people.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, Benfica today said they won't carry out any investigation about the racist fans in their stadium.pic.twitter.com/1nbud0rlKo — LBW (@losblancoswrld) February 19, 2026\n\n'Benfica reaffirms that it does not tolerate any form of discrimination or racism and will continue to act firmly whenever behaviors that undermine the values ​​of the club, sport, and society are involved,' the club said in a statement.\n\nThe match in Lisbon was stopped for close to 10 minutes after Vinicius Jnr, 25, alleged that Prestianni had racially abused him following the Brazilian’s second-half goal. Referee Francois Letexier signalled the start of FIFA’s racial abuse protocol by crossing his wrists above his head.\n\nReal Madrid team-mate Kylian Mbappe claimed after the match that Prestianni had called Vinicius Jnr a 'monkey' five times.\n\nThe 20-year-old star has denied using racist language and instead claims he used the homophobic slur 'maricon', Spanish for 'f****t', in response to being taunted about his height.\n\nStanding at 5ft 5in, Prestianni is among the shortest players in the Champions League and was reported to have said he acted in retaliation after Vinicius referred to him as a dwarf.\n\n\n\nBoth racist and homophobic abuse are breaches of Article 14 of the UEFA's disciplinary rules, meaning Prestianni could be set for a lengthy ban regardless of whether his defence is believed."

            "content": "The previously unseen reaction from Geri Halliwell to her husband Christian Horner being booed by fans in the wake of his sex texting scandal has been revealed.\n\nHalliwell, 53, was a semi-regular fixture on race weekends alongside her husband, often appearing in the paddock at prominent races such as the British Grand Prix, before he was sacked as Red Bull chief during the last season.\n\nIn February 2024, the paddock was stunned by a leaked cache of suggestive messages purporting to be from Horner. Horner was later accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour by a female member of staff, with an internal investigation led by KCs twice clearing him of wrongdoing. Halliwell supported him throughout.\n\nRed Bull GmbH in Salzburg - the world champion team's parent company - said in a statement: 'The independent investigation into the allegations made against Mr Horner is complete, and Red Bull can confirm that the grievance has been dismissed.\n\n'The complainant has a right of appeal. Red Bull is confident that the investigation has been fair, rigorous and impartial.\n\n'The investigation report is confidential and contains the private information of the parties and third parties who assisted in the investigation, and, therefore, we will not be commenting further out of respect for all concerned. Red Bull will continue striving to meet the highest workplace standards.'\n\nGeri Halliwell's previously unseen reaction to Christian Horner being booed after his sex text scandal engulfed Formula One\n\nSpice Girl Halliwell stood by her husband (right) as he was subject to an internal investigation\n\nThe exact nature of the complaints remain unknown, but Horner was questioned by a KC for a full day at a secret location last year as the barrister gathered evidence that he wrote up in 150 pages for the Red Bull board's determination. Horner always denied the accusations.\n\nStill, at the F1 72 launch event at the O2 in February last year, fans opted to boo him vigorously as he took to the stage to carry out his speech.\n\nHe wore a grin, and said: 'It's a pleasure to be at the O2, anyway. I hope everyone is having a good night.'\n\nNetflix cameras, meanwhile, captured the reaction of Halliwell. The Spice Girl could be seen watching on, also smiling, but seemingly concerned for her husband.\n\nHorner told the documentary: 'When you become a serial winner the crowd and the audience, they don't wanna see that. In Formula One, there's this element of pantomime, we're now like the Kardashians on wheels.\n\n'But I'm way past even caring what other people think.\n\nHe later added: 'You have to be the pantomime villain. We are different, and that's what makes us who we are. This isn't a popularity contest it's Formula One and you're judged on the result sheets at the end of the day.\n\n'It's easier to be the hunter than the hunted and of course, for us, anything outside of total domination, is not good enough.' He would later repeat the villain line when sat in the audience.\n\nHorner was sacked from his role at Red Bull amid a suspected power struggle at the Thai-Austrian constructor\n\nAfter his speech, Horner was seen awkwardly looking for directions to his seat in the crowd.\n\nAs Horner was booed, Ferrari duo Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc watched on, as did Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Liam Lawson.\n\nHamilton, stunned, could be seen backstage saying 's***.' Lawson, meanwhile, said: 'I think we are going to get a lot of boos,' to which Verstappen replied: 'I don't give a f***.'\n\nHorner was also present at Red Bull's new car launch on February 15 - three days before the event at the O2 - and spoke for the first time since allegations came to light, claiming Geri had been 'very supportive' before insisting he would be present at the Bahrain curtain-raiser.\n\n'I have a very supportive family and a very supportive wife,' he said. 'My focus has been on the job and the season ahead.\n\n'There's been a day job to be getting on with. I feel the support within the business and our partners, and within the industry. It is overwhelming.\n\n'There's a process that's ongoing at the moment. Some allegations have been made, which I fully deny and I have fully complied with that process and will continue to do so until it's dealt with.\n\n'Everybody's focused on one thing, which is the performance of that car to go out and defend both the world titles that we've worked so hard to achieve over the last couple of years.\n\nA shocked Lewis Hamilton said 's***' as he heard the reaction to Horner's entrance at the O2\n\n'So the car is what everybody is invested in and I look forward to seeing it in action in Bahrain next week.'\n\n\n\nHorner won 13 world championships in charge of the team since taking over as a 31-year-old in 2005. Mid-way through the 2025 season, however, amid a suspected power struggle at the Thai-Austrian constructor - and one year on from his sex texting scandal - he was sacked, and eventually left the team in July after receiving an £80million package."

I did that at 35, I finished 11th, 12th. Who is in those positions now, probably Bournemouth, Brighton?\n\nGareth Southgate has hinted only a high-profile role would tempt him back into management\n\nThe former England boss has been away from the dugout since losing the Euro 2024 final\n\n'So I don’t feel the need to just go and do it to say I’ve managed in the Premier League.\n\n'I’ve had one of the biggest jobs in world football so I’ve been spoiled. Huge nights, working with outstanding players. No owner interfering.\n\n'The bit that, externally, people are saying is, \"well, he didn’t win\". So how do you prove that you can win? You’ve got to one of those big clubs.'\n\nTowards the end of his time with the national team, Southgate was criticised for failing to get over the line in major finals, with England still yet to win a major trophy since the World Cup in 1966.\n\nConfident he could take on a 'big' role in the top flight, Southgate added: 'Now we know those big clubs… do I think I could have done the job that some people who have been in those clubs recently have done? Could I do better? I think I could.\n\n'But we’ve talked about the baggage that comes with me as an appointment if you’re an owner.\n\n'And there’s a reality around (that), I can understand what that noise is. There’s that bit which makes me potentially a complicated appointment for a club.'\n\nKeen not to rush back into management, Southgate admitted: 'I don’t want to go and manage a different national team. Club? It’s honestly not what I’m looking to do.\n\n'Now, two years after leaving England, I’m not actively looking for a role in coaching. If that European final was the bit (in coaching) I wouldn’t worry about that.\n\n\n\n'Because there is another 15-20 years of my life ahead of me and I’m excited about a different video, a different movie, a different part of my life.'"

            "content": "Opta supercomputer reveals the favourite to win the Champions League - as one Premier League club has a slim ONE per cent chance of glory after knock-out stage draw\n\nThe Opta supercomputer has confirmed that Arsenal remain the favourites to claim their maiden Champions League trophy after the final draw for the knockout stages of the competition took place on Friday morning.\n\nMikel Arteta's side - who are still Premier League frontrunners after navigating a challenging winter spell - are in contention for an unprecedented quadruple this season after a run of consecutive near-misses in recent years.\n\nWhile chasing the league remains a priority for many Gunners fans after successive second-place finishes, the chance to gain major European silverware for the first time is a tempting motivation for the squad as they enter the business end of the season.\n\nAnd following Friday's draw, chances of making the final in Budapest appear to have only intensified, after the north London team were drawn against Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nShould they progress, their Blue pathway would see them then meet either Bodo/Glimt or Sporting Lisbon in the quarter-finals.\n\nTheir semi-final opponent could be one of the winners of either Newcastle versus Barcelona, or Atletico Madrid's meeting with Tottenham.\n\nArsenal remain on-track to break new ground at Europe's top table at the end of the season\n\nConveniently, the last 10 winners of the Champions League - Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid - are on the other 'Silver' pathway.\n\nDespite being drawn amongst a pack with a stronger European pedigree however, Bayern Munich are the closest contenders to spoil Arsenal's path, with Opta grading their 14.28 per cent chance of lifting the trophy second to the Gunners' 27.40 per cent chance.\n\nFans of the English game will be pleased to note that four of the top six clubs with the highest chance of claiming glory in Hungary are from the Premier League with Liverpool and Manchester City - who play Galatasaray and Real Madrid in the round of 16 respectively - the third and fourth-likeliest to win the Champions League.\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE PREDICTIONS Arsenal - 27.40 per cent chance Bayern Munich - 14.28 per cent chance Liverpool - 12.83 per cent chance Man City - 10.79 per cent chance Barcelona - 7.72 per cent chance Chelsea - 6.86 per cent chance Newcastle - 4.66 per cent chance Paris Saint-Germain - 4.64 per cent chance Real Madrid - 2.78 per cent chance Sporting Lisbon - 2.73 per cent chance Atletico Madrid - 2.00 per cent chance Tottenham - 1.22 per cent chance\n\nLiverpool, who would then play the winner of Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, have a 12.83 per cent chance, narrowly edging Man City, who have a 10.79 per cent chance.\n\nChelsea round out the cohort, with a significantly smaller 6.86 per cent chance, but the Blues will be confident heading into their match-up with the title-holders having beaten them roundly in the Club World Cup final last July.\n\nNewcastle just miss out on making the top six with their 4.66 per cent chance of winning the trophy, having navigated their way through a one-sided play-off match-up with Azerbaijan side Qarabag.\n\nThe remaining Premier League team still in play in Europe's top club competition, Tottenham, have a slender 1.22 per cent chance.\n\nIgor Tudor's injury-ravaged squad will likely throw full focus onto avoiding relegation one season on from winning the Europa League, with Atletico - who have a 2.00 per cent chance of winning the trophy - the favourites to make it into the quarter-finals.\n\nArsenal romped through the league phase to finish top of the table in the new-look model, with Liverpool, Man City, and Chelsea also qualifying automatically.\n\n\n\nOf the favourites for the title, only PSG were forced to endure a more arduous route to the round of 16, sneaking a win over two legs against Ligue 1 rivals Monaco 5-4 on aggregate."

Being blunt about everything that everyone thought wasn't right,' he added.\n\n'If you're five or six weeks in and you think he's not delivering, okay, then you have a point. But to throw out such strong opinions based on his first half hour, I thought, was inappropriate.'\n\nAfter Sterling's cameo appearance last Sunday, one Instagram account called FootballPark, boasting almost 100k followers, wrote that the ex-England international looked like 'Bambi on Ice' and even suggested he should consider retiring.\n\nThe author, who was by no means the only social media account ripping into the footballer, posted: 'Raheem Sterling's debut for Feyenoord was not exactly a success story – in fact, it looked like a veritable disaster from the Dutch club's point of view.\n\n'The English winger looked like Bambi on ice. On a downward spiral since 2022, lacking motivation, and seemingly unable to play under anyone who isn't named Pep Guardiola, Sterling is well and truly into his twilight years. Is it time to hang the boots up once and for all?'\n\nSterling's former Manchester City team-mate Jack Grealish jumped in to defend the 31-year-old star online, taking issue with the post.\n\n'What a f*****g stupid Instagram post man what's wrong with you guys. Guy hasn't played or trained for so long. Ppl like u guys is what wrong with the world. Have some respect,' he wrote."

            "content": "As James Milner reflected on becoming the Premier League's record appearance holder last weekend, his mind may have wondered back to last season - when a milestone that has long seemed inevitable felt like a distant dream.\n\nMilner was expected to be sidelined for only a few weeks after limping out of a draw with Arsenal in August 2024. However, complications with a routine knee operation meant that six months later he was still unable to lift his foot or toes.\n\n'Things change quickly in football, especially when you get to my age,' Milner recalled at Brighton's training ground this week, speaking to a group of reporters at a briefing to mark his incredible achievement.\n\n'When I look at where I was last year, not being able to lift my foot for six months...\n\n'I think most people, including the surgeon, the physio and those who understood the injury thought I was finished at my age.'\n\nAfter an arduous, near nine-month recovery, the 40-year-old - who celebrated his record with characteristic humility - returned from the bench for the final minutes of Brighton's game at Tottenham on the last day of the season.\n\nJames Milner became the Premier League's record appearance holder (654) last weekend\n\nMilner is now in his 24th consecutive Premier League season and is a legend of the league (pictured as a 16-year-old during his debut campaign for Leeds back in 2002-03)\n\nThe determination, professionalism and resilience required to battle back from a career-threatening injury are hallmarks of a man who made the first of his 654 Premier League appearances as a 16-year-old for Leeds United on November 10, 2002. That was nearly three years before his current midfield colleague, Jack Hinshelwood, was born.\n\n'It was that desire to prove people wrong that probably means I'm still playing now,' added Milner, who managed only four appearances in 2024-25.\n\n'I wanted to prove that I could recover from the injury and not let my career end in a way that wasn't in my control.\n\n'It might still might happen, but that was the drive. I don't think many people believed I could return.'\n\nMilner, who surpassed his former England, Man City and Aston Villa team-mate Gareth Barry to claim the record, boasts a resume that includes 61 England caps and impressive spells at Leeds, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Man City, Liverpool and Brighton - plus a brief loan stint at Swindon as a 17-year-old.\n\nHis enduring popularity and respect within the game was evident in the tributes that poured in last Saturday, and you'd be hard pressed to find fans of any of his former clubs with a negative word to say about him.\n\nMilner admitted his phone 'blew up' with messages, including one exchange with Barry, who he credits for encouraging him to take up yoga during the latter part of his career.\n\nDespite his age, Milner remains in exceptional condition, with no grey hairs in sight. His triceps strain against his training top, though he jokes his ankles crack when he tries to sneak quietly into his children's rooms to kiss them goodnight.\n\nHe is engaging company too, frequently drawing laughter with his self-deprecating humour.\n\nMilner pictured with previous record holder Gareth Barry in 2005 during their Aston Villa days\n\nHe suffered a career-threatening injury last season but battled back to take the record\n\nMilner's desire to prove doubters wrong has been a recurring theme throughout his career.\n\nPerhaps most notably, when Graeme Souness - then Newcastle manager - loaned him to Aston Villa for the 2005-06 campaign, he said: 'You won't win the league with James Milners'.\n\nSouness was dismissed the following February and Milner has gone on to win three Premier League titles - twice with Man City and once with Liverpool, where he also lifted the Champions League.\n\nIn spite of his achievements, the motivation burns as strongly as ever in a player who has worked under 21 managers.\n\n'You always have your doubters no matter what you achieve,' added Milner, who credits his father Peter for instilling that mentality. 'You want to be the best, and proving people wrong has always been at the forefront of my mind.'\n\nThis week, Milner was presented with three Guinness World Records; the most Premier League appearances (654), most consecutive Premier League seasons played (24), and the longest period between a player's first and last Premier League goals (22 years and 248 days).\n\nMilner has won three Premier League titles despite previously facing doubts over his ability\n\nMilner said he is 'very open' to signing a new contract at Brighton and playing another season\n\nHe may now have his sights on surpassing Teddy Sheringham's record as the oldest outfield player in Premier League history (40 years and 272 days). Milner is currently 40 years and 54 days old.\n\nThe midfielder is out of contract this summer, although Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has expressed a desire to keep him for another season. So what does the future hold?\n\n'I'm very open to playing another year,' Milner explained. 'Whether I will or not, I'm not sure. I haven't had any conversations with the club yet and they have to want me as well.\n\n'Earlier in the season, I said let's get to February and see where we're at. We're there now, so we'll see what happens. I'm just doing my work every day, and hopefully the last few games showed I can still contribute on the pitch.'\n\nMilner is undecided about moving into coaching when he eventually hangs up his boots, saying he plans to rest and take a break first. He insists he doesn't fear retirement, though he may miss the structure of professional football and could turn to marathons to give himself a new challenge.\n\nAs the conversation draws to a close, Milner believes the best individual season of his career came at Aston Villa. He ranks being part of the beginning of Man City's era of dominance and helping restore Liverpool to glory as his proudest achievements.\n\nAbove all, however, Milner is grateful.\n\n'When I was younger, if there was a bad first half, there could be teacups flying and walls punched in the dressing room,' he said.\n\n'Things have changed, but there's so much good in the game now as well. I just feel fortunate and lucky that I've played through, and been a part of, two eras.'\n\nYou would be foolish to write Milner off just yet."

Dutch kickboxing legend Verhoeven had been a potential opponent for Anthony Joshua before the Brit's return to the ring was delayed when he was involved in a fatal car crash last December.\n\nUsyk will take on Verhoeven in Egypt on May 23 with his WBC heavyweight title on the line. The Ukrainian said: “I truly respect people who reach the very top in their sport. Rico is one of them — a powerful athlete and a great champion. Being a champion isn’t just about belts.

But this is boxing — a different game, with its own rules and its own kings. I’m ready and really looking forward to meeting him in the ring. It’s going to be a unique experience for both of us, and I know the fans are excited too. A big night is coming!”\n\nVerhoeven, who has had just one professional boxing fight 12 years ago, added: “I spent 12 years as the undisputed heavyweight kickboxing champion and accomplished everything I set out to accomplish. But staying at the top for that long didn't take away the hunger, it strengthened it.\n\n\"I wasn’t looking for comfort, so I started looking for the highest challenge available in another world. Usyk is undisputed in boxing. That’s the kind of challenge that motivates me. Undisputed versus undisputed. The best facing the best.”\n\nVerhoeven defended his heavyweight title in June last year, defeating former two-time light heavyweight champion Artem Vakhitov by unanimous decision before announcing his departure from the sport in November after 76 fights and 66 wins."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nBRADENTON, Fla. -- The first time Konnor Griffin visited Maven Baseball Lab in Atlanta, he did something no one there had ever seen. Since opening in 2022, Maven has assessed thousands of baseball players with force plates that use sensors to measure the amount of energy being transferred into the ground during a swing. Griffin was the top-ranked 16-year-old in the country, a 6-foot-4, 200-pound specimen, and the plate was no match for him.\n\nThough the plate was anchored into a portable frame that had withstood swings from perennial major league All-Stars and MVP-caliber players, the force Griffin was creating jarred it loose, cajoling it out of place. Once the awe of onlookers subsided, they scrambled to place 45-pound weights on each side of the plate, hopeful that would suffice in keeping Griffin from wrecking the setup. It did, though those at Maven learned that day what others in the world of Major League Baseball have in the years since: It's damn near impossible to keep Konnor Griffin -- and anything he touches -- down.\n\n\"You're looking at a Ferrari,\" said Tyler Krieger, the co-owner of Maven and a former Cleveland minor leaguer. \"You're not looking at a little Fiat.\"\n\nThis spring, the Pittsburgh Pirates are endeavoring to figure out whether they're ready to take their F40 for a spin. Now 19 years old -- and the No. 1 prospect in the game after a tour de force 2025 in which he dominated three levels and was the consensus Minor League Player of the Year -- Griffin entered camp with an opportunity to win Pittsburgh's every-day shortstop job. Regardless of whether he secures an Opening Day roster spot, Griffin will debut at some point this season and join Paul Skenes as the best pair of young players on any team in baseball.\n\nAnd until the Pirates make that decision, the eyes of the baseball world will be trained on Bradenton. Griffin represents more than a glimmer of hope for a woebegone organization. He is the dream of any franchise: top-of-the-scale power and speed, with a nifty glove and a shotgun-blast arm, the kind of work ethic that will make any slacker in his orbit feel like a lout, and a demeanor so polite and accommodating that the words \"yes\" and \"sir\" might as well be surgically attached to one another.\n\nNow, two years after missing out on earning a first-round draft pick because they kept Skenes in the minor leagues to start the season -- after he won the National League Rookie of the Year, they would have been awarded the pick through the prospect promotion incentive program -- the Pirates face a similar conundrum with Griffin. It's not exactly apples to apples. Skenes spent three years in college and was two weeks shy of his 22nd birthday when he arrived in May 2024. Griffin would be the first teenage hitter to debut on Opening Day since Ken Griffey Jr. in 1989.\n\nThe Pirates are nonetheless entertaining the possibility -- because they have postseason aspirations, sure, but more because Griffin is forcing them to. Inviting him to major league camp last spring just seven months after selecting him in the 2024 MLB draft, then watching him smash an opposite-field home run in his first Grapefruit League game, intimated the Pirates were open to fast-tracking Griffin, but to suggest anyone foresaw what followed -- a .333/.415/.527 line with 21 home runs, 65 stolen bases and sterling shortstop defense across Single-A, High-A and Double-A -- would be wrong. This, as those at Maven will attest, is something different.\n\nWhat it breeds is an all-timer of a cost-benefit analysis. Griffin could immediately be a star ... and he also could struggle with the truth that baseball excellence is far from linear. He possesses immense and magnificent tools ... and has under 100 plate appearances above Single-A. He could help Pittsburgh this year ... and if next season is lost due to a work stoppage and as part of an eventual deal the time to free agency is reduced from six years of service, his tenure as a Pirate could be even shorter-lived.\n\nThere are no clear answers, not this early in the spring, not even after Griffin's two-homer barrage Tuesday against the Boston Red Sox. Time is the ultimate judge. And with Opening Day a month away, Griffin has a finite amount in which to convince the Pirates that the benefit outweighs the cost.\n\n\"I fully trust what the front office and the coaches and everybody have done, how they're going about it,\" Griffin said. \"They've done a great job so far allowing me to be free in the minor leagues and be able to move and continue to face challenges. But this spring, I'm really trying not to think about it too much. There's a lot of noise. I'm just trying to treat it just like I did last spring. I knew I had no chance of just making the big league team. And so every day I was just trying to be a sponge and soak up the advice of these great players who've been through it. And I'm trying to do the same thing this year. I know there could be a chance I make the big leagues at some point soon, and that's great, but I just want to feel ready.\"\n\nIN LATE 2022, Paul Skenes met Konnor Griffin for the first time. After transferring from the Air Force Academy to LSU, Skenes was a few months from turning in one of the best seasons in college baseball history, capped by a College World Series win and being taken with the No. 1 selection in the amateur draft. Griffin already had reclassified to graduate high school a year early and was LSU's top recruiting target, a can't-miss kid the coaching staff knew would likely get poached in the draft before he set foot on campus. Still, the cachet of having a player of Griffin's talent even committed made the juice worth the squeeze.\n\nTwo other recruits accompanied Griffin in Baton Rouge that day -- and when they saw Skenes, they went full fanboy, asking for photos. Griffin did not.\n\n\"And I had so much respect for that,\" Skenes said. \"He had the presence. It's a feel thing. It's such a small world, and he probably knew at some point he would see me again.\"\n\nBreaking News from Jeff Passan Download the ESPN app and enable Jeff Passan's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here.\n\nThe two reconnected after Griffin slid to the Pirates with the ninth pick in the 2024 draft, met again last spring and have chatted more during Griffin's ascent toward the big leagues. Skenes' opinion of Griffin has only grown brighter. A top pick in the draft, the No. 1 prospect in the game -- few understand the deluge of hype, the potholes on the road to success, quite like them. And Skenes, a 23-year-old who carries himself like a 10-year veteran, can't get past the way Griffin conducts himself as a teenager.\n\n\"Goes to church every Sunday, doesn't cuss, doesn't do any of that stuff, married at 19,\" Skenes said. \"It's not common, but nothing about him is common. Everything screams uncommon. And if you want to be uncommon, you want to do uncommon things, it starts with thinking uncommon -- and he does that.\"\n\nThe uniqueness dates back to before Griffin was a teenager. His father, Kevin, is a longtime coach who had turned the softball team at Belhaven University -- a Division III college in Jackson, Mississippi, with an enrollment of around 1,000 undergraduates -- into a powerhouse. Konnor, the second of his three sons, was the tallest, strongest and fastest of his peers. Recruiting services pegged him as a future star at 12 years old. Agents chased him around the South, hoping to advise him. He latched on with Excel Sports, whose client Corey Dickerson, an 11-year major leaguer and Mississippi native, invited Griffin to a hitting session when he was 14 and already playing varsity at Jackson Prep as an eighth grader.\n\n\"At that point,\" said Josh DeMoney, the hitting coach they worked with that day, \"Corey's been in probably seven or eight seasons in the big leagues. And Konnor's going toe-to-toe with him every swing at 14 years old.\"\n\nGriffin found comfort with DeMoney, whose Grit Training facility in Flowood, Mississippi, was a two-minute drive from Jackson Prep. Kevin would accompany his son to hitting sessions and throw batting practice right-handed, and DeMoney countered from the left side. They would crank up a pitching machine to spit out fastballs with velocities that, accounting for the machine sitting 38 feet from the plate, were equivalent to hitting pitches of 100 to 105 mph.\n\n\"One thing that I look for is how quick a player can make adjustments,\" DeMoney said. \"You literally could tell Konnor, 'All right, try this,' and he would do it the first swing. He is very cerebral and very advanced. Some kids it takes a month or even a whole season to figure something out.\"\n\nThe 2026 Fantasy Baseball Draft Guide Rankings, tips, stats, strategy and more. Everything you need for the 2026 fantasy baseball season is here!\n\nCheck out the Draft Guide today! >>\n\nBaseball came naturally to Griffin. His physicality allowed him to dominate other sports -- he was featured on \"You Got Mossed\" as a freshman in high school after outjumping three defenders to snag a football -- but his love of baseball ran deep. The sounds, the smells -- even more than that, he said, the constant failures, which made the successes feel that much richer.\n\nGriffin became a regular at DeMoney's facility, running from midweek road basketball games to hitting sessions that didn't start until 10 or 11 p.m. Griffin's reclassification, in which he moved from the class of 2025 to 2024, forced him to take extra classes and attend summer school. Neither deterred Griffin; if this was the price to reach professional baseball sooner, he would gladly pay it. For years, he spent his weekends traveling around the country playing games and using off weeks to improve, like his five-hour treks from central Mississippi to Atlanta for maintenance sessions at Maven.\n\nUnable to quibble with his production, evaluators nitpicked Griffin's swing, wondering aloud about his hit tool. Sometimes he did overstride, his weight crashing forward and making him susceptible to strikeouts. At Maven, Griffin would take 12 swings on a force plate with motion-capture cameras recording his every movement and an algorithm would spit out weaknesses that coaches would devise drills to cure.\n\nGriffin needed to anchor his back leg into the ground to keep from almost leaping forward. He tightened up his swing, allowing his back elbow to guide the movement of his hands and carry his bat through the strike zone. With his hit tool cleaned up, he entered the 2024 draft with no discernible weaknesses. The power was extraterrestrial, the speed blazing enough to steal 87 bases in 88 tries during his final high school season, the glove in center field arguably even better than at shortstop, the arm good enough to pump 97 off the mound and warrant consideration as an early-round pitching prospect, too. Griffin won Gatorade National High School Player of the Year, then heard eight names -- all college players -- called before his in the draft.\n\nThe Pirates haggled with Griffin until the signing deadline, when he agreed to a $6.5 million signing bonus, nearly $300,000 over the assigned slot value. He played all of 2025 at 19 years old -- Griffin will turn 20 on April 24 -- and ingratiated himself as much with who he is as what he does.\n\n\"There's nothing bad you can say about him,\" said Pirates outfielder Jake Mangum, who graduated from Jackson Prep a decade before Griffin. \"Genuinely, he is an amazing dude that works really hard and does everything the right way. Mix that together with the talent he has, it's going to be something special. He works like he has no talent at all, and it's a really cool combo.\"\n\nFEW ORGANIZATIONS IN baseball suffer as many self-inflicted wounds as the Pirates. It's not just the bad trades of past front office regimes and decades of paltry payrolls, either. It's the removal of Bucco Bricks and replacing Roberto Clemente's retired number on the right-field wall with an ad for alcohol-spiked iced tea. More than anything, though, it's the lack of winning. The Pirates last made the postseason in 2015. Their last NL Central title came in 1992, Barry Bonds' final season in Pittsburgh.\n\nAnd for as great as Andrew McCutchen and Brian Giles were, Griffin is the organization's most talented position player since the home run king. Thirty-five years of pain doesn't vanish overnight, but a team that pairs Griffin with offseason lineup additions Brandon Lowe, Ryan O'Hearn and Marcell Ozuna could cause the biggest shock of all: a Pirates fan base that isn't openly hostile to owner Bob Nutting's skinflint spending. Complement those bats with a rotation featuring Skenes, Bubba Chandler, Braxton Ashcraft and Mitch Keller, with Jared Jones returning from Tommy John surgery and left-hander Hunter Barco and right-hander Antwone Kelly big-league-ready, and the Pirates could find themselves in postseason contention should they take their 26 best players back north. And Griffin, clearly, is among them on merit alone.\n\nESPN is now the home of MLB.TV All MLB out-of-market games. Live or On Demand. All in one place. Get access\n\n\"It absolutely says something about what we're trying to do,\" Skenes said. \"I mean, we haven't gone out and gotten a shortstop this offseason. I think they're going to give him a shot, but he needs to play well enough. And he knows that.\n\n\"I say this all the time to guys that are trying to come up: You make the team, and then what? Is that it? I know that's not how he's thinking now. There's a timeline on it for him. So for him, it's not about playing well and making the team. That doesn't matter. The only person that knows how good he can be is him. And even I don't think he knows exactly how good he can be, but there are a lot of expectations and people are saying a lot about him, and I hope he doesn't see that and read into it and try to fulfill those expectations rather than just be the best Konnor Griffin that Konnor Griffin can be. If he does, then he will learn from that. And the Pirates are going to be in a really good spot.\"\n\nThe easiest solution to Pittsburgh's dilemma is to take service time out of the equation. At some point this spring, the Pirates are expected to approach Griffin with a long-term contract extension, sources said. For comparison, Boston Red Sox outfielder Roman Anthony -- the No. 1 prospect in baseball entering last year -- spent the season's first two months at Triple-A as a 21-year-old. Less than two months later, he signed an eight-year, $130 million extension.\n\nGriffin's calculus is different. A debut at 19 would mean free agency at 25. The two most astounding contracts in baseball history were lavished on players who arrived in the majors as teenagers: Alex Rodriguez's $252 million deal with the Texas Rangers that doubled the previous highest guarantee, and Juan Soto's $765 million contract with the New York Mets that nearly did the same. The Pirates know that to lock up Griffin -- to nullify the years of trauma that have Pittsburgh fans reflexively counting down the days until he's traded or leaves in free agency -- will take a never-before-seen type of deal. The very type the Pirates have never bestowed on a player.\n\n\"Konnor looks at himself completely different than people look at him,\" DeMoney said. \"He's always thinking that he needs to get better. He's always trying to improve on something. He doesn't look at himself as a No. 1 prospect. Obviously, he knows it and it's all over the place, but his mindset is he is always trying to find ways to get better at the game and develop. You would think that could get to your head as a 19-year-old kid. And it doesn't even faze him. He doesn't even think about it. He is still working just as hard as when he was a kid trying to get to that spot.\"\n\nEven if a long-term deal that would guarantee Griffin's place in the middle of the lineup Opening Day doesn't get done, the Pirates don't necessarily have to play the service-time game. Though it's true that keeping him in the minor leagues for at least two weeks to start the season would ensure they control him through 2032 instead of 2031, the desire to win now -- to win back a generation of lost fans -- and the PPI program are strong enough incentive to warrant him helping raise the Jolly Roger in April.\n\nEither way, Griffin won't allow a decision that's ultimately out of his hands to dictate his mood. Nor will he rest on the past successes that have led to the spotlight on his every move as baseball's next teenage phenom.\n\n\"It was wonderful getting all those awards and really just brought the whole year together,\" Griffin said, \"but what I worked on was kind of closing that yearbook, taking everything I've learned and continuing to put in the work to prepare for what's to come. I haven't made it to the big leagues yet, and that's what matters. Awards in the minor leagues are great, but they're even better when you're in the big leagues.\n\n\"I always tell people my goal is to be in the Hall of Fame, and if I can make the Hall of Fame, then I'll sit back and be happy and be complacent. But right now I'm just trying to grow.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nSpring training camps are underway, which means it is time to look at the state of baseball. As part of our 2026 MLB season preview, ESPN's Buster Olney surveyed those around the industry to help him rank the top 10 players at every position as part of his annual positional ranking series.\n\nToday, we cap the series by ranking the best of the best at designated hitter.\n\nThe objective of this exercise is to identify the best players for the 2026 season, not who might be best in five years or over their career. We rolled out a position per day over two weeks. Here's the rest of the schedule: starting pitchers (Feb. 16), relief pitchers (Feb. 17), catchers (Feb. 18), first basemen (Feb. 19), second basemen (Feb. 20), third basemen (Monday), shortstops (Tuesday), corner outfielders (Wednesday), center fielders (Thursday).\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has a lot of options to sort through at the top of his lineup, juggling Freddie Freeman, Mookie Betts and now Kyle Tucker, whose four-year deal will pay him a record $57.1 million average annual salary. But Roberts is settled on this: Shohei Ohtani will be the leadoff hitter again, whether he's serving as the designated hitter or the Dodgers' starting pitcher.\n\nOhtani likes the idea of getting everything started, of getting into the game, Roberts said last year, and you cannot argue with the results: Ohtani has scored 280 runs over the past two seasons, by far the most in the big leagues. Over his past three seasons -- his final year with the Los Angeles Angels and his first two seasons with the Dodgers -- he has 153 home runs and an adjusted OPS+ of 184.\n\nIt shouldn't be any surprise, then, to find him at the top of our list of the top 10 designated hitters in MLB this upcoming season.\n\nTop 10 designated hitters\n\n1. Shohei Ohtani, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nHe went through some postseason struggles last year, and opposing pitchers will undoubtedly try to follow the script created by the Phillies in October -- Ohtani went 1-for-18 with nine strikeouts in the National League Division Series against them -- but he is known for his adjustments. Ohtani is an equal-opportunity masher, as borne out by some of his regular-season splits from 2025:\n\nHome OPS: 1.010\n\nRoad OPS: 1.018\n\nFirst half OPS: .988\n\nSecond half OPS: 1.054\n\nInnings 1-3 OPS: 1.019\n\nInnings 4-6: .979\n\nInnings 7-9 1.041\n\nOPS vs. starting pitchers: .977\n\nOPS Vs. relievers: 1.071\n\nOPS in high-leverage situations: 1.123\n\nMedium leverage: .975\n\nLow leverage: 1.021\n\n2. Kyle Schwarber, Philadelphia Phillies\n\nSchwarber was rewarded for his investment in his teammates and his work ethic, which has driven his improvements over the course of his career. A couple of years ago, Schwarber aimed to get better against fastballs, and now he has become one of the best fastball hitters of his generation.\n\nAgainst four-seam fastballs in his career:\n\n2023: .235 BA, .548 SLG\n\n2024: .222 BA, .493 SLG\n\n2025: .286 BA, .759 SLG\n\nAnd his improvement against lefties is ridiculous:\n\n2023: .758 OPS\n\n2024: .898 OPS\n\n2025: .964 OPS\n\nSchwarber turns 33 next month, and the idea that a DH-only player would get a $150 million deal, as he did over this winter, might have been unthinkable once. But given Schwarber's power, command of the strike zone, effort to get better and clubhouse impact, the thought of fielding a team without him must've been unthinkable for Phillies owner John Middleton.\n\n3. Yordan Alvarez, Houston Astros\n\nHouston is committed to keeping him at DH because of his injury issues in recent seasons -- he missed 48 games in 2023 and 114 games last year, including the last two weeks of the season as the Astros fought for a playoff spot. His slugging percentage dipped to a career-low .430 last season, and his adjusted OPS to 121. With a very right-handed lineup, Houston desperately needs the left-handed-hitting Alvarez to impact opponents again.\n\n4. George Springer, Toronto Blue Jays\n\nRanking MLB's best at every position As a new baseball season approaches, Buster Olney compares the elite at every spot on the diamond. Top 10s for 2026 »\n\nSpringer enters the last year of his six-year, $150 million contract with the Jays at 36 years old, and he's at the stage of his career where he'll be playing for another contract, if he wants that. But what he did last year was pretty spectacular: Only Aaron Judge and Ohtani, two of the game's biggest stars, had a higher wRC+ than Springer's 166, and he had a .309/.399/.560 slash line to go with it. Springer played 54 games in the outfield last season, but with Anthony Santander out for most of the year and with Addison Barger and Nathan Lukes manning the corners for the Jays, Toronto can reduce the grind on Springer's legs by keeping him at DH.\n\n5. Brent Rooker, Athletics\n\nAfter a 39-homer campaign in 2024 resulted in a contract extension that keeps him with the A's through 2029, Rooker compiled 73 extra-base hits last season, including 30 homers. The right-handed masher is a perfect hitter to line up behind the left-handed hitting Nick Kurtz, forcing opposing managers to make difficult choices; Rooker hammered left-handed pitchers last year for a .293/.385/.500 triple slash line.\n\n6. Yandy Diaz, Tampa Bay Rays\n\nTampa Bay exec Erik Neander has constantly turned over his roster to manage payroll, trading everyone from Blake Snell to Tyler Glasnow to Brandon Lowe. But Diaz remains -- this will be his eighth year with Tampa Bay -- partly because of his team-friendly contract but also because of his offensive impact. Over the past four years, he has compiled 13.4 WAR, a .379 OBP and an OPS+ of 138.\n\n7. Christian Yelich, Milwaukee Brewers\n\nManager Pat Murphy's priority is to keep Yelich's bat in the lineup, so it appears his days as an every-day outfielder are over. Yelich, who had a .795 OPS and 121 OPS+ last season, is entering his 14th season in the majors and approaching some benchmarks -- he needs 259 more hits for 2,000 in his career, and another 17 homers for 250.\n\n8. Giancarlo Stanton, New York Yankees\n\nAaron Judge is the leader of this team, but some players in the clubhouse say that the impact Stanton's words have on his teammates cannot be overstated. He has played 120 or more games only once since 2019, but he does damage when he's in the lineup -- Stanton had 24 homers and an OPS+ of 162 in 77 games last season. He's within range of 500 career homers, needing 47 more, with two years (plus a $25 million team option) left on his Yankees' contract.\n\n9. Kerry Carpenter, Detroit Tigers\n\nESPN is now the home of MLB.TV All MLB out-of-market games. Live or On Demand. All in one place. Get access\n\nDespite dealing with hamstring issues throughout last season, Carpenter still did big-time damage at the plate, with 18 doubles and 26 homers. He came off the bench in 21 of his 130 games, as Tigers manager A.J. Hinch worked to get the slugger as many matchups as possible against right-handed pitching -- he went .257/.300/.512 vs. righties and .217/.238/.400 vs. lefties last season. As Kevin McGonigle and Max Clark lengthen the Detroit lineup, Carpenter is likely to have more opportunities with runners on base.\n\n10. Ivan Herrera, St. Louis Cardinals\n\nMy colleague Paul Hembekides strongly believes Herrera should be much higher on this list, after a really nice offensive season last year -- a .373 on-base percentage and an adjusted OPS of 136 in 107 games. However, Herrera does not have as much of a track record as the players in front of him.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nSalvador Perez, Kansas City Royals: With Carter Jensen ascending to the big leagues and Vinnie Pasquantino at first and Jac Caglianone developing in the outfield, it's not clear how Perez, who hit 30 homers last season, will be used this year. But he had 38 games at DH in 2025, and that number is likely to grow in 2026.\n\nEugenio Suarez, Cincinnati Reds: He hit 49 homers last season between the Diamondbacks and Mariners, and he still had to wait until late in the winter to sign a one-year deal with the Reds -- probably due to his high strikeout rate and below-average defense.\n\nJurickson Profar, Atlanta Braves: He has made it clear this spring that he prefers to play the outfield, but it's hard to imagine Atlanta catering to a player who missed half of last season because of a PED suspension. Profar's defensive metrics in left field were also well below average in 2025, which informed the Braves' decision to sign Mike Yastrzemski to play alongside Michael Harris II and Ronald Acuña Jr. in the outfield.\n\nMLB's top 5 breakout teams for 2026 Which teams are about to get a whole lot better? We break down five potential breakouts.\n\nBradford Doolittle »\n\nRyan O'Hearn, Pittsburgh Pirates: He had a really nice season last year with a .281/.366/.437 slash line, with only 50 of his games coming at DH. But he might best fit Pittsburgh's lineup now at this spot.\n\nSamuel Basallo, Baltimore Orioles: His bat speed is unreal, and his power is immense. At just 21 years old, it'll be really interesting to see how Baltimore manager Craig Albernaz chooses to develop Basallo behind the plate and as a major league hitter."

Spokesperson Chris Page said the Ann Arbor PD was \"just recently made aware\" of the allegations, which stem from a Dec. 5, 2024, incident while Lewis was on the Michigan football staff.\n\nLewis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ESPN has contacted Michigan for comment.\n\nKaren Truszkowski, the woman's attorney, told ESPN that her client filed an incident report with the Ann Arbor PD and applied for a protective order against Lewis earlier this week.\n\nTruszkowski said her client and Lewis met on a dating app and started communicating in July 2024, while Lewis was an assistant defensive line coach at Michigan. Lewis' behavior \"became increasingly aggressive\" over text and phone calls, Truszkowski said.\n\nThe two met in person for the first time at Weber's Hotel in Ann Arbor in December 2024, where Truszkowski said Lewis was supposed to give back goods her client had given him. At the hotel, Lewis raped and battered her client, according to the attorney.\n\nIn January 2025, officers from the Milford Police Department, north of Ann Arbor, responded to a call to the woman's home after neighbors heard raised voices, according to the incident report obtained by ESPN. Both Lewis and the woman told officers at the time that they had gotten into a verbal argument that was not physical, according to the report.\n\nThe woman told police that Lewis was a coach at Michigan and \"stated that she didn't want to talk about it,\" according to the incident report. No charges were filed.\n\nThe attorney said Lewis physically abused her client during that incident, but she was too afraid to tell police at the time.\n\nThe allegations against Lewis were first reported Thursday night by Darko State Media. The Falcons hired Lewis on Feb. 10 after coaching stints at Michigan, Toledo and UConn. He played defensive line at Tennessee and spent three seasons in the NFL.\n\nThe allegations against Lewis emerged less than three weeks after Falcons player James Pearce Jr. was arrested in Florida. The linebacker is facing five felony charges stemming from an alleged incident on Feb. 7 where he crashed his vehicle into a car driven by his ex-girlfriend and WNBA player Rickea Jackson and struck a police officer with his vehicle to start a subsequent chase."

The Heisman runner-up had to issue an apology after posting a message that included \"F-All THE VOTERS\" on social media.\n\nBut Pavia said his demeanor and approach are what made him a good leader at Vanderbilt. And his confidence, he said, comes from being constantly counted out in life, including when he started his career in junior college.\n\nThat has turned out to be a credit to him in his quest to make it in the NFL, he said.\n\n\"I feel like a lot of teams love the tenacity, the fight,\" he said. \"The life of an underdog, that's for sure. And, so, they ask questions. But you go back, you look at my record, ain't nothing on my record.\"\n\nHe added, \"I just want everyone to know what's true about me is I'm humble and I get my confidence from my process. And if you saw how much I put into this, you would see where I get my confidence.\"\n\nAnother thing NFL teams will need to weigh is Pavia's lack of size. He measures under 5-foot-10, a big detriment at the position in the NFL. But playing at that size against elite competition is nothing new, he said.\n\n\"I would just say turn on the tape,\" Pavia said. \"It's not like we're not playing these guys that are going first-round, second-round [picks] on Saturdays in the SEC. So, the SEC and the Big Ten probably have the most guys getting drafted in the first, second round. So, we're playing those guys and ain't nothing going to change.\""

            "content": "Louis Riddick raves about why he thinks Ty Simpson has earned a spot as a top-15 pick in the 2026 NFL draft. (0:57)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Former Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson said Friday at the NFL combine that he is prepared to show NFL talent evaluators that he is a \"franchise quarterback.''\n\nSimpson is the No. 25 player overall on ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr.'s Big Board and the No. 2 quarterback behind Indiana's Fernando Mendoza (the No. 1 player overall). Simpson was asked at the combine Friday about his readiness to be an NFL starter. He said he has conveyed his confidence in his abilities to team personnel during the sit-down interviews in Indianapolis.\n\n\"First off, I think I'm ready, I'm a franchise quarterback,'' Simpson said. \"Alabama prepares you the most for the NFL ... The Alabama locker room is as close to an NFL locker room as you can get.''\n\nSimpson said he is healthy after battling some nagging injuries down the stretch this past season, including to his lower back and elbow as well as a fractured rib. He plans to throw Saturday during the on-field workout for quarterbacks. Mendoza is not expected to throw Saturday, so Simpson will be Kiper's highest-ranked quarterback to participate in the combine workout.\n\n\"It's why I decided to throw and why I'm excited about it,'' Simpson said of his health.\n\nHe also addressed his significant weight loss toward the end of the season -- he went from about 210 pounds to just over 190 pounds due to what some in the league have said was a case of gastritis -- and outlined his pre-combine regimen to be prepared for the combine and the draft.\n\n\"Lot of eating, lot of three meals, four meals a day,'' Simpson said of his combine prep. \"Lot of shakes, just getting in a routine of getting up in the morning, eating, drinking chocolate milk, eating lunch, eating the right meal, adding a shake to that, dinner, eating, adding a salad, just sticking to that.''\n\nHe was a one-year starter for the Crimson Tide (11-4) and finished with 3,567 yards passing with 28 touchdowns and five interceptions. But Simpson had 21 of his touchdown passes without an interception over his first eight games of the season and struggled some, including with the injuries. over the second half of the season as well as in the postseason with seven touchdowns to go with the five interceptions over the last six games.\n\nSome scouts have pointed to some struggles in the SEC championship game, a 28-7 loss to Georgia when Simpson was 19-of-39 passing as well as a 38-3 loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff when Simpson was 12-of-16 for 67 yards.\n\nBut Simpson said Friday he has met with most teams who have needs at quarterback, including the Steelers, Arizona Cardinals and New York Jets. And when asked about the second half of last season, he has been direct in his responses with scouts and coaches.\n\nOn his meeting with the Steelers, Simpson said \"I love Coach [Mike] McCarthy, I love the Steelers.'' He added he hasn't paid much attention to player rankings or quarterback rankings as the draft approaches.\n\n\"It matters what happens April 24th and 25th,'' Simpson said. \"Knowing no matter where I'm projected, where I go, they're going to get the best Ty Simpson.''"

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

Government remains committed to supporting private enterprises to grow and create sustainable jobs.\"\n\nHe stressed that waste management companies play an important role in safeguarding public health while simultaneously providing large-scale employment opportunities.\n\nHighlighting the government's proposed 24-hour economy policy, the Minister indicated that companies capable of sustaining continuous operations would receive strategic attention and support.\n\n\"The government is committed to creating value and supporting private businesses, especially under the 24-hour economy framework.\n\n\"Zoomlion is a strong example of the type of organisation we are looking to support, and this visit helps us better appreciate the scale of their work,\" he noted.\n\nAccording to him, initiatives that prioritise worker safety, environmental sustainability, and employment generation align directly with the government's economic transformation agenda.\n\n\"We are not pushing people to rush into waste management, but we will provide incentives for those willing to invest in the sector. Zoomlion is doing remarkable work and has enormous potential,\" he added.\n\nThe Minister further disclosed that the company's nationwide presence through numerous subsidiaries and operational facilities has contributed significantly to youth employment, noting that approximately 200,000 Ghanaians have benefited from opportunities created across the sanitation value chain.\n\nHe emphasised that facilities such as ACARP could benefit substantially from policies aimed at boosting productivity through round-the-clock operations.\n\n\"We are pursuing a reset agenda while supporting the 24-hour economy to function effectively. Organisations such as Zoomlion represent areas where government support can have a significant national impact,\" he said.\n\nThe Chief Operating Officer of the Environment and Sanitation Cluster of the Jospong Group of Companies, Mrs Florence Larbi, highlighted the company's transformation over the past two decades.\n\nShe explained that Zoomlion has evolved from basic waste collection into a comprehensive waste value-chain operator covering collection, storage, transfer, recycling, and treatment services.\n\nWith 36 waste treatment facilities across Ghana, including medical, liquid, and solid waste processing plants, the company now provides sanitation services to households and institutions nationwide.\n\n\"We have come a long way, and today we are proud to serve almost every household in Ghana,\" she said.\n\nShe added that the company remains well-positioned to support large-scale national sanitation initiatives, including youth employment programmes.\n\nThe Managing Director of Zoomlion Ghana Limited, Mrs. Doris Kweikwor Adjei, expressed appreciation to the Minister and his delegation, describing the visit as a strong affirmation of collaboration between government and the private sector.\n\n\"Your visit reinforces that labour is not only about policy discussions but about people, dignity, and the employment opportunities created for Ghanaians,\" she said.\n\nShe assured the delegation of the company's continued commitment to building a disciplined and motivated workforce capable of contributing meaningfully to Ghana's economic growth.\n\n\"We will not only clean Ghana but also continue to develop a workforce that supports national productivity and development,\" she added.\n\nOther management members of the Jospong Group present included Executive Director of the Environment and Sanitation Cluster, Mrs. Gloria Opoku Anti; Chief Corporate Communications Officer, Ms. Sophia Kudjordji; General Manager of ACARP, Mr. Paddy Tuwor; Director of Communications and Corporate Affairs, Ms. Emma Adwoa Appiah Osei-Duah; and Public Relations Manager, Mr. Ernest Morgan Acquah, among others.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Both institutions acknowledged culture as one of Ghana’s most potent soft power tools and a strategic pillar for inclusive growth.\n\nSpeaking during the engagement, the CEO of the GTA, Maame Efua Houadjeto, underscored the importance of synergy:\n\n“Tourism and culture are inseparable.\n\nGhana’s heritage is not just a memory of the past; it is a powerful economic engine for the future.\n\nStrengthening our collaboration with UNESCO allows us to harness culture, education, and innovation—particularly AI—to drive sustainable tourism growth.”\n\nShe said integrating AI into destination marketing, visitor experience management, data analytics and digital storytelling would position Ghana strongly in an increasingly competitive global tourism landscape.\n\nIn his remarks, Edmond Moukala highlighted UNESCO’s commitment to supporting member states in advancing education, science, culture and communication for sustainable development.\n\nEstablished in 1945, UNESCO works globally to safeguard cultural and natural heritage, promote quality education, foster scientific cooperation and encourage intercultural dialogue. Through initiatives such as the World Heritage Programme and Education for Sustainable Development frameworks, the organisation supports countries in translating heritage preservation into socio-economic gains.\n\nMr Moukala noted:\n\n“Ghana has immense cultural capital. The opportunity lies in connecting heritage, education, and emerging technologies to create sustainable value. UNESCO stands ready to support Ghana in protecting its heritage while embracing innovation to enhance tourism management and knowledge sharing.”\n\nThe discussions also covered youth engagement, digital documentation of heritage assets, curriculum integration to build tourism awareness and sustainable site management approaches aligned with global standards.\n\nAt the close of the engagement, Mr Moukala presented a copy of the book titled World Heritage for Sustainable Development in Africa to the GTA CEO as a symbolic gesture reflecting a shared commitment to ensuring Africa’s heritage becomes a foundation for sustainable economic transformation.\n\nThe CEO was accompanied by the Deputy CEO in charge of General Services, Ben Anane Nsiah; the Deputy CEO in charge of Operations, Ekow Sampson; and the Director of Corporate Affairs, Bright Asempa Tsadidey.\n\nTheir presence underscored the strategic importance the Authority attaches to partnerships that elevate Ghana’s cultural and tourism agenda on the global stage.\n\nThe engagement reaffirmed the Ghana Tourism Authority’s commitment to building strong international collaborations that leverage culture, education and innovation as drivers of national development. As Ghana strengthens its position as a leading tourism destination in Africa, partnerships with institutions such as UNESCO remain crucial in converting heritage into measurable economic and social impact.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) in the Ashanti Region has announced the restoration of full power capacity and improved voltage levels following the resolution of a major technical setback caused by infrastructure theft.\n\nAt least eight high-tension towers collapsed after being tampered with by unidentified criminals who removed bolts, nuts, and bases from the galvanised steel structures, forcing the pylons, vital lines connecting the Anwomaso Bulk Supply Point (BSP) to the Akyawkrom Substation, to topple.\n\nECG had to channel multiple feeders through a single source, characterised by chronic low voltage for thousands of customers, frequent power outages due to system overloads, and reduced operational flexibility for the technical team.\n\nSeveral communities in the Ashanti region on March 18, 2024, experienced several hours of power outages.\n\nThe development forced the Electricity Company of Ghana to launch immediate investigations.\n\nAt least eight towers, stretching several kilometres, had fallen onto the ground after some miscreants removed bolts, nuts, and the base.\n\nThe high-tension towers were transmitting power from Anwomaso Bulk Supply Point to the Akyawkrom Substation near Ejisu.\n\nBekwai, Anwiankwanta, Kumawu, Antoakrom, Manso Nkwanta, Jacobu, and Samfo-Aduam were some of the affected areas.\n\nOthers included Kumawu, Ejisu, Nsuta, Effiduase, and their environs.\n\nEngineers of ECG busily working to complete the construction of the 8 high-tension towers\n\nThe completion of the construction works on Wednesday, February 25, 2026 also coincided with a planned maintenance by ECG, which saw all customers on the broken towers restored to their normal positions.\n\nThis means residents and businesses in several districts within the Ashanti Region can now heave a sigh of relief.\n\nDaniel Mensah-Asare is the General Manager of the Ashanti East Region of Electricity Company of Ghana. He is elated ECG has restored the towers.\n\n“We have worked very tirelessly to resolve the problem. The problem occurred around the 18th of March 2024, exactly. So, as a result of the problem, it has created a situation where we have to manage to feed a lot of feeders through one source.\n\nAnd today as I speak, I am happy and on behalf of the entire ECG Ashanti Region, we want to say that we have resolved that problem and we have restored the stolen pylons and has restored power supply.”\n\nAccording to him, the construction of the eight-high tension towers mean a lot to ECG.\n\n“What has happened today is going to enable us to improve the voltage that we supply to our customers. It's going to minimise outage and as well give us what we call the flexibility in our operations.”\n\nIng. Mensah-Asare has been explaining to JoyNews what the restoration means to ECG and its customers.\n\n“From today, we can see that customers around this area and its environs and all those places who were experiencing some form of low voltage as a result of the incident that occurred on the 18th of March 2024. Today we have solved their problem and their voltages are going to improve.\n\n\"When we say low voltage, that's when you are not getting enough of power; the voltage that you require for a fridge or light or anything to work effectively. Comparing it to water, voltage is like the pressure that makes the water to flow. So the voltage was low.\n\n\"So most of our customers often say it is low current. So most of our customers who do not often see it low current, so the fridges are going to work better the air conditions are going to work better, the fans are going to turn better and every electrical gadget they are going to use in those areas is going to function or perform better.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ing. Mensah-Asare has commended residents in the Ashanti region for their patience as ECG worked on this capital-intensive project.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Ghana’s health system returns to the spotlight as the debate over the so-called “no-bed syndrome” intensifies. Assurances in Parliament that reforms and digital coordination will end emergency care refusals stand in sharp contrast to persistent reports of patients dying in corridors or being redirected across facilities.\n\nIs this a resource crisis, a coordination breakdown, or a question of professional conduct? And beyond promises, what measurable change is underway to guarantee that emergency care is truly non-negotiable?\n\nIn the power sector, public trust is under pressure as households report rapid depletion of prepaid electricity credits.\n\nThe regulator has ordered urgent explanations from the Electricity Company of Ghana, while investigations seek to determine whether the problem stems from tariff adjustments, technical faults, or deeper systemic lapses.\n\nConsumers want clarity, and potentially compensation. Will the probe deliver answers within days, and could the outcome reshape billing transparency and regulatory enforcement?\n\nAt the heart of the rural economy, tensions deepen over cocoa sector governance and pricing stress. As financial pressures mount and farmers raise alarms about hardship, calls are growing for accountability reviews involving the Office of the Special Prosecutor and the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice.\n\nAre these petitions grounded in evidence of conflict of interest, or are they political theatre in a moment of sector vulnerability? And what does this dispute mean for confidence in agricultural leadership during crisis?\n\nSecurity and social order also come under scrutiny amid rising concerns about school-related indiscipline and broader enforcement gaps affecting communities and local commerce. As incidents fuel anxiety about safety and governance capacity, the question becomes unavoidable: how does the state restore deterrence, discipline and public confidence without undermining rights and trust?\n\nAnd overarching all these concerns lies one defining question: Does the State of the Nation Address meaningfully confront these lived realities, or are citizens still waiting for policy to meet practice?\n\nJoin Samson Lardy Anyenini this Saturday at 9 a.m. on the JoyNews channels, on digital satellite channels 421 on DSTV and 144 on GoTV, and streams on JoyNews’ Facebook or YouTube channels on Saturdays from 8 am to noon and MyJoyOnline for a rigorous, solutions-focused national conversation.\n\nViewers can also follow the discussion by tuning in to Joy 99.7 FM or Luv 99.5 FM on the radio or stream the discussion live on either Google or Apple Podcasts.\n\nNewsfile is your most authoritative news analysis programme.\n\nIf it’s Saturday… it’s Newsfile.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Prof Hamidatu Saaka Darimani, revealed that for the first time in the institution's history, the university has admitted 17 differently-abled students into various academic programs.\n\nIn a major step toward inclusive higher education, the educational expenses for all 17 students will be fully absorbed under the free tertiary and persons with disabilities policy.\n\nThe university experienced a massive influx of interest this academic year, receiving a total of 2,575 applications. Out of that applicant pool, 1,967 candidates were offered admission.\n\nBreakdown the admissions data, the university admitted:\n\n768 students into Higher National Diploma (HND) programs.\n\n665 students into BTech/MSc programs.\n\n487 students into BTech/BSc programs.\n\n35 students into postgraduate programs.\n\nAddressing the economic hurdles of tertiary education, the Vice-Chancellor noted that 906 of the newly admitted Level 100 students have already successfully enrolled under the government's \"no fees stress policy,\" with others still undergoing documentation scrutiny.\n\nTo accommodate this 17% surge in the student population and ease the burden of off-campus housing, the university has commenced the construction of a 400-bed hostel facility aimed at providing a safe, conducive on-campus residential environment.\n\nOther major campus upgrades are currently underway to support the growing student body.\n\nThe vice chancellor highlighted the ongoing construction of the main entrance and access roads, the installation of solar street lights to boost campus security, and the outfitting of state-of-the-art laboratories to strengthen practical, industry-relevant training.\n\nIn a major demonstration of this commitment to practical skills, the matriculation ceremony was followed by the official commissioning of a state-of-the-art Cosmetology Laboratory.\n\nThe facility stands as the first of its kind in the entire region, specifically established to create direct employment pathways and equip students with high-level cosmetic science and practical skills.\n\nThe cosmetology department, currently operating with three staff members, is designed to offer specialised BTech and certificate courses. University management indicated that intensive recruitment efforts are underway to secure additional cosmetology faculty, allowing for the full enrollment of students into the program by the start of the next academic year.\n\nBeyond student training, the laboratory has been outfitted to offer premium, first-class cosmetology services to the general public, serving as both an educational hub and a revenue-generating enterprise for the university.\n\nClosing the ceremony, university management issued a stern warning regarding campus discipline and the student code of conduct.\n\nStressing that \"ignorance of these regulations would not be accepted as an excuse,” Prof Hamidatu urged matriculants to familiarise themselves with the rules and prioritise moral character alongside their studies.\n\n\"Remember that character and competence must go hand in hand,\" the Vice-Chancellor stated, reminding the students that \"academic excellence without integrity is incomplete\"\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

He therefore advised fans to comport themselves and adhere to guidelines in order to safeguard this status.\n\n\n\n'We need our best players to stay fit ahead of 2026 World Cup' - John Paintsil\n\n\n\n“Mr Speaker, supporters and others interested in going to support their team will have to submit visa requests to the American Embassy. We are being told that we must ensure that supporters who travel return on their visas. It has taken a lot of work to restore Ghana's 5-year non-immigrant visas and remove us from the ban list. It is my hope that this event will not send thousands of Ghanaians to America and put us back on the ban list,” he said.\n\n\n\nPresident Mahama also urged the Black Queens to improve their performance at the 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) after placing third in the previous edition.\n\n\n\n“Mr Speaker, the Black Queens will compete at the 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, building on their bronze medal finish in Morocco,” he noted.\n\n\n\nHe also expressed optimism about Ghana’s participation in upcoming competitions, including the Youth Olympic Games and the 2026 Commonwealth Games, hoping for success from the athletes.\n\n\n\n“At the youth level, Ghana will participate in the 2026 Youth Olympic Games in Dakar with a multidisciplinary team aimed at strengthening long-term elite pathways. We will also compete at the 2026 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, reinforcing Ghana's presence across the Commonwealth sporting landscape,” he added.\n\n\n\nSB/JE\n\n\n\nWatch highlights from the Ghana Boxing Federation logo unveiling below:"

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "IAEA says Iran has stored most of its highly enriched uranium at an underground tunnel complex at its Isfahan facility.\n\nThe United Nations nuclear watchdog has said in a report that Iran has stored most of its highly enriched uranium at an underground tunnel complex at its Isfahan facility, urging Tehran to allow inspections as it faces growing pressure from the United States over its nuclear programme.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report, which was circulated to members Friday, confirmed earlier findings that the country was enriching uranium up to 60 percent, which is a short step away weapons-grade purity, raising concerns over the IAEA’s lack of access to the Isfahan site, one of three facilities that the US claimed to have “obliterated” in last year’s 12-day war.\n\nThe IAEA report also stated that its inspectors do not know the precise location of a fourth uranium enrichment facility that Iran said it was setting up in Isfahan prior to the 12-day war, adding that they were not aware of its operational status or whether it currently contains nuclear material.\n\nThe IAEA said it had observed in satellite imagery “regular vehicular activity around the entrance to the tunnel complex at Isfahan in which (uranium) enriched up to 20% and 60% U-235 … was stored”, stressing the importance of being able to carry out inspections in Iran without further delay.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Iran.\n\nThe report comes a day after US and Iranian negotiators held a third round of indirect talks mediated by Oman in Geneva that yielded no breakthrough.\n\nIt will be discussed at a quarterly meeting of the IAEA’s 35-country board commencing on Monday next week in Vienna, coinciding with further Oman-mediated meetings between technical teams in the same city.\n\n\n\nThere is uncertainty over the fate of Iran’s stockpile of more than 400kg (882 pounds) of 60 percent enriched uranium that was last seen by nuclear watchdog inspectors last June 10.\n\nIsrael launched strikes on Iran later that month, beginning a 12-day war that the US briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nTehran suspended some cooperation with the IAEA and restricted the watchdog’s inspectors from accessing sites bombed by Israel and the United States, accusing the UN body of bias and of failing to condemn the strikes.\n\nAl Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem said the technical points up for discussion in the Oman-mediated talks on Monday would, he said, be “related” to extracting the 440.9kg (972 pounds) of uranium enriched to up to 60 percent that the IAEA had reported prior to the 12-day war, in case there was “any tendency to go towards weaponisation of the programme”.\n\nHowever, Hashem added, the IAEA is aware that “even the Iranians aren’t able to get into those facilities.” “So there’s been a lot of work around the facilities, at least this is what was shown in satellite imagery, but it doesn’t seem that the Iranians were able to get in,” he said.\n\nReporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi said the stockpile of enriched uranium and the inspections were the main “sticking point” in US-Iran discussions.\n\nAfter yesterday’s talks, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the US should stop its “excessive demands”. He did not specify what those demands were, but the US has said it wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure entirely, limit its arsenal of ballistic missiles and stop supporting regional allies."

He said the nuclear negotiations have so far achieved significant, important, and unprecedented progress, according to the Oman News Agency.\n\nThe meeting focused on the indirect talks which are being mediated by Oman. American and Iranian officials held the latest round of negotiations in Geneva on Thursday.\n\nSince resuming talks last month, the US has said it wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure entirely, limit its arsenal of ballistic missiles and stop supporting regional allies. While Tehran has shown flexibility about discussing limitations on the enrichment of uranium for civilian use, it has so far treated missiles and proxies as non-negotiables.\n\nDuring his meeting with Vance, Al Busaidi said the negotiations had resulted in “creative and constructive ideas and proposals.”\n\nMiddle East tensions\n\nFriday’s meeting comes as concerns grow over a potential US military strike on Iran.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he favours a diplomatic resolution to the standoff, but has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran if it does not accept a deal. The US has amassed its biggest military arsenal in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the world’s biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, which arrived on Friday in the Israeli port city of Haifa, according to Israeli Channel 12.\n\n\n\nIran has said that it was not going to initiate a war, but that it was ready to respond if attacked, threatening to strike bases used by US forces in the region.\n\nOn Friday, the US authorised the departure of nonemergency embassy staff from Israel – the same order Washington issued for the US mission in Lebanon earlier this week.\n\nChina, Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy are amongst the growing number of countries that have urged their citizens to leave Iran in recent days."

            "content": "Trump tells reporters he would ‘love not to use’ military force against Iran but added, ‘Sometimes you have to.’\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to travel to Israel next week as President Donald Trump expresses displeasure with the ongoing negotiations with Iran.\n\nOn Friday, the US Department of State issued a notice that Rubio’s trip will run from March 2 to 3, and that its focus will be on relations with Iran and Lebanon, as well as implementing Trump’s 20-point plan for war-torn Gaza.\n\nThis will be Rubio’s fifth trip as secretary of state to Israel, a close US ally. He visited for the first time in February 2025, then in September and twice in October of last year.\n\nNo other details were provided about the latest diplomatic outing. But it comes at a delicate time for relations in the Middle East.\n\nJust this week, the US and Iran held a third round of indirect talks, this time in Switzerland, as the two sides attempt to negotiate a deal to restrict Iran’s nuclear programme.\n\nA new round of talks is slated to take place in Austria on Monday, the day Rubio arrives in Israel.\n\nStill, Trump used a public appearance on Friday on the White House lawn to voice frustration at the slow pace of negotiations.\n\n“I’m not happy with the fact that they’re not willing to give us what we have to have. I’m not thrilled with that. We’ll see what happens,” Trump said.\n\n“We’ll have some additional talks today. But no, I’m not happy with the way they’re going.”\n\nTrump added that he was not averse to using the military to accomplish his aims. “I’d love not to use it, but sometimes you have to. We’ll see what happens.”\n\n\n\nTrump’s latest comments are likely to feed ongoing fears of a military escalation with Iran, a conflict that could spill into the broader region.\n\nHis remarks coincided with an email from US Ambassador Mike Huckabee to embassy staff in Israel, giving them permission to leave the country, another signal that simmering tensions might boil over.\n\nHuckabee emphasised that those who leave “should do so TODAY”, according to media reports. He added, however, that there is “no need to panic”.\n\nA public notice from the US Embassy in Jerusalem acknowledged the authorisation to leave and cited “safety risks” due to “terrorism and civil unrest”.\n\n“Persons may wish to consider leaving Israel while commercial flights are available,” the notice said.\n\nThreat of Iran attack\n\nConcerns have been mounting, though, that the US may seek to take military action against Iran, a longtime adversary of Israel and the US.\n\nSince January, the administration of US President Donald Trump has deployed a “massive armada” to the waters near Iran, including two aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and the USS Abraham Lincoln.\n\nTrump has also hinted on several occasions that he is prepared to launch an attack, either to force a deal to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities or intervene on behalf of Iranian protesters.\n\nOn January 1, for instance, Trump responded to a deadly crackdown on antigovernment demonstrations in Iran by posting a message on Truth Social.\n\nIt said that the US military was “locked and loaded and ready to go” to “rescue” any protesters who might be killed.\n\nMore recently, during last Tuesday’s State of the Union address, Trump described his military threats as a successful tactic in stopping the execution of protesters.\n\n“We stopped them from hanging a lot of them with the threat of serious violence,” Trump said.\n\nHe added that he would not be afraid to act. “I will never hesitate to confront threats to America wherever we must,” Trump said in the primetime speech, which accused Iran of having “spread nothing but terrorism and death and hate”.\n\nOn Friday, however, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk signalled that eight protesters have nevertheless been sentenced to death, and 30 more are at risk of receiving the same penalty.\n\nTurk also warned against the possibility of military action, highlighting the risk of civilian harm.\n\n“I am extremely alarmed about the potential for regional military escalation and its impact on civilians, and I hope the voice of reason prevails,” he said.\n\n\n\nPushing for a deal\n\nBut the protesters have not been the only motive Trump has cited for his sabre-rattling.\n\nTrump has also indicated that military intervention may be necessary should Iran fail to agree to a nuclear deal.\n\nOn February 19, the president told reporters aboard his jet, Air Force One, that Iran had “10, 15 days, pretty much maximum” to strike a deal with US negotiators.\n\nShould it fail to, Trump indicated he would take his “maximum pressure” campaign a “step further”, appearing to imply military action.\n\n“We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen,” Trump had said earlier in the day at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace panel.\n\nIran, meanwhile, has said its position is “close” to that of the US on many issues, but it has called for the Trump administration to drop what it considers “excessive demands“.\n\nRecent reports have indicated that the US government not only wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear programme, but it also seeks to curtail its ballistic missile arsenal and sever its relations with regional allies and proxy groups, like Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nIran, however, has largely dismissed those demands as unrealistic, and it has argued that its nuclear enrichment programme is designed to produce civilian energy, not weaponry.\n\nIt has also warned of retaliation if the US proceeds with another military strike.\n\nLast June, the US bombed three Iranian nuclear sites, including the Fordow facility, as part of a 12-day war initiated by an Israeli attack. The Trump administration dubbed the campaign “Operation Midnight Hammer”.\n\nThe latest negotiations seek to mint a new nuclear deal following the collapse of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a multilateral agreement that saw Iran scale down its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nBut Trump’s decision, during his first term, to withdraw the US caused the deal to fall apart. As part of his withdrawal, Trump renewed US sanctions against Iran.\n\n‘There’s always a risk’\n\nBut the pressure on Iran has increased in recent days, particularly as media reports emerged that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, has been blocked from accessing the three sites targeted in Operation Midnight Hammer.\n\nThe agency has indicated that it cannot confirm whether Iran has suspended nuclear enrichment at the sites, nor can it estimate the size of Iran’s nuclear stockpile.\n\nThat news is likely to fuel the Trump administration’s efforts: It has long warned that Iran seeks a nuclear weapon, a claim Tehran denies.\n\nStill, the government of Oman, which is mediating the talks, issued a statement striking a positive note, following a meeting between its top diplomat and US Vice President JD Vance.\n\n“His excellency, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, clarified that the negotiations have thus far achieved significant, important and unprecedented progress, which could form the cornerstone of the desired agreement,” the statement said.\n\nIt added that Oman would continue “its efforts in supporting dialogue and facilitating rapprochement between the concerned parties” and that diplomatic efforts could resolve the impasse.\n\n\n\nStill, as Trump prepared to travel to Texas on Friday, he was asked about the prospect of a military strike sparking a wider, drawn-out regional war with Iran.\n\nHe largely shrugged off the possibility, citing successes with Operation Midnight Hammer as well as his decision to order the assassination of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020.\n\n“I guess you could say there’s always a risk. When there’s war, there’s a risk in anything, both good and bad. We’ve had tremendous luck,” Trump replied.\n\nLater, he added, “Everything’s worked out, and we want to keep it that way.”\n\nHe called on Iran to negotiate in “good faith and conscience”. Still, he ended with a note of scepticism: “They are not getting there.”"

A tranche of documents released by the Department of Justice includes photos of Clinton with women whose faces are redacted.\n\n“I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong,” Clinton said.\n\nThe former president is in a deposition before the House Oversight Committee, one day after his wife, Hillary Clinton, testified before the same panel. It is being held near the Clintons’ home in Westchester County, New York.\n\nThe panel’s Republican chairman, Representative James Comer of Kentucky, said he would ask the former president about the photos released by the Justice Department. The committee is also expected to quiz Clinton about Epstein’s involvement with the couple’s charitable foundation.\n\nComer said video of Hillary Clinton’s testimony could be released as soon as Friday. He repeatedly has said the Clintons are not accused of wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nDemocrats call for Trump to testify\n\nThe Clintons agreed to testify after the House threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate, which could have led to criminal charges.\n\nBoth Clintons accuse Republicans of conducting a partisan exercise designed to protect President Donald Trump from scrutiny, noting that others in the inquiry were allowed to submit written statements rather than testify in person.\n\nDemocrats have called on the committee to also subpoena Trump, whose name appears in Epstein-related documents, as well as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has acknowledged visiting Epstein’s private island.\n\nTrump socialised extensively with Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s and says he broke off ties before Epstein’s 2008 conviction.\n\nDemocrats have further accused the Justice Department under Trump of withholding records related to a woman who alleged that Trump sexually abused her when she was a minor. The department has said it is reviewing the material and will release it if deemed appropriate.\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Trump said he was not pleased about former President Bill Clinton’s deposition in the House’s Epstein inquiry.\n\n“I like Bill Clinton, and I don’t like seeing him deposed,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House for Corpus Christi, Texas."

            "content": "Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts, and have stopped getting a response. This week, thanks to a reader tip, we think we’ve found the original phone the T1 is based on.\n\nA long time ago, back when the Trump phone was but a single, inaccurate render and a contradictory spec sheet, we tried to figure out what other phone it might be based on. Now, eight months, two spec overhauls, and one redesign later, I have a good guess: the HTC U24 Pro.\n\nI didn’t spot this by myself. A reader first tipped me off to the similarities between the U24 Pro and the Trump phone I revealed a few weeks ago, which are numerous: a similar angled body and curved display, a unique front sensor array, and broadly similar specs, including oddities like a headphone jack and microSD card support.\n\nLet’s get one thing out the way at the top: I’m pretty sure HTC isn’t secretly building the Trump phone. Sohaib Ahmed, the company’s global director of PR, told me as much: “HTC does not design or manufacture phones for third parties.” But that doesn’t rule out another company playing a part in designing or building both phones, and given just how similar they look, I suspect that’s exactly what happened.\n\nIt’s a little hard to make out in this screenshot, but the Trump phone shares the sharply angled edges of the HTC U24 Pro. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nThe U24 Pro is an odd phone in its own right. It launched in 2024 for €549 (around $600 at the time), and was heralded in some corners as a return from the dead for HTC, despite the fact that it followed the U23 Pro a year earlier, and a string of smaller releases that targeted the Asian market. HTC, once one of the major players in the Android phone industry, had been greatly diminished ever since selling a large part of its smartphone business to Google for $1.1 billion in 2017.\n\nBoth the T1 Phone and the U24 Pro share a slightly asymmetric angular frame, jutting out into a point along every edge, with a heavily curved screen on the front. I cannot think of, nor find, another phone that is quite the same shape — even small details like the positions of the antenna lines around the power and volume buttons line up. Even more telling is the set of sensors along each phone’s top. The U24 Pro splits up its speaker grill, notification LED, and proximity sensor into three, resulting in an unusual design with a long bar, a small dot for the LED, and then a second shorter bar, at the point where the display meets the phone’s top. What looks like the same sensor design can be clearly seen on the Trump phone I was shown, though I can’t confirm that the sensors themselves are the same, or that the T1 Phone will also have a notification LED.\n\nBoth phones have near-identical sets of speakers and sensors about the front selfie camera, with headphone jack and microphone visible behind them on the top edges. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nOther details are subtler. It’s hard to tell exactly from the glimpses I got of the Trump phone, but along the top frame it certainly looks to have both a headphone jack and a microphone in the exact same positions as on the HTC device. Even having a headphone jack in the first place is evidence of the phones’ connection, given how rare the feature is in modern devices. The same can be said for the fact that both phones include a microSD card slot, sharing support for up to 1TB cards on top of a base 512GB of storage.\n\nWhile the rear cameras look completely different, which seems to scupper my theory, look again: The U24 Pro’s cameras are split into a pair close together, with a third lens lower down. The new Trump phone sets all its cameras in one mount, but they’re unevenly spaced, with a larger gap between the second and third lenses. These cameras may look totally different on the surface, but I suspect that underneath you’ll find they’re similar. And what we know of the specs matches too: Trump Mobile told me that its phone will have 50-megapixel sensors for both the main and selfie cameras, and my glimpse of its camera UI showed an ultrawide and a 2x zoom option — all of which you’ll find on the U24 Pro.\n\nThe two phones’ cameras look different at first, but the unusual lens placement might just line up. Screenshot: Dominic Preston / The Verge and Image: HTC\n\nAssuming that the two phones are essentially the same, does the U24 Pro tell us any more about what to expect from the T1? It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, matching what I’d been told about a Snapdragon 7-series chip in the Trump phone. The U24 Pro has a 6.8-inch OLED display, 60W wired charging and even wireless charging support, and an IP67 rating for dust and water protection. There’s reason to be cautious reading too much into the spec sheet, though: The U24 Pro released with a 4,600mAh battery, smaller than the 5,000mAh capacity I’ve been told will be in the Trump phone. If that spec differs, then other elements of the internals could well too — the bigger battery in particular might replace the wireless charging coils of the HTC phone.\n\nThe U24 Pro launched to middling reviews, which may not inspire much confidence in Trump Mobile’s offering. Tech Advisor gave the phone two and a half stars out of five, calling it “hard to recommend over rivals,” while Notebookcheck declared it “modern and yet out of date.” Still, it fared surprisingly well in a JerryRigEverything teardown and durability test.\n\nHe noticed, however, that this didn’t appear to be the HTC of old, lacking the sapphire crystal HTC previously used on its displays and optical image stabilization on the front camera it once pioneered. The U24 Pro and other HTC phones released in the last few years share little consistent design language, and ship with near-stock Android software. Speculation has been rife that HTC isn’t in fact manufacturing the phones internally, but had commissioned an ODM — original design manufacturer — to produce the hardware. ODMs design and manufacture phones for other companies, usually to a set of specifications provided by the consumer-facing brands, and often retain ownership of the designs, allowing them to reuse and repurpose them for other clients. I asked HTC for clarification, but the company wouldn’t confirm whether the U24 Pro was made in-house or contracted out.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that Trump Mobile, or its manufacturing partner, is simply ripping off the design of a little-known HTC device. But I think the most likely answer here is a more mundane one: HTC probably worked with some unnamed ODM to design and manufacture the U24 Pro, and Trump Mobile just happened to work with the same company. That manufacturer may have either dug out its old designs for HTC when developing the T1 Phone, or perhaps gave new life to old, unused components from HTC’s production run. Without knowing the hypothetical ODM involved, it’s hard to say for sure. Trump Mobile has previously confirmed that it’s working with a partner or partners to manufacture its phones outside the US, before their “final assembly” in Miami, but executive Don Hendrickson wouldn’t tell me the name of its manufacturer or where it’s based. I reached out to the company again for comment on this story, and received no reply.\n\nSo no, I don’t think that HTC made the Trump phone. But it does look likely that it is based, more or less, on one of that company’s phones. It remains to be seen how the T1 Phone will differ in its details, but the fact that its origins seem so closely tied to an unpopular midranger from two years ago doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the T1 Phone’s flagship credentials.\n\nGot inside information on Trump Mobile or the Trump phone?

The leadership change comes just a month after reports that Gottumkkala uploaded sensitive documents to ChatGPT. Gottumkkala had requested special permission to use ChatGPT, despite the AI being off-limits for other DHS employees.\n\nGottumkkala’s departure follows a downturn at CISA over the past year as the agency has been “gutted and politicized” by the Trump administration, resulting in budget cuts, layoffs, and wavering trust from local leaders. CISA is also still without a Senate-confirmed director. Trump nominated Sean Plankey for the role last year, then renominated him in January. Plankey previously served in the first Trump administration."

            "content": "is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nOn Thursday morning, I attended a Q&A panel with four top Samsung smartphone executives. Until 2025, Samsung was the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer, and by association, the world’s largest maker of cameras. It’s still the second largest after Apple.\n\nSamsung handed me the microphone first. I asked:\n\nWe see a divide in society between people who want AI to do impressive things with their photos and videos, and those who don’t want AI to do anything with photos and videos because it’s eroding our ability to believe that what we have seen is real, destroying the concept of photographic evidence. Metadata tools like C2PA have utterly failed to stem the tide. Does Samsung have any new and different ideas on how to prevent AI images from taking over the world?\n\nSamsung’s four executives did not have any new and different ideas to share.\n\nI will credit Won-Joon Choi, the mobile division’s COO and R&D chief, for not dodging the question. He told the room that the erosion of reality is a problem and he wants to fix it.\n\nBut he, and other Samsung executives, suggested that the company needs to balance the desire for photographic reality with letting smartphone buyers be “more creative.” They passed the buck by suggesting it’s an industry-wide problem, one that requires a broader conversation, and suggested that Samsung has already partially solved it simply by adding a watermark to AI-generated images. A watermark that can easily be removed.\n\nGiven an opening later, an exec suggested our feelings toward AI-generated content might become more favorable in the future.\n\nHere are some of those answers.\n\n“We recognize the issue, because a lot of content is generated by AI,” Choi began. “On the one hand, people want to be more creative, so we believe we have to provide a solution so people can be more creative,” he said. “On the other hand, it’s really hard nowadays to distinguish the real photos and videos from the fake ones. I think this is a problem, we recognize that, and I think it’s a problem we have to solve at an industry level.”\n\n“The C2PA, you may view it as a failure, but it’s still enough to provide a mechanism if people want to validate that those pictures and videos are made by AI. I think we have to provide a mechanism so people can use it. I think it’s an ongoing effort throughout the industry to solve this problem,” he added.\n\n“I think if we make joint efforts to solve this problem, I believe that we should be able to do it,” he concluded.\n\nAs my colleague Jess Weatherbed wrote earlier this week, we’re starting to worry that this sort of “the industry will solve this together” rhetoric, and the C2PA itself, are substitutes for actual meaningful action.\n\nPerhaps responding to our Samsung AI slop watch reporting, Samsung America exec Dave Das also chimed in to say that the company’s still learning about how much AI is acceptable when creating its own ads. He admitted that the company has “just started utilizing some AI content in our creative, and the feedback has been pretty clear.”\n\n“We’re trying to discern what is the right place to use it, and absolutely how to be very clear about when we are using AI generated content vs naturally generated content,” Das said.\n\nBut Das still frames it as a balancing act between business priorities, not a social responsibility. “It really boils down to giving the creator choice,” he said, suggesting that Samsung’s job is to find “the right balance.”\n\nLater in the morning, KTLA-TV tech reporter Rich DeMuro felt out Samsung’s stance with a very different question. He asked whether Samsung might want to make it easier for customers to remove its AI watermark from AI-generated photos.\n\nThree screenshots taken from AI-generated Samsung ads on YouTube. More on Samsung slop watch here. Image: Samsung / The Verge\n\n“If I’m making a Christmas card with all your fun tools, do I really want that to say ‘AI-generated content?’” asked DeMuro.\n\nDrew Blackard, Samsung America’s SVP of mobile product management, took that one. He concluded by saying that “If we feel like consumers really want that ability to remove watermarks, and there are other ways to address the first point around authenticity at the same time, we’ll do both things and deliver the best of what people are wanting out of the experiences.”\n\n“At least right now, there’s enough concern from consumers around authenticity that that’s the primary thing we’ve solved for, in terms of the watermarking both in the metadata and on the photo itself. Not all services do that,” he said.\n\nBlackard also suggested we might look back one day and realize that AI-generated content isn’t such a big deal, that our perceptions might change over time, the same way perceptions changed toward user-generated content to begin with. People were concerned then with “the amount of content now flowing into the system” and how it wasn’t the professional video product they were used to, he said.\n\nI wonder if Samsung and fellow smartphone makers have considered the opposite: that perceptions of AI-generated imagery might become even less favorable after people lose their jobs in favor of cheap-to-produce AI slop, and after it becomes far easier to lie and cheat and steal in the absence of reliable recorded evidence.\n\nI wonder if they’ve considered solving this problem ”at an industry level” before they break the dam, and whether perception might turn against Samsung for helping create the flood that comes after."

Though FedEx covers the cost of duties and tariffs on a customer’s behalf when packages arrive in the US, it bills customers for the fees later on.\n\n“Our intent is straightforward: if refunds are issued to FedEx, we will issue refunds to the shippers and consumers who originally bore those charges,” FedEx says. “When that will happen and the exact process for requesting and issuing refunds will depend in part on future guidance from the government and the court.”\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court determined that the levies implemented by Trump under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) exceeded the president’s powers. Trump used this law to impose sweeping fees on imported products from China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as put “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of other countries. Days after the ruling, Trump imposed a new 10 percent tariff under the Trade Act of 1974.\n\nAlong with FedEx, over 1,000 companies, including Costco, Revlon, Bausch + Lomb, Dyson, and L’Oréal, have filed lawsuits in the US Court of International Trade in an attempt to recoup the funds that went toward Trump’s tariffs, according to NBC News and CBS."

The update is now finally rolling out to the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, making it an even better buy now that it’s on sale for $29.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target — $5 shy of its best price to date. If you want something cheaper and don’t mind waiting for the update to arrive, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Select is also on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, for $19.99 ($20 off), which is $2 more than its all-time low price.\n\nThe new Fire TV OS update makes navigating content even easier, adding tabs across the top for search, home, movies, TV shows, sports, news, and live content that pull recommendations from all of your subscriptions. Your apps now live on their own row, and you can pin up to 20 favorites instead of just six. You also get support for Alexa Plus, letting you search for specific types of content with your voice, jump to particular scenes, control compatible smart home devices, check sports scores, and more. The update also improves the remote, with a long press of the Home button opening a panel so you can quickly adjust audio or check on devices like Ring cameras.\n\nRelated Alexa Plus on the TV is made to save you from your phone\n\nThe Fire TV Stick 4K Plus is also a good streaming device on the hardware front. The middle child in the Fire TV stick lineup, it offers half the storage of the $40 Fire TV Stick 4K, but otherwise shares support for HDR10 Plus, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos. You also get an Alexa Voice Remote included, for quick access to apps and voice controls. For most people, it offers a good balance between features and price.\n\nWe’d recommend the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus overall, but if you just want a cheap and basic 4K streaming stick — maybe one for a second or third TV — the standard Fire TV Stick 4K is hard to ignore at $20. The redesigned Fire TV OS has yet to roll out to the stick, and it has half the RAM so it’s slower. It also lacks Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support, but it still supports HDR10, HDR10 Plus, and Alexa Plus while including an Alexa Voice Remote. You also get access to all the major streaming services, while Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can stream select games from the cloud as they can on Amazon’s other sticks."

            "content": "is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nIt’s the day of the Pentagon’s looming ultimatum for Anthropic: allow the US military unchecked access to its technology, including for mass surveillance and fully autonomous lethal weapons, or potentially be designated a “supply chain risk” and potentially lose hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts. Amid the intensifying public statements and threats, tech workers across the industry are looking at their own companies’ government and military contracts wondering what kind of future they’re helping to build.\n\nWhile the Department of Defense has spent weeks negotiating with Anthropic over removing its guardrails, including allowing the US military to use Anthropic’s AI kill targets with no human oversight, OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to such terms, although OpenAI is reportedly attempting to adopt the same red lines in the agreements as Anthropic. The overall situation has left employees at some companies with defense contracts feeling betrayed. “When I joined the tech industry, I thought tech was about making people’s lives easier,” an Amazon Web Services employee told The Verge, “but now it seems like it’s all about making it easier to surveil and deport and kill people.”\n\nIn conversations with The Verge, current and former employees from OpenAI, xAI, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google expressed similar feelings about the changing moral landscape of their companies. Organized groups representing 700,000 tech workers at Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and more have signed a letter demanding that the companies reject the Pentagon’s demands. But many saw little chance of their employers — whether they’re directly embroiled in this conflict or not — questioning the government or pushing back.\n\n“From their perspective, they’d love to keep making money and not have to talk about it,” said a software engineer from Microsoft.\n\nSo far, Anthropic has stood its ground. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei put out a statement on Thursday that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” But he has stated that he is not at all opposed to lethal autonomous weapons sometime in the future, just that the technology was not reliable enough “today.” Amodei even offered to partner with the DoD on “R&D to improve the reliability of these systems, but they have not accepted this offer,” he wrote in the statement.\n\nIn the past few years, however, major tech companies have loosened their rules or changed their mission statements to expand into lucrative government or military contracts. In 2024, OpenAI removed a ban on “military and warfare” use cases from its terms of service; after that, it signed a deal with autonomous weapons maker Anduril and then its DoD contract, and just this week, Anthropic changed its oft-touted responsible scaling policy, dropping its longtime safety pledge in order to ensure it stayed competitive in the AI race. Big Tech players like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have also allowed defense and intelligence agencies to use their AI products, including some agreeing to work with ICE despite growing outcry from the public and employees alike.\n\nIn past years, tech workers’ resistance to partnerships and deals they deem harmful to society at large sometimes led to big change. In 2018, for instance, thousands of Google employees successfully pressured the company to end its “Project Maven” partnership with the Pentagon, and Microsoft workers presented leadership with an anti-ICE petition signed by about 500 Microsoft employees, though Microsoft still works with the agency. In 2020, after the murder of George Floyd, tech companies made public statements about and financial commitments supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. But in recent months, the industry has seen a very different reality: a culture of fear and silence, especially amid cooperation with the Trump administration and ICE, tech workers recently told The Verge.\n\nCompanies have followed in the footsteps of longtime surveillance and military tech partnerships, who have only become more hawkish. That includes the Peter Thiel-cofounded Palantir, whose CEO Alex Karp recently stated to shareholders that “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world, and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them. And we hope you’re in favor of that.” (Protect Democracy, a nonprofit, recently put out an open letter calling for Congressional oversight of the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted use of AI. )\n\nOpenAI, Google, Microsoft, xAI, and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA former xAI employee told The Verge, “Everyone is actually working on killer robots at this point,” adding that he believes everyone will follow in the footsteps of Palantir, Anduril, and xAI, since the government sentiment is that if a company doesn’t acquiesce, it’s “against the benefits of the country, in a sense.” He said there’s a “big push for working with the military, and the trend is it’s cool to do it… You’re a patriot if you do it.”\n\nA Google employee called the situation a “dominance display from Hegseth that is disgusting.” He added, “Over and over AI is presenting us with choices about who we want to be and what kind of society and future we want to have. And they’re coming at us fast and with, really, the least thoughtful and least principled leaders in power that we could imagine. I can only thank Anthropic for insisting on the decent path and using their leverage — that they are indispensable — to chart a course toward a humane world and a humane future.”\n\nThe AWS employee told The Verge that “boundaries have definitely eroded in terms of the customers big tech is willing to court” and that there’s “a deliberate whitewashing of the implications of new lucrative deals.” She recalled recently receiving an email from an AWS executive touting a more than $580 million contract with the US Air Force, among other partnerships, as a sign of Amazon’s AI successes, with no acknowledgment of the broader scope or harms involved.\n\n“If the government is hell-bent on pursuing technologies like this, they should have to build them themselves, and be answerable for those decisions,” she said.\n\nThe erosion may have extended to internal culture as well — normalizing the idea that companies should always be watching. The AWS employee said that she and her colleagues are tracked on how much they’re using AI for their jobs, how often they’re working from the office, and more. “I can see myself and my coworkers getting more desensitized to surveillance on ourselves at work, and I’m worried that means we’re obeying, complying, and giving up too much in advance,” she said.\n\nAn OpenAI employee said the general feeling within the AI industry over the last few weeks “has reopened the door to more discussion… about the values and the future of the technology.” The employee said that the Pentagon-Anthropic situation, the recent ICE headlines, and the fast advancement of AI have been some of the main factors opening up those discussions internally.\n\nEven so, people who are immigrants or in more vulnerable positions are more afraid to speak, the OpenAI employee said.\n\nAnthropic, the former xAI employee said, seems like it’s in a position where it can say no and still stay afloat. Its focus on enterprise rather than consumer AI business may make it more sustainable even without government contracts, offering it some leverage. A software engineer at Microsoft said of Anthropic, speaking generally, “I was surprised to see them stand on some form of principle. I don’t know how long it’ll last.”\n\n“Will it last?” seems to be the question on everyone’s lips. The Pentagon has already reportedly asked two major defense contractors, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to provide information about their reliance on Anthropic’s Claude, as it moves to potentially designate Anthropic a “supply chain risk,” a classification usually reserved for threats to national security and rarely, if ever, assigned to a US company. It also reportedly may be considering invoking the Defense Production Act to attempt to force Anthropic to comply with its request.\n\nJust like with any other AI company, if Anthropic folds, the Microsoft employee said, there’s little chance of it or others pulling back on killer robots and surveillance. “Once you’re in the door with the Department of Defense or whatever we’re calling it now… I think it’s probably hard for them to actually have the oversight they claim. It’s just going to be lucrative to basically give themselves permission to do the thing that makes the most money.”\n\nIn Microsoft’s own case, he said he doesn’t expect the company to adhere to any sort of ethical principles. The company has worked extensively with the Israeli Defense Forces, including for mass surveillance of Palestinians and dissidents, despite employee protest. (It said it ended some parts of the partnership last year.)\n\nAnother Microsoft employee told The Verge that although “Microsoft holds a Responsible AI ‘commitment,’… they are currently attempting to play both sides for the sake of profit rather than meaningfully commitment to Responsible AI.”\n\nBut this is nothing new, one AI startup employee said. In her eyes, the boundaries have often been “fuzzy, especially within AI,” about what kinds of things companies are willing to let their technology power. “A lot of it has been going on beneath the surface for as long as AI has been around.”\n\nThe AWS employee emphasized that “we need cross-tech solidarity and a coherent, worker-led vision for AI now more than ever.”\n\n“The safeguards that Anthropic is trying to keep in place are no mass surveillance of Americans and no fully autonomous weapons, which just means that they want a human in the loop if the machine is going to kill somebody,” she added. “Even if this technology were perfect — which it isn’t — I think most Americans don’t want machines that kill people without human oversight running around in an America that’s become an AI-powered mass surveillance state.”"

            "content": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

            "content": "Starting this week, Perplexity subscribers will have a new agentic tool at their disposal.\n\nPerplexity Computer, in the company’s words, “unifies every current AI capability into a single system.” More specifically, Perplexity says it is a computer user agent that can execute complex workflows independently using 19 different AI models, even creating subagents to handle specific problems.\n\nThe tool is available now, only on the company’s highest subscription tier, the $200/month Perplexity Max. It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.\n\nTechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in example workflows on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial, or legal data; creating analysis; and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations.\n\nPerplexity invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company canceled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.\n\nThis tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.\n\nThe company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base — in the tens of millions of users — pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nNow, Perplexity executives say they are aiming for a more boutique set of users, with products that serve people making “GDP-moving decisions.” Executives in the briefing, who asked not to be identified by name, described prioritizing enterprise subscriptions, particularly for deep research.\n\n“You don’t hear us talk about MAUs ever, because we’re not actually on a mission to get as many users as possible,” one executive said.\n\nPerplexity recently released a new benchmark for complex research tasks, called Draco, where (no surprise) its own deep research offering beats out competitors like Gemini.\n\nPerplexity says it is no longer reliant on other companies’ APIs for its web index and now has its own AI-optimized search API. But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.\n\n“Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done in Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.\n\nA visualization of model usage by Perplexity users over time. Image Credits:Perplexity\n\nIf one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.\n\nThe company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear.\n\nStill, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on user fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.\n\nAnd there is more on the horizon: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.\n\nOne executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.\n\nHowever, the execs at the briefing dismiss such complaints: “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” one said."

            "content": "A new set of main series Pokémon games is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2027, marking the 10th installment in the series.\n\nIn a livestream celebrating the release of the first Pokémon games exactly 30 years ago, the company unveiled Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves, open-world games set across a vast ocean of islands.\n\nThe three new starter Pokémon were announced as well: Browt, a Grass type “bean chick” that looks like an Angry Bird; Pombon, a Pomeranian-inspired Fire type who better not evolve into a bipedal man; and Gecqua, a Water type gecko with big pink eyes.\n\nImage Credits:The Pokémon Company\n\nLeakers have rumored that the new games are set in a region inspired by Indonesia and Southeast Asia — while the trailer doesn’t explicitly confirm this, it makes a good case for proving the rumors correct, showing us lush jungles, seaside mountains, tropical towns, and even underwater reefs. Fans have also honed in on a suspicious-looking cloud in the trailer, which looks like a Gyarados-slash-Lapras flying through the sky — perhaps it’s a nod to a new legendary Pokémon?\n\nPokémon already explored a tropical island vibe in the Hawaii-inspired “Sun and Moon” games, which came out nearly 10 years ago, but there’s still a ton to explore in that sort of setting, especially now that the franchise is embracing open-world maps. Not all tropical archipelagos are alike!\n\nMain series Pokémon games usually get released in November, which would mean that we have almost two years to wait before we can explore this new region … but hopefully we’ll be surprised. It already seems like forever ago since Pokémon Scarlet and Violet came out in 2022. But when that game came out, fans criticized it for feeling rushed and being rife with glitches. So if a later release date means we’ll get something incredible, I’m happy to wait.\n\nIn the meantime, Pokémon fans can buy reissues of the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen games today for the Switch … but they cost $20. It’s too bad that there isn’t an extremely easy and legally dubious way to get those games on your phone for free."

But as the Pentagon’s Friday afternoon deadline for Anthropic’s compliance approaches, more than 300 Google employees and over 60 OpenAI employees have signed an open letter urging the leaders of their companies to support Anthropic and refuse this unilateral use.\n\nSpecifically, Anthropic stood in opposition to the use of AI for domestic mass surveillance and autonomous weaponry. The open letter’s signatories seek to encourage their employers to “put aside their differences and stand together” to uphold the boundaries Anthropic has asserted.\n\n“They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,” the letter says. “That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.”\n\nThe letter specifically calls on executives at Google and OpenAI to maintain Anthropic’s red lines against mass surveillance and fully automated weaponry. “We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War’s current demands.”\n\nLeaders at the companies have not yet formally reponded to the letter. TechCrunch has reached out to Google and OpenAI for comment.\n\nHowever, informal statements suggest both companies are sympathetic to Anthropic’s side of the case. In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he doesn’t “personally think the Pentagon should be threatening DPA against these companies.” According to a CNN reporter, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that the company shares Anthropic’s red lines against autonomous weapons and mass surveillance.\n\nAgreed.

            "content": "Looking for an upgraded Roku that's a great match for your new 4K TV? Right now, both Amazon and Best Buy have the 2024 Roku Ultra discounted to $80, a $20 break from the usual price. It spots dual-band Wi-Fi and Ethernet for a more consistent connection, support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and the remote has a headphone port.\n\nWhile there are a ton of great Roku streaming devices to choose from, the Ultra stands out for a few reasons. Streaming in 4K requires a huge amount of bandwidth, and some wireless networks just aren't up to the task, particularly if your TV isn't near your router. A true dual-band Wi-Fi setup in the Roku Ultra helps ensure a stutter-free experience on all of your favorite streaming services. If you really hate buffering and dropped connections, there's an Ethernet port around back for a wired hookup, something most other streaming devices can't claim.\n\nAnother nice upgrade you get with your Roku Ultra kit is the remote, which includes a built-in 3.5mm headphone jack. That's perfect if you like to sneak in a few episodes of your favorite show after everyone's gone to bed, or catching a movie without waking a sleeping baby. The Roku Ultra even includes a pair of earbuds you can use right out of the box, which are surprisingly good for what they are, and they include extra ear tips for getting the fit right.\n\nLike some of the other premium Roku streaming devices, the hands-free voice controls make it super easy to find what you're looking for. Rather than dig through all of your apps and services looking for a movie, you can just say the title into the remote and let Roku go and find it for you.\n\nIf you're ready to take your 4K streaming to the next level, both Best Buy and Amazon have the Roku Ultra marked down to $80. We also have a great guide that breaks down the differences between all of the available Roku streamers, and a roundup of our favorite media streamers, in case you're wondering what the Roku alternatives look like."

            "content": "A few months ago, a family came into Pasadena Cyclery in Pasadena, California, for a repair on what they thought was their teenager’s ebike. “I can’t fix that here,’ Daniel Purnell, a store manager and technician, remembers telling them. “That’s a motorcycle.” The mother got upset. She didn’t realize that what she thought was an ebike could go much faster, perhaps up to 55 miles per hour.\n\n“There’s definitely an education problem,” Purnell says. In California, bike advocates are pushing a new bill designed to clear up that confusion around what counts as an electric bicycle—and what doesn’t.\n\nIt’s a tricky balance. On one hand, backers want to allow riders access to new, faster, and more affordable non-car transportation options, ones that don’t require licenses and are emission-free. On the other hand, people, and especially kids, seem to be getting hurt. Ebike-related injuries jumped more than 1,020 percent nationwide between 2020 and 2024, according to hospital data, though it’s not clear if the stats-keepers can routinely distinguish between ebikes and their faster, “e-moto” cousins. (Moped and powered-assisted cycle injuries jumped 67 percent in that same period.)\n\n“We’re overdue to have better ebike regulation,” says California state senator Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat who sponsored the bill and represents parts of North County in San Diego. “This has been an ongoing and growing issue for years.”\n\nSenate Bill 1167 would make it illegal for retailers to label higher-powered, electric-powered vehicles as ebikes. It would clarify that ebikes have fully operative pedals and electric motors that don’t exceed 750 watts, enough to hit top speeds between 20 and 28 mph.\n\n“We’re not against these devices,” says Kendra Ramsey, the executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition, which represents riders and is promoting the legislation. “People think they’re ebikes and they're not really ebikes.”\n\nBill backers say they hope the fix, if it passes, makes a difference, especially for teenagers, who love the freedom that electric motors give them but can get into trouble if something goes wrong at higher speeds. Kids 17 and younger accounted for 20 percent of US ebike injuries from 2020 to 2024, about in line with the share of the total population. But headlines—and the laws that follow them—have focused on teen injuries and even deaths.\n\nThere are no national laws governing ebike riding. But bike backers spent years moving between states to pass laws that put ebikes into three classes: Class 1, which have pedal-assist that only works when they’re actually pedaled, and goes up to 20 mph; Class 2, which have throttles that work without pedaling but still only reach 20 mph; and Class 3, which use pedal-assist to move up to 28 mph. Plenty of states and cities restrict the most powerful Class 3 bikes to people older than 16. (In a complicated twist, some ebikes have different “modes,” allowing riders to toggle between Class 2 and Class 3.)\n\nLast year, researchers visited 19 San Francisco Bay Area middle and high schools and found that 88 percent of the electric two-wheeled devices parked there were so high-powered and high-speed that they didn’t comply with the three-class system at all.\n\nEbikes have clearly struck a chord with state policymakers: at least 10 bills introduced this year deal with ebikes, according to Ramsey.\n\nSome bike advocates believe injuries have less to do with ebikes than “e-motos,” a category that’s less likely to appear in retail stores or the sort of social media ads attracting teens to the tech. These have more powerful motors and can travel in excess of 30 mph. Vehicles, like the Surron Ultra Bee, which can hit top speeds of 55 mph, or Tuttio ICT, which can hit 50, are often marketed by retailers as \"electric bikes.” Because so many sales happen online, it can be hard for people, and especially parents, to know what they’re getting into."

The employee, she said, “used confidential OpenAI information in connection with external prediction markets (e.g. Polymarket).”\n\n“Our policies prohibit employees from using confidential OpenAI information for personal gain, including in prediction markets,” says spokesperson Kayla Wood. OpenAI has not revealed the name of the employee or the specifics of their trades.\n\nEvidence suggests that this was not an isolated event. Polymarket runs on the Polygon blockchain network, so its trading ledger is pseudonymous but traceable. According to an analysis by the financial data platform Unusual Whales, there have been clusters of activities, which the service flagged as suspicious, around OpenAI-themed events since March 2023.\n\nUnusual Whales flagged 77 positions in 60 wallet addresses as suspected insider trades, looking at the age of the account, trading history, and significance of investment, among other factors. Suspicious trades hinged on the release dates of products like Sora, GPT-5, and the ChatGPT Browser, as well as CEO Sam Altman’s employment status. In November 2023, two days after Altman was dramatically ousted from the company, a new wallet placed a significant bet that he would return, netting over $16,000 in profits.

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at kateknibbs.09.\n\nThe behavior fits into patterns typical of insider trades. “The tell is the clustering. In the 40 hours before OpenAI launched its browser, 13 brand-new wallets with zero trading history appeared on the site for the first time to collectively bet $309,486 on the right outcome,” says Unusual Whales CEO Matt Saincome. “When you see that many fresh wallets making the same bet at the same time, it raises a real question about whether the secret is getting out.”"

A looming Paramount Skydance merger with Warner Bros. Discovery would expand their empire even further.\n\nNow that Netflix has backed out of its bid to acquire WBD, the Ellisons stand to gain an entirely new trove of significant intellectual property, from DC Comics to Harry Potter. According to Reuters, Warner Bros. agreed to be acquired by Paramount Skydance in a $110 billion deal signed Friday, with Paramount Skydance agreeing to pay a $7 billion termination fee if federal regulators don’t approve the merger.\n\nParamount’s merger with Skydance has already brought about mass layoffs, including at CBS News, where Free Press founder Bari Weiss is leading a cultural overhaul as editor in chief. In January, Oracle became a partial owner of TikTok, giving the Ellisons even more cultural currency.\n\nHere’s everything the family would control if the WBD deal goes through.\n\nCBS and CBS News\n\nBesides its news division, which includes 60 Minutes, CBS is also home to hits like Tracker and Matlock, along with reality stalwarts Survivor and Big Brother.\n\nHBO and HBO Max\n\nAmong the most Emmy-winningest networks to exist, HBO’s library includes classics like Game of Thrones, The Wire, and Veep, as well as newer hits like The Pitt, The Gilded Age, and Thrones spin-off A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. (Outside of Canada, HBO Max is also a key distributor of the hockey smut drama Heated Rivalry.)\n\nCNN\n\nWhile CNN’s ratings dipped last year, it remains a news juggernaut and a top 5 cable network, featuring household names like John King, Kaitlan Collins, and Anderson Cooper (who recently announced he will be leaving 60 Minutes at the end of the current season).\n\nDC Comics\n\nThe merger would put Paramount Skydance in control of storied comic book franchises like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nThe wizarding world of Harry Potter, including all eight fantasy films and the upcoming HBO television series slated to premiere in 2027 would also be under the Ellisons’ purview.\n\nTikTok\n\nAs of a deal finalized in January, Oracle now holds a 15 percent stake in TikTok’s US operations.\n\nStar Trek\n\nAll 13 Star Trek movies and television shows are owned by Paramount Skydance. At a press event last year, Dana Goldberg, cochair of Paramount Pictures and chair of Paramount Television, said the franchise would be a “priority across the company.”\n\nWarner Bros. Studios\n\nHome to blockbusters like Barbie, The Dark Knight, and more recently, One Battle After Another and Sinners.\n\nComedy Central\n\nSouth Park announced a five-year, $1.5 billion deal with Paramount last July, just prior to the merger with Skydance. The show has since skewered Donald Trump and those in his administration regularly.\n\nAvatar Studios\n\nIn December, Paramount+ announced it would be the exclusive streamer of Avatar Studios content, including animated film The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender and series Avatar: Seven Havens.\n\nA Bunch of Cable Channels and Networks\n\nThe Food Network, HGTV, Discovery, TLC, OWN, Adult Swim, Showtime, TNT, and TBS are all part of WBD.\n\nOther Key Franchises\n\nOther notable titles that are or would be controlled by the Ellisons, pending the WBD takeover, include: The Lord of the Rings franchise, the Mission Impossible franchise, and the distribution rights to Dune: Part Three.\n\n2/27/26, 2:34 PM EDT: WIRED updated details about Paramount Skydance's deal with Warner Bros.

            "content": "Before last week the name Alap Shah didn’t ring a bell for many people. The 45-year-old financial analyst and tech entrepreneur had spent the past two decades working in relative obscurity. Then last weekend he coauthored a blog with the research firm Citrini titled “The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis.” It was a “thought exercise” about the impacts of artificial intelligence, and it predicted that in June of that year, AI would jack up unemployment past 10 percent and force the Dow down, down, down. Writing in a confident, Nostradamic tone—as if auditioning for starring roles in the next Michael Lewis book—the authors painted a picture of a flywheel in reverse: AI agents take jobs from workers, people spend less, and struggling corporations conduct layoffs on top of layoffs.\n\nThere wasn’t much in it that hadn’t been previously heard, or speculated about. Tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have already estimated that half the entry level white collar jobs will soon be gone, and earlier this year, Anthropic’s release of new agentic tools spurred a Wall Street selloff. Nonetheless the report hit with the force of the blizzard blowing through lower Manhattan. When the closing chimes sounded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow was down 800 points. The name Alap Shah was now ringing bells.\n\nThe achievement is less impressive than it seems. Wall Street, like the rest of us, is in a persistent state of anxiety about AI, and it doesn’t take much to trigger a mini-panic. Financial markets don’t necessarily map to reality, but the jitters reflect a wider disquiet. The AI future is in a William Gibson zone—it’s here, but unevenly distributed—and the news from those already living in the agent-packed, AI code-writing universe is both exciting and unsettling. Emphasis on unsettling.\n\nNo one—no one!—knows exactly how AI will impact the economy, but clearly it will be significant. Right now stocks are soaring, so it seems to make sense to keep the party going. But then along comes the latest doom manifesto, or a paper indicating that a traditional business sector might be threatened by AI, and suddenly money managers are reminded that the biggest issue of our time is totally unresolved. Case in point: earlier this month, a tiny company (valuation under $6 million) that had previously sold karaoke machines pivoted to AI-powered shipping logistics and put out a report saying that it had discovered some efficiencies in loading semi-trucks. That was enough to erase billions of dollars from the share prices of several major logistics companies, none of which had karaoke experience.\n\nAfter it did its job on Wall Street, the Citrini report came under considerable fire. Critics climbed over each other to proclaim its flimsiness. For one thing, they pointed out, AI has had very little discernable impact on the economy so far. Others cited the long history of resilience after technological upheavals. A mocking response by the respected trading firm Citadel Securities read, “For AI to produce a sustained negative demand shock, the economy must see a material acceleration in adoption, experience near-total labor substitution, no fiscal response, negligible investment absorption, and unconstrained scaling of compute.”\n\nThe most withering critiques disputed the report’s contention that much of the economy involves non-productive “rent-seeking” by middlemen and market makers, taking advantage of the laziness of the general population. When everyone has a few dozen AI agents working on their behalf, writes Shah, consumers will be able to effortlessly find the best goods for the best prices. Apps will be rendered unnecessary—just type what you want into the LLM and an army of agents will do everything for you. The “poster child” for this phenomenon, Shah says, is DoorDash. Instead of being limited to the restaurants on the app, consumers will send out AI agents to find their ideal meal options, contracting directly with restaurants and delivery people—no apps needed. Zero friction! The DoorDashes of the world are avocado toast!"

            "content": "The Soltera 3, the new single-speed, hybrid-style commuter from electric bike brand Aventon, is the brand’s answer to the ever-growing bulk and heft of modern ebikes. In my opinion, Aventon has made the least ebikey bike on the ebike market, which provides the most fun I’ve yet had riding an electrically powered bicycle. (Sorry, I couldn’t in good conscience write “ebike” in that sentence a third time.)\n\nThe Soltera 3 is a class 1 electric bike, meaning it has a top speed of 20 miles per hour. (Motor-assisted, of course. Your legs combined with a downhill can get this thing going a whole lot faster.) It also lacks any sort of throttle control. However, the bike's pedal assist is super responsive and offers immediate aid with the slightest bit of rider input.\n\nIt has a claimed range of up to 70 miles—though, given how hilly my area is and how much assistance I typically use on an ebike, I got closer to 50 on a full charge—and takes less than two hours to charge its integrated battery from flat to full.\n\nCarbon Belt\n\nPhotograph: Michael Venutolo-Mantovani\n\nOK, now that all of the spec sheet info is out of the way, we can talk about the coolest part of the Soltera 3: It has a carbon belt in place of a chain."

There's even a notable AI app available for podcasts too. It’s called Huxe.\n\nAt the core of Huxe is a daily brief, a sort of personal productivity podcast tailored to your tastes and requirements, generated from the sources you pick. Connect up your calendar and email account, and every morning you get a quick audio summary to get you set for the day. The idea is that a 15-minute audio podcast can replace the much longer amount of time you'd otherwise spend trying to figure out what's happening with your inbox and your schedule.\n\nThe audio emphasis of Huxe is no surprise, as the team behind the app previously worked on Google NotebookLM, a research tool that has its own podcast-style Audio Overviews feature. Huxe is similar, but it draws information from your emails and calendar entries.\n\nThere's more to Huxe as well, including audio deep dives on any topic of your choice, as well as news summaries. The app is completely free to use right now, and you can sign up through the apps for Android or iOS.\n\nGetting Started\n\nRegistering interests with Huxe. Photograph: David Nield\n\nTo start taking advantage of Huxe’s personalized audio production powers, you need to tell it a little bit about yourself.

            "content": "Blood pressure is simultaneously the least exciting yet one of the most important vital signs that a fitness tracker can measure. Unlike a pedometer or sports watch, it’s not going to incentivize you to get active. Unlike a continuous glucose monitor, it’s not going to help you lose weight. A gigantic blood pressure cuff isn’t exactly a gorgeous or enticing accessory to wear. In fact, getting your arm squeezed so tight can be downright claustrophobic.\n\nBut there’s a reason why blood pressure is one of the first tests you get at the doctor’s office. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is one of the top killers in the United States. It can result in conditions like heart attacks or strokes. There are usually no symptoms; hypertension is called “the silent killer” for a reason. Nearly one in three people worldwide has it. And unlike diseases like cancer, we already have simple, readily available tools to treat it, like exercise and reducing the amount of salt that you eat.\n\nLast year, a few fitness trackers debuted hypertension notifications in their suite of features—most notably, the Apple Watch. Unlike the Apple Watch, the Aktiia Hilo band does not merely notify you when you have signs of hypertension. It monitors your blood pressure up to 25 times a day, 24 hours a day. Aktiia reached out to me for testing when it launched; WIRED is the first in the United States to test it. This device could change many lives for the better when it goes on sale in the US later this year. (It's available now in some countries.)\n\nLight and Sound\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nThe Aktiia Hilo comes in two parts—the slim, cuffless band you wear every day and a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuff you use to calibrate the device every month or so. Both have to be connected to the Hilo app (iOS, Android). Once both are connected, the app will remind you to abstain from alcohol, caffeine, and exercise for at least 30 minutes beforehand and to sit and relax with your back supported for at least five minutes."

            "content": "As a fashion lover who's always hunting for outfit inspo, I've spent more hours than I care to admit trying to track down the exact pieces from a TV scene or red carpet look. So when Samsung unveiled an upgraded version of Circle to Search at its Galaxy Unpacked event in San Francisco that can identify multiple items from a single image, I made a beeline for the Galaxy S26 demo area to try it myself.\n\nCircle to Search, which first appeared on the Galaxy S24 phones and then expanded to other devices as Google Lens, felt like magic: Circle anything on your screen and get instant results. The AI-powered visual search tool can identify objects, translate text and surface contextual results without ever leaving the app you're on.\n\nNow it's gotten even smarter, and broader: Google says it's now also on Pixel 10 devices.\n\nAndroid's Circle to Search feature originally launched on Samsung Galaxy S24 and Pixel 8 phones in January 2024. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nInstead of just identifying a single item, it can recognize and surface information about multiple things you've presented it with, including an entire outfit. The feature can be used for just about everything, from identifying bird species to translating text, but Samsung says fashion and shopping are hands-down the most popular use case.\n\nSo of course I had to put it to the test by having it scan my outfit -- and I was genuinely floored. In the crowded event space under harsh lighting, I was skeptical it could deliver. It did.\n\nFirst, it pulled up an AI summary describing the scene: \"The look features a vibrant blue structured blazer, white top, dark fitted leggings and classic black leather boots.\" Right below that, I pressed the \"Find the look\" button and watched it do its magic.\n\nWithin seconds, I was staring at the exact same in-your-face cerulean blazer I was wearing, with a link to the online store I'd bought it from, along with a slew of strikingly similar shopping options ranging from upscale alternatives to budget-friendly picks. This level of stalking would've taken me at least 20 minutes to lock down.\n\nScrolling down revealed the same for my glossy black leggings. Despite being from many seasons ago and not available anymore, it returned convincing dupes from different retailers. It did the same for my decade-old knee-high boots and even pulled up a used pair from Postmark; a nod at the fact that mine are old AF. The only thing it failed to surface was the shirt I was wearing under the blazer that was clearly visible in the shot. Maybe layers is the next frontier for Circle to Search.\n\nSurprisingly, the hardest part of the process was figuring out how to use the feature. I had to ask a Samsung employee to take a full-body picture of me. Once I had it on the screen, I long-pressed on the home button at the bottom of the screen, which triggered a Google overlay. I then had to circle myself from head to toe. It's the kind of feature I'd program on an action button if I could -- although my wallet would likely suffer the consequences.\n\nIn doing this, Samsung and Google have virtually removed the friction between liking someone's outfit, and pressing the trigger on buying it. It wasn't that long ago that the closest alternative involved screenshotting a look, posting it to Pinterest and attempting to track down similar pieces. This is faster, cleaner and almost dangerously good for fashion lovers like me.\n\nIf this gets any better, Samsung may need to add a few guardrails for those of us prone to a little too much impulse shopping."

            "content": "At Samsung's Feb. 25 Galaxy Unpacked Event, the company showed off new Galaxy AI features, including call screening and camera upgrades. But what stood out to me most were the generative AI photo editing features, like Photo Assist.\n\n\"It doesn't just let you remove what was there,\" said Mason Page, from Samsung's product marketing team. \"It helps you add what should have been there.\"\n\nDon't like the clothes you were wearing in this photo? Have Galaxy AI change your fit! Wish your dog were here in this coffee shop with you? Manifest a corgi through the power of AI!\n\nYou're no longer limited to removing unwanted elements in your photos. Now you can adjust larger aspects of the pictures themselves.\n\nIt's tempting and easy and entirely inauthentic.\n\nLook, I get it. Sometimes you just want to fix a photo. When I got engaged a couple of years ago, the only picture my now-wife and I had of the proposal featured me asking her to marry me while a stranger stood uncomfortably close between us -- interrupting and intruding on our special moment. We tried every simple AI-powered erase tool to remove the stranger from the photo, but nothing really worked.\n\nBut AI photo and video editing tools aren't harmless. Grok has been behind an estimated millions of nonconsensual deepfake images and videos, eventually leading to an EU investigation. Scammers are turning to celebrities' likenesses to power their AI-generated scams, and there's an ocean of AI slop drowning the internet. The expansion of AI tools and capabilities is making it continually easier to use AI to cause harm.\n\nIntroducing the ability to add large features with AI is a different story from just erasing small details. My particular worry is how these tools will interact with social media -- specifically, how they seem primed to amplify existing issues related to mental health and self-image.\n\nSure, the dog is cute, but it wasn't at that coffee shop. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nThe endless pursuit of unrealistic expectations\n\nOne problem with social media is how it can implicitly foster a highly curated image of someone's life, focused almost exclusively on positive experiences. A post about a major event or a fun trip might spark an eruption of likes and positive comments, which may entice someone to be more selective and post only about the highlights of their life.\n\nA 2023 study from Germany's Ruhr-Universität Bochum looked at the relationship between photo editing and self-esteem on social media. The authors wrote, \"The depiction of reality is usually not a documentary but part of a narrative which the photo editor intends to project on the public screen.\"\n\nThe gap between reality and expectations can weigh particularly heavily on young adults.\n\nA 2024 study by the Universidad Europa de Madrid examined the relationship between social media use and physical measurements of self-esteem. \"The blurring of lines between reality and digitally enhanced portrayals leads individuals to harbor unrealistic expectations for their bodies and lifestyles,\" the researchers wrote. \"The impact is especially pronounced among teenagers and young adults who are more susceptible to social media influences and are at a critical developmental stage concerning self-identity and body image.\"\n\nThe gap between a social post and reality can already be plenty fuzzy with basic tools like filters and the good old-fashioned process of taking a million photos in pursuit of one \"perfect\" shot. But Galaxy AI's examples of changing or adding major elements raise the stakes of distinguishing between reality and fabrication.\n\nIt's one thing to wonder how many selfies someone took before they found the most flattering angle. It's something else entirely to wonder if that person even owns the outfit they're wearing. While it's not inherently harmful for someone to swap the style of their clothes in a photo, the availability of these tools invites a situation in which everyone is competing to create a better, more impressive \"impossible\" image.\n\nBut the companies behind these tools aren't talking about the consequences. (Samsung couldn't even be bothered to mention AI when it talked about its environmental initiatives.) Yet when it comes to young adults trying to navigate online perfection versus reality, the consequences are important.\n\n\"The insurmountable gap perceived between one's real self and the polished images online foster[s] feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness,\" wrote the Universidad Europa de Madrid researchers.\n\nThe world, and the internet in particular, is already plenty efficient at stoking those feelings. And the easier we make it for people to fundamentally alter images, the more they are going to feel they can't live up to expectations that aren't grounded in reality. It's already a problem, and new tools and features will make it worse.\n\nWhat's the fix?\n\nParents who can talk to teens about social media use and set sustainable limits may be able to mitigate the downsides.\n\nThe American Psychological Association reported in 2023 that \"Teens and young adults who reduced their social media use by 50% for just a few weeks saw significant improvement in how they felt about both their weight and their overall appearance,\" compared with peers who continued their normal social media use.\n\nThe bigger battle is combating the ideas and behaviors behind those unattainable standards.\n\n\"Fostering a digital environment that values authenticity over perfection, and well-being over appearances, is crucial for mitigating the negative impacts of self-presentation on social media,\" wrote researchers from Universidad Europa de Madrid.\n\nUltimately, my wife and I gave up on trying to edit the stranger out of our engagement photo. Their presence was unwelcome and distracting, but it was also part of the moment -- one we try to laugh at now. We have professional photos from our eventual wedding, which thankfully turned out well and are devoid of strangers.\n\nBut the proposal photo captures the true story of that day: the authentic mix of joy and weirdness from that moment, which is something these AI tools can't generate."

Astound's gigabit plan is typically $60 a month, which means you can save $25 on your monthly bill. Astound is primarily a cable internet provider, but select cities will have access to Astound's fiber plans -- with speeds up to 5,000Mbps.

For example, that 500Mbps plan has a cost per Mbps of 6 cents. Compare that to a similarly priced plan or one even cheaper from another provider -- such as the Ziply Fiber 100 plan, which has a lower starting price at $20 per month but significantly lower maximum download speeds (100Mbps) and thus a higher cost per Mbps -- and Frontier Fiber's 500Mbps plan stands out as the much better internet deal.

Speeds of 100Mbps for $50 per month equate to a cost per Mbps of 50 cents, which is high compared to most internet plans. On the other hand, the convenience of a prepaid service, free equipment rental and a three-year price guarantee go a long way to make up for the high cost per Mbps.

While a slew of perks and promos might be enticing to customers, a low-cost-per-Mbps plan will often be the best internet deal. For example, Frontier Fiber 500 includes maximum download and upload speeds of 500Mbps starting at $45 monthly for a cost per Mbps of 9 cents. Compare that to a similarly priced plan or one even cheaper from another provider -- such as the Xfinity Connect plan, which has a lower starting price at $20 to $30 per month but significantly lower maximum download (150Mbps) and upload (10Mbps) speeds and thus a higher cost per Mbps -- and Frontier Fiber 500 stands out as the much better internet deal. If you have similar pricing and speed options from multiple providers, look for special promotions, equipment costs, contract requirements and other service factors to determine which provider has the best deal. Show more\n\nCan I get a deal on internet without a contract? Yes. Many providers, including AT&T, Frontier, Google Fiber, Spectrum and Verizon Fios offer their best internet deals and incentives without requiring you to sign a contract. Other providers, such as Cox and Xfinity, may require you to sign a contract to get the lowest introductory rate in select areas.

Most major providers have a discount internet program available to qualifying low-income households, including those with students and seniors. Plans are typically in the $20 to $30 range and often come with broadband speeds of 50Mbps or higher. Show more"

Between sparse population density and limited infrastructure, cable and fiber often give these areas a skip. As a result, many households are left relying on slower and older options like DSL, satellite or even fixed wireless service. That frustration is compounded by rising costs. A recent CNET survey revealed that 63% of Americans are paying more for internet that still feels unreliable. Even with the FCC now defining broadband as a minimum of 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload, many rural communities fall far below that standard.\n\nFor most rural households, T-Mobile Home Internet stands out as the top option. Its wide availability makes it accessible where wired service is unavailable and plans start at just $50 a month. Unlimited data and free equipment add to its appeal, making it a practical solution for areas underserved by traditional providers. Depending on your location, other providers worth considering include Ziply Fiber, Mediacom, CenturyLink, Kinetic and Rise Broadband. If none of those options are available, Starlink remains the strongest satellite choice. Here are CNET's top choices for rural internet providers based on availability, performance, pricing, data policies and customer satisfaction.\n\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.

While service isn’t the cheapest or the fastest of any rural internet provider, the unlimited data, free equipment and mobile bundle discounts help boost the provider’s overall value.

Those speeds are a boost from what T-Mobile Home Internet previously offered (72 to 245Mbps), thanks to equipment upgrades. Now, T-Mobile Home Internet offers two speed ranges and a slew of new perks to promote its plans. While those speeds may not be guaranteed, they're still an impressive boost to such a broadly available fixed wireless internet provider. Plus, all plans come without the hassle of added fees, data caps or contracts.

If you can get only 10Mbps or lower at your address and there are other options available, I'd recommend shopping elsewhere. There's a $17 monthly fee if you rent your Wi-Fi equipment, but this fee is skippable if you use your own equipment. You can also purchase your equipment for $200 up front, which might be a better option for long-term service.

However, select areas might be serviceable for its faster fiber speed tiers, offering gigabit speeds.

Where available, Rise Broadband would be my choice over satellite internet, since the provider offers speeds up to 250Mbps and latency low enough to support online gaming and truly unlimited data options -- all for a relatively low price compared to satellite. Rise offers a $5 equipment rental for a TP-Link DecoX21 Wi-Fi 6 mesh router. You can add extra mesh routers for $5 more a month, which may be useful for boosting whole-home Wi-Fi speeds.

For a satellite internet service, speeds aren't bad (100 to 350Mbps), and the unlimited data and low latency are a nice bonus, but initial and ongoing costs are high. The entry-level plan is priced at $80 a month with another plan available at $120 monthly, plus equipment will cost upwards of $349.

Ziply's entry-level plan, for example, starts at just $60 per month for symmetrical upload and download speeds of up to 300Mbps. The 300Mbps speed tier starts at $30 per month. All plans come with unlimited data and no contract requirements. Ziply has an impressive fiber network, but only about half of Ziply service areas are eligible for fiber service, according to the FCC. All others will rely on a DSL network which, like most DSL services, presents one plan option for the fastest speeds available.

Viasat: Pricing is a bit higher than rival satellite provider Hughesnet, but Viasat may offer a higher data allowance and faster max speeds, depending on where you live. If satellite internet is your only option, be sure to compare Hughesnet and Viasat closely before deciding on which is best for your home.\n\nFixed wireless and satellite internet are most common in rural and suburban areas, because providers can cover a large area with a single antenna tower, or with a constellation of satellites, and without needing to run cable to each home address. Wireless Internet Service Providers Association\n\nHow to improve your rural internet speeds\n\nInternet speeds tend to be slower in rural America. Here are some ways to help boost your home internet speeds in rural areas.\n\nSwitch providers or plans . A surefire way to improve your speeds is to switch to a provider with faster speeds or upgrade your plan with your current provider if you can. Faster providers or plans aren’t always available, but the search tool further up the page will give you an idea of what’s available in your area.\n\nA surefire way to improve your speeds is to switch to a provider with faster speeds or upgrade your plan with your current provider if you can. Faster providers or plans aren’t always available, but the search tool further up the page will give you an idea of what’s available in your area. Used a wired Ethernet connection . It’s common to experience slower speeds when using a Wi-Fi connection. If you have a stationary device with an Ethernet port, such as a desktop computer, gaming console or smart TV, plug it directly into your modem or router via an Ethernet cable for a faster, more reliable connection.\n\nIt’s common to experience slower speeds when using a Wi-Fi connection. If you have a stationary device with an Ethernet port, such as a desktop computer, gaming console or smart TV, plug it directly into your modem or router via an Ethernet cable for a faster, more reliable connection. Upgrade your equipment, or move closer to it. When only Wi-Fi will do, a high-quality router will help to keep your speeds as fast as possible throughout your home. If your connection is spotty, try moving closer to the router or adding Wi-Fi extenders to your network.\n\nWhen only Wi-Fi will do, a high-quality router will help to keep your speeds as fast as possible throughout your home. If your connection is spotty, try moving closer to the router or adding Wi-Fi extenders to your network. Limit the number of connected devices. The more active devices you have on your Wi-Fi network, the slower your speeds can be on each device. When running a particularly demanding task, such as streaming in HD or downloading a video game file, try disconnecting other, less-used devices from your network.\n\nThe more active devices you have on your Wi-Fi network, the slower your speeds can be on each device. When running a particularly demanding task, such as streaming in HD or downloading a video game file, try disconnecting other, less-used devices from your network. Watch your data usage. Some rural internet providers do enforce data caps. Going over your limit could result in significantly slower speeds for the remainder of your billing cycle, so keep an eye on your data usage if you have a cap.\n\nHow we chose the best rural internet providers\n\nAvailability is an important consideration for CNET when evaluating home internet providers, but it plays an even larger role when it comes to rural areas where there are fewer practical broadband options.\n\nUsing the most recent FCC data, I determined which wired and wireless providers had the largest coverage areas, particularly in regions with low population densities. I then compared advertised speeds, pricing and service details of each to determine which providers may be the best option for rural households.\n\nRural ISPs tend to be slower for roughly the same monthly costs as ISPs in urban areas, which means they tend to have a higher cost per Mbps. If you can qualify for a low-income plan, you can shave some money off your internet bill, and you can also save by buying your own internet equipment instead of renting. Ultimately, the best plan for your household comes down to your budget and how much internet speed you actually need.\n\nFor more information about our review process, see our guide to how CNET reviews internet providers.\n\nRural internet FAQs\n\nWhat are my options for internet in a rural area? Satellite internet from Hughesnet, Starlink or Viasat is almost always going to be an option because of the wireless delivery, but satellite comes with a few downsides, not least of which is the high pricing. Other wireless internet options for rural areas include fixed wireless service from providers such as Rise Broadband and AT&T and 5G home internet. T-Mobile offers the greatest 5G coverage in rural areas with max speeds of 133 to 415Mbps starting at $50 a month. DSL is another popular internet option in rural areas, but speeds can vary significantly by location and provider. For the fastest rural DSL speeds, look to ISPs CenturyLink and Kinetic. Cable internet is will likely be your best option for speed variety and connection reliability, but availability is limited in rural areas. Show more\n\nWhy aren't there more rural internet options? Installation and operation costs are the main factors preventing ISPs from expanding their networks into rural or suburban markets with low population density. Satellite and fixed wireless services are common in rural areas because providers can broadcast internet signals over a large area without having to run physical cables to each address. DSL service is also common since the technology largely makes use of existing phone lines, which are readily available in many rural areas. Coaxial (traditional \"cable\") and fiber-optic lines are less accessible in rural areas as the cost of installing lines is often much more than the provider will get in return. This means major cable internet providers like Cox, Spectrum and Xfinity, as well as fiber providers such as AT&T, Google Fiber and Verizon, are less inclined to expand service into rural areas. Show more\n\nWhat internet connection type is best for rural areas? Wired connection types, such as DSL (copper), cable and fiber-optic internet, typically offer faster speeds and better reliability than wireless, although 5G wireless home internet could prove to be a better option than DSL. Although fiber-optic internet is difficult to come by, especially in rural areas, cable internet is available to 82% of US households, according to the FCC, and is capable of download speeds of 250Mbps or higher in nearly all service areas. In rural areas where wired connections are unavailable, fixed wireless or 5G home internet are the top choices. You'll likely get faster speeds, more data (possibly unlimited) and lower latency with fixed wireless or 5G compared with satellite internet. As a last resort, satellite internet is available virtually everywhere. Prices are high for the speeds you get, and data restrictions can make it difficult to use your internet for streaming, but it's an option for rural internet if no others are available. Show more\n\nWho has the fastest rural internet? Ziply Fiber is the fastest rural internet provider with maximum download speeds of up to 50,000Mbps (50Gbps) available in rural parts of Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Ziply Fiber also offers a 5Gbps and 1Gbps plan. Aside from Ziply Fiber, the fastest rural internet providers include Kinetic, Rise Broadband and Mediacom, all of which offer maximum download speeds of around 1Gbps. Show more\n\nIs rural internet fast enough for streaming? Speeds of up to 10Mbps, which are available to nearly all US households, will support light streaming activity such as streaming in standard definition on a single device. Faster speeds, such as CenturyLink's 100Mbps plan or Mediacom's 100Mbps plan, will support streaming in higher resolution and on more devices. The primary issue with streaming in rural areas isn't speed but data. Streaming typically consumes more data than anything else we use the internet for, so you'll want to look for a rural internet option with a high data cap or unlimited data if you typically do a lot of streaming. Try to avoid satellite internet and its strict data limits that, once exceeded, may result in restricted or reduced speeds that cannot support streaming. Show more\n\nIs Viasat or Hughesnet better for rural areas? Viasat has faster maximum speeds -- over 150Mbps in select areas compared with Hughesnet's maximum of 100Mbps -- and possibly higher data allowances, but Hughesnet is cheaper and likely to be the better value. The choice between Hughesnet and Viasat comes down to whether Viasat's higher price is worth the potentially faster speeds and higher data allowance. For more details, check out our Hughesnet versus Viasat comparison. Show more\n\nWill internet service in rural areas get any better? It's doubtful that cable or fiber providers will significantly expand into rural areas unless a driving force like population growth or development occurs, but emerging 5G and satellite technologies could help close the digital divide in the coming years. While AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon are actively deploying 5G service across the US, Elon Musk and his satellite service Starlink are ramping up to completely disrupt the satellite internet market. Stay tuned for updates regarding these technologies and others that could impact your home internet service, rural or otherwise. Show more"

            "content": "There's always a new tech standard coming out (USB 4! 5G!), and sometimes it's hard to know if it's really worth upgrading your tech for a potentially small improvement.\n\nNot all new generations are major improvements, but in the case of Wi-Fi 7, early testing shows. Experts say that the latest Wi-Fi standard delivers a remarkable jump in speeds by doubling the width of the channels it uses to send signals to your devices. It's definitely worth the upgrade, especially if like to stream 4K video, to game without latency, or enjoy crystal-clear video calls.\n\nYou will need some new equipment to take advantage of Wi-Fi 7, though. MSI offers Wi-Fi 7 mesh routers designed to support high-speed connections anywhere in your home, and the company also makes add-ons to make your laptop or desktop computer compatible with the latest generation of Wi-Fi.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Wi-Fi 7—including how to upgrade your hardware.\n\nWi-FI 7 is the newest wireless standard, offering faster speeds and lower latency than Wi-Fi 6 and 6E.\n\nWi-Fi 7 introduces 320MHz channels and Multi-Link Operation (MLO) to improve efficiency and reliability.\n\nYou'll need a Wi-Fi 7 router and compatible devices to see full benefits.\n\nMesh systems, including models from MSI\n\nWhat is Wi-Fi 7?\n\nWi-Fi 7 is the fastest Wi-Fi that's currently available. It meets specific standards for performance, like bandwidth, reliability and latency, which is how long it takes data to move from your computer to its destination and back.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nWi-Fi 7 sticks with the same three bands we know from Wi-Fi 6E — 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz — so you might wonder what the big deal is. WiFi-7 widens the channels within those frequency bands so data can move through them faster. Think of it like merging narrow lines on a highway into one super-lane: Wi-Fi 7 bumps the 6GHz band from 160MHz to a massive 320MHz. By creating more open space on the digital road, you can move way more data at once without the traffic jams.\n\nWi-Fi 7 is already popular with gamers and streamers who love its super-fast speeds and low latency rates.\n\nIs Wi-Fi 7 really that much better?\n\nThe hype is real. Wi-Fi 7 offers speeds over three times as fast as previous standards Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E and five times faster than Wi-Fi 5. After testing a bunch of Wi-Fi 7 devices, PC Mag managing editor Tom Brant called the difference \"astonishing.\"\n\nHere's how Wi-Fi 7 increases theoretical throughput compared to previous versions:\n\nWi-Fi 7 drastically increases how much data can be transmitted at once, giving your data twice as many \"lanes\" to travel on.\n\nMulti-Link Operation (MLO) technology lets devices connect to multiple bands simultaneously, limiting latency and boosting efficiency and reliability.\n\nWi-Fi 7 offers speeds up to 40 GBPs—four times faster than Wi-Fi 6E—and can handle multiple devices more easily.\n\nMSI / CNET\n\nWhich devices support Wi-Fi 7?\n\nTo enjoy the ultra-fast connections of Wi-Fi 7, you'll need to upgrade your hardware. The good news is that more than 233 million Wi-Fi 7 devices are currently on the market, according to the Wi-Fi Alliance. You'll get the smoothest, speediest results if your entire network is Wi-Fi 7-enabled—meaning smartphones, tablets and PCs as well as your router, which communicates wirelessly between your modem and your devices.\n\nEven if you don't need super speeds, Wi-Fi 7 devices are smart future-proofing. They're also backwards-compatible, meaning they'll still work if other parts of your network are Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E.\n\nWhat's the best performing Wi-Fi 7 router?\n\nThe best Wi-Fi 7 router offers seamless coverage no matter where you are in your home. A high-quality mesh router like MSI's Roamii BE Pro or Roamii BE Lite includes multiple access points for powerful penetration through walls and ceilings. Both models cover several thousand square feet, support hundreds of connected devices at once and offer adaptive roaming—meaning no dropped connections as you move around the house. Additionally, now available in the MSI Router 2.0 App, the \"Find WiFi Spot\" tool allows for real-time signal diagnostics to identify the perfect location for nodes, ensuring a stable Wi-Fi 7 backhaul.\n\nCan I add Wi-Fi 7 to my PC or laptop?\n\nYes, you can adapt your existing hardware and combine it with a Wi-Fi-7 router to take advantage of this new technology.\n\nMSI's BE6500 WiFi 7 USB Adapter is an easy and affordable way to get faster connections, lower latency and better reception, even when you're further from your router. The adapter connects via USB and installs through standard drivers. Adds Wi-Fi 7 capability to a compatible desktop PC with the HERALD BE9400 WiFi 7 PCIe Card for a smoother, more responsive experience while gaming, streaming or working in the cloud.\n\nMaking the move to Wi-Fi 7\n\nWi-Fi 7 hardware is becoming more widely available, and mesh systems and adapters provide multiple ways to add the new standard to existing home networks. MSI's Roamii BE mesh routers and Wi-Fi 7 adapters are designed to deliver broader coverage, higher speeds and support for more connected devices across the home."

            "content": "Nintendo sure does love teasing us with Game Boy things.\n\nFirst, a collectible Lego Game Boy model last year that almost looked like a real Game Boy (but wasn't). Now, for the 30th anniversary of Pokemon, Nintendo and the Pokemon Group are selling a collectible music player that looks like a tiny Game Boy and plays authentic original Pokemon Red/Blue songs on swappable cartridges, one per song.\n\nThe Game Boy Jukebox is being sold on the Pokemon Center site for a whopping $70. It's so small, it uses button batteries.\n\nThis level of absurdity is standard issue for Nintendo: Just in the last 18 months, we've had Alarmo, a talking Super Mario flower and a Virtual Boy recreation. This new collectible is so tempting precisely because it looks like a little, even more pocketable Game Boy. Except it isn't a Game Boy at all. It's just a music player. Even the dot-matrix \"screen\" is fake -- it's just an overlay that the cartridges display when they're slotted in.\n\nThe music this thing plays is Game Boy-accurate, down to the little boot-up ping. It just makes my skin itch for a new Game Boy (one that isn't already made by several other companies).\n\nBut come on. Make a real Game Boy collectible with preloaded games. One that plays Pokemon Classic games and Tetris and more. You know you want to, Nintendo. It's only a matter of time.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're desperate for all 45 Pokemon Red and Blue songs on a little Game Boy music player, now's your chance."
