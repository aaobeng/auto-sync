Alvarez, 26, has emerged as a target for the Gunners, who've explored the conditions of a potential deal.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe ex-Manchester City star only joined Atletico 18 months ago but could be Arsenal's marquee signing this summer. Alvarez won't come cheap, though, as the La Liga side paid City £81.5million for his services and would want to make a decent chunk of profit.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt's been speculated that Barcelona want the Argentine to succeed Robert Lewandowski, whose contract expires in June. Barca witnessed the Argentine's quality when he scored in their 4-0 defeat to Atletico in the Copa del Rey earlier this month.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNow, it's been claimed by a member of Barcelona's hierarchy that the club are indeed looking for a new striker. Ferran Olive - Barca's treasurer under president Joan Laporta, who's up for re-election this month - was asked if they were in a position to sign a top striker.\n\nFOLLOW OUR ARSENAL FB PAGE! Latest Gunners news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nChampions League supercomputer in no doubt over Arsenal chances after dream draw READ MORE :\n\n\"Barcelona is in a position to do so,\" Olive told Culemania. \"In fact, Barcelona is currently looking for a top striker.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe chief was then asked if it was likely that Lewandowski will be offered a new contract. \"No, not in principle,\" Olive replied. \"I would say no.\"\n\nDespite the Barcelona striker insisting that no decision has been made on his future, Oliver's comments are telling. Lewandowski's departure, potentially to MLS outfit Chicago Fire, would free up room in Barca's budget for a player like Alvarez.\n\nBACK THE MIRROR! Ensure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Robert Lewandowski is out of contract in June (Image: Pressinphoto/Icon Sport via Getty Images)\n\nArsenal hope to use their sporting director, Andrea Berta, as a trump card to beat Barcelona to the 26-year-old's signature. Berta was the man to bring Alvarez to Madrid in 2024.\n\nIn October, the Argentina international said that he was 'very calm' when quizzed on his future. \"People always talk,\" Alavrez told ESPN. \"Last year, there was a lot of talk as well, but the season is just starting and my focus is on getting better every day, doing my best for the club, helping my team-mates and winning here.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAfter scoring 29 goals in his first season with Atletico, he's been less prolific this term. Alvarez is currently on 13 goals, but he'll be looking to increase his tally, especially when his side face Barcelona again in their Copa del Rey semi-final second leg at the Camp Nou next Tuesday.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Gianluca Prestianni is under investigation for alleged racial abuse towards Real Madrid's Vinicius Junior in a Champions League match last week.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhat he said to Vinicius is disputed, with Prestianni vehemently denying using racist language. The Argentinian's mouth was covered when he appeared to say something to Vinicius.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFIFA is understood to be keen to explore ways to tackle the issue, and is understood to have raised the idea of introducing a deterrent to such behaviour at a technical meeting on Friday ahead of the International Football Association Board (IFAB) annual general meeting in Wales on Saturday.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOne insider referred to it as 'Vinicius' Law' and the British associations - who make up the IFAB alongside FIFA - were understood to be receptive to the idea, although as it is so early in discussions the practicalities of enforcing it would need careful consideration.\n\nFOLLOW OUR REAL MADRID FB PAGE!

FIFA is also believed to have raised increasing the penalty for players walking off the pitch from a yellow to a red card in the wake of the chaos at the end of the Africa Cup of Nations final between Senegal and Morocco.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFIFA has been approached for comment. Vinicius was allegedly abused during Real Madrid's win over Benfica in Lisbon on February 17.\n\nThe 25-year-old left the field after reporting a member of the Benfica team - whom the Spanish side later claimed to have been Prestianni - to referee Francois Letexier. The match was paused in line with UEFA regulations, resulting in a stoppage in play lasting 10 minutes, with Vinicius going on to play the full game in Real’s 1-0 win.\n\nBACK THE MIRROR!

After celebrating in front of the home fans, the 25-year-old became visibly upset about something said to him and immediately informed Letexier.\n\nAfter the game, Vinicius posted in Portuguese on his Instagram story: “Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts in their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe started for Real in Wednesday's return and had the final word as the Spanish giants reached the last 16, with a cool 80th-minute finish securing a 2-1 win on the night and 3-1 aggregate success.\n\nUEFA had imposed a provisional sanction on Prestianni on Monday, ruling him out of the tie, although the winger had travelled to Madrid as part of the Benfica squad. The Portuguese club had appealed against the decision to ban Prestianni, but UEFA dismissed the case on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

What's he cost €20m (£18.2m)? I think that tells you everything about him at this point.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It tells me he's [Lammens] not a top goalkeeper. As soon as that man [Donnarumma] became available, drive to Paris, go and get him, give him whatever he wants.\"\n\nHowever, Lammens has well and truly made Scholes eat his words. The Belgian custodian has emerged as one of the most impressive goalkeepers in the Premier League this season.\n\nLammens has let in just 26 goals across 21 top-flight fixtures in 2025/26 and delivered arguably his finest display yet during the 1-0 triumph at Everton on Monday. He pulled off four saves, four punches, two high claims and remained authoritative throughout as he earned the Premier League Player of the Match for his contribution.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Senne Lammens won the Player of the Match during Manchester United's win at Everton\n\nSpeaking after the Everton clash, Lammens drew comparisons to former United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, who was covering the match for Sky Sports. \"[I] just try to stay calm, play my own game,\" Lammens said.\n\n\"I know I have the qualities, I wouldn't be here otherwise. So, [I] just believe in myself, the players around me and my teammates support me really much.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Now I just keep on building, keep getting that confidence. Like today, getting those wins, feeling important, is really important. And yeah, like you said, if I'm in a comparison with Edwin van der Sar, it's always nice to hear.\"\n\nThroughout Lammens' 21 Premier League outings, United have suffered defeat on only two occasions. One came in the 1-0 reverse against Everton in November, whilst the other was a 2-1 setback at Aston Villa.\n\nAdditionally, Lammens' stops have prevented 5.5 more goals than the average goalkeeper based on the quality of accurate shots he has denied, according to OPTA's expected goals on target (xGOT) conceded model. No Premier League keeper can rival that record since the Belgian's United debut on October 4.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHis impact has been astronomical, with some claiming that Lammens is - and could be - United's best and most influential signing in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Lammens has made the No.1 spot his own and it's clear that he is far above Onana, who is on loan at Trabzonspor, and Bayindir in the pecking order.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Sterling, 31, looked rusty after coming on as a second-half substitute in Feyenoord's 2-1 win against Telstar last Sunday.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt was understandable given that the former Manchester City star's previous competitive appearance was in May 2025, his final game on loan at Arsenal. Sterling had been exiled at Chelsea, who finally agreed to terminate his contract after six months training away from the first-team squad.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHis performance was panned by Dutch media and Van Persie has described some criticism as 'inappropriate'. \"If you have a little sense of context, where he comes from, what he's achieved in the past, and that he hasn't had any team training for months,\" the Feyenoord manager began.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I understand that there are expectations of an absolute top player, but to criticise him like that after half an hour - his first half hour after over six months - then you really don't understand anything at all.\"\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

The Reds offloaded Alexander-Arnold to Los Blancos for £10m on June 1 in 2025, just 30 days before his contract expired.\n\nLiverpool injury latest: Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong updates ahead of West Ham READ MORE :\n\n12 things you must know about Champions League draw and crucial data around the ties READ MORE :\n\nWhile the transfer to the Norwegian club has gone through four months before the young star's contract expired, compared to less than a month for Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool have managed to get a fee for his services.\n\nKone-Doherty, who attracted interest from several clubs, is able to make the switch due to Norway's transfer window being open ahead of their domestic league's commencement next month. Last year, Molde finished 10th in the 16-team Eliteserien.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe winger, who celebrates his 20th birthday in June, joined Liverpool in the summer of 2022 from Derry City and progressed through the Academy ranks, playing for the Under-18s and Under-21s whilst also regularly featuring in the UEFA Youth League, FA Youth Cup and EFL Trophy.\n\nView 2 Images Trent Doherty-Kone in action for Liverpool (Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe Republic of Ireland Under-21s international was on the bench for the Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven in January 2025 before making his senior Reds debut as a substitute in the FA Cup fourth round loss at Plymouth Argyle the following month.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nKone-Doherty also made a late appearance in the 3-0 League Cup defeat to Crystal Palace at Anfield in October.\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE!

The former England boss has ruled himself out of contention, as he has 'no passion' to work in the Premier League at this time.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSouthgate hasn't coached a team since quitting as England manager in July 2024, shortly after the losing the European Championship final. The 55-year-old has focussed on business ventures and he's set to host a TV show.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn a new interview, Southgate reiterated that he isn't planning on a return to the dugout any time soon. \"I've got no passion to just go and manage in the Premier League,\" he told The Football Boardroom podcast.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I did that at 35, I finished 11th, 12th. Who is in those positions now, probably Bournemouth, Brighton? I've had one of the biggest jobs in world football so I've been spoiled. Huge nights, working with outstanding players. No owner interfering.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nMan Utd boss Michael Carrick hints where he stands on Harry Maguire contract decision READ MORE :\n\nThe ex-Middlesbrough boss was linked with the United vacancy after Ruben Amorim was sacked last month. Michael Carrick has been given the job until the end of this season and United have hired Steve Holland, Southgate's right-hand man for England, as one of Carrick's assistants.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, he and Holland won't be reuniting at Old Trafford. Southgate also acknowledged the backlash he'd receive if a club such as United appointed him, having been perceived by some as a failure with England.\n\n\"The bit that, externally, people are saying is, 'well, he didn't win'. So how do you prove that you can win? You've got to go to one of those big clubs,\" he explained.\n\n\"Now we know those big clubs… do I think I could have done the job that some people who have been in those clubs recently have done?

And there's a reality around (that), I can understand what that noise is. There's that bit which makes me potentially a complicated appointment for a club.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSouthgate went on to confirm: \"I don't want to go and manage a different national team. Club? It's honestly not what I'm looking to do.\n\n\"Now, two years after leaving England, I'm not actively looking for a role in coaching. If that European final was the bit (in coaching) I wouldn't worry about that.\n\n\"Because there is another 15-20 years of my life ahead of me and I’m excited about a different video, a different movie, a different part of my life.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Up 2lb for that victory, he has obvious claims under Dylan Johnston.\n\nTwinjets scored by 10 lengths when beating off Heltenham over this track and 2m 4f trip in November and can be forgiven a poor run when unseating at Cheltenham in January. He returns from a short break with an excellent chance for trainer Paul Nicholls who has won this race a record nine times.\n\nIssam justified favouritism when landing a Kempton handicap chase last time and shapes as if he could have plenty more left in the tank.\n\nHeltenham, the 2024 winner, is another with each-way claims for Dan Skelton and Charlie Todd.\n\n2.30 Doncaster - King's Threshold and Dartmoor Pirate feature\n\nA splendid renewal of the Virgin Bet Grimthorpe Handicap Chase at Doncaster where King's Threshold and Dartmoor Pirate headline a field of 13.\n\nEmma Lavelle's King's Threshold had options at the Cheltenham Festival next month but has chosen to come here and could be the one to beat under James Bowen. The form of his latest Newbury win is solid, and he must be taken seriously.\n\nDartmoor Pirate seeks a hat-trick after winning at Lingfield before taking the Great Yorkshire Chase at this venue last time and he looks a danger from 5lb higher in the weights. New Order was second in that contest and merits respect off the same mark.\n\nNeil Mulholland has three runners in here with Kelce the pick under Conor O'Farrell. The eight-year-old racked up a third success over fences and the extra couple of furlongs to 3m 2f ought to suit this strong stayer.\n\nStablemates Broomfields Cave and Lord Accord complete the shortlist.\n\n2.35 Lingfield - Red-hot Ten Carat Harry faces Richie's Rocket\n\nLingfield stages a trappy-looking Listed BetMGM Spring Cup Stakes where in-form Ten Carat Harry faces seven rivals.\n\nA perfect six wins from six starts on the all-weather, Jamie Osborne's charge has been progressing through the grades this winter and deserves a crack at this better race. The manner of his latest Newcastle victory was impressive and the step up to seven furlongs should not inconvenience him.\n\nRichie's Rocket, third on debut at Newmarket in October, made a sparkling all-weather debut when clearing away to win by nine lengths over this trip and track the following month. Well-backed on that occasion, he quickened stylishly despite showing signs of greenness and rates one to follow.\n\nOf the others, Hilitany has some useful form from Meydan this year, while Sir Albert and Bella Lyra are worth a mention.\n\nBest of the rest\n\n5.40am Randwick - Group One Verry Elleegant Stakes where Golden Eagle winner Autumn Glow features and Trinity College debuts for Waller. Sir Delius appears too!\n\nMeydan - Super Saturday\n\n2.50 Meydan - Group Three with Symbol Of Honour and Run Boy Run involved.\n\n3.25 Meydan - Group Three with Apollo One declared.\n\n4.00 Meydan - Group Two where Quddwah and Alakazi clash.\n\n4.35 Meydan - Group Two Al Maktoum Classic with Mendelssohn Bay and Heart Of Honor fancied.\n\n5.10 Meydan - Group Two Dubai City Of Gold - Rebel's Romance tops eight runners.\n\n5.55 Meydan - Group Three with Audience representing David O'Meara.\n\n6.30 Meydan - Talk Of New York is expected to be useful for Charlie Appleby.\n\n2.40 Newbury - Rodney bids for a four-timer.\n\n3.15 Newbury - Brave Kingdom and Eldorado Allen headline Veterans' Chase. Mister Coffey, Hang In There and Capodanno also feature.\n\n4.58 Newbury - Joe Tizzard's Fairy Park rates an intriguing debutant.\n\n1.25 Doncaster - Listed mares novices' hurdle with Coolanna and Broomfield Aderra fancied.\n\n1.55 Doncaster - Mighty Bandit and Queens Gamble headline classy handicap field.\n\n3.52 Lingfield - Royal Jet bids for another success.\n\n6.30 Southwell - Unbeaten Chantelle features for Sir Mark Prescott.\n\n7.00 Southwell - Aisling Oscar is back again!\n\n7.30 Southwell - Charlie Appleby saddles two newcomers.

            "content": "Tim Henman feels Emma Raducanu is better off without a coach despite the British No 1 reuniting with Mark Petchey on an informal basis ahead of Indian Wells - live on Sky Sports Tennis.\n\nRaducanu parted company with Francisco Roig in the wake of her second-round defeat at the Australian Open.\n\nShe enjoyed a strong run of form while working with Andy Murray's former coach Petchey early in 2025 in a temporary arrangement, but hired Roig in August as she sought a new permanent fixture.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights of the Transylvania Open final as Raducanu struggled in defeat against Sorana Cirstea\n\nFollowing a six-month spell in which she has endured disappointing results, Roig, who formerly coached Rafael Nadal, became the ninth coach to depart since Raducanu's 2021 US Open win, with the pair gelling well on a personal level but not aligning on style of play.\n\nHer next tournament in Romania saw her reach her first final since her victory in New York in 2021, and since the split from Roig, Raducanu insisted she is happy working only with hitting partner Alexis Canter, a 27-year-old British former player who reached a career-high ranking of 779 last year.\n\nThe 23-year-old, coming off a first-round defeat to Antonia Ruzic at the Dubai Tennis Championships, is set to retain Canter as part of her setup as well as working with Petchey in the lead-up to Indian Wells next week.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Marion Bartoli believes Raducanu will learn more from playing the top players after she exited the US Open\n\nSky Sports analyst Henman thinks British No 1 Raducanu doesn't need a coach and should concentrate on working on her physicality to match the likes of fellow Grand Slam champions Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Elena Rybakina and Coco Gauff.\n\n\"I just wonder whether she's better off without a coach and that's nothing against Petch,\" said the four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist. \"He's someone I've known for a long time and he's a very, very good coach but we know it's not going to be a full-time appointment because Petch has his broadcast commitments.\n\n\"Emma has talked about her identity, her game style and she wants to own it. She's been around long enough on the tour so I wonder whether that might be a good option for her but it's her prerogative.\n\n\"I worked with three coaches in 15 years. I like the consistency and continuity and we know that coaches don't last long working with Emma.\n\n\"An aggressive game style is how you have to play. You have got to be aggressive because if you don't your opponent will be and for me. I want to see her build her physicality: to get stronger, more resilient, to hit the ball harder.\n\n\"And I think if she does that, that'll mean that she has less interruptions and less little setbacks physically. She'll be able to compete at a high level for longer periods, so if I could add one element it would be the physical side.\n\n\"Raducanu does work on her physical side. I think her tennis game is outstanding but when you think of the physicality of Sabalenka, Swiatek, Rybakina, Gauff, she's not in the same league.\n\n\"The physicality is the biggest challenge.\"\n\nPetchey helped inspire the most productive period of Raducanu's season as she reached the quarter-finals at Queen's before running Sabalenka close in the third round of Wimbledon.\n\nEmma Raducanu's NINE coaches\n\nNigel Sears\n\n\n\nBest known for coaching former top five players Amanda Coetzer, Daniela Hantuchova, Anett Kontaveit and Ana Ivanovic, Sears joined her team in April 2021 and oversaw her incredible breakthrough run to the Wimbledon fourth round.\n\n\n\nAndrew Richardson\n\n\n\nGuided Raducanu to her historic Grand Slam title at the US Open as a qualifier. Raducanu opted not to extend his trial contract immediately after the victory.\n\n\n\nTorben Beltz\n\n\n\nAngelique Kerber's former coach lasted only five months. They split in April 2022 with Raducanu transitioning towards a new training model involving LTA coaching support.\n\n\n\nDmitry Tursunov\n\n\n\nRaducanu took on the former pro on a trial basis during the summer of 2022 but Tursunov decided not to continue, later citing red flags in her camp that he felt could not be ignored for a long-term commitment.\n\n\n\nSebastian Sachs\n\n\n\nThe German joined in late 2022 but the partnership was cut short when Raducanu required multiple surgeries, leading to a mutual split.\n\n\n\nNick Cavaday\n\n\n\nThe 14-month stint was her longest professional partnership, helping her return to the top 60 before he stepped down in early 2025 due to personal health issues.\n\n\n\nVlado Platenik\n\n\n\nHired on a trial basis in March 2025, the partnership lasted only 14 days.\n\n\n\nMark Petchey\n\n\n\nAndy Murray's former coach provided crucial tactical knowledge through Wimbledon where she went out to world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, despite an encouraging display.\n\n\n\nFrancisco Roig\n\n\n\nAppointed in August 2025, Rafael Nadal's former mentor offered elite tactical clarity, but after her Australian Open exit in January 2026, Raducanu announced their split.\n\n\n\nRobson: Raducanu has 'same ideas' as Petchey\n\nImage: Petchey coached Raducanu during the grass-court season\n\nFormer Junior Wimbledon champion Laura Robson sees Raducanu's happiness on court as the biggest advantage and argues working with Petchey can only bring out the best in her.\n\nShe said: \"I think we make such a big deal out of the coaching situation and as long as she is feeling happy on the court, as long as she's confident out there then that's half the job done, and that's what coaches try and bring out in you when you do have one.\n\n\"She obviously gets on really well with Petch. They've been on and off for a fair few years now and it's someone she knows. They have the same ideas. They agree on so much that she needs to bring out there, so why not?\n\n\"As long as you've got someone who's taking care of the boring stuff like the logistics of booking practice, finding someone to practice with, racket re-strings - all of that. As long as that's taken care of, then you can just focus on trying to play.\n\n\"They have the same identity of how both of them feel she should be as a player.\"\n\nRaducanu is hoping to hoping to revert to a more aggressive style in order to compete with the top players and Robson says she has shown in the past she is capable of playing against the elite on the WTA Tour.\n\n\"For sure. We've seen how close her matches against Sabalenka have been,\" said former British No 1 Robson.\n\n\"It feels like everyone is adding different elements to their game all the time, so at the moment it feels like she wants to add that aggression back into her game and once you've got that you can start thinking about adding more variety again so you've got more strings to your bow.\n\n\"But you want to have a clear identity as a player before you go out onto any match court - so long as that's defined in your mind then that's half the job done.\"\n\nOverend on Raducanu finding the right balance\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Jonathan Overend believes that if Raducanu can find the right balance with the correct coach, she will be set up for a great year of tennis\n\nSpeaking earlier this month, Sky Sports commentator Jonathan Overend said Raducanu will only be able to find the right balance in her setup once she answers a key question.\n\n\"I think she has spent a lot of her young career re-evaluating,\" he said. \"In one regard, it explains why she has been through so many coaches and why she has been criticised for it.\n\n\"It's typical of Raducanu that she wants to keep re-evaluating and finding out what is best for her on and around a tennis court.\n\n\"That challenge continues, and to some extent it is a struggle, because finding the right balance is so hard, but I think she is slowly getting [it], not in terms of her Grand Slam results but in terms of that re-evaluation process.\n\n\"What is it she really wants for herself on a tennis court and in tournaments?\"\n\nWatch the ATP and WTA Tours, live on Sky Sports or stream with NOW and the Sky Sports app, giving Sky Sports customers access to over 50 per cent more live sport this year at no extra cost.

            "content": "Fernando Mendoza - the potential No 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft - says the opportunity to be mentored by Tom Brady if he is selected by the Las Vegas Raiders would be \"fantastic\".\n\nThe former Indiana Hoosiers quarterback was attending the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis on Friday after a National Championship-winning season in college that has made him the hot favourite to be taken by the Raiders with the top selection.\n\nLas Vegas have one of the more intriguing quarterback situations in the NFL, as seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Brady became a minority owner in 2024.\n\nAlthough Brady is not directly involved in coaching, the Raiders haven't had a young, potential face of the franchise in the past two years for Brady to mentor. That is expected to change if the franchise invest a high NFL Draft pick in a quarterback.\n\nWhile Brady was not present in Indianapolis, 22-year-old Mendoza said they had spoken on the phone briefly, and was asked what he would think of working with the NFL legend.\n\nImage: Tom Brady is a minority owner for the Las Vegas Raiders and would be expected to help develop a young quarterback\n\nHe said: \"Yeah, I mean, who hasn't admired Tom Brady? I mean, more Super Bowl rings than anybody ... anybody!\n\n\"So, that opportunity would be fantastic.\n\n\"Brady, I believe, is the greatest quarterback of all time - by a wide margin - and to be able to have the opportunity to be mentored by him would mean so much.\n\n\"Especially to learn, and I'm all about learning. So from day one, I've got to learn a lot.\n\n\"It's going to be a long journey, and to potentially have a mentor like that, it would be pretty impressive and pretty meaningful.\"\n\nImage: Mendoza was a winner in college but will likely begin his NFL career on one of the worst teams in the league\n\nMendoza revealed that he had a \"great\" meeting with the Raiders, who appointed Super Bowl-winning Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak as their head coach earlier this month as they look to rebuild after a fourth straight losing season.\n\nAlthough he admitted there's no guarantee he will end up in Las Vegas after April's event in Pittsburgh, Mendoza was enthused about his meeting with the team.\n\n\"It was a fantastic interview,\" he said.\n\n\"The coaching staff were in there. We went over some of my previous plays and drew some plays on the board.\n\n\"I thought it was a great meeting, and I know they have the prospective No 1 pick, but anything can happen in the draft. I'm just excited for the opportunity.\n\n\"Whatever team drafts me, I'm just going to give everything I have to them.\""

            "content": "Arsenal’s journey under Mikel Arteta has long been a reference point for Chelsea’s owners. It is part of the club’s shift towards youth and potential after the Roman Abramovich era. Chelsea have built with a long-term view and, seeing how Arteta has reversed Arsenal’s decline since his appointment as manager in December 2019, have been keen to find a young coach capable of becoming a similarly galvanising force at Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt is not an easy task. Chelsea briefly thought they had their rising star when they hired Graham Potter in September 2022, only for his reign to end after seven months. Now there is hope that Liam Rosenior can become Chelsea’s answer to Arteta. Rosenior is young, confident, talented and a little unconventional in the way he presents himself. It is early days but the 41-year-old has made an encouraging start, winning eight of his first 12 games, and has transmitted enough authority to keep jibes about his inexperience at bay so far.\n\nDoes he have it in him to match Arteta though? More pertinently, will he be given the time to succeed? Just over six years on from turning to Arteta after firing Unai Emery, Arsenal stand five points clear at the top of the Premier League before hosting Chelsea on Sunday. They have benefited from a stable environment. Rosenior, by contrast, is the fifth permanent head coach under the ownership of Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly. Chelsea have had nine managers, including interims, during the Arteta era. It is impossible to ignore the upheaval when it comes to working out why Chelsea have not mustered a title challenge since winning the league in 2017.\n\nThey remain a strong cup team, capable of raising their level in one-off games, but the consistency required to keep up with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City in the league has been lacking. Rosenior has already felt it. Chelsea have been at their careless worst in their past two league games, home draws with Burnley and Leeds the consequence of a repeated inability to stay focused and defend a lead in mature fashion.\n\nDropping 19 points from winning positions this season says a lot about the squad’s mentality. Rosenior has to tackle the listlessness. Behind closed doors he should make clear that he did not like Malo Gusto wasting a promising attack with a pointless no-look pass against Burnley. Chelsea cannot afford to be cocky. They have to be honest about where they are short. They have to acknowledge that they have a discipline problem. They have had eight red cards this season and were pegged back by Burnley – whose stoppage-time equaliser arrived when one of Rosenior’s players dozed off at a corner – after losing Wesley Fofana to a needless second yellow card.\n\nView image in fullscreen Liam Rosenior is young and confident, and has transmitted enough authority to keep jibes about his inexperience at bay so far. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThe frustration is that there are times when Chelsea look like a serious team. They have beaten the champions of England, Italy, Spain and France in the past 12 months. They face Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League and it would not be a surprise if they went through. Chelsea are different in the big games. They have a daunting run-in but are not fearful of top opposition. The problem is more that they switch off when expected to win.\n\nRosenior has to lift standards. He has the youngest squad in the Premier League and needs time to instil good habits. Whether Rosenior lasts, though, will partly come down to whether Chelsea are capable of leaving the chaos behind. Can they hold their nerve when results dip? It is one thing to find your Arteta but another to stand by him when the pressure rises and fans are baying for blood.\n\nIt is worth remembering that it has not always been plain sailing for Arteta. The Spaniard was 37 when he replaced Emery and earned his first managerial role. He arrived with Arsenal struggling to move on from how the Arsène Wenger era fizzled out. There was a lot of damage to repair. The squad were a mess and although Arteta ended his first season on a high, winning the FA Cup thanks to surprise victories over City and Chelsea, it was not long before he was in danger of losing his job.\n\nArsenal were 15th and winless in seven league games before beating Frank Lampard’s Chelsea on Boxing Day in 2020. Arteta was in trouble. He needed Arsenal’s trust. Even then it was not until the second half of the 2021-22 season that Arteta’s vision truly became clear. Arsenal have had to fight their way to the top. They have also stuck with Arteta through three consecutive second-placed finishes. They have had to be resolute in their belief that he is the man to win their first title since 2004.\n\nArteta has driven the process. He is the manager, not the head coach, the individual knitting everything together. Arsenal have a sporting director but Arteta is the face of the club. There is no doubt about his power. Arsenal have thrown everything into winning now. They have targeted experienced, established players in an attempt to get over the line. They have filled holes that needed filling. Signing Martín Zubimendi, Noni Madueke, Viktor Gyökeres and Eberechi Eze last summer gave them depth and quality in every position, while exposing a key point of difference with Chelsea’s model of centring recruitment around young talents who will need time to adapt to English football.\n\nIt remains an issue for Chelsea that, for every hit, there is a signing struggling to meet expectations. João Pedro has shone since signing from Brighton last summer but Liam Delap has been disappointing and Alejandro Garnacho is still the winger who blew hot and cold at Manchester United. There has been too much volatility. Erratic performances are not a surprise. Chelsea are still to prove that their project will work. Their bet is that hoovering up some of the best young talent in the world will give them a team to fear. They are convinced that their collaborative structure, with a head coaching working in tandem with five sporting directors, breeds stability.\n\nYet it will take more than handing Rosenior a six-and-a-half-year deal to show that Chelsea understand why Arteta has flourished at Arsenal. There will come a time when the heat rises. Chelsea’s faith in Rosenior will be tested. How will they react?"

            "content": "As Wolves applied the seal to only their second Premier League victory of the season, Rodrigo Gomes doubling their lead over Aston Villa deep into second-half stoppage time, Rob Edwards hared down the touchline, yelling into the stands as his players started a celebratory pile-on a few yards behind him. It was a moment of catharsis for Edwards, who beat his chest and wellied an advertising hoarding, but for Unai Emery it was a different kind of cue.\n\nAs those in old gold savoured a win over near neighbours that takes them to 13 points, ending any fears that they may not eclipse Derby’s record-low tally of 11 in 2007-08, Emery marched straight down the tunnel before the post-match handshakes.\n\nWolves’s other Premier League win came against West Ham at the start of last month and no wonder the supporters savoured every second. “The two games we’ve won in the league this year, both managers have disappeared from the touchline,” Edwards said with a smile. “I think everyone expects just to turn up and win, which is understandable given how this season has gone.”\n\nAt the end of the season, how costly might this untimely slip prove for Villa? Judging by the way Emery fumed, this defeat will hurt for a while yet and, significantly, it could have major implications for their hopes of returning to the Champions League. They are on a poor run of form having taken only one win in their past six matches in all competitions and 12 points from their past nine league games. Emery called for perspective.\n\n“Maybe you can say: ‘We are losing the chance to the win the Premier League,’” Emery said animatedly. “Some supporters maybe were dreaming. Now we are not with the possibility to fight for the Premier League, some can feel frustrated, even myself because I have my dreams. In September I was worried and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. One month ago I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League.”\n\nView image in fullscreen A sodden Unai Emery tries to spur on his Aston Villa team as they struggled against Wolves. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters\n\nVilla were unpicked by a team almost certainly heading for the Championship but, as they did when rousing to a draw against the leaders, Arsenal, Wolves showed they will go down fighting.\n\nJoão Gomes fired in his first goal in a year just after the hour, starting the move himself after nutmegging the Villa substitute Ross Barkley, and then Rodrigo Gomes put the game beyond doubt on the counterattack, after Yerson Mosquera and José Sá combined to deny Amadou Onana. Morgan Rogers’s attempt to recycle a corner ended with Wolves attacking three v two. Rogers had his face in the turf as Rodrigo Gomes swivelled near the penalty spot and buried the ball past Emiliano Martínez.\n\nIt was never going to be an evening for the purists and driving rain did little to enhance this soggy Midlands derby as a spectacle. It was a contest bogged down by misplaced passes, clunky touches and the ball slowing unpredictably on a saturated surface. Ezri Konsa can vouch for that, the Villa centre-back nudging the ball back to Martínez with his big toe, just as Adam Armstrong sought to prey on Douglas Luiz’s loose pass. It was a night for the poncho-clad Wolves supporters in the uncovered Graham Hughes stand in a corner of this stadium. Hugo Bueno looked battle-hardened, the reverse of the Wolves full-back’s old gold shirt caked in mud.\n\nEmery grew increasingly agitated as the game went on. He exploded as Jadon Sancho declined to take a shot first time at the back post and there was a restlessness within the home support too. Edwards gestured for calm as the locals aired their frustration at Jackson Tchatchoua looking inside for the perceived easy pass. Wolves struggled to hold on to the ball and when they did have it surrendered possession cheaply, João Gomes among those guilty. Sá, wearing the captain’s armband, shanked a goal-kick straight out of play to the disbelief of those in the stands.\n\nWolves, certainly not lacking in spirit, defended admirably. Tchatchoua did well to halt Ian Maatsen, one of those thrown on by Emery as Villa chased the game. Toti Gomes halted an advancing Leon Bailey, another second-half substitute. Bueno blocked off all avenues for Cash and turned to celebrate with the home fans. Then, at the final whistle, having doubled their lead, Wolves let loose."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says his Tottenham players are not fit enough and has questioned their desire to put in the hard yards without the ball.\n\nThe interim head coach has a clearer idea of the problems he faces after two weeks – and there are many of them, including low levels of confidence and the capacity of the younger players to handle the pressure of a relegation battle.\n\nTudor knows there are reasons for the physical issues with the squad stretched by an injury crisis amid a punishing schedule. Although Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso are in contention to return for Sunday’s trip to Fulham, Tottenham will be without eight injured players plus the suspended Cristian Romero.\n\nTudor believes there is only one way out of the situation – an on-the-hoof fitness reboot in training, particularly as the club had no midweek fixture last week or this. The Croat surprised the players by working them extremely hard throughout last week and not tapering off before last Sunday’s home game against Arsenal, which they lost 4-1. As Tudor made plain, it is not a time to pander to player sensibilities.\n\n“Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,” Tudor said. “They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and it made the physical condition of the team drop down. So we need to use this period where we don’t play the games to put some petrol in the engine so the engine starts to work better.\n\n“They are fatigued. To do the pressing high you need to be fit. But [it is] all of them because if someone is not in the right shape there is a problem because someone is coming late [to the press].\n\n“The second thing is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back. If you run up and don’t run back it’s a problem. For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it’s a big question what we can do and what we cannot do.”\n\nTudor was asked about his full-throttle approach from the first training session. “Yes, that’s the only way – running,” he said. “The pitch is 100 yards, it’s long. So you need to run.\n\n“Maybe you have habits to, I don’t know … work a bit less. I put some runs without the ball [into the sessions]. Never players like runs without the ball so we put some runs without balls. But it’s a moment when there is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn’t like. And the best thing is that they understand this. They gave me their availability to do these things.”\n\nTudor is under no illusions about the size of the challenge. It was put to him that the striker, Randal Kolo Muani, had played well against Arsenal. “That’s good, one good thing,” he replied.\n\nWhat Tudor wants to see at Fulham and beyond is players such as Kolo Muani stepping up, accepting the responsibility. “Some players are still young,” he said. “They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to resolve the problems.\n\nView image in fullscreen Randal Kolo Muani scores against Arsenal – Igor Tudor wants him to keep raising his game for Spurs. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\n“If you have too many of these players because of the amount of injuries, who are playing together in the squad, it does create some problems. But it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man. To say: ‘Come on, I’m the guy, give me the ball, I will score.’ Instead of just: ‘What can I do? I’m just here, you know.’\n\n“It’s always how you see the situation. It’s not: ‘I’m just here. We had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play.’ How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy and positive, there is opportunity.”\n\nTudor has not dwelt for long on the derby with Arsenal. “No, no, forget that,” he said. It was never likely to be a game that would define the club’s survival hopes. The same is not true of Fulham – or the home fixture against Crystal Palace next Thursday.\n\n“After the first game, I said if you play against the best team in the world at this moment, it’s not a realistic game to show [whether] we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,” Tudor said. “That’s the truth. They show they can be in some parts of the game. But for long periods we had problems, in defence especially. It’s not easy against them. Let’s see in the next games.”"

            "content": "1. Title run-in all about ‘little details’ Pep Guardiola has told his Manchester City players their pursuit of honours in the final three months of the season will depend on their “brains and minds”. City, who remain in contention for four trophies, meet title rivals Arsenal in the Carabao Cup final and Newcastle in the fifth-round of the FA Cup next month, as well as Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League. In the Premier League, they are five points behind Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal with a game in hand. City have had no midweek games for two weeks and – after the visit to Leeds on Saturday – Guardiola has given his players Sunday to Tuesday off as he believes the challenge in the defining part of the campaign is more mental than technical. Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more “There are still things that we should train and practise more, but I prioritised rest,” Guardiola said. “With three months left, there are many things that the team have improved in and still some things that the team has to improve, but now it is the little details. “Now it is how it is in your brains and your minds that will make the difference. Maybe for the new players it is new, but we have talked a lot in many meetings for many years that, when you arrive in the last three months, competing in all competitions, everything is here [points to his head].” Jamie Jackson\n\nEddie Howe has urged Anthony Gordon not to be distracted by reports linking him with a summer move to Arsenal amid speculation that the 25-year-old winger will be a target for the title-chasing Gunners. Howe, who is still dealing with the fallout from Alexander Isak’s defection to Liverpool last summer, could do without a repeat of that saga, but the Newcastle manager admits there is little he can do to prevent it. Newcastle face Gordon’s former cub Everton in the Premier League on Saturday and Howe said: “I’m not sure there’s a lot I can do about that. I’ve not seen the story, so it’s news to me. But we’re mid-season, we’re in the middle of some of the biggest games of his career and who knows what’s going to happen internationally with him in the summer as well? “He’s got no time to look left or right, he’s got to be fully focused on straight ahead and the next game and trying to be as good as he can be.” View image in fullscreen Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon is reported to be on Arsenal’s wishlist. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA Gordon, who earlier this month dismissed rumours he was on the way out of the club where he signed a new contract in October 2024, will hope to continue his good run of form to secure a place in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for this summer’s World Cup finals and Howe is hopeful he will not be unsettled by talk over his future. “It comes with the territory of being a top player and playing at this level, that there’s going to be speculation,” said Howe. “You’ve just got to put it out of your brain and you’ve got to focus on the football because as we know with our schedule, there’s so many games, there’s no time for distractions. We have to be fully focused on each match.” PA Media\n\n3. Moyes blames referees for corner ‘dark arts’ David Moyes has claimed corner-kick routines are turning into wrestling contests because referees have ignored “the dark arts” for too long. Moyes’s Everton team were criticised for crowding the Manchester United goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, at several corners during their 1-0 defeat at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Monday. Ahead of Saturday’s game at Newcastle, the Everton manager insisted that went against his gameplan but he, and other managers, would seek any advantage that the laws of the game offer. However, he also believes referees should take a harder line to try to eradicate jostling at set-pieces. “Truthfully, it wasn’t the plan for our corner kicks to end up like that. But I think there’s a bigger issue with it,” Moyes said. “It has been allowed to let go, whether it be blocking of goalkeepers or blocking of defenders, and you get the feeling now that referees really don’t want to get involved in any of it. It is nearly wrestling to an extent, which it shouldn’t be. It should never have got to this situation, but I think it’s been really poor that they’ve not tried to deal with it well enough and stop it. “You are now allowed lots of blocking, for example. In my day, if you blocked someone it would have been a free-kick. But blocking has become a big part of it. Let’s be fair, the best at it – but with style – would be Arsenal: good delivery, good style, but ultimately there’s a lot of dark arts in it such as blocking the goalkeeper from the back or the front, blocking defenders and making it difficult for them to be your key headers of the ball. “It is a big thing in football, but I do think the level of refereeing has let that part of the game drop. And managers, if we see somebody else doing it and not getting punished for it, then we are all on it.” View image in fullscreen More wrestling match than football as Manchester United and Everton players indulge in some dark arts from a corner. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images Ironically, Moyes felt Everton’s approach in the closing stages against United worked against his team. He wanted more variety from Everton’s corners but claimed: “It was very difficult to get the message on.” Moyes admitted: “The plan was not to deliver the corners in the fashion we did the other night. They shouldn’t have been delivered as close to the goalkeeper. They should have been delivered into different areas at different times according to what we had worked on. It became a bit of a wrestling match and I didn’t think it showed enough quality or enough thought.” Andy Hunter\n\n4. Glasner wary of United’s Carrick bounce Oliver Glasner credits Michael Carrick for imbuing Manchester United with a “great spirit” and “clear structure” since his appointment last month. No team has picked up more Premier League points in 2026 than United, with Carrick winning five of his six games in charge since replacing Ruben Amorim. Palace have been a thorn in United’s side in recent years, winning three of their five last encounters, but Glasner expects Carrick’s side to be in fine form on Sunday when the Eagles head to Old Trafford.

They gave a very good balance between, it’s a very experienced team, with really, very experienced Premier League players, and very young players with huge talent. “It’s a good mix they have now, but I think the most important thing for them is they are consistently playing with their team and have a clear structure in the way they are playing. This is what I could see against Everton. They have a great spirit right now. It was really impressive seeing Matheus Cunha celebrating winning a duel in their own box. This, I think, is what Michael Carrick brought into this team.” PA Media"

            "content": "Paris Saint-German v Chelsea\n\nThe Club World Cup final victory over Paris Saint-Germain last summer was probably Enzo Maresca’s finest hour as Chelsea manager. He devised a gameplan, pinging balls over Nuno Mendes for Cole Palmer to chase, backed up by Malo Gusto, that tore the European champions apart in the first half. Liam Rosenior may try to exploit the same vulnerability, but this is a Chelsea that look weary, their exertions in the US perhaps having left them fatigued.\n\nPSG’s recent form has been indifferent, as proved by the fact they were forced into the playoff round by a defeat by Sporting and a draw against Newcastle in their final two league-phase games, before limping to a 5-4 aggregate win over Monaco. But then they looked unimpressive until this stage last season as well.\n\nVerdict Narrow PSG win.\n\nGalatasaray v Liverpool\n\nLiverpool have won only one of five previous meetings with Galatasaray, their league-phase defeat in Istanbul in September part of their miserable autumn. But four of those games were more than 20 years ago and Liverpool, while still nowhere near the level of last season, are a more solid team now than they were five months ago, while Florian Wirtz had begun to find his feet before his injury.\n\nGalatasaray showed both sides of their character against Juventus in the playoff round. They were exceptional in the second half of the first leg at home and Victor Osimhen may have a physical edge over the heart of Liverpool’s defence. But in the second leg, even against 10 men, they wobbled badly, losing discipline and self-belief.\n\nVerdict Comfortable Liverpool win.\n\nReal Madrid v Manchester City\n\nThe players change, the managers change, the format changes, and somehow Manchester City always end up playing Real Madrid. The sides had never met in a competitive game until 2012; these two legs will bring their meetings since to 17, including in the league phase in December, when City withstood early pressure to win 2-1 at the Bernabéu.\n\nThis will be the fifth straight season in which City and Madrid have met in the knockouts, with Madrid having prevailed on three occasions. Although City are beginning to click into form, having won seven of their last eight in all competitions, they are not the all-conquering side of old, but Madrid, having sacked Xabi Alonso, are also flawed, a gaggle of great individuals having not quite coalesced into a coherent whole.\n\nVerdict Narrow City win.\n\nAtalanta v Bayern Munich\n\nBayern Munich are perhaps the side most likely to prevent a Premier League success. They have lost just once all season in the Bundesliga and are averaging more than 3.5 goals per game in a system that gets the best out of Harry Kane. He has scored 43 goals in all competitions this season and his habit of dropping deep is complemented by Michael Olise, Serge Gnabry and Luis Díaz running beyond him.\n\nBayern finished the league phase second behind Arsenal, their only dropped points coming at the Emirates Stadium, where they were outclassed and lost 3-1. Atalanta’s comeback to overhaul a 2-0 first-leg deficit against Borussia Dortmund in the playoff round was stirring but they are not the side they were when they won the Europa League in 2024 and lie seventh in Serie A.\n\nVerdict Comfortable Bayern win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Harry Kane has scored 43 goals in all competitions for Bayern Munich this season and is key to their hopes of a first Champions League title since 2020. Photograph: Maryam Majd/Reuters\n\nNewcastle v Barcelona\n\nFor Newcastle fans, any mention of Barcelona will always conjure images of Faustino Asprilla’s hat-trick in their 3-2 win in the Champions League in 1997. They’ve lost all four meetings since, though, including in the league phase in September. That 2-1 defeat at St James’ Park, though, should give Newcastle hope: they were far from outclassed and showed a clear physical edge.\n\nA combination of set plays and pace in behind Barcelona’s remarkably high line could be a path to the quarter-final. That high line places huge stress on Barça’s press; any slip-up and Hansi Flick’s side are wide open, which in the end was what cost them in last season’s semi-final. They are top of La Liga, though, and only Arsenal scored more goals in the league phase.\n\nVerdict Narrow Barcelona win.\n\nAtlético Madrid v Tottenham\n\nTottenham have met Atlético Madrid only once, but it was one of the most famous nights in the history of the club as Bill Nicholson’s side romped to a 5-1 win in the 1963 Cup Winners’ Cup final in Rotterdam, making them the first British club to lift a European trophy. For Spurs this season, the priority has to be avoiding relegation, and it remains to be seen what impact Igor Tudor will have.\n\nUnder Thomas Frank, Europe brought a sense of relief. Only Arsenal let in fewer goals, and five of the seven they did concede came in their only defeat, at PSG. Atlético have had a mixed season and lie a frustrating fourth in La Liga. They lost to Liverpool and Arsenal in the league phase.\n\nVerdict Narrow Atlético win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Xavi Simons celebrates scoring for Tottenham in the Champions League. The tournament has offered much-needed respite to the beleaguered London club. Photograph: John Walton/PA\n\nBodø/Glimt v Sporting\n\nHaving been one of only two non-English sides, along with Juventus, not to have played a Premier League side in the league phase, Sporting’s luck held as they were drawn against by far the least-fancied side in the last 16.\n\nBodø/Glimt didn’t win a game in the league phase before Christmas but then beat Manchester City and Atlético to qualify for the playoff round, where they were highly impressive in beating Inter over two legs, despite having to play a very different style of football to the possession-heavy approach they take domestically. Momentum and their artificial pitch north of the Arctic Circle give them a chance.\n\nVerdict Narrow Sporting win.\n\nBayer Leverkusen v Arsenal\n\nArsenal won every game in the league phase. They scored the most goals and they conceded the fewest. Last season, Liverpool gained no advantage from finishing top, but Arsenal have. It’s not just that they face Leverkusen, sixth in the Bundesliga, in the last 16, it’s that if they win they will face Bodø/Glimt or Sporting in the quarter-final.\n\nThe clubs have met only once, in 2002, when Arsenal drew 1-1 away and won 4-1 at home in the second group stage, and there’s every chance of something similar here. Although Leverkusen did beat Manchester City at the Etihad in the league phase, that was one of only three victories, and in their only other game against Premier League opposition they needed a late equaliser to force a home draw with Newcastle.\n\nVerdict Comfortable Arsenal win."

            "content": "Premier League clubs are unhappy with Uefa’s decision to reveal details of their financial results before some have been published and without warning.\n\nChelsea’s record pre-tax loss of £355m last season formed a key part of Uefa’s European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report, which was presented by its executive director, Andrea Traverso, at the Financial Times’s Business of Football Summit on Thursday, with the losses incurred by Tottenham and Aston Villa also featuring prominently.\n\nThe issue is understood to have been discussed by Premier League representatives at Friday’s Champions League draw in Nyon, where there was agreement that Uefa had failed to keep them informed.\n\nNone of the clubs were briefed about Uefa’s plans, leaving Chelsea in particular frustrated at being given no time to prepare for questions on their results. The club are not planning to publish their 2024-25 accounts until the end of March.\n\nChelsea, while not contesting the £355m loss, which is based on information they provided to Uefa, insist the headline figure does not reflect the economic reality.\n\nClub sources have disclosed that the record loss reflects non-cash accounting adjustments required by Uefa’s financial sustainability regulations, specifically one-off transactions related to player contract and asset write-offs, and that they are profitable on an operational basis.\n\nChelsea were fined £27m by Uefa last summer for breaching its spending restrictions and ordered to submit to a business plan, but are confident of avoiding another sanction. As part of that settlement agreement Chelsea were permitted to continue running at a substantial loss, as long as it remained in line with “the projected deficit submitted in the business plan”."

            "content": "Being teetotal, always asking questions and taking up yoga in his early 30s after a recommendation from Gareth Barry have played their part. But if one thing inspired James Milner to break the Premier League’s appearance mark then it is a trait honed during his formative years in Yorkshire: sheer bloody-mindedness.\n\n“Some things don’t change,” Milner says with a chuckle when asked whether his desire to prove people wrong was as strong as ever after his 40th birthday last month. “There’s people who are always going to doubt you but that’s always something that’s been at my forefront: to prove them wrong.”\n\nMilner credits his father for instilling the fighting spirit that has carried him through a remarkable 24 seasons in English football’s top flight. He started as a 16-year-old with Leeds under the watchful eye of Terry Venables, and has had spells at Newcastle, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Liverpool and now Brighton.\n\n“He knew what I was like and he used to say: ‘You don’t work hard enough, you’re not going to make it,’” he says of his father. “He’d never say it in a horrible way or anything like that. But he’d be like: ‘You got no chance of scoring the goal from there.’ And then [I would] take free-kicks and two shots later it’s in the top corner. He knew how to get the best of me.”\n\nThe same desire provided motivation after it seemed Milner’s career was finished in 2024 when he was unable to walk following knee surgery. He spent nine months on the sidelines before returning at the end of last season.\n\n“I think most people – the surgeon, the physio, people who knew what I had, probably every single person – thought I was finished; at my age being a footballer and what I had,” he says. “So it was probably that same thing that meant I’m still playing now: not to finish your career in a way that wasn’t really in your control. That was the drive really. I wanted to try to prove that I could get back from that because I don’t think many people could.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner salutes the fans after the final whistle in Leeds’ victory over Chelsea in December 2002, a month after his Premier League debut as a 16-year-old. Photograph: Gareth Copley/PA\n\nIt has been particularly satisfying for Milner that, having come off the bench more than 200 times in the Premier League, he started on his 654th appearance to break his former Villa teammate Barry’s record when Brighton overcame Brentford last week. “My body doesn’t agree to sitting still, so that’s why I don’t like being on the bench so much,” he says.\n\nHe relishes his role as the elder statesman of the Brighton squad and reveals that the teenage striker Charalampos Kostoulas has been joining him for yoga sessions. “I probably started maybe eight or nine years ago now, which I think Gareth put me on to actually,” he says. “We’re passing it down, so I’ve passed it on to Babis [Kostoulas] at this moment. He’s only 18, so he’s starting young.”\n\nMilner, whose rippling muscles bulge as he holds court at Brighton’s training ground in Lancing, recognises he has been fortunate that his career coincided with the rapid growth of sports science. He uses strengthening techniques created by the celebrated German athletics coach Frans Bosch to counteract injuries that have included a fractured ankle at Newcastle and 12 hamstring problems, meticulously tracks his sleep patterns and takes magnesium to boost a natural shortfall in his body. Milner believes the decision to never drink alcohol, made during his schooldays in Horsforth, outside Leeds, is another of the secrets to his longevity.\n\n“I’ve never had a problem with people drinking at all – I think it’s healthy,” he says. “Like if that’s the right time to do it and if that’s your thing to get away from football and go have a blast, then I’ve no problems with it all. But it’s just a decision I made that if it would help me, I wouldn’t do it.\n\n“When I first started playing you had maybe one or two physios, maybe a part-time masseur, one fitness coach. Now you’ve got five or six fitness coaches, you’ve got seven or eight in the medical team. So that’s been to my advantage that I’ve managed to learn from that to ask questions early.\n\n“I always ask questions: ‘Why are we doing this?’ Or: ‘Explain it to me so I understand and then I decide if it is the right thing to do. I’m not just going to do it because you say. Give me the information why. Give me the science behind it.’ It was interesting, a few of the messages I had over the weekend were: ‘You were a nightmare to work with,’ or ‘challenging to work with’. But I take that as a compliment that I push them to be better and ask questions and challenge them. The best people always come out and give you the exact reason why you’re doing it.”\n\nThings have changed from his youth, when Milner recalls “teacups flying and walls being punched” at half-time by irate managers. “You don’t see much of that now,” he says. “I just feel fortunate. I played through two eras; one when I was emerging and now another.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner, with then teammate Jordan Henderson, holds the FA Cup after Liverpool’s win in 2022. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nMilner was presented this week with three Guinness world records: one for the appearances, another for most consecutive Premier League seasons (23) and the third for the longest gap between his first and last Premier League goals (22 years and 248 days). The next milestone on the horizon is surpassing Teddy Sheringham’s record as the Premier League’s oldest outfield player at 40 years 272 days, though Milner has never been inspired by chasing records.\n\nHe is yet to open discussions with Brighton about extending his stay beyond this season – a prospect recently welcomed by his 33-year‑old head coach, Fabian Hürzeler – but is keen to stay and he denies fearing what retirement may bring.\n\n“When we have some days off I look forward to that: go and play golf, spend time with the family. So I feel whenever I finish, I’ll probably have a break and a rest because I’ve been so 100% for so long.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner with his three Guinness World Records certificates. Photograph: Paul Hazlewood\n\nHaving worked under Venables, Sir Bobby Robson, Roberto Mancini, Jürgen Klopp and many other of the game’s finest managers, Milner is well placed to judge what makes a good one. He rates his two seasons as a central midfielder at Martin O’Neill’s Villa as his best from an individual perspective, and has especially fond memories of winning City’s and Liverpool’s first league titles for a generation. There are doubts about his prospects of making the transition to the dugout when he hangs up his boots.\n\n“It’s such a hard gig, innit? You see managers getting a new contract and getting sacked in two months. People don’t get the time they deserve now. But the competitive guy in you thinks: ‘Yeah, I wouldn’t mind giving that a go.’\n\n“I’ve got a great array of different managers from different countries and different personalities to lean back on, so in one way I think it’d be a big shame to lose all that knowledge and experience I’ve built up, to not be able to use that.”"

            "content": "A European occasion that appeared ominous for Celtic instead provided evidence that it is never wise to write off Martin O’Neill. His side exited the Europa League in Stuttgart but the scale of spirit and togetherness visible during their 1-0, playoff second-leg victory emphasised that tales of their demise may be overstated.\n\nCeltic’s key attribute during a critical week, which begins at Ibrox on Sunday, is course and distance specialism. The shortcomings within, and patched-up nature of, O’Neill’s squad are blindingly obvious. This is, however, a club that has become accustomed to dominating Scottish football over more than a decade. Much earlier, O’Neill had demonstrated he could emerge successful from title scraps. Contrary to giddy analysis, there is nothing miraculous or remarkable about O’Neill’s work during his second short-term stint of the season. It is, though, immediately striking how a 73-year-old can achieve such buy-in from players. Faith in O’Neill within Celtic is absolute.\n\nThis Celtic season, typified by managerial upheaval and protesting supporters, retains a pulse. Stuttgart felt significant because Celtic, in makeshift form, displayed character. The easier option would have been to limp out of the Europa League. Instead, there was an unwillingness to concede an equaliser that reflects positively on O’Neill and his squad.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill (left) is in his second interim stint of the season at Celtic and has galvanised the players after a rocky period. Photograph: DPA/PA\n\nOn Sunday they face a Rangers team who are under considerable pressure to prove they will not deliver another campaign typified by false dawns. Rangers’ home form is strong but Danny Röhl’s team are yet to remove the sense of a soft underbelly, demonstrated by draws at Hibernian, Motherwell and Livingston. The most recent of those, last Sunday, was a horrendous result; Livingston had not won in 25 league matches. The stakes are huge for Rangers, who should be embarrassed if a net spend of about £30m is not sufficient to prise the title from Celtic – at one point managed by Wilfried Nancy – and a Hearts side assembled for buttons in comparison. Celtic’s seven Premiership losses to date match their combined tally from the previous two seasons.\n\nA Rangers win would place Celtic in tricky territory, five points behind their oldest foes. Celtic’s game in hand will be played in Aberdeen on Wednesday, before a return to Ibrox on Scottish Cup business. Hearts hope to extend their lead at the top to seven points on Saturday when Aberdeen visit Edinburgh. An Old Firm draw would suit Hearts perfectly.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rangers’ Danny Röhl speaks to the media on Friday – his side are four points behind Hearts and two above Celtic. Photograph: Luke Nickerson/Rangers FC/Shutterstock\n\nStuttgart gave O’Neill plenty food for thought. Luke McCowan’s terrific performance in midfield should afford him a start at Ibrox. O’Neill’s public backing of Kasper Schmeichel suggests he will restore the veteran goalkeeper despite almost weekly errors. Schmeichel’s deputy, Viljami Sinisalo, repelled Stuttgart. Auston Trusty’s suspension leaves Celtic weak in central defence. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was not in Celtic’s European squad, was surely signed to play in fixtures such as the derby.\n\nO’Neill is aware of a bigger picture, despite that hardly being his concern given he is due to leave in the summer. “European football is what big clubs in Scotland should be aiming for,” he said. “Not for the coefficient points to be dropping out of sight. It’s ridiculous. This is what it’s all about.”\n\nHis regular reference to the country’s coefficient, which is indeed dipping to a worrying level, is intriguing. There is a theory Celtic’s reluctance to spend heavily on players is linked at least in part to knowledge that their potential lack of access to European revenue in upcoming years could swallow up cash reserves. In a worst-case but feasible situation, Celtic could be staring at Conference League football. This does not, however, explain the horrendous lack of preparation for this season’s Champions League playoff tie. Sensible investment would have been sufficient to topple Kairat Almaty, who instead left Celtic with red faces.\n\nThe shadow boxing has started. McCowan has asserted no team in the league can touch Celtic when at their best. In truth, it would be more of a story had McCowan stipulated Celtic are also-rans. Röhl cast aspersions on Celtic’s approach in Stuttgart; this was amusing, given Rangers finished 32nd out of 36 in the Europa League table.\n\nAll Old Firm jousts are fascinating. This one carries more meaning than most. Events in Germany suggested Celtic are formed of the kind of substance that Rangers must be wary of."

Data from the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS) shows that in 2023, a quarter of car occupants (25%) killed in crashes across Great Britain, where seat belt status was recorded, weren't wearing one.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Alicia Hempsted, car insurance expert at MoneySuperMarket, is urging motorists that, barring exemptions or specific situations, travelling without a seat belt constitutes a legal offence and could land you with a fine reaching £500 under present legislation.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA new survey from MoneySuperMarket discovered that, whilst 7.6 million drivers (18%) acknowledged they've driven without a seat belt, only just over a third (32%) of those have been hit with a fine over the past five years for this particular violation. Meanwhile, 14% (5.9 million) confessed they habitually drive without buckling up.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMotorists are required to wear a seat belt at all times, unless medically exempt or when reversing. Should you be exempt, you must keep your certificate of 'exemption from compulsory seat belt wearing' in your car permanently and notify your insurer accordingly.\n\nAlicia said: \"Seat belts are one of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce injury and save lives on the road, so it's concerning that a significant number of UK drivers admit to not wearing them when behind the wheel. Because insurers use penalty points as a measure of risk, the proposed changes could leave drivers facing more than just a fine. Points on a licence may also push up premiums when it's time to renew.\n\n\"There are a limited number of exceptions to this law, such as when reversing, those who are licensed taxi drivers of a private hire vehicle in specific circumstances, certain delivery drivers, and people who are medically exempt. Should you be medically exempt, you must always keep your certificate in your vehicle, as well as update your insurer of your exemption. For most drivers though, the message is simple: wearing a seat belt isn't just about avoiding fines, it's about saving lives.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Changes are proposed (Image: west via Getty Images)\n\nGovernment's proposed changes to seat belt legislation\n\nIn its consultation proposals, the Government stated: \"It has been mandatory since 1991 for drivers and passengers to wear a seat belt when travelling in any motor vehicle unless medically exempt, or under specified circumstances, such as a driver reversing their vehicle or a taxi driver plying for hire. It is also mandatory for drivers to ensure that children under the age of 14 in their vehicle wear a seat belt or are secured with an appropriate child seat or restraint.\n\n\"The sanction for failing to do so is a fixed penalty notice of £100 or, if the case goes to court, a maximum fine of £500. Failure to wear a seat belt is not currently an endorsable offence; that means the offender does not incur penalty points. This section asks the public's view on whether drivers and passengers failing to wear a seat belt, and drivers who fail to ensure children travelling in the vehicle are suitably restrained, should receive three penalty points on their driving licence.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe document continued: \"We propose that three penalty points should apply to all drivers who fail to wear a seat belt or who fail to ensure that any child in the vehicle wears an appropriate child restraint.\"\n\nView 3 Images It could soon be more than just a fine (Image: Alphotographic via Getty Images)\n\nExisting seat belt rules\n\nPresent regulations stipulate that \"drivers must wear a seat belt if one is fitted in the seat they are using, with only a few exceptions. You're also only allowed one person per seat fitted with a seat belt\".\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFurthermore, \"you must make sure that any children in the vehicle you are driving in are in the correct car seat for their height or weight until they reach 135 centimetres tall or their 12th birthday, whichever is first. And ensure they are wearing a seat belt if they're 12 or 13 years old, or younger and over 135cm tall\".\n\nMethodology\n\nMoneySuperMarket commissioned research through Censuswide involving 1,000 UK motorists aged 17 and over (full licence holders). The study took place between January 20, 2026 and January 23, 2026. DVLA figures show that 42,120,966 individuals presently hold a full UK driving licence.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

According to Niamh McMillan, Superdrug's pharmacy superintendent, ongoing exhaustion could be the body's way of \"screaming\" for attention - and in certain circumstances blood tests might uncover an underlying condition such as nutrient deficiencies or thyroid imbalance.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Feeling a little more tired during winter is normal,\" Niamh explained. \"But when exhaustion becomes constant and affects concentration, mood or daily functioning, it can be a red flag that something isn't quite right internally.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFatigue and hidden deficiencies\n\n\"Low energy levels are commonly linked to deficiencies in nutrients such as iron, vitamin B12 and vitamin D, all of which play a crucial role in energy production, oxygen transport and overall wellbeing,\" said Niamh.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"These deficiencies are particularly common during winter when diets change and sunlight exposure drops.\n\n\"Because symptoms often creep in gradually, people can go months feeling drained without realising there's an underlying cause.

The following day, Tommie-Lee was found lifeless by his friend's mum.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDuring the inquest, the father of Tommie-Lee's friend admitted that he had previously caught the boys inhaling fumes from deodorant cans. This activity, often dubbed 'chroming' on the internet, was described by the boy as inducing a high and was something they did \"for a laugh\".\n\nView 2 Images (Image: Lancs Live/Jude Tolson)\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as your Preferred Source in your Google search settings.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTommie- Lee's unnamed friend, due to legal restrictions, confessed to his parents that he had picked up the trend from an older boy at the local skatepark. The matter was subsequently reported to the elder boy's school and the police.\n\nThe friend's parents told the inquest that they had informed Tommie-Lee's parents about the incident. However, Sherri Ann Gracie and Graham Billington refuted these allegations, insisting they were never made aware of the situation, reports Lancs Live.\n\nFriends of the lads informed police that the pair had been on a video call that evening, during which they were seen inhaling substances on a Snapchat group chat. As per the police statement from one of the boys, Tommie-Lee had inhaled an entire can of Lynx deodorant that morning before opting to take a nap.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTragically, he was discovered unresponsive in a bunk bed at midday and was later pronounced dead at Royal Lancaster Infirmary.\n\nDCI Dylan Hrynkwo, the senior officer on duty at the time of the incident, revealed that upon inspecting the house, officers discovered a can of Lynx in the bed and several others scattered around the room. Concerns about 'chroming' prompted the police to scrutinise social media content and the boys' mobile phones to determine if this had influenced them to inhale the gases.\n\nHowever, after only uncovering videos warning others against participating in the 'craze', DCI Hrynkwo suggested that social media did not incite the boys to get involved. Nonetheless, he noted that \"the internet is almost a living beast\" and is constantly evolving, implying that harmful videos may have been removed previously.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDuring the inquest, family members reminisced about their cherished memories of Tommie-Lee. His father Graham expressed: \"I will never forget him, he was such a lovely boy\".\n\nHis grandmother Tina Burns added: \"He was just a beautiful boy, he was our little whirlwind, there was no stopping him. He was just full of life, full of energy.\"\n\nCoroner Emma Mather confirmed that Tommie-Lee's cause of death was inhalational asphyxiation and cardiac arrest following the inhalation of butane and other 'volatile substances'. She determined his death constituted a 'misadventure', given that Tommie-Lee was considered too young to have grasped the dangers involved.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nShe said: \"Tommy-Lee was a beautiful little boy. He had his whole life ahead of him. Both boys were playing video games and were observed by friends on a snapchat call to be using aerosols. It is likely they were spraying aerosols through a towel and taking a deep breath to experience the effects.\n\n\"The boys had been able to inhale aerosols without interruption. if the parents had been aware I have no doubt they would have stepped in. I find that it is more likely than not the two boys had been introduced to this by an older boy at the park.\n\n\"It is not possible to explain why there was a missed opportunity to inform Sherri Ann and Graham. It is my finding that, had this happened, Tommie-Lee's parents would have been aware of this and would have spoke to him about it.\""

And anyone who has an accident as a result of the issue could even face prosecution.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDiplopia, the medical term for seeing two images of a single object, is not simply a visual nuisance. Under DVLA rules double vision is incompatible with safe driving unless it is fully controlled.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThose who develop the condition are legally required to inform the DVLA which can be done online. Failure to do so can result in a fine of up to £1,000, the invalidation of motor insurance and, in serious cases, prosecution.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMr Nadeem Ali, Consultant Squint and Double Vision Surgeon at The London Squint Clinic, said: \"Many people assume that if they can manage their symptoms, they can continue driving. But from a regulatory perspective, double vision raises an immediate red flag. If you are seeing two images, your depth perception and spatial awareness are compromised, and that has obvious implications at any speed.”\n\nView 3 Images Mr Nadeem Ali, Consultant Squint and Double Vision Surgeon (Image: The London Squint Clinic)\n\nThe DVLA assesses cases individually. In some instances a licence will be revoked temporarily while medical reports are obtained.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIf the diplopia is stable and can be completely controlled - with prism lenses in glasses or by occluding one eye - driving may be permitted. However, uncontrolled double vision will usually mean a suspension.\n\nFor professional drivers the stakes are even higher. Group 2 licence holders, which includes lorry and bus drivers, face stricter visual standards and a diagnosis can mean an end to their career.\n\nApart from notifying the DVLA, motorists must also tell their insurance provider of any medical condition that could affect their ability to drive. Failure to do so may allow an insurer to refuse a claim following a collision.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMr Ali explained: “If someone has an accident and it later emerges they had double vision that wasn’t declared, the financial consequences can be devastating. It could be treated as driving without valid insurance which exposes the individual to personal liability for damages.”\n\nWhile the legal and financial risks are clear, the condition itself can arrive suddenly and without warning. Double vision may develop in later life as the muscles that control eye alignment gradually weaken.\n\nIt can also follow a minor stroke, diabetes-related nerve palsy, thyroid eye disease or head trauma, including injuries sustained in falls or road traffic accidents. Mr Ali said: \"In adults, even a small change in eye muscle balance can tip someone into diplopia.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Patients often describe it as sudden and disorientating. You cannot accurately judge distance and road markings or oncoming vehicles may appear duplicated or blurred.”\n\nView 3 Images The DVLA must be informed if you are diagnosed with double vision (Image: Getty)\n\nThe good news is that treatment is often effective. Some cases resolve themselves while prism glasses can realign images for certain patients and modern double vision surgery can restore binocular single vision in persistent cases.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMr Ali added: \"Restoring single vision through surgery is not just about comfort. For many patients it means regaining their independence and, subject to DVLA approval, their ability to drive legally again.\"\n\nWith Britain’s population ageing and more drivers remaining on the road into later life, specialists say awareness is crucial. Sudden double vision is always a reason to seek urgent medical advice.\n\nFigures estimate more than 800,000 people in the UK visit a eye care specialist every year as a result of some form of double vision.

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The cameras were forced to cut away before medics attended to the fighter.\n\nReplays show that late in the first round, the two boxers clashed heads, with George coming away dazed and shaken. It appears this was the reason for his sudden fall to the canvas.\n\nThe 36-year-old made it back to his feet following medical attention and was taken to a Detroit hospital to be monitored.

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

Ben Youngs, Freddie Steward and Jack van Poortvliet all grew up in East Anglia yet the area has no professional club representation.\n\nSeason ticket renewals for Norwich City are among the highest in England because it is a remote part of the country which has little other professional sport on offer.\n\nThe RFU and Prem Rugby should be banging down the door of Sir James Dyson, the British inventor who grew up in the area but currently pumps his millions into the jersey sponsorship of Bath.\n\nBirmingham, Yorkshire, Liverpool and the south coast are other areas that rugby should be trying to tap into as part of the long-term plan to grow the sport.\n\nScrapping promotion and relegation is a tough pill to swallow, although the gulf between the first and second division has become virtually unbridgeable.\n\nEnglish rugby's overhaul should be used as a springboard for expansion in untapped counties\n\nWorcester Warriors and London Irish are primed to apply for one of the 12 top-flight franchises and return to the PREM, having been expelled over financial difficulties in 2022 and 2023\n\n28 CLUBS HAVE PLAYED IN THE PREMIERSHIP - WHO'S NEXT? Team Seasons Bath 36 (7 titles) Gloucester 36 Leicester Tigers 36 (11 titles) Harlequins 35 (2 titles) Wasps 35 (6 titles) Northampton Saints 31 (2 titles) Saracens 31 (6 titles) Sale Sharks 30 (1 title) London Irish 28 Bristol Bears 25 Newcastle Red Bulls 24 (1 title) Worcester Warriors 16 Exeter Chiefs 13 (2 titles) Orrell 10 Leeds Tykes 8 Nottingham, West Hartlepool 5 Birmingham Moseley, Rosslyn Park 4 Bedford Blues 3 Liverpool St Helens, London Scottish, London Welsh, Richmond, Rotherham Titans, Rugby Lions, Waterloo 2 Coventry 1\n\nThe model is broken and ring-fencing with the option for expansion offers a happy medium. A pathway for ambitious clubs remains (at least in theory), while new investors can be confident they are not throwing money into a black hole.\n\nAfter the RFU council approved the changes yesterday, Exeter Chiefs owner Tony Rowe told Daily Mail Sport that investor confidence immediately spiked.\n\nNow 77, Rowe is speaking to new investors and negotiations can now advance with financiers in America. ‘We’re talking to a couple of investors and one of them wanted to wait to hear what happened this week,’ he said.\n\n‘English rugby is desperate for money but it’s difficult to find investment because of the worry of relegation. Red Bull didn’t just come along and say, “we don’t mind if we get relegated”. They were banking on this decision.\n\n‘I’m certain we’ll see more big names invest in English rugby now. Money dictates where sport goes and if somebody wants to pay handsomely to change the name of Exeter I have no doubt that might happen.\n\n‘We’re in the market for a partner investor. It’s going to cost you somewhere between £50m and £100millon to get a Prem side together with a stadium. I’m sure there are people out there interested in doing it.\n\n‘There are talks about rugby at the new stadium in Birmingham. Yorkshire has more rugby clubs than any other county but none of them perform at the top level so it would be nice to see another club there. Maybe someone in the North West. We want people to come into the Prem and first we want to get back to 12 clubs.’\n\nThe likes of Ollie Chessum, Freddie Steward and Fraser Dingwall have all played in the second division and the competition must not be set up to fail. It is key the chances of promotion remain genuine if teams meet the relevant criteria.\n\nSeason ticket renewals for Norwich City are among the highest in the country because it is a remote part of the country which has little other professional sport on offer\n\nYorkshire has not had a Premiership team since 2011, when Leeds Carnegie went down - a year later, they sold their P shares in the competition to Exeter Chiefs\n\nThe perfect scenario is more big hitters enter the market and rugby’s ecosystem grows. We could see more investment into playing squads, stronger academies and a trickle-down effect on the Champ.\n\n\n\nWe have seen London Irish, Wasps and Worcester fold under the financial pressures of professional sport but, after years of turmoil, there is an opportunity for new shoots to appear off the beaten path."

            "content": "Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall always thought he would play for David Moyes, ever since the Everton manager tried to sign him for West Ham.\n\n‘It felt like I needed to work with him at some point,’ he says. But then close relationships with managers don’t always take you where you think they will.\n\nTwo summers ago, Dewsbury-Hall followed Enzo Maresca from Leicester to Chelsea only to find himself on the fringes. Two Premier League starts in a season was not what he thought Chelsea had paid £30million for.\n\n‘There were times when it felt very dark,’ Dewsbury-Hall admits. ‘If I am not playing, I can feel useless. I am very emotional.’\n\nNow, three-quarters of the way through a debut season at Everton, Dewsbury-Hall can talk about a career revived and some ambitions of winning a first cap for his country that have not been discouraged by England manager Thomas Tuchel.\n\n‘I've spoken to him once or twice,’ he tells Daily Mail Sport. ‘He was at Old Trafford when I scored. He was at Fulham when I scored. So I wouldn't mind him coming to more games! He's been complimentary and told me to stick at it. I feel like I am ready now. I feel like I am moving forwards again.’\n\nIn his debut season at Everton, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall can talk about a career revived and some ambitions of winning a first cap for his country\n\n'I feel like I am ready (to play for England) now. I feel like I am moving forwards again.’\n\nDuring a season of change – most of it positive – at Everton, Dewsbury-Hall stands out. Jack Grealish was the big-name signing but injury has ended his season. Young Tyler Dibling has struggled. Dewsbury-Hall, now 27, has assumed the role of senior player quite naturally.\n\n‘When I broke through at Leicester I just went on to the pitch trying to do the right thing,’ he says. ‘Now I've got a different mentality. I want to stand out.\n\n‘The manager and myself have history. He's known me for a while. He was interested when he was at West Ham. So it felt like the right time now to come to him. I just genuinely thought it would click here and it has. I know if I had the opportunity at Chelsea, it would have been the same.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall was a late developer and a thinker. It’s not always a great combination. As a teenager he interpreted his slow physical progress as a weakness. But now that he’s through all that, a clear intellect radiates and it’s to his benefit.\n\nFew footballers are as engaging or as curious. Two years into a degree in sports management, he has concerns about the direction football is taking on and off the field. He is also obsessed with West End musicals – 'my guilty pleasure' – and is convinced he will stand on a different kind of stage one day. Meanwhile he is an accomplished snooker and pool player.\n\n‘I do like to learn,’ the Nottingham-born midfielder says in his broad East Midlands accent. ‘I don't just like sitting on my backside doing nothing.’\n\nIn three weeks, fatherhood beckons. A little girl. That learning process is about to be accelerated and maybe it’s fitting, then, that Everton chose him to visit Much Woolton Primary School, 10 miles from Hill Dickinson Stadium, to read to a class of 25 children ahead of World Book Day next week.\n\nThe kids are blindfolded and have to guess the identity of their ‘secret reader’ as Dewsbury-Hall makes his way slowly through a page of a Harry Potter book he has chosen. When his identity is revealed, there is classroom bedlam. An enthusiastic signing session follows, as Dewsbury-Hall makes his way from table to table talking about books, reading and a fair bit of football.\n\nThe kids at Much Woolton Primary School are blindfolded and have to guess the identity of their ‘secret reader’ as Dewsbury-Hall reads a page of a Harry Potter book he has chosen\n\nWhen his identity is revealed, there is classroom bedlam. Dewsbury-Hall makes his way from table to table talking about books, reading and a fair bit of football\n\n‘You know, I was really nervous before going in there,’ he smiles as he sits down to talk in the headteacher’s office. ‘I haven't read out loud for a while. Football's not easy but I'm used to that, aren’t I? I thought, \"God, if I start making mistakes here, I'll make myself look like a right sausage\". But no, it was good in the end.’\n\nChildren can be blunt. At one stage, Dewsbury-Hall is asked by an eight-year-old why Everton can’t win at home. It’s a theme we return to. Ahead of today’s visit to Newcastle, Everton sit ninth despite having won only twice at their new Hill Dickinson Stadium in the Premier League since the start of November, and none of the last six.\n\n‘I do think there's maybe a little mental block there at the moment,’ he admits. ‘That does happen in football. I truly believe it. Something will happen in a game and it will just knock us for six or it will change the way we play. Whereas away, we know what we're doing.\n\n‘We do talk about it. I'm not gonna lie to you. We're humans. We ask ourselves why it goes wrong. We have tried training on the pitch and stuff and will probably do it again.’\n\nReflection is common in football and Dewsbury-Hall is prone to it. His home library comprises largely of autobiographies and motivational business books but not much of it prepared him for what happened at Chelsea.\n\nFollowing Maresca to Stamford Bridge in 2024 felt like the next step. Instead, Dewsbury-Hall found himself buried beneath a mountain of midfield bodies. He was the only player to feature in all 15 games of the club’s Conference League triumph and had some minutes at the Club World Cup. But every weekend brought Premier League disappointment.\n\n‘I had a lot of options but signed for Chelsea genuinely thinking I was gonna play,’ he says. ‘I believed I could. I know I could. And then football is football. Things happen.\n\n‘Obviously the competition was high. Rival midfielders were £100m players (Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez). It was a strange dynamic at times. It was quite fortunate for the club that the manager could field two very strong teams.\n\nHe was the only player to feature in all 15 games of the club’s Conference League triumph and had some minutes at the Club World Cup\n\nHis home library comprises largely of autobiographies and motivational business books but not much of it prepared him for being overlooked by Enzo Maresca at Chelsea\n\n‘But it was weird - it almost felt like no matter how well I played in midweek, I would not play at the weekend and that was the only thing that didn't sit well with me. In football it's important, if you're playing well, that you get the chance to play. I'm a very emotional guy. If I'm not playing, I feel useless, basically. I feel like I haven't got a purpose because that's my life.\n\n‘So yeah, there were dark times where I thought, “I don't care about money or anything else. I just wanna play football, so why aren’t I?”.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall’s relationship with Maresca meant there were regular conversations but not reassurances. ‘He was as honest as maybe he could be,’ the player adds. ‘He said some things that I wanted to hear and maybe some things that I didn't want to hear. He told me I had to be patient and said I wasn’t as big a fish in a pond as I was at Leicester.\n\n‘I am not gonna cry over it. I know if I did play more I would have been able to show people what I could do. In my head, that's a fact. But the strategy worked for the club, didn’t it? They won trophies and they got in the top four.\n\n‘I could easily have stayed at Chelsea for much longer but I wanted to go to a club with a project and be a main player. Everton felt perfect. Seamus Coleman has been here 17 years and tells me to imagine what winning a trophy would be like.\n\n‘If you can do that here, you'll go down in history books. This fanbase deserves good times and it gave me that extra motivation to come. Now I'm in such a better place. People look at me in a different light I hope.’\n\nRelationships with coaches and managers are always key to a player’s development. Dewsbury-Hall has had his bumps in the road and sometimes they have been impossible to see coming.\n\nAt Leicester, the club he joined aged eight, Brendan Rodgers gave him his senior debut at the age of 21 but he soon learned that managers have egos too.\n\nAt Leicester, the club he joined aged eight, Brendan Rodgers (right) gave him his senior debut at the age of 21 but he soon learned that managers have egos too\n\nScoring the winning goal at Old Trafford in November as David Moyes' side pulled off a famous win with 10 men\n\n‘He organised a pool tournament and everyone had to join in,’ recalls Dewsbury-Hall, a friend of four-time world snooker champion Mark Selby, the 'Jester from Leicester'. ‘I was playing for a pub team when I was 10 years old. I mean, I can play.\n\n‘I was young at the time – wasn’t a first-team player – but was drawn to play him (Rodgers) in the first round. I said to the lads: “Do I try my hardest?” Because he was having himself. He was going, “I'm really good at pool” and all the lads thought he fancied himself to win the whole thing.\n\n‘Quite a few people were watching and I beat him 3-0 and you could tell he was raging. I've just gone, “Yeah, sorry gaffer” and a week later got sent out on loan to Blackpool. So yeah, I mean, that was a fun week of my life.’\n\nDewsbury-Hall’s talents as a snooker player are not in doubt. As an actor, there is not yet any proof but he does yearn to find out. His love of the West End runs deep. He has watched endless shows in London and on New York's Broadway, and has contacts and friends in the business. A few years ago he was due to have a brief role through a BBC project in The Lion King but an injury got in the way.\n\nHe has tried and failed to encourage interest in various team-mates. ‘They just look at me like I am alien,’ he says. 'But one day I genuinely believe I'll do something in the West End.\n\n‘I resonate with what they do every night, giving their best to a completely new set of eyes. That's hard to do, so I respect them so much.’\n\nIn terms of the football, Dewsbury-Hall looks at where the game is going and, along with many others inside and outside of dressing rooms, has concerns about the influence of money, endless VAR checks, 100-minute matches and social media.\n\nAsked if the game is losing a bit of its innocence, he says: ‘Yeah, a little bit. And look, I'm old school. I'm an old head. That's why I hang around with people like Seamus.\n\nDewsbury-Hall looks at where football is going and has concerns about the influence of money, endless VAR checks, 100-minute matches and social media\n\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel was at Craven Cottage earlier this month to see Dewsbury-Hall score in the win over Fulham\n\n‘It's going away from that sort of old-school football isn’t it? It’s the way the world's going. Football’s more business now than it was. It will only increase. I just don't want it to lose its identity and lose why we fell in love with the game. I grew up watching Match of the Day and all I cared about was seeing people score goals. I don't want kids in 10 years watching it and going: “What is this?”\n\n‘It should be about the love. But look at the last week. The north London derby is taking 15 minutes to get restarted. Lloyd Kelly gets sent off for Juventus in the Champions League for the most ridiculous thing in the world. Rules are rules in football but sometimes you just need to smell a situation.\n\n‘The players, we're humans just like you. We grew up watching the sport. It's obviously just because we're inside it now, it's a bit more close to home. But we see the same things you see. We have the same concerns.’\n\nFor now, Dewsbury-Hall is probably too busy to save football. But Everton have a fine player and the rest of us have a genuine thinker in our midst. He is in Tuchel’s thoughts for a reason."

            "content": "Why Aston Villa can feel a Champions League place slipping through their fingers AGAIN: The three key players they look half a team without and where Unai Emery is going wrong after Wolves defeat: TOM COLLOMOSSE\n\nWhen Rodrigo Gomes sealed Wolves' victory with a handful of seconds remaining, Unai Emery had seen enough.\n\nThe Aston Villa boss marched straight down the tunnel and when Rob Edwards approached the away dugout at full-time to shake hands, Emery was nowhere to be seen. Soon after full-time his captain, Ezri Konsa, appeared to be restrained by a Villa staff member. There were suggestions Konsa had exchanged cross words with some away supporters.\n\n'In September I was worried about being in the relegation zone,' said Emery, referring to Villa's poor start. 'Then maybe a month ago I was dreaming of fighting with Manchester City and Arsenal for the title.\n\n'We are having a great season and I want to tell our fans now that we need them. We are grateful for them for being with us but at Villa Park we need their help. We need to be together – players, coaches, fans, everyone.\n\n'Our points total is similar to clubs who have finished in the top five before. We are competing against great teams and for them it is necessary to finish in the Champions League. We need to keep our position.'\n\nJoao Gomes' opener and Rodrigo's clincher means Wolves eclipse Derby's record low points total from 2007-08 and they deserved their win. 'I have not been especially focused on [the total] but it is important for the club and the fans,' acknowledged Edwards.\n\nAston Villa will have fears over their Champions League spot again after losing 2-0 at Wolves\n\nUnai Emery was left with his head in his hands as his third-place side stumbled at Molineux\n\nThe lasting image of the night, however, was Emery's touchline meltdown. Villa fans hope their toiling team do not follow suit as they fear a Champions League place will slip from their grasp for the second season in a row. Their next two fixtures are against fellow contenders Chelsea and Manchester United.\n\nAsked about the pressure on Villa, Morgan Rogers said: 'It does weigh on us but it shouldn't. We deserve to be here and we should not forget that. There is nothing to worry about.'\n\nEmery's early exit was no surprise. From the moment he gave Jadon Sancho an earful midway through the first half, the Spaniard looked ready to boil over. 'Only seven?!' he seemed to scream at the fourth official after the stoppage time board was raised, with his side chasing an equaliser. Earlier, Emery appeared to ignore Emi Buendia and Lucas Digne when they were substituted, his frustration growing when play was delayed due to an issue with referee Craig Pawson's earpiece.\n\nEmery is one of the finest managers in Villa's history but this was not his finest hour. From the moment the team sheet landed, his night started going wrong. Ollie Watkins and Lucas Digne ahead of the in-form Tammy Abraham and the adventurous Ian Maatsen. Really?\n\nThen there was his demeanour throughout the game. Emery is always full of nervous energy on the touchline and usually it is a positive force. Here, though, it could not possibly have been.\n\nVilla are still third in the table, six points ahead of Liverpool in sixth, and are favourites for the Europa League.\n\nVilla needed Emery to be calm. Instead he acted like a man who was watching everything go up in smoke, though he had cooled down by the time he faced the media.\n\nIn this form, Villa will struggle to succeed at home or in Europe. When Joao Gomes gave Wolves the lead just after the hour mark, only Ezri Konsa and Digne tried to encourage their team-mates. Konsa and Amadou Onana berated Buendia for dragging his heels as the Argentine walked to the bench after being substituted.\n\nWolves know they are down but there are still certain matches that can bring some light in the darkness. One is next week's FA Cup fifth-round tie against Liverpool. The other is the chance to knock over one of their local rivals.\n\nThe absence of key players is starting to take its toll on Villa. Shorn of Boubacar Kamara, as well as John McGinn and Youri Tielemans, they look half the team.\n\nJoao Gomes (above) struck midway through the second half to put Wolves in the ascendancy, before Rodrigo Gomes grabbed the hosts' second goal with virtually the last kick of the game\n\nVilla's dismal defeat marked just the second time Wolves have won in the league this season\n\nThe early signs were not promising. Buendia's clumsy challenge on Jean-Ricner Bellegarde gave Wolves a free-kick that Mateus Mane sent just wide from 22 yards. Many expected Abraham to be preferred to Watkins here and in the sixth minute Watkins wasted a great chance to repay that faith.\n\nSent clear by Morgan Rogers, Watkins hesitated just long enough for Yerson Mosquera to steal the ball before the forward could even shoot. Moments later, Pau Torres wasted a free header from Douglas Luiz's corner. Luiz then volleyed straight at Jose Sa and at the other end, Mateus Mane put a free-kick just wide and Toti Gomes miscued a volley.\n\n\n\nThe pattern did not change in the second half until, moments after Emery had made a double change, Jackson Tchatchoua crossed from the right, Adam Armstrong laid the ball off and Gomes crashed it in off the bar from 15 yards. Maatsen's arrival made a difference and his rising shot forced Sa into another sharp stop and Mosquera cleared off the line from Abraham before Rodrigo sealed it in front of the South Bank."

'We have earned the right to be in a strong position (with) what we've done in the group stage, and that's it.\n\n‘And now we need to start to analyse them and find ways to be better than them (Bayer Leverkusen), to try to go through the tie.’\n\n\n\nAsked if the route ahead gives him excitement, Arteta added: ‘Yeah, we are really excited. Obviously, being in the forefront and the way the team is consistently performing gives you a lot of hope and positive thoughts about what is coming.'"

            "content": "Igor Tudor has shelved plans to impose his full-throttle brand of football at Tottenham after realising his players are not in good enough physical shape.\n\nTudor has forged a reputation for an intense, man-to-man, high-pressing tactical style during his 13-year coaching career.\n\nIt was part of his appeal for Spurs where fans demand adventure and ambition but just a fortnight and one game into his tenure, he admits this will not be possible with the tired and depleted squad he has inherited.\n\n'Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,' said Tudor. 'They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and the physical condition of the team has dropped down. So, we need to use this period where we don't play the games to put some petrol in the engine, so the engine starts to work better.\n\n'They are fatigued and to press high you need to be fit. But all of them. If someone is not in the right shape, there is a problem because someone is coming [pressing] late. And the second thing, is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back so if you run up and don't run back it's a problem.\n\n'For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it's a big question what we can do and what we cannot.'\n\nIgor Tudor has revealed that he was shocked by his players' fitness at this point in the season\n\nTudor has surprised some Spurs players with some gruelling running sessions in training overseen by the fitness coach he brought with him Riccardo Ragnacci.\n\n'That's the only way, running,' said the Spurs interim boss. 'The pitch is a hundred yards, it's long. You need to run. There are habits. Maybe you have habits to work a bit less. Players never like runs without the ball so we put in some runs without the ball.\n\n'There is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn't like. And the best thing is that they understand this.'\n\nTudor's initial assessment is not dissimilar to predecessors Ange Postecoglou and Thomas Frank, who both concluded that the squad was neither strong nor robust enough to cope when coupled with the expectation to play adventurous, exciting football and attack four competitions.\n\nBut the urgency of these circumstances, four points above the relegation zone without a win in nine Premier League games, together with the Croatian's imposing stature and taciturn delivery gave his message the ring of a chilling wake-up call for his players.\n\n'There is some pressure here in this club,' said Tudor. 'Some players are still young. They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to solve the problems.\n\n'If you have too many of these players because of injuries who are playing together it does create some problems, but it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man.\n\n'To grow fast and say, 'Come on, I'm the guy, give me the ball, I will score' instead of just, 'What can I do, I'm just here you know'. This is the challenge for each of them. Why not say, 'Come on, I will be the guy, give me the ball, I will not cry, I will take the ball, I will defend my box'.\n\n'It's always how you see the situation. You can always see it both ways. Or 'I'm not, I'm just here and we had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play'. How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy, positive there is opportunity.'\n\nWhen asked ahead of Sunday's trip to Fulham if he thought there were enough soldiers for the fight ahead, Tudor said that he hoped and believed there were and promised not to read too far into performances in his first game, a 4-1 defeat against Premier League leaders Arsenal.\n\n'If you play against the best team in the world, at this moment, for us, I need to be honest, it's not a realistic game to show we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,' he said. 'That's the truth. For long periods in the game we had problems, in defence especially. It's not easy against them. Let's see in the next games.'"

And no one looks at the circumstances, which are that the 450 is very well spent… very, very, VERY well spent, one more time: very well spent.\n\n'They are great football players which will be a big, big, big success for this club. Some already now and some in the future. The reality of this season is we sold for £300m, some starters like Trent (Alexander-Arnold) sold for only £10m.\n\n'We had to recoup the money with players. From that spend, then £250m of it (has not been used)… Alex has not been the Alex of Newcastle, maybe 20 minutes at Tottenham, I don't criticise him because we signed him for six years not six months.\n\nArne Slot has insisted Liverpool were right to splash out £450million in the summer because of the players they sold\n\n'Giorgi (Mamardashvili), we needed him because Caoimh (Kelleher) left but we hardly played with two goalkeepers. Jeremie (Frimpong) has been injured, Giovanni (Leoni) out for the season.\n\n'Tomorrow, I miss out on Florian (Wirtz, who is injured).'\n\nMeanwhile, Slot has also urged for patience with 17-year-old winger Rio Ngumoha, who has been subject to much clamour from fans and media this week after his promising cameo off the bench at Nottingham Forest last week.\n\nIt comes at the same time fellow wingers, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo, have been out of form in front of goal.\n\nSlot said: 'Let's be clear, he is a special player that will have more playing time and already has more playing time recently.\n\n'But for a player that is playing for the Under 19 team of England, if everyone thinks he is so good, then he should be in (in a higher international team).'\n\n\n\nThe Reds will be without Wirtz for the visit of West Ham but Frimpong is back in the squad after missing the last month with a groin problem."

            "content": "How Harry Maguire turned his Man United career around after Greece scandal, being booed by his OWN fans and losing the captaincy - and why the club want him to sign a new deal, writes CHRIS WHEELER\n\nTwo significant dates are marked in the calendar for Harry Maguire next week.\n\nOn Thursday, a celebration for the Manchester United and England defender’s 33rd birthday. Twenty-four hours earlier, a retrial over allegations he assaulted a police officer and of attempted bribery is scheduled to take place on the Greek island of Syros.\n\nSafe to say, he will only be turning up at one of them.\n\nIn the unlikely event that the shambolic Greek legal process functions on this occasion after no fewer than four previous postponements, Maguire isn’t even required to appear in person. He will instead be doing what he does best, anchoring United’s defence against Newcastle in the Premier League at St James’ Park.\n\nThe good times and the bad times have never been far apart during a rollercoaster career at Old Trafford that could feasibly come to an end in June, although there is growing optimism that contract talks will have a positive outcome before then.\n\nAside from the arrest in Mykonos on a family holiday in 2020, Maguire has been booed by his own fans playing for club and country, and been the target of a bomb threat. He has been dropped from the United team, stripped of the captaincy, and would have been sold in 2023 had he not rejected a £30million move to West Ham.\n\nHarry Maguire has fought his way back into a key role for Manchester United\n\nThe good times and the bad times have never been far apart during a rollercoaster career at Old Trafford that could feasibly come to an end in June\n\nThroughout it all, Maguire has kept his dignity and remained loyal to United when it didn’t always feel like the club were being loyal to him. Those who have worked with him describe the ultimate team player who puts his body on the line and faces adversity while worrying more about those around him.\n\nThere he was again at Everton on Monday, leading the defensive effort in the face of a late onslaught to earn a 1-0 win that put United back into the top four.\n\nRestoring Maguire to central defence in a 4-2-3-1 formation has been one of the key changes under Michael Carrick.\n\nAfter missing the final two months of Ruben Amorim’s tumultuous reign through injury, he returned on the bench for two games under Darren Fletcher, and has started all six of Carrick’s matches in charge.\n\nNo wonder United’s new head coach expressed hope on Friday that Maguire will stay beyond this summer, when his contract expires. United are known to be concerned about losing him at the same time as another experienced player in Casemiro.\n\n‘Harry's had a great career so far, and hopefully there's a lot more to come,’ said Carrick, who was first-team coach under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when Maguire arrived at United from Leicester in a £80m deal in 2019.\n\n‘He’s an impressive character. He has been here on the journey and the experiences that he's had, and with England as well, shows exactly what he is. I think we all know the player he is and what he's capable of doing.’\n\nWith all Maguire’s experience, is he in some of the best form of his career?\n\n‘There's a case,’ nodded Carrick. ‘I think as your career goes, when you're a young player everything's fresh and new, and you're fearless and there's not many scars there.\n\n‘You get to your peak years and you feel good, but obviously you've had a few ups and downs along the way. The experience that you've gained then makes you a better player; that sweet spot of being able to do it physically still, but using the experiences to know what's coming.\n\n‘Experience is massive, it's hard to put a price on how valuable that can be. Harry's gained an awful lot of it in different ways through this club.’\n\nIncluding interim managers and caretaker coaches, Maguire has played under seven different bosses at United. Some have valued him highly, others less so. Most of them had to rely on him at some point.\n\nLikewise the fans, although for the most part he has always had the backing of hardcore United supporters who appreciate his endeavour and a knack for late goals. His winners against Liverpool and Lyon were the stand-out moments under Amorim.\n\nMaybe not the Australian day-trippers who booed him at the Melbourne Cricket Ground when United played Crystal Palace – their opponents at Old Trafford on Sunday – on tour in 2022, and again in Perth a few days later.\n\nOr the idiot who had threatened to bomb Maguire’s home in March of that year, leading to the player moving his partner Fern and their two young daughters to a safe house while police carried out a sweep of the property and United brought in extra protection.\n\nThe so-called United boo-boys never bothered Maguire, but that wasn’t the case with his England critics.\n\nTargeted by Three Lions fans when England played Ivory Coast and Germany in 2022, he was hammered so relentlessly by Scotland supporters as he scored an own-goal at Hampden Park the following year that his mother Zoe took to social media to hit back at the ‘disgraceful’ behaviour. ‘That was a bad one for him,’ says an insider, referring to the lows of the 2022-23 season.\n\nThe so-called United boo-boys never bothered Maguire, but that wasn’t the case with his England critics\n\nNew United manager Erik ten Hag preferred Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane in central defence. The captain and mainstay under Solskjaer, Maguire only started eight Premier League games.\n\nThere was the awkwardness of coming off the bench in the Carabao Cup final against Newcastle at Wembley to then lift the trophy with Bruno Fernandes.\n\nMaguire had to publicly deny rumours of a leadership challenge from Cristiano Ronaldo before the Portugal star was pushed out of Old Trafford, but insiders say that he saw Ten Hag’s decision to hand the armband to Fernandes coming long before he was stripped of the captaincy that summer.\n\nNews broke just before a pre-season tour in which Maguire had the added indignity of being berated by goalkeeper Andre Onana on the pitch against Borussia Dortmund in Las Vegas and again booed by fans before a pre-season game against Athletic Bilbao in Dublin.\n\n‘He was very consistent in terms of his emotions,’ says one source. ‘When the younger players look at him, they must think “he’s been through so much, what have we got to complain about?”.’\n\nAll the while, the shadow of his trial in Greece continued to hang over the player and his family after he was arrested in August 2020 following a brawl. Maguire, who claimed to be defending his sister Daisy during the altercation in a bar, was handed a 21-month suspended sentence. However, the conviction was automatically quashed on appeal under Greek law and four retrials have been postponed.\n\nThe Maguire camp want to clear his name, and their legal team will be ready for court again on Wednesday, but no-one expects it to go ahead. There are doubts it will ever take place at all before the statute of limitations runs out in August 2028.\n\nMaguire is said to be very close to his family. His parents Zoe and Alan travel the world watching him. His brothers Laurence and Joe are both footballers, and Daisy works in the sports and entertainment industry.\n\nMaguire has played under seven different bosses at United. Some have valued him highly, others less so. Most of them had to rely on him at some point\n\n‘He was very consistent in terms of his emotions,’ says a source. ‘When younger players look at him, they must think “he’s been through so much, what have we got to complain about?”.’\n\nThat's one reason why Sheffield-born Maguire is said to be keen to stay in the North West and sign a new deal with United. The signs are promising.\n\nHe has been able to talk to foreign clubs since the beginning of the year, but turned down AC Milan and Brendan Rodgers’ new Saudi club Al Qadsiah in January.\n\nUnited are committed to driving down the wage bill and want to reduce his £180,000-a-week salary. But at least they are open to negotiation, which was not necessarily the case with Casemiro.\n\nAt this stage of his career, Maguire wants some security in terms of length of contract as he prepares to turn 33. ‘It’s an amazing club to play for and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could,’ he said last year.\n\nForm and fitness will be factors in United’s decision, and in that sense Maguire has a strong case.\n\nHe has outlasted his central defensive partners Varane, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans at Old Trafford. Martinez is out again after only recently returning from a long-term injury, and Matthijs De Ligt has not been available since the end of November. Youngsters Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven have had their teething troubles.\n\nThomas Tuchel has also taken note and says Maguire is in his thoughts for the World Cup. The player is desperate to go to North America after missing out on Euro 2024 through injury.\n\nHe has yet to play under Tuchel and won the last of his 64 caps in a Nations League win over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in 2024.\n\nHe has yet to play under Thomas Tuchel and won the last of his 64 caps in a Nations League win over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in 2024\n\nMaguire is still holding out hope of playing in a third World Cup for England\n\nSteve Bruce, who knows a thing or two about playing centre back at United and captaining the club, believes Maguire is worthy of a new contract and a World Cup spot.\n\n‘I believe Harry has been made the whipping boy for what was going on around him for too long,’ Bruce told Daily Mail Sport. ‘I don't think he's ever let Man United down. In fact, he's never let England down either.\n\n\n\n‘I wouldn't be surprised if he went to the World Cup and gets offered a new deal. Why wouldn't you? I think centre-halves get better with age. Over the last five or six weeks, he's given a reminder of just what he's about – if he ever needed to.’"

            "content": "England have spent this entire Twenty20 World Cup talking about playing the perfect game, yet remain firmly in the hunt to become the first country to win the tournament three times because they have learned to deal with their imperfections.\n\nThis astonishing late heist against New Zealand kept up their 100 per cent record in the Super Eight stage, meaning Harry Brook's team will, barring some extraordinary results this weekend, be heading for the second semi-final in Mumbai on ­Thursday — where the prospect of a frenzied atmosphere against co-hosts India or a replay of their group-stage meeting with West Indies, their only defeat here, awaits.\n\nMore top-order failure meant that for much of a chase of 160, it looked like they would be destined for Kolkata instead, until a seventh-wicket union between Will Jacks and the recalled Rehan Ahmed worth 44 off just 16 deliveries catapulted them to victory.\n\nIt speaks of the dysfunctional aspects of this team that Jacks, their No7 batsman and sixth bowler, has won four man-of-the-match awards in 20 days. On the balance of probabilities, their luck must run out eventually.\n\n'Yeah, you're right, because ideally I would do nothing, and I'm kind of at some stage the extra bowler and the extra batter. If I didn't bowl and didn't bat, we'd have had that perfect game that we keep speaking about,' Jacks said, following two for 23 with an unbeaten 32.\n\n'We've won six out of seven games and qualified for a semi-­final. We obviously want to play well but we're not gutted we ­haven't been perfect. What we've done well is in the key moments, we've kept a calm and clear head and managed to get those rewards.'\n\nWill Jacks starred with both bat and ball as England beat New Zealand at the T20 World Cup\n\nEngland required 42 off 17 when Ahmed, preferred to Jamie Overton because the match was contested on a used pitch, got off the mark by launching a 103-yard six off spinner Glenn Phillips, who had been reintroduced to the attack for his ability to dart the ball in from around the wicket, cramping his opponents for room.\n\nIt was almost fantasy cricket: as he left the dugout at 117 for six, all-rounder Ahmed received a walkie-talkie message from coach Brendon McCullum to bat like India great Virender Sehwag.\n\nTwo balls later, Jacks sent a skyscraper of a hit over the midwicket boundary to truly seize the momentum and with New Zealand reeling, he powerfully pierced the field for back-to-back fours.\n\nWhen Ahmed danced down the track to hit a second six from the final ball of the penultimate over, sent down by the usually parsimonious Mitchell Santner, they were on the verge of a victory set to an all too familiar template: Nepal, Scotland and Italy discomforting them until late in proceedings in the group stage.\n\nHowever, after New Zealand followed the way of Sri Lanka and Pakistan, captain Santner said of England: 'If you can get yourselves out of a tricky position to end up winning it does a lot for the team, and a lot for the confidence.\n\n'There's no better team at finding a way to win from anywhere. There's different guys stepping up at different times, which is what you want. I wouldn't want to face them, if we're in the semi-finals.'\n\nThe Kiwis face a nervous wait as defeat has presented the outside possibility of Pakistan pipping them for the last four. To do so, Pakistan must defeat Sri Lanka by a minimum of 64 runs or chase down their target in 13.1 overs in Pallekele today.\n\nIn England's favour is an extraordinary belief that they can win from anywhere, and an enviable team spirit. 'This is the era of Harry Brook as white-ball captain,' said Jacks, as if to emphasise the captain's popularity within a youthful squad.\n\nRehan Ahmed put on a more-than-useful partnership wirth Jacks to steer his side to their sixth win from seven games\n\nBut members of the old guard are an issue: the opening partnership of Jos Buttler and Phil Salt averages just 12 in the tournament, and Buttler has just 62 from seven visits to the crease.\n\nEngland have been effective at the start of bowling innings, taking 18 powerplay wickets in the tournament, before this fruitless return against Tim Seifert and Finn Allen.\n\nJofra Archer's form bodes well whichever opponents await. Here, he started with a maiden featuring a successful Seifert review for caught behind, but did not bowl out, as Brook opted to send down a record 16 overs of spin.\n\nThings will get tougher but despite being outhit by opponents, England's engine room has fired.\n\nIn addition to Jacks, who has figures in the Sri Lankan leg of 10-0-72-5, Sam Curran followed closing out the last-ball thriller versus Nepal with handy runs, and combined in a 42-run stand with Tom Banton that kept the prospect of another dramatic England win alive."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe Women's National Basketball Players' Association submitted a new counterproposal to the WNBA on Friday evening with some concessions on revenue share and housing, a source familiar with the collective bargaining negotiations told ESPN.\n\nIn the new CBA proposal, the players union is asking for players to receive 26% of gross revenue (defined as revenue before deducting expenses) over the lifetime of the agreement, with the salary cap in Year 1 of the deal (about $9.5 million) unchanged from its previous offer.\n\nThe revenue share split is down from 27.5% of gross revenue as proposed in the WNBPA's Feb. 17 proposal, a change that a source said amounts to nearly $100 million in reductions on revenue share.\n\nThe new proposal also contained tweaks to the union's housing offerings: Previously, the players asked that teams continue to provide housing to players in the first several years of the new deal, but that in later years, teams will no longer be obligated to provide it for players making at least 80% of the maximum salary, on multiyear deals and receiving full salary protection.\n\nIn the new proposal, the union struck the multi-year component and lowered the salary threshold to 75% for which players would no longer be obligated to receive team-provided housing.\n\nThe two sides are still going back and forth on the years of service limit for developmental players - a new feature of this CBA with each team now expected to have two developmental player spots. The union is now proposing a year of service limit of six after originally asking for no experience limit for those players, a source said, while the league's latest proposal suggested four or five years of service based on minutes played.\n\nThe WNBPA's counterproposal comes one week after the league submitted one of their own. That Feb. 20 league proposal guaranteed housing for all players in 2026 before being phased out in subsequent years of the deal. Players on their applicable minimum salary and those with zero years of service would be provided a one-bedroom apartment in 2027 and 2028 only, while developmental players would be provided studio apartments for the entirety of the deal.\n\nBut the two sides are still far apart on the issue of revenue sharing, including in proposing different revenue sharing systems: The WNBA has held firm in its proposals, with players being offered on average over 70% of net revenue (revenue after deducting expenses), what would amount to less than 15% of gross revenue. The 2026 salary cap would come in at $5.65 million salary cap (up from $1.5 million in 2025) that in subsequent years will grow in line with revenue growth. The league's proposal features maximum salaries, including revenue sharing payouts, amounting to nearly $1.3 million in 2026 and projecting to approach $2 million in 2031. The supermax in 2025 came in at $249,000. The average player salary, including revenue sharing, would be projected to reach $540,000 in 2026 and $780,000 by 2031, up from $120,000 in 2025.\n\nThe WNBA publicly struck down the WNBPA's previous proposal as \"unrealistic\" and \"caus[ing] hundreds of millions of dollars of losses for our teams.\" A source familiar with the negotiations told ESPN the league projected that Feb. 17 plan would result in losses of $460 million over the lifetime of the agreement, though the union has maintained its revenue sharing model would still put the league in a \"profitable position,\" a separate source said.\\\n\nEarlier this week, the league gave the WNBPA and its teams a target date of March 10 to complete a term sheet, or else the schedule for the 2026 season may be impacted."

            "content": "The Atlanta Falcons dismissed LaTroy Lewis from his role as assistant defensive line coach Friday after sexual assault allegations surfaced against him, the team announced.\n\nThe Ann Arbor Police Department confirmed Friday to ESPN that it is currently investigating allegations of sexual assault against Lewis. Spokesperson Chris Page said the Ann Arbor PD was \"just recently made aware\" of the woman's allegations, which stem from a Dec. 5, 2024, incident while Lewis was on the Michigan football staff.\n\nLewis' attorney, Fabiola A. Galguera, said Lewis \"intends to fiercely fight these false allegations with the support of his wife, family, and my team.\" In a statement, Paul Corliss, a spokesperson for Michigan, called the allegations \"deeply concerning.\"\n\nKaren Truszkowski, the woman's attorney, told ESPN that her client filed an incident report with the Ann Arbor PD and applied for a protective order against Lewis earlier this week.\n\nTruszkowski said her client and Lewis met on a dating app and started communicating in July 2024, while Lewis was an assistant defensive line coach at Michigan. Lewis' behavior \"became increasingly aggressive\" over text and phone calls, Truszkowski said.\n\nThe two met in person for the first time at Weber's Hotel in Ann Arbor in December 2024, where Truszkowski said Lewis was supposed to give back goods her client had given him. According to the attorney, Lewis raped and battered her client at the hotel.\n\nThe woman informed then-Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore, whom she knew personally, about the incident, according to her attorney. But Moore did not report Lewis and \"weaponized\" the incident against the woman, Truszkowski said, including sending her lewd and sexually charged text messages.\n\nMoore's attorney, Ellen Michaels, denied the allegations in a statement to ESPN.\n\n\"Sherrone Moore did not fail to report misconduct, did not reward wrongdoing and did not harass anyone,\" she said. \"These claims are false.\"\n\nIn January 2025, officers from the Milford Police Department, north of Ann Arbor, responded to a call to the woman's home after neighbors heard raised voices, according to the incident report obtained by ESPN. Both Lewis and the woman told officers at the time that they had gotten into a verbal argument that was not physical, according to the report.\n\nThe woman told police that Lewis was a coach at Michigan and \"stated that she didn't want to talk about it,\" according to the incident report. No charges were filed.\n\nTruszkowski said that Lewis physically abused her client during that incident but that she was too afraid to tell police at the time.\n\nThe allegations against Lewis were first reported Thursday night by Darko State Media. The Falcons hired Lewis on Feb. 10 after coaching stints at Michigan, Toledo and UConn. He played defensive line at Tennessee and spent three seasons in the NFL.\n\nMichigan fired Moore on Dec. 10, 2025, for an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. He was then arrested on charges related to stalking and illegally entering the staff member's home, and he is awaiting trial.\n\nIn his statement, Corliss referred to Michigan's ongoing review of Moore's conduct and the culture of its athletic department and encouraged anyone with information to come forward.\n\nThe allegations against Lewis emerged less than three weeks after Falcons player James Pearce Jr. was arrested in Florida. The linebacker is facing five felony charges stemming from an alleged incident on Feb. 7 where he crashed his vehicle into a car driven by his ex-girlfriend, WNBA player Rickea Jackson, and struck a police officer with his vehicle, setting off a chase."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe NFL Players Association executive committee has narrowed its search for a permanent executive director to a group of finalists, including interim executive director David White and former union chief strategy officer JC Tretter, according to four sources briefed on the process.\n\nAlso among the finalists is American Conference commissioner Tim Pernetti, the sources said. The union's 32 player representatives will vote on the finalists at the annual NFLPA meeting in San Diego next month.\n\nIn a statement to ESPN, NFLPA president Jalen Reeves-Maybin said the executive committee is \"conducting a comprehensive search that includes a strong pool of highly qualified candidates. Out of respect for the integrity of the process and those involved, we will not comment on or disclose individual names.\"\n\nWhite, Tretter and Pernetti did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nThe NFLPA has been searching for a permanent leader since July, when then-executive director Lloyd Howell resigned following ESPN reporting that he had charged a pair of strip club visits to the union. ESPN also reported that he worked part time for the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that is seeking minority ownership in NFL franchises, and that the union and league had struck a confidentiality agreement to keep an arbitrator's rulings about possible collusion by NFL owners from players.\n\nIn August, the union elected White as its interim executive director. White is the former CEO of 3CG Ventures, an executive coaching and strategic firm, and a former board chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. He has extensive labor experience, having served as the leader of the SAG-AFTRA union, with 160,000 members who work in the entertainment industry, from 2009 to 2021. White was also a finalist when Howell was elected in 2023.\n\nWhile serving in the interim role, White has said union membership has \"no appetite\" for an 18th regular-season game, which NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has publicly contemplated.\n\nTretter, who served as the NFLPA's chief strategy officer under Howell, also resigned from his position in the wake of ESPN's reporting last year. Tretter is a retired Cleveland Browns offensive lineman who served as the player president from 2020 to 2024. He was reportedly a candidate to serve as interim executive director after Howell's resignation, but pulled his name from consideration when he stepped down.\n\nTretter led the 16-month search process that resulted in Howell's election in 2023 and presided over a vote that changed the NFLPA's constitution to make the search and election process more confidential. Last year, he told ESPN he made confidentiality a priority because candidates' names had leaked to the media in past elections.\n\nThe names of the finalists for this election are known to the executive committee and the finalists themselves, and confidentiality again has been a priority, other sources familiar with the process have told ESPN. Two player reps who spoke to ESPN this week said the executive committee hadn't yet told them who the finalists are.\n\nWhen he resigned, Tretter told CBS Sports that he denied having access to the collusion grievance or having any involvement in the confidentiality agreement that Howell struck with the league.\n\nPernetti has been the American Conference commissioner since June 2024. He was previously the president of Florida's IMG Academy, an athletic powerhouse high school that produces some of the top football recruits in the country. He has also held leadership roles at sports and entertainment company Endeavor and with Major League Soccer.\n\nOther candidates for the executive director role included Domonique Foxworth, a former player and an ESPN commentator who was the NFLPA president from 2012 to 2014; Matt Schaub, a former player rep who was a candidate in 2023; and Jeff Saturday, also a former player and an ESPN commentator, according to three other sources familiar with the process.\n\nSchaub did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Saturday confirmed to ESPN that he interviewed for the role with the firm the union hired to run the search but not with the executive committee. Foxworth also said he was interviewed by the firm but not by the executive committee.\n\n\"I'm extremely disappointed,\" Foxworth said. \"I hope they get it right this time.\""

(0:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide center Charles Bediako's college career is effectively over for the second time after the Alabama Supreme Court on Friday denied his request to play while he appeals his case.\n\nEarlier this week, Bediako's attorneys asked the Tuscaloosa County Circuit Court and the Alabama Supreme Court for \"interim injunctive relief\" while he appeals a local judge's ruling that denied his request for a preliminary injunction to play college basketball for the remainder of the season.\n\nBediako had played in the G League and signed multiple NBA contracts before a different local judge gave him a temporary restraining order to return to college basketball in January.\n\nIn the request to allow Bediako to play for the rest of the season, pending his appeal, Bediako's lawyers argued that his case \"is unlikely to resolve before the season concludes.\" The appellate process through the Alabama Supreme Court system can take months to finish. If his lawyers pursue a decision from a federal court, it could take even longer.\n\nIn January, the unprecedented move by a judge to grant a temporary restraining order that allowed Bediako to suit up for Alabama drew criticism from various stakeholders, including the NCAA, which accused Bediako of attempting to \"sidestep\" rules on eligibility.\n\nBediako's attorneys argued that even though the 2023 NBA draft entrant had signed a two-way deal with the San Antonio Spurs and multiple Exhibit 10 contracts -- moves that disqualified him from competing in college again, according to NCAA rules -- other G League players, European pros and James Nnaji, the 31st pick in the 2023 NBA draft, had similar cases and were granted full eligibility to play during the 2025-26 season. But those players hadn't played college basketball, making Bediako's situation unique.\n\nThis season, Bediako averaged 10.0 points for Alabama, which finished 3-2 in the five games he played. He was a standout with the team from 2021 to 2023. During the 2022-23 season, he was a defensive star for an Alabama squad that had the No. 3 defense in college basketball.\n\nHis agent told ESPN last month that a return to the G League would be considered if he were denied the opportunity to play college basketball.\n\nOn Thursday, Bediako returned to the court when he finished with eight points, seven rebounds and one block in Canada's win over Puerto Rico in the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2027 Americas Qualifiers in Miami."

The Heisman runner-up had to issue an apology after posting a message that included \"F-All THE VOTERS\" on social media.\n\nBut Pavia said his demeanor and approach are what made him a good leader at Vanderbilt. And his confidence, he said, comes from being constantly counted out in life, including when he started his career in junior college.\n\nThat has turned out to be a credit to him in his quest to make it in the NFL, he said.\n\n\"I feel like a lot of teams love the tenacity, the fight,\" he said. \"The life of an underdog, that's for sure. And, so, they ask questions. But you go back, you look at my record, ain't nothing on my record.\"\n\nHe added, \"I just want everyone to know what's true about me is I'm humble and I get my confidence from my process. And if you saw how much I put into this, you would see where I get my confidence.\"\n\nAnother thing NFL teams will need to weigh is Pavia's lack of size. He measures under 5-foot-10, a big detriment at the position in the NFL. But playing at that size against elite competition is nothing new, he said.\n\n\"I would just say turn on the tape,\" Pavia said. \"It's not like we're not playing these guys that are going first-round, second-round [picks] on Saturdays in the SEC. So, the SEC and the Big Ten probably have the most guys getting drafted in the first, second round. So, we're playing those guys and ain't nothing going to change.\""

Spohr was killed and Wood survived, though she died a year after the shooting.\n\nPlacer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said in a Friday statement that Spohr and Wood were loving grandparents and that Serafini's crimes greatly impacted family members and friends.\n\n\"The impact of this attack has extended far beyond the immediate victims, deeply affecting family members and the broader community, and highlighting the lasting harm caused by deliberate violence,\" Gire said.\n\nSerafini's attorney did not return requests for comment.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Serafini addressed the court and maintained his innocence, according to MyNews4. He said he was out partying with his wife the night of the shooting and described himself as a \"broken, imperfect man that makes mistakes.\"\n\nSerafini was drafted in 1992 by the Minnesota Twins. In a career spanning 11 years, the left-hander played for the Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies.\n\nProsecutors said Serafini hated his wife's wealthy parents and was heard saying he was willing to pay $20,000 to have them killed, according to the Sacramento Bee. Prosecutors showed jurors transcripts of angry emails and text messages between Serafini and his in-laws.\n\nDuring the six-week trial, Serafini's attorney, David Dratman, argued there was no physical evidence linking his client to the crime scene. He told the jury that although Serafini had a rocky relationship with his in-laws, he did not have motive to kill them.\n\nFollowing his conviction, Serafini filed multiple motions for a new trial, but those were denied.\n\nSerafini will serve his sentence at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the Placer County District Attorney's Office."

There was discussion surrounding a possible fight with former WBC champion Deontay Wilder, but Usyk opted to go in a different direction.\n\nUsyk, 39, had teased an announcement was coming earlier in the week on his social media and a bout with GLORY kickboxing's longest-reigning heavyweight champion had been discussed. Not only will Usyk step into the ring with a man widely regarded as one of the greatest kickboxers of all time with a record of 66-10, but he will also do it at the Pyramids of Giza in North Africa.\n\n\"I truly respect people who reach the very top in their sport,\" Usyk said in a statement. \"Rico is one of them -- a powerful athlete and a great champion. Being a champion isn't just about belts. It's about years of hard work, discipline and belief. I respect his journey; he's truly the King of Kickboxing. But this is boxing -- a different game, with its own rules and its own kings.\n\n\"I'm ready and really looking forward to meeting him in the ring.

The Dutch kickboxer has tried his hand at boxing once and defeated Janos Finfera by knockout in 2014. Verhoeven, 36, also has one MMA fight, a TKO win over Viktor Bogutzki in 2015.\n\n\"I spent twelve years as the undisputed heavyweight kickboxing champion and accomplished everything I set out to accomplish,\" Verhoeven said. \"But staying at the top didn't take away the hunger, it strengthened it. I wasn't looking for comfort, so started looking of the highest challenge available in another world.\n\n\"Usyk is undisputed in boxing. That's the kind of challenge that motivates me.

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "President Trump has said he is not happy with Iran in the wake of the latest talks on its nuclear programme, but said he had not yet decided whether to attack the country.\n\n\"I'm not happy with the fact that they're not willing to give us what we have to have. So I'm not thrilled,\" Trump said in his first comments on negotiations in Geneva that broke up on Thursday without a deal.\n\nThe US president stressed that he did not want to use military force against Iran, but said sometimes \"you have to\".\n\nConcern over the prospect of US strikes against Iran led a number of countries to issue warnings to their citizens in the region on Friday.\n\nThe UK temporarily withdrew staff from its embassy in Tehran and updated its travel guidance to advise against \"all but essential travel\" to Israel.\n\nCountries including China, India and Canada urgedtheir citizens to leave Iran as soon as possible due to the prospectof hostilities. Germany advised \"urgently\" against travel to Israel while France reiterated its advice not to do so.\n\nMeanwhile, the US urged its citizens in Iran to leave \"immediately\". Itsembassy in Israel also told some non-emergency staff and their families they could leave the country,advising that they may wish to do so \"while commercial flights are available\".\n\nTrump has threatened military action against Tehran if it does not reach a deal about its nuclear ambitions.\n\nHe has ordered the largest US military build-up in the Middle East since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, while Iran has vowed to respond to an attack with force.\n\nWashington and its allies suspect Iran is moving towards developing a nuclear weapon, which Tehran has always denied. It claims its programme is intended for peaceful, civilian purposes despite having enriched uranium up to near weapons-grade level.\n\nThe president told reporters on Friday: \"I say no enrichment... I think it's uncivil.\"\n\nIt came as Oman's Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, who was mediating the talks, said Tehran had agreed never to stockpile enriched uranium, making \"the enrichment argument less relevant\".\n\n\"If you cannot stockpile material that is enriched then there is no way you can actually create a bomb,\" Albusaidi told CBS News.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office said the decision to temporarily withdraw its embassy staff from Tehran was a 'precautionary measure' (file photo)\n\nHe had said on Thursday that US and Iranian officials made \"significant progress\" in the high-stakes nuclear talks in Geneva, but the chances of a deal that could avert a war remain unclear.\n\nAlbusaidi said the two sides planned to resume negotiations \"soon\" after consultations in their capitals, and technical-level discussions would take place next week in Vienna.\n\nIran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led his country's delegation, said \"good progress\" had been made but while there had been agreement on some issues, differences remained on others.\n\nHe said more negotiations would happen in a less than a week. President Trump's comments on Friday were the first official reaction from the US.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Department announced US Secretary of State Marco Rubio would travel to Israel on Monday, where he is expected to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and discuss \"a range of regional priorities\", including Iran.\n\nRubio also said on Friday he had designated Iran a \"state sponsor of wrongful detention\". It marked the first use of a power created in September under which the US can sanction or take other measures against countries unjustly detaining its citizens.\n\n\"We reiterate our call for Americans who are currently in Iran to leave immediately,\" he said in his statement announcing the move.\n\nEarlier, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee advised embassy staff who wished to leave Israel to \"do so TODAY\", the New York Times reported.\n\nHereportedly said in email there was \"no need to panic, but for those desiring to leave, it's important to make plans to depart sooner rather than later\".\n\nA statement on the embassy's website said they \"may wish to consider leaving Israel while commercial flights are available\".\n\nIt came days after the US government ordered all non-essential staff to leave its embassy in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, following a security review.\n\nVice-President JD Vance had told the Washington Post on Thursday that strikes remained under consideration - but there was \"no chance\" of the US becoming involved in a drawn-out war.\n\n\"I think we all prefer the diplomatic option,\" Vance said. \"But it really depends on what the Iranians do and what they say.\"\n\nThe US has sent thousands of troops and what Trump has described as an \"armada\" to the region in recent weeks, including two aircraft carriers along with other warships, as well as fighter jets and refuelling aircraft.\n\nHe said on 19 February that the world would find out within 10 days whether the US would reach a deal with Iran, or take military action.\n\n\"We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen,\" Trump said at the time.\n\nIran claims its enrichment activity stopped after the US bombed three of its nuclear sites in June, joining Tehran's conflict with Israel. Trump said at the time they had \"obliterated\" the facilities.\n\nThe UN's nuclear watchdog said on Friday that it had been refused access to the uranium enrichment sites ever since, calling it a cause of growing concern.\n\nIn a confidential report to its member states, the International Atomic Energy Agency said it was critical that its staff inspect the nuclear sites without delay.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Warner Bros is the network's parent company.\n\nParamount, which is looking to transform itself into a Hollywood heavyweight, is backed by tech billionaire Larry Ellison and led by his son David.\n\nThe funding of Paramount's offer has drawn scrutiny, in part over the close ties between US President Donald Trump and Larry Ellison, a major Republican donor.\n\nTrump has frequently attacked the news network over its reporting of his policies. He said in December that he believed CNN should be sold as part of any Warner Bros deal. He called the people running CNN \"corrupt or incompetent\" and said they should not be entrusted to run the network.\n\nCNN head Mark Thompson sent an email to employees as news spread of the all-but-assured Paramount deal, telling workers to not \"jump to conclusions about the future until we know more\", US media reported.\n\nThe BBC has contacted CNN for comment.\n\nParamount's initial hostile bid was also supported by Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner through his investment firm, raising concerns about the president's influence over the deal.\n\nKushner's firm, Affinity Partners, backed away in December amid scrutiny over the deal.\n\nParamount's 2025 merger with Skydance also led to scrutiny amid negotiations with the Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission, which had to sign off on the deal.\n\nAmong the concessions made was Paramount's $16m settlement on behalf of CBS News. Trump had sued the network over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former vice president Kamala Harris, claiming that the network had engaged in election interference in the way the program was edited.\n\nThe two studio's merger later resulted in leadership shakeups and layoffs at CBS News.\n\nOn Thursday, chief executive David Ellison welcomed the Warner Bros board's decision in favour of Paramount's sweetened offer. The proposal, he said in a statement, offers Warner Bros shareholders \"superior value, certainty and speed to closing\".\n\nIf Paramount's deal is approved by regulators, the company would fold Warner Bros' HBO Max streaming customers into its portfolio. It would also take ownership of CNN, the Food Network and a range of sports offerings.\n\nParamount's traditional networks already include brands such as Nickelodeon, CBS and Comedy Central.\n\nParamount Skydance boss David Ellison\n\nMany in Hollywood have viewed the bidding war between Netflix and Paramount as a battle with no good winner.\n\nCritics of a deal with Netflix voiced concern that the storied movie studio would be lost to the Silicon Valley streaming titan, paving the way for the depletion of cinema. But a merger with Paramount, which has touted itself among the last standing movie studios in Hollywood, also left critics unnerved over the company's perceived political connections to the Trump administration - a concern that has also riled the media landscape over the future of CNN.\n\nAcross the board, the selling of Warner Bros will have massive ramification across Tinsel town, with all but assured cuts to staff in a city that has been marred by continued production cuts.\n\nIn December, Warner Bros said it had agreed to sell its film and streaming divisions, including HBO, to Netflix in a deal worth $27.75 per share or roughly $82bn (£61bn), including debt.\n\nWarner Bros said it would spin-off the remainder of its business, including traditional television networks and the news channel CNN, as an independent company.\n\nBut in a last-ditch push, Paramount this week agreed to pay more for a Warner Bros takeover. The company offered $31 per share in cash, up from $30 per share to take over the entire company.\n\nIt also agreed to pay $7bn should the deal fall through and cover the $2.8bn fee Warner Bros had agreed to pay Netflix in the event of a break-up of the merger plan.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Dr Kwabena Bempah Tandoh, a former Deputy Director-General of the Ghana Education Service (GES), has mounted a robust defence of the double-track system introduced in Senior High Schools, labelling it an \"absolutely worth it\" journey that salvaged the futures of over a million Ghanaian children.\n\nSpeaking in a reflective interview on JoyNews’ Personality Profile with Emefa Akosua Adeti on Friday, February 27, Dr Tandoh, who spent seven years at the Ghana Education Service (GES), credited the system with providing a lifeline to students who would have otherwise been shut out of the senior high school cycle due to infrastructure deficits.\n\nDr Tandoh dismissed criticisms of the policy by pointing to the sheer scale of its impact. He noted that the \"novice idea\" was the primary vehicle for expanding secondary education access during his tenure.\n\n“Had it not been for the double track... some almost 1.3 million people, 1,274,000 or so children, had access to school beyond what would have been possible. On the fact that the novel idea has been able to provide opportunity for another 1.3 million kids to have access to a teacher, I believe it’s absolutely worth it,” Dr Tandoh stated. The Double-Track System was introduced as a temporary measure to manage the surge in enrolment following the implementation of the Free Senior High School (FSHS) policy. By splitting the student body into two separate tracks, the government was able to utilise existing facilities year-round. While the system faced scrutiny regarding the length of holidays and the pressure on teaching staff, Dr Tandoh’s assessment reinforces the government's stance that the \"social intervention\" of access outweighed the logistical hurdles. Even though the system increased enrolment, it led to reduced contact hours, compelling stakeholders to demand cancellation of the policy.\n\nA little over a year since exiting his role, Dr Tandoh shared a rare glimpse into the internal culture of the GES. Despite the high-pressure environment of managing one of the country's most significant educational shifts, he described a \"truly cordial\" working atmosphere.\n\nWhile he acknowledged the Director-General's role at the top of the hierarchy, he spoke warmly of the service's presence at every level of the country’s administrative structure, from national offices down to regional, district, and school units.\n\n“I miss my colleagues, you know. Beyond the work, I miss my colleagues... the really cordial environment that we worked in. Ghana Education Service is truly a service,” he remarked.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Ghana has done something many countries say they want to do: it opened the door to a new, climate-smart agricultural industry.\n\nParliament recognized industrial hemp — cannabis with no more than 0.3% THC — as a lawful crop. In plain language, this is hemp that cannot make anyone high. It’s used in textiles, construction materials, food products, cosmetics, and industrial fibers. It’s a development crop. A jobs crop. A value-addition crop.\n\nThen Ghana regulated it as though it were a narcotic.\n\nThat contradiction is now before the Supreme Court in a constitutional case filed by the lawyer Amanda Akuokor Clinton on behalf of a farmer, Mariam Alhassan. It may sound like a narrow lawsuit about licensing. It isn’t. It’s a test of something bigger: whether a government can declare an industry legal while designing the regulatory gate so high that ordinary citizens cannot enter.\n\nThe framework under challenge was built under the Narcotics Control Commission Act and implemented through regulations governing cultivation and the movement of hemp. What the suit says — in careful constitutional language — is what many Ghanaian entrepreneurs would say more bluntly: the system turns “legal” into “impossible.”\n\nConsider how modern economies actually work. Not everyone needs to plant hemp to be affected by hemp policy. Consumers are already living inside the contradiction.\n\nIn many places in Accra, you can buy imported hemp-derived products — skincare, oils, cosmetics — marketed with “hemp” on the label and containing trace amounts of hemp extract. A body scrub, a lotion, a hair product. These items circulate through regular commercial channels. No armed escort. No narcotics-style transport permit. No special security convoy.\n\nBut if a Ghanaian farmer wants to cultivate industrial hemp domestically — the same non-intoxicating plant ingredient that shows up in imported goods — the law can demand layers of licences, fees denominated in U.S. dollars, recurring levies, and transport controls designed for dangerous drugs. The case points to cultivation charges that can reach tens of thousands of dollars per hectare, plus annual percentage-based “regulatory” levies and additional compliance costs.\n\nThis is the kind of policy that looks neutral on paper but produces a predictable outcome in real life: it creates an industry reserved for those with deep pockets and foreign currency buffers. Smallholders and local cooperatives don’t lose because they lack talent or land; they lose because the entry price is engineered beyond reach.\n\nIn a country where currency volatility is not a footnote but a lived experience, pricing licences in U.S. dollars is not a technical detail. It’s a wall. It inserts global exchange-rate shocks into local farming decisions — a type of risk with nothing to do with public safety, product quality, or regulatory cost. It also quietly shifts the sector toward large capital players: corporations that can hedge, import finance, or absorb surprise costs. Those are not the people hemp was supposed to empower.\n\nThe deeper issue is constitutional, not botanical.\n\nThe Ghanaian Constitution doesn’t forbid regulation. It forbids arbitrary regulation — the kind that is irrational, unfair, or so disproportionate that it becomes a form of economic exclusion. That is why the case leans on provisions about administrative justice and the control of discretionary power. It also raises a question that other democracies recognize instantly: when do “fees” become taxes in disguise? If charges bear little relationship to the cost of regulation and function mainly as revenue instruments, then the democratic safeguards around taxation matter.\n\nAnd the policy incoherence is hard to miss.\n\nIf the State’s concern is diversion or misuse, it has tools: testing, traceability, licensing, audits, and penalties. Many countries use those instruments without requiring armed escorts for a crop that is legally defined as non-narcotic. The current approach suggests that Ghana has imported not just regulation but fear — a lingering institutional reflex that sees the word “cannabis” and reaches for the narcotics playbook, even when Parliament itself drew a scientific and legal boundary.\n\nThat reflex has consequences. A country can’t build local value chains by punishing local value creation.\n\nThe result is a strange economic theater: imported hemp-based products can appear on Ghanaian shelves with ordinary commercial friction, while domestic farmers face extraordinary barriers to growing the underlying plant. If that remains the equilibrium, Ghana will have legalized hemp as a consumer brand while suppressing hemp as a Ghanaian livelihood.\n\nThis is exactly how inequality gets written into markets — not through slogans, but through spreadsheets, licensing tables, and regulatory discretion.\n\nThe Supreme Court case asks for declarations that the framework violates constitutional principles, and for an order compelling the state to redesign the regime into something tiered, scaled, and risk-based — more like agricultural regulation than narcotics control. Even if one disagrees with every number in the complaint, the moral and democratic premise is difficult to dismiss: regulation should manage risk, not manufacture exclusion.\n\nGhana doesn’t need to choose between safety and opportunity. It needs to stop pretending that safety requires the regulation of hemp like heroin.\n\nBecause when a government makes an industry “legal” but unreachable, it doesn’t regulate a market. It creates a cartel — and then calls it compliance.\n\nBy: Amanda Akuokor Clinton Esq.\n\nMsc.

            "content": "The Member of Parliament for the Central Tongu Constituency, Gabby Alexander Hotordze, has announced the introduction of what he described as the 'Common Competitive Exams' for basic schools in the Central Tongu District, in a bid to boost academic performance among pupils.\n\nHe made this known while speaking to the media at a short ceremony to officially hand over a newly constructed three-unit classroom block with an office and store to the people of Mafi-Seva. The facility was built by the NGO Adanu to support quality education in the area.\n\nIn an interview with the media, the MP outlined the rationale and structure of the initiative.\n\n“We have realised that there is a fallen standard of education in the Central Tongu District. That urge among pupils to study is no longer there. So we have decided to introduce common competitive exams. The various classes from Class 4 to the end will enter into competitive exams in English Language, Mathematics and Integrated Science at the circuit level,\" he explained.\n\n\"Those who do better at the circuit level will be applauded and given something, but the best three at the circuit level will go to the district level and write the exams again. Those who excel will be supported by my office and the assembly.”\n\nHe explained that the intervention is designed to reignite academic enthusiasm among learners and create healthy competition across schools in the district.\n\nAccording to him, the initiative will inspire pupils to study harder when they see their peers being recognised and rewarded for excellence.\n\nThe ceremony, held at Mafi-Seva in the Central Tongu District, brought together community leaders, education officials, teachers, and residents who expressed gratitude for the new classroom facility, describing it as a significant boost to teaching and learning.\n\nThe Headmaster of Mafi-Seva D/A Roman Catholic Basic School, Mr. Richard Benjamin Agordor, while thanking Adanu for the edifice, used the opportunity to appeal for urgent support in the form of additional teaching staff.\n\n“It is my appeal, especially to the Central Tongu Education Directorate and others, to help us.\n\nThis time, we are having only two teachers, including myself, who are facilitating from kindergarten to JHS 3, which is a very hard task on our shoulders. So we are pleading for more teachers to come.”\n\nMr. Agordor stressed that although the new infrastructure will greatly improve the learning environment, the shortage of teachers remains a major challenge, affecting effective classroom delivery and individual attention for pupils.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Volunteer and Project Coordinator of Adanu, Mr. Jerry John Kotoka, called on individuals, corporate bodies, and government institutions to partner with the organization to expand its impact.\n\n“Most of our funding comes from friends of Adanu abroad. We cannot handle this alone. We want to make more impact. We have been doing these projects for the past 23 years, and we are looking for corporate institutions, individuals and even the government to partner with us so that we can impact other communities.”\n\nBeyond the Mafi-Seva project, Adanu has also constructed a library, a kindergarten block, and a six-unit classroom block for the people of Adaklu Hehekpoe in the Adaklu District, further demonstrating its commitment to rural development and education.\n\nFor the past 23 years, Adanu has been at the forefront of community-driven development in Ghana. The organisation has focused on improving access to quality education, healthcare, water, sanitation, and other essential social infrastructure in underserved communities.\n\nThrough partnerships with international donors, volunteers, and local stakeholders, Adanu has constructed classroom blocks, libraries, sanitation facilities, and other critical projects aimed at uplifting rural populations and creating sustainable opportunities for growth.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Health service delivery must address the whole person — not just the visible symptoms,” he stressed.\n\nTo address these gaps, the project convened stakeholders from national to district levels, including the Ministry of Health, Mental Health Authority, NTD Programme, Ministry of Environment Science and Technology and affected communities, to review findings and jointly design an integrated intervention.\n\nThe project is being implemented by the University of Health and Allied Sciences in collaboration with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and supported by development partners.\n\nCurrently being piloted in Ho, Hohoe, Ellembelle and Bole, the four-year initiative aims to produce an integrated assessment tool that can be scaled nationwide.\n\nDr. Manyeh pointed out that similar implementation research has only been conducted in Liberia within Africa, positioning Ghana as the second country on the continent to undertake such an initiative.\n\nHe believes the project could reshape national health policy and serve as a model for integrated NTD–mental health care across the region.\n\n“If we succeed,” Dr. Manyeh noted, “any patient who walks into a health facility in Ghana with skin NTD will receive both physical and mental health assessments as part of routine care.”\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

When mental health is affected, people are less likely to seek care. The cycle continues.”\n\nProf. Ansah Manu introduced what he described as the “resonance of stigma”—a layered burden faced by patients who experience both NTD-related stigma and mental health stigma.\n\n“When someone has an NTD and develops depression or anxiety because of stigma, the discrimination doubles,” he explained.\n\nHe argued that Ghana’s health system must move beyond medicalising disease and instead adopt a holistic framework that addresses psychological and social dimensions.\n\nThe IMAGINE GHANA initiative has brought together the Ghana Health Service, the Mental Health Authority, ministries, civil society groups, traditional authorities and persons affected by NTDs to co-design sustainable solutions.\n\nRather than creating parallel systems, the project seeks to strengthen existing structures and embed integrated care within routine service delivery.\n\n“Our goal is dignity,” Prof. Ansah stated. “When we treat people, we must restore not only their physical health but also their place in society.”\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Business News of Saturday, 28 February 2026\n\nSource: classfmonline.com\n\nPresident John Dramani Mahama has hailed Ghana’s diaspora as the country’s “most reliable development partner,” revealing that remittances from citizens abroad reached a historic $7.8 billion in 2025, the largest annual inflow ever recorded.\n\n\n\nSpeaking during his 2026 State of the Nation Address (SoNA) to Parliament on Friday, President Mahama emphasised the critical role expatriate Ghanaians play in stabilising the national economy and supporting everyday life across the country.\n\n\n\n“Mr Speaker, I’m also pleased to report that remittances from our relatives abroad, the Ghanaian diaspora, reached a historic high of $7.8 billion in 2025,” he told lawmakers.\n\n\n\nThe president attributed the record-breaking inflow to confidence in Ghana’s economic direction and the “enduring patriotism” of Ghanaians living overseas.\n\n\n\nHe highlighted the tangible impact of the funds, noting that they go directly into households, education, housing, and entrepreneurship.\n\n\n\n“Mr Speaker, these remittances they bring back home support households, they finance education, they build homes, they provide seed money for businesses, and best of all, they stabilise our foreign exchange position,” he said.\n\n\n\nMahama contrasted the diaspora’s contributions with traditional development aid, noting that their support arrives without bureaucratic hurdles, conditionalities, or fanfare.\n\n\n\n“In many respects, our diaspora has become one of the country’s most reliable development partners. Without contracts, conditionalities, or fanfare, they are easily one of our most reliable development partners,” he said.\n\n\n\nDespite the relative strength of the Ghanaian cedi against major foreign currencies, the diaspora continues to play a vital role in supporting the local economy. Remittances flow directly into households, businesses, and community projects, often providing resources that go beyond what local incomes alone can sustain. This consistent financial inflow demonstrates that, even when currency conditions favour domestic residents, Ghanaians abroad remain committed to backing development at the grassroots level, reinforcing both economic stability and social resilience."

It has since been described as one of the most significant grassroots scouting initiatives in recent years.\n\n\n\nFive Talents Identified — One Stands Above\n\n\n\nFrom the large pool of hopefuls, Sadiek successfully identified five outstanding prospects. The headline act is prolific forward Solomon Osei Tutu, whose rapid rise has drawn national attention.\n\n\n\nOsei Tutu has already earned a call-up to Ghana’s U20 national team, underlining his growing status in the country’s football landscape.\n\nThe 18-year-old striker’s explosive pace, intelligent movement, aerial strength, and clinical finishing have led many to compare him to Nigerian goal machine Victor Osimhen.\n\n\n\nOutstanding Numbers at Sasaamo Panin FC\n\n\n\nCurrently playing for Sasaamo Panin FC, Osei Tutu’s statistics underline why he is regarded as a special talent:\n\n\n\n• 16 goals in 16 games last season\n\n• 11 MVP awards\n\n\n\n• Currently leading the goal king chart in his zone\n\n\n\n• 12 goals in 14 games this season\n\n\n\n• 6 assists and 6 MVPs\n\nHis consistency in front of goal, combined with his all-round attacking contribution, has positioned him as one of the most productive young forwards in Ghana.\n\n\n\nSenior National Team Attention\n\n\n\nSuch is his growing reputation that the head coach of the Ghana national football team paid a personal visit to observe the high school striker during a recent U20 training camp in Accra — a significant endorsement of his potential.\n\n\n\nAt just 18, Osei Tutu is already being monitored beyond youth football.\n\nCOPA SADIEK Set to Become Annual Talent Platform\n\n\n\nFollowing the overwhelming success of the tournament, COPA SADIEK will now be structured as an annual scouting platform. The initiative aims to provide consistent opportunities for emerging talents to showcase their abilities and potentially secure professional contracts and international transfers.\n\n\n\nThrough vision, strategic networking, and international connections, Hamzah Sadiek continues to build pathways for Ghanaian and African footballers to access the global stage.\n\n\n\nIf Solomon Osei Tutu’s trajectory is anything to go by, the next Ghanaian star may well have been discovered in Kumasi."

            "content": "Paramount is set to take over Warner Bro\n\nNetflix has backed away from its proposal to buy Warner Bros Discovery, clearing the way for Paramount Skydance to win a months-long battle for one of Hollywood's most storied studios in a deal worth around $111bn (£82.2bn).\n\nWarner Bros, which put itself up for sale last year, on Thursday said Paramount's latest bid was \"superior\" to the one from Netflix, which in turn refused to raise its offer.\n\n\n\nNetflix executives say they have declined to match Paramount's bid as \"the deal is no longer financially attractive\" at that price.\n\n\n\nThe buyer would gain control of the iconic studio along with its films and media networks - a takeover that could significantly reshape the media landscape.\n\n\n\nLast December, Warner Bros agreed to a takeover offer from Netflix for some of its assets, in a deal worth roughly $82bn (£61bn) including debt.\n\n\n\nParamount then made a rival proposal, which was rebuffed by Warner Bros, but an increased offer was made earlier this week, boosted by $1 per share.\n\n\n\n\"The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,\" Netflix co-chief executives Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement. \"However, we've always been disciplined.\"\n\n\n\n\"This transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price,\" the Netflix executives added.\n\nThe announcement came just hours after Sarandos had visited the White House on Thursday.\n\n\n\nIt caps off a dramatic months-long saga that - if approved by regulators - is likely to reshape Hollywood.\n\n\n\nBut California Attorney General Rob Bonta said later on Thursday that the potential merger \"is not a done deal\".\n\n\n\n\"These two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny - the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review,\" he wrote in a social media post.\n\n\n\nBonta had said earlier this month that his office would review any deal involving Warner Bros as the entertainment industry represents a \"critical sector\" for California's economy.\n\n\n\nParamount would also need approval from the US Department of Justice as well as European regulators.\n\n\n\nA deal between Paramount and Warner Bros could hold serious ramifications for the future of one of the US's biggest news brands - CNN. Warner Bros is the network's parent company.\n\nParamount, which is looking to transform itself into a Hollywood heavyweight, is backed by tech billionaire Larry Ellison and led by his son David.\n\n\n\nThe funding of Paramount's offer has drawn scrutiny, in part over the close ties between US President Donald Trump and Larry Ellison, a major Republican donor.\n\n\n\nTrump has frequently attacked the news network over its reporting of his policies. He said in December that he believed CNN should be sold as part of any Warner Bros deal. He called the people running CNN \"corrupt or incompetent\" and said they should not be entrusted to run the network.\n\n\n\nCNN head Mark Thompson sent an email to employees as news spread of the all-but-assured Paramount deal, telling workers to not \"jump to conclusions about the future until we know more\", US media reported.\n\n\n\nThe BBC has contacted CNN for comment.\n\n\n\nParamount's initial hostile bid was also supported by Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner through his investment firm, raising concerns about the president's influence over the deal.\n\n\n\nKushner's firm, Affinity Partners, backed away in December amid scrutiny over the deal.\n\nParamount's 2025 merger with Skydance also led to scrutiny amid negotiations with the Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission, which had to sign off on the deal.\n\n\n\nAmong the concessions made was Paramount's $16m settlement on behalf of CBS News. Trump had sued the network over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former vice president Kamala Harris, claiming that the network had engaged in election interference in the way the program was edited.\n\n\n\nThe two studios' merger later resulted in leadership shakeups and layoffs at CBS News.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, chief executive David Ellison welcomed the Warner Bros board's decision in favour of Paramount's sweetened offer. The proposal, he said in a statement, offers Warner Bros shareholders \"superior value, certainty and speed to closing\".\n\n\n\nIf Paramount's deal is approved by regulators, the company would fold Warner Bros' HBO Max streaming customers into its portfolio. It would also take ownership of CNN, the Food Network and a range of sports offerings.\n\n\n\nParamount's traditional networks already include brands such as Nickelodeon, CBS and Comedy Central.\n\n\n\nMany in Hollywood have viewed the bidding war between Netflix and Paramount as a battle with no good winner.\n\nCritics of a deal with Netflix voiced concern that the storied movie studio would be lost to the Silicon Valley streaming titan, paving the way for the depletion of cinema. But a merger with Paramount, which has touted itself among the last standing movie studios in Hollywood, also left critics unnerved over the company's perceived political connections to the Trump administration - a concern that has also riled the media landscape over the future of CNN.\n\n\n\nAcross the board, the selling of Warner Bros will have massive ramifications across Tinsel town, with all but assured cuts to staff in a city that has been marred by continued production cuts.\n\n\n\nIn December, Warner Bros said it had agreed to sell its film and streaming divisions, including HBO, to Netflix in a deal worth $27.75 per share or roughly $82bn (£61bn), including debt.\n\n\n\nWarner Bros said it would spin off the remainder of its business, including traditional television networks and the news channel CNN, as an independent company.\n\n\n\nBut in a last-ditch push, Paramount this week agreed to pay more for a Warner Bros takeover. The company offered $31 per share in cash, up from $30 per share, to take over the entire company.\n\n\n\nIt also agreed to pay $7bn should the deal fall through and cover the $2.8bn fee Warner Bros had agreed to pay Netflix in the event of a break-up of the merger plan."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "The expanded indictment targets protesters who rallied at Cities Church in St Paul against Trump’s immigration surge.\n\nThe administration of United States President Donald Trump has broadened its prosecution of the protesters involved in a church demonstration to 39 people, up from nine.\n\nThe demonstration was part of a backlash to Trump’s deadly immigration surge in the Midwestern state of Minnesota, but officials have sought to frame the protest as an attack on religious freedom.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced the expanded indictment on Friday in a message posted to social media.\n\n“Today, [the Justice Department] unsealed an indictment charging 30 more people who took part in the attack on Cities Church in Minnesota,” Bondi wrote. “At my direction, federal agents have already arrested 25 of them, with more to come throughout the day.”\n\nShe added a warning to other protesters who might seek to disrupt a religious service.\n\n“YOU CANNOT ATTACK A HOUSE OF WORSHIP,” Bondi said. “If you do so, you cannot hide from us — we will find you, arrest you, and prosecute you. This Department of Justice STANDS for Christians and all Americans of faith.”\n\nAppealing to Christian voters\n\nSince taking office for a second term, Trump has sought to appeal to Christian conservatives by launching initiatives, for example, to root out anti-Christian bias and prevent alleged acts of Christian persecution, both domestically and in countries like Nigeria.\n\nBut critics have accused his administration of attempting to stifle opposition through its prosecution of the Minnesota protest attendees.\n\nSome of those indicted deny even being a part of the January 18 protest. Defendants like former CNN anchor Don Lemon and reporter Georgia Fort say they attended in their capacity as journalists.\n\n\n\nBoth have pleaded not guilty to the charges and have publicly questioned whether their prosecution is an attempt to curtail freedom of the press.\n\nThe superseding indictment, filed on Thursday, levies two counts against the 39 defendants, accusing them of conspiracy against the right of religious freedom and efforts to injure, intimidate or interfere with the exercise of religious freedom.\n\n“While inside the Church, defendants collectively oppressed, threatened and intimidated the Church’s congregants and pastors by physically occupying the main aisle and rows of chairs near the front of the church,” the indictment reads\n\nIt also describes the protesters as “engaging in menacing and threatening behavior” by “chanting and yelling loudly” and obstructing exits.\n\nA magistrate judge on January 22 initially rejected the Justice Department’s attempt to charge nine attendees who were at the protest.\n\nBut the department sought a grand jury indictment instead, which was filed on January 29 and made public the next day.\n\nA reaction to Trump’s immigration surge\n\nThe protest, dubbed “Operation Pullup”, was conceived as a response to the violent immigration crackdown that had unfolded in Minnesota.\n\nMany of the enforcement efforts centred on the metropolitan area that includes the Twin Cities: St Paul and Minneapolis.\n\nTrump had repeatedly blamed the area’s large Somali American population for a welfare fraud scandal involving government funds for programmes like Medicaid and school lunches.\n\nIn December, the Trump administration surged federal immigration agents to the region, nicknaming the effort Operation Metro Surge. At its height, as many as 3,000 agents were in the Minneapolis-St Paul area.\n\nBut the effort was plagued by reports of excessive violence towards detainees and protesters alike. Videos circulated of officers breaking the car windows of legal observers, pepper-spraying protesters and beating people.\n\nOfficers also engaged in the practice of entering homes forcibly without a judicial warrant, which advocates described as a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. Cases of unlawful arrests were also reported.\n\nBut a turning point came on January 7, when an agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was caught on camera shooting into the vehicle of 37-year-old mother Renee Good. She died, and her killing triggered nationwide protests.\n\nOperation Pullup took place at Cities Church in St Paul less than two weeks later.\n\nIt was intended as a demonstration against the church’s pastor, David Easterwood, who serves as a local official for ICE.\n\n\n\nSeveral protesters have indicated that they are prepared to fight the government’s charges over the incident, citing their First Amendment rights to free speech.\n\nSome also said that they intended to remain vigilant towards government immigration operations, even after Trump administration officials announced Operation Metro Surge was winding down in mid-February.\n\n“This is not the time to be Minnesota Nice,” one protester, civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong, wrote on social media last week. “It’s time for truth, justice, and freedom to prevail.”"

            "content": "There has been a weeks-long feud between the Pentagon and Anthropic over concerns about how the military could use AI at war.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump said he is directing every federal agency to immediately cease work with artificial intelligence lab Anthropic, adding there would be a six-month phaseout for the Department of Defense and other agencies that use the company’s products.\n\n“I am directing EVERY Federal Agency in the United States Government to IMMEDIATELY CEASE all use of Anthropic’s technology. We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again!” Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Friday.\n\nTrump’s directive came during a weeks-long feud between the Pentagon and the San Francisco-based startup over concerns about how the military could use AI at war.\n\nSpokespeople for Anthropic, which has a $200m contract with the Pentagon, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump’s decision stopped short of threats issued by the Pentagon, including that it could invoke the Defense Production Act to require Anthropic’s compliance.\n\nThe Pentagon had also said it considered making Anthropic a supply-chain risk, a designation that previously targeted businesses tied to foreign adversaries.\n\nTrump’s comments came just over an hour before the Pentagon’s deadline for Anthropic to allow unrestricted military use of its AI technology or face consequences – and nearly 24 hours after CEO Dario Amodei said his company “cannot in good conscience accede” to the Defense Department’s demands.\n\nCalling the company “left-wing nut jobs”, the president said Anthropic made a mistake trying to strong-arm the Pentagon. Trump wrote on Truth Social that most agencies must immediately stop using Anthropic’s AI, but gave the Pentagon a six-month period to phase out the technology that is already embedded in military platforms.\n\n\n\n“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again!” Trump wrote.\n\nAt issue in the defence contract was a clash over AI’s role in national security. Anthropic had said it sought narrow assurances from the Pentagon that Claude won’t be used for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons. But after months of private talks exploded into public debate, it said in a Thursday statement that new contract language “framed as compromise was paired with legalese that would allow those safeguards to be disregarded at will”.\n\nTrump threatened further action if Anthropic did not cooperate with the phaseout. Trump warned he would use “the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow” if Anthropic did not help in the phaseout period.\n\n‘Threatening’ move\n\nThe setback comes as AI leader Anthropic raced to win a fierce competition selling novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of its widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalised an IPO decision.\n\nAnthropic was the first frontier AI lab to put its models on classified networks via cloud provider Amazon.com and the first to build customised models for national security customers, the startup has said.\n\nIts product, Claude, is in use across the intelligence community and armed services.\n\nUS Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, criticised the action taken by Trump, a Republican.\n\n“The president’s directive to halt the use of a leading American AI company across the federal government, combined with inflammatory rhetoric attacking that company, raises serious concerns about whether national security decisions are being driven by careful analysis or political considerations.”\n\nThe conflict is the latest eruption in a saga that dates back at least to 2018. That year, employees at Alphabet’s Google protested the Pentagon’s use of the company’s AI to analyse drone footage, straining relations between Silicon Valley and Washington. A rapprochement ensued, with companies including Amazon and Microsoft jostling for defence business, and still more CEOs pledging cooperation last year with the Trump administration.\n\nThe dispute stunned AI developers in Silicon Valley, where a growing number of workers from Anthropic’s top rivals, OpenAI and Google, voiced support for Amodei’s stand in open letters and other forums.\n\n\n\n“The Pentagon is negotiating with Google and OpenAI to try to get them to agree to what Anthropic has refused,” says the open letter from some OpenAI and Google employees. “They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in.”\n\nAnd in a surprise move from one of Amodei’s fiercest rivals, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Friday sided with Anthropic and, in a CNBC interview, questioned the Pentagon’s “threatening” move, suggesting that OpenAI and most of the AI field share the same red lines. Amodei once worked for OpenAI before he and other OpenAI leaders quit to form Anthropic in 2021.\n\n“For all the differences I have with Anthropic, I mostly trust them as a company, and I think they really do care about safety,” Altman told CNBC."

            "content": "Government agency says more extreme weather expected after rains trigger floods, landslides in Minas Gerais state.\n\nThe death toll from landslides and flooding in eastern Brazil has risen to 64, as authorities continue to search for survivors.\n\nThe update on Friday came days after a long period of heavy rain in the state of Minas Gerais, with the cities of Juiz de Fora and Uba particularly hard hit.\n\nThe state’s fire department said five more people are still missing. More than 5,500 people have been forced to leave their homes.\n\nMeanwhile, Brazil’s meteorology institute, Inmet, has warned of a “great danger” of more inclement weather in parts of Minas Gerais, as well as in the neighbouring states of Rio and Sao Paulo along Brazil’s Atlantic coast.\n\nIt also highlighted further risks of landslides, river overflows and major flooding.\n\nOn Saturday, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is set to visit Minas Gerais to meet with local leaders, according to a statement from the presidential palace.\n\nThe statement said Lula “will fly over areas affected by heavy rains” and meet with the mayors of Juiz de Fora, Uba and Matias Barbosa.\n\nThe federal government has authorised the release of approximately 3.4 million reais ($660,000) for reconstruction efforts and humanitarian assistance.\n\nLula’s meeting with the mayors will take place in the city hall of Juiz de Fora, where about a quarter of the population – about 540,000 people – live in places identified as being at risk for natural disasters related to land and water, according to a 2023 report from the Brazilian government agency Cemaden.\n\n\n\nVideo footage taken Thursday evening showed brown water flowing through the tourist hot spot of Paraty, located in southeastern Brazil. Authorities told residents to steer clear of flooded areas and hillsides as well as to avoid sheltering under trees due to a risk of lightning strikes.\n\nScientists say extreme weather is happening more frequently due to human-caused climate change.\n\nOn Friday, Greenpeace Brazil posted on Instagram a call for action to better prepare cities for the ravages of extreme weather.\n\n“Avoiding tragedies like the ones currently happening in cities in Minas Gerais and other states needs to be a priority,” the nonprofit said. “Disasters are also the result of political choices.”\n\nThe deaths in Minas Gerais come nearly two years after flooding in Brazil’s southern Rio Grande do Sul state devastated the area, leaving at least 185 people dead."

            "content": "The Taliban said their leaders are willing to negotiate with Pakistan as both sides claim to inflict heavy losses on their opponents in fighting.\n\nAfghanistan’s Taliban leaders said they were willing to negotiate after Pakistan bombed a number of major cities, with Islamabad’s defence minister declaring the neighbours in “open war”, following months of tensions and tit-for-tat clashes.\n\nPakistan struck the Afghan capital Kabul and the city of Kandahar, where Taliban leaders are based, as well as other towns, on Friday, with fighting also continuing along the border. Both sides have reported heavy losses.\n\nPakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif declared an “all-out confrontation” with the Taliban government, posting on X: “Now it is open war between us and you.”\n\nAfghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the Taliban’s leaders were ready to negotiate with Pakistan in order to bring an end to the violence.\n\n“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has always tried to resolve issues through dialogue, and now also we want to resolve this matter through dialogue,” said Mujahid.\n\nThe latest violence erupted after Pakistan’s air strikes on Afghan territory last weekend triggered Afghan retaliatory attacks along the border on Thursday, escalating long‑simmering tensions over Pakistan’s claim that Afghanistan shelters Pakistan Taliban fighters. Afghanistan denies this.\n\nMujahid said Pakistani strikes hit parts of Kabul, Kandahar and Paktia on Thursday night, and on Paktia, Paktika, Khost and Laghman on Friday.\n\nThat followed Afghan drone strikes that began late on Thursday on Pakistani military positions and installations in northwest Pakistan along their shared border.\n\n\n\nPakistan’s army spokesperson, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said Pakistani air and ground operations had killed at least 274 members of the Afghan forces and affiliated fighters, and wounded more than 400 others, while 12 Pakistani soldiers were killed and 27 others were wounded. One Pakistani soldier was missing in action.\n\nMujahid rejected the claims of a high number of Afghan casualties as “false”. He said that 55 Pakistani soldiers were killed, with the bodies of 23 of them taken to Afghanistan. He also said “many” Pakistani soldiers were captured. Thirteen Afghan soldiers had been killed, he said, and another 22 wounded, while 13 civilians were also wounded.\n\nLater on Friday, the Afghan government said that 19 civilians were killed and 26 others injured when Pakistan struck the provinces of Khost and Paktika in southeastern Afghanistan.\n\nCasualty claims from both sides have not been independently verified by Al Jazeera.\n\nRelations plunged\n\nThe operation was Pakistan’s most widespread bombardment of the Afghan capital and its first air strikes on the southern power base of the Taliban authorities since they returned to power in 2021.\n\nAbdul Sayed, a Sweden-based analyst on conflict in Afghanistan and Pakistan, says domestic factors in Pakistan constitute a significant constraint on its ability to initiate a full-scale war against Afghanistan.\n\n“This limitation stems from the deep ties between the populations of both countries, particularly the tribes residing on either side of the Durand Line,” a 2,575-kilometre (1,600-mile) frontier that is internationally recognised as Pakistan’s border but which Afghanistan does not recognise as legitimate.\n\n“Consequently, despite its substantial military capabilities, Pakistan cannot sustain the large-scale bloodshed that an armed conflict with Afghanistan would entail,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nRelations between the neighbours have plunged in recent months, with land border crossings largely shut since deadly fighting in October that killed more than 70 people on both sides.\n\nSeveral rounds of negotiations between Islamabad and Kabul followed an initial ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkiye, but the efforts have failed to produce a lasting agreement.\n\nAfter repeated breaches of the initial truce, Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply concerned by the escalation of violence” between Afghanistan and Pakistan and the impact that is having on civilian populations, his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told a news briefing. Russia, Iran and Iraq are among the countries that have called for an immediate end to the fighting."

            "content": "The search of CK Hutchison’s subsidiary marks the latest flashpoint in the rising US-China tensions over control of Panama’s vital trade canal.\n\nAuthorities in Panama have reportedly searched and removed property from the subsidiary of a Hong Kong company that has been at the heart of recent tensions between the United States and China over the Panama Canal.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the Panama Ports Company (PPC), part of the Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, said the Panamanian government “acted in disregard for the rule of law”.\n\nIt decried what it called “the latest steps to invade and ⁠take the property of PPC” during a search on Thursday. It also accused authorities of entering a private storage site without notice and ignoring requests to safeguard sensitive corporate data.\n\nPanama Ports Company has been under increased scrutiny following US President Donald Trump’s claims that China was asserting too much influence over the arterial trade canal, which connects the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic.\n\nPanama’s government has robustly denied Chinese control of the waterway.\n\nBut last month, the country’s Supreme Court annulled deals that gave the Panama Ports Company control over two canal ports. The court ruled that the concessions provided to the company were unconstitutional.\n\nChina has alleged that the court case was a reaction to “hegemonic” pressure.\n\nIt condemned Panama’s seizure of the ports as well as its decision to temporarily tap the Danish Maersk company and Switzerland-based MSC to run the ports until a new agreement is reached.\n\nPanama’s President Jose Raul Mulino, meanwhile, warned China to “be careful” in its manoeuvring.\n\n\n\n“They need us more than we need them,” he said.\n\nThe two ports in question, the Balboa Port on the Pacific Ocean side and the Cristobal Port at the Atlantic end, handle about 39 percent of all of Panama’s container traffic.\n\nThe ports are located at the entrances of the Panama Canal, but they do not fall under the supervision of the autonomous Panama Canal Authority that operates the waterway.\n\nPrior to taking office, Trump repeatedly said he wanted to take control of the Panama Canal, claiming that the US was being “ripped off” by its toll prices.\n\nThe canal had previously been controlled by the US, but it was handed over to Panama in 1999 under a 1977 treaty signed by then-President Jimmy Carter.\n\nPrior to Friday’s raid, CK Hutchison had agreed to a $23bn sale of dozens of ports worldwide, including the Panamanian terminals, to a consortium led by the US multinational BlackRock and the Mediterranean Shipping Company.\n\nThe deal, which has faced repeated delays, has been criticised by Beijing but welcomed by Trump."

While the operation was hailed by some as the end of a brutal dictatorship, critics argue it violated international law and replaced one crisis with another.\n\nUS President Donald Trump now boasts of controlling Venezuela’s oil, as the country’s interim leadership strikes deals with Washington.

Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of “effective altruism,” they have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission - a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives.\n\nThe Terms of Service of Anthropic’s defective altruism will never outweigh the safety, the readiness, or the lives of American troops on the battlefield.\n\nTheir true objective is unmistakable: to seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military. That is unacceptable.\n\nAs President Trump stated on Truth Social, the Commander-in-Chief and the American people alone will determine the destiny of our armed forces, not unelected tech executives.\n\nAnthropic’s stance is fundamentally incompatible with American principles. Their relationship with the United States Armed Forces and the Federal Government has therefore been permanently altered.\n\nIn conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security. Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic. Anthropic will continue to provide the Department of War its services for a period of no more than six months to allow for a seamless transition to a better and more patriotic service.\n\nAmerica’s warfighters will never be held hostage by the ideological whims of Big Tech.

            "content": "Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.\n\nYet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, Kodak, and others.\n\nAll the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.\n\nIf you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that offers great image quality and lets you choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like Kodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.\n\nTake a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for most people\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 306 grams / Charging method: AA batteries / Companion app: None / Other features: Built-in selfie mirror, film counter\n\nIf all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well-suited for kids and those new to photography.\n\nFor an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most struggle to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash helps. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both bright and dark environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. Photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before, but selfies captured my features and skin tone more accurately, thanks in part to the small front-facing mirror. The updated lens design also lets you twist into Close-Up Mode to zoom slightly and activate the Parallax Correction features for a more aligned photo. It’s a fun, point-and-shoot-style feature, though aligning photos still takes some practice (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).\n\nFor an instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 produces vivid, relatively true-to-life photos. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nThe Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the small counter that shows your remaining shots, which is a useful tracking feature given that each print costs about $1. However, it doesn’t support Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it doesn’t feature filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for a solid instant camera that caters to all ages and experience levels, you’ll likely be satisfied with the Instax Mini 12.\n\nThe best premium instant camera\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 285 grams / Charging method: USB-C (on newer models) / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nOne of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo was a favorite of my former colleague Becca Farcase — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a handsome brown version, as well as a newer pink model.\n\nIt’s easy to balk at its price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.\n\nBeing able to adjust the brightness of the prints helped me capture night photos and a low-light immersive exhibit a little more clearly and realistically, which is a feature the Instax Mini 12 doesn’t offer. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Mini 12, the Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can disable the flash, leverage the 3-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder, and adjust the brightness of a print — a helpful feature, given Evo doesn’t capture dark environments well. The camera’s dials also let you apply various lens options and effects, from retro filters to monochrome shades, and you can even take app-based remote shots, allowing for better seflies and more photographic control.\n\nThe Evo isn’t perfect, though. The companion app isn’t as feature-rich as competing software, the menu system can be confusing to navigate, and the camera’s internal storage maxes out at 45 images. Still, these are relatively minor drawbacks for a stylish, portable camera that makes it easy to quickly capture and print quality shots.\n\nThe best instant camera for social occasions\n\nFilm type: Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / Film size: 3 x 3-inch square prints / Weight: 467 grams / Charging method: Micro USB / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nWhereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app lets you apply frames, stickers, filters, and a wide range of customization options to photos, making it great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature in the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making it a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.\n\nLike the Evo, the Shot 3 Retro features an LCD screen — albeit a much smaller one — that lets you decide whether to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp images from your phone. Unlike the Evo, however, the Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of film. It also uses cheaper film; you can often pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for under $20. The cheaper arguably encourages creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than those from both Fujifilm and Polaroid.\n\nPhotos taken with the Kodak Mini Shot 3 aren’t particularly sharp and can have an excessive pink tint. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nHowever, there are notable drawbacks to the Shot 3 Retro. The resulting prints aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone, for one, nor were they as clear or sharp as what you might get with the Evo or Mini 12 (some even have an excessive pink tint). The Shot 3 Retro doesn’t store images the way the Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish. Nonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.\n\nThe best instant camera for retro fans\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / Weight: 648 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: Yes / Other features: Flip-up lid, scene analysis feature\n\nIf you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the Polaroid Flip is the camera for you. It resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 more than any other camera on our list, thanks to its classic, retro-inspired design and flip-up lid. Its square I-Type film prints and iconic white frame give photos an authentically vintage look, while modern touches like Bluetooth, USB-C charging, and a beginner-friendly companion app add greater convenience and creative control.\n\nCompared to the third-gen Polaroid Now Plus, my former retro pick, the Flip delivers clearer shots with fewer wasted photos, making the extra $50 worthwhile given that eight I-Type sheets are a spendy $18.99. The increased clarity can be attributed to several factors, including the Flip’s sonar autofocus and a four-lens hyperfocal system — which result in sharper, more focused images — along with its excellent flash. It’s the most powerful of any Polaroid camera, and while it can sometimes overexpose images, you can adjust exposure directly from the camera or app. The Scene Analysis feature also helps by warning if a shot is likely to be over- or underexposed, or if you’re too close to your subject. In my experience, the warnings didn’t always prevent overexposure, but they did leave me with shots that looked less blown than those from the Now Plus.\n\nA few outdoor examples I captured with the Polaroid Flip. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nAll that being said, there are some notable drawbacks. The Flip is relatively heavy and awkwardly sized, so you can’t slip it into a purse or easily carry it around. Prints also take up to 15 minutes to develop — during which they must be shielded from light — which can be quite an inconvenience. Low-light performance remains a weak spot as well, and I struggled to capture indoor shots given the contrast and saturation are lower than with Instax film. Admittedly, this gave my pictures a more dreamy, vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust the saturation and exposure settings.\n\nTruth be told, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, the Flip is the perfect camera for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for portability\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / Weight: 239 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: No / Other features: Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter\n\nWhereas the Flip is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It weighs just over a pound and fits easily in the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it the most portable instant camera on our list. If its images were more true to life and didn’t require you to sheild them from the light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d call it the best instant camera for kids or travel.\n\nAt $89.99, the latest Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera available, with film that costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (a 16-sheet pack runs $21.99). The new Go sports a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including USB-C support, and Polaroid claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor. Photos are slightly brighter, though the original Go produced warmer images that felt more true to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low, but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Flip.\n\nThe second-gen Polaroid Go produces charming photos but with a cooler tone. Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Flip, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. There’s no Bluetooth or companion app for added effects; however, the camera does include a self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. The smaller prints may disappoint those who prefer traditional Polaroid sizes, though, and its modern design lacks the retro charm of older models. But classic Polaroid cameras didn’t come with an app, either, and the Go’s simplicity makes it an a easy-to-use option that delivers a traditional instant film experience at less than half the price of the Flip.\n\nOther instant cameras to consider\n\nFujifilm’s $116.99 Instax Mini 41 is the long-awaited follow-up to the Mini 40. The updated model retains the retro design found on the prior model but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups. It didn’t take long testing the Mini 41 for me to realize it’s simply the Mini 12 for adults. With its black-and-silver body and flatter, squarer edges, the Mini 41 looks sleeker and more stylish. The two cameras are nearly identical, aside from the design, with the same solid photo quality and feature set. Both battery-powered options turn on with a simple twist of the lens, and each comes equipped with a selfie mirror, a close-up mode, and a flash (which cannot be disabled).\n\nThere are a few subtle upgrades to the Mini 41, however. A textured grip in the front makes it easier to hold, and its shape makes shooting in landscape mode more comfortable. But those are small differences, and at their core, the cameras offer the same experience. Since the Instax Mini 12 retails for less, I ultimately believe it’s the better value; however, if a fashionable, mature look appeals to you, the Mini 41 is a great alternative, especially if you can find it on sale.\n\nIf you’re looking for an advanced analog instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At $234.95, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12 or the Mini 41, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click cameras given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket, an aluminum extension column, and a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur when capturing fast-moving subjects.\n\nThanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12, Mini 41, and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera, not a hybrid like the Evo, so you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The newer model is also less user-friendly than the Mini 12 and Mini 41, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters.\n\nThe Kodak Smile Plus is another hybrid instant camera that allows you to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $129.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with a physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers.\n\nHowever, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark.\n\nThat said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software isn’t as snappy or feature-rich, it still lets you add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it’s often available for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.\n\nFrom photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, Leica’s Sofort 2 is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.\n\nThe drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s challenging to recommend at $399, as most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The Leica user interface is easier to navigate, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also appreciate that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.\n\nWhile it didn’t make the cut, the Instax Square SQ1 is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and features a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $159.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100. That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Flip and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.\n\nFujifilm also sells the newer Instax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at $199.95. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.\n\nFujifilm’s Instax Wide Evo Hybrid is nearly identical to the Instax Mini Evo. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $409.95 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lenses and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.\n\nPlus, unlike the Wide 400, the Wide Evo Hybrid is a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful feature that can reduce wasted shots. However, at $409.95, it costs significantly more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken, which is something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects, such as a dog or hyperactive toddler.\n\nIf you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $409.95 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $175.95 Instax Wide 400 is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar stills to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.\n\nFujifilm’s new Instax Mini LiPlay Plus isn’t nearly as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo, but it’s worth considering if you take a lot of selfies. At $234.99, the hybrid camera costs the same as the Instax Mini Evo, but features a 3-inch LCD screen on the back, along with a second, rear-facing wide-angle lens designed specifically for self-portraits. That dedicated selfie camera, paired with the LCD, delivers some of the best — and most precise — selfies I’ve captured with an instant camera to date.\n\nThe LiPlay Plus also includes some fun extra features, such as a layered photo mode that combines images from both cameras into a single shot. It can also record short audio clips, which are saved as a QR code you can place in a corner of the printed photo. Both features are enjoyable to play with, though the layered photo mode can, admittedly, come off as gimmicky. You’re basically just dropping a selfie onto a background image with no way to reposition or resize it.\n\nWhat I’m looking for How we test instant cameras Collapse Typically, I try to spend at least a couple of weeks, if not months, testing each camera to get a sense of what it would be like to actually own one. I’ll use them to capture photos of loved ones while hanging out, as well as subjects and scenes I stumble across as I explore Los Angeles and its many beaches. I shoot indoors and outside, with and without the flash, allowing me to compare how each camera performs in both bright and low-light environments.I also ask friends and family — both young and old — for their input on image quality, and I have them take photos with the instant camera to get their thoughts on usability. If the camera comes with extra features, such as filters or support for a companion app, I’ll make sure to put them to the test in real-life situations. I note how easy it is to pull up and navigate the app, apply the effects, and, of course, how the results look. Photo quality Collapse Instant cameras aren’t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most struggle in low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life. Ease of use Collapse How easy is it to set the instant camera up and take photos with it? Ease of use is a big part of what makes instant cameras fun and accessible to people of all ages. You shouldn’t need a professional photography background just to enjoy an instant camera. Value Collapse Instant cameras come with different features at various price points. Generally, the more feature-rich cameras tend to be pricier, but do the extra capabilities justify the added cost? Some cameras, for example, pair with a companion app or feature a built-in selfie mirror, while others let you print images from your phone. None of these are essential, though the added niceties may be worth it for some people. Suitability Collapse Some instant cameras aren’t as well-suited for certain situations and / or people as others. For example, there are instant cameras that print old-fashioned Polaroid photos that aren’t very clear. They frustrate me, but retro lovers might find them charming. Other cameras come with advanced creative modes that let you edit photos and even print smartphone photos, but a young child might find them difficult to use. Film Collapse Each instant camera requires a different kind of film, which means that the sticker price of the camera isn’t the true price. This is something you should take into account before making a purchase, as the cost of film can quickly add up. Depending on the brand, you may have to pay anywhere between 50 cents and $2 a shot.It’s also important to take into account that some film is easier to find. The Instax Mini 12, for example, uses credit card-size Instax Mini film that’s sold at most major retailers. Other types of film, including the film needed for Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, are available on Amazon but aren’t sold by as many retailers.Finally, most instant camera brands sell films of varying quality in a range of styles. Some are decorated with colorful frames and patterns, while others are black and white. They also vary in shape and size, from small rectangular prints you can stick in your wallet to square-shaped ones. You can also buy wider prints, and some brands even sell film with an adhesive backing that allows you to use the resulting images as stickers.\n\nUpdate, February 27th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and shorten the copy for all of our main entries."

Discovery and Paramount Skydance’s merger agreement is now official. On Friday, the two companies announced plans to merge into a massive media company that will fold WBD’s studio, linear channels, streaming service, and gaming segment into Paramount.\n\nThough WBD initially signed onto an $83 billion agreement to merge part of Warner Bros. with Netflix, Paramount persisted with a hostile takeover bid, followed by a series of offers. That persistence paid off, as WBD determined that Paramount’s “best and final” offer is “superior” to Netflix’s deal. On Thursday, Netflix declined to match Paramount’s bid, calling it “no longer financially attractive.”\n\nParamount and WBD say the board of directors of both companies has signed off on the deal. The companies expect it to close in the third quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Under the agreement, Paramount will acquire WBD in a deal valued at $110 billion. Paramount has also agreed to cover the $7 billion regulatory termination fee and the $2.8 billion breakup fee owed to Netflix, which it has already paid, according to Bloomberg.\n\n“Together, Paramount and WBD will deliver greater choice for consumers through its leading streaming platforms with an exceptional intellectual property portfolio that has produced popular franchises such as Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Top Gun, the DC Universe and SpongeBob SquarePants,” the companies say in the press release.\n\nLawmakers and regulators are skeptical about the Paramount-WBD merger. “A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a statement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta also warned that the agreement isn’t a “done deal,” and that the state’s Department of Justice will be “vigorous” in its review of the merger."

            "content": "Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts, and have stopped getting a response. This week, thanks to a reader tip, we think we’ve found the original phone the T1 is based on.\n\nA long time ago, back when the Trump phone was but a single, inaccurate render and a contradictory spec sheet, we tried to figure out what other phone it might be based on. Now, eight months, two spec overhauls, and one redesign later, I have a good guess: the HTC U24 Pro.\n\nI didn’t spot this by myself. A reader first tipped me off to the similarities between the U24 Pro and the Trump phone I revealed a few weeks ago, which are numerous: a similar angled body and curved display, a unique front sensor array, and broadly similar specs, including oddities like a headphone jack and microSD card support.\n\nLet’s get one thing out the way at the top: I’m pretty sure HTC isn’t secretly building the Trump phone. Sohaib Ahmed, the company’s global director of PR, told me as much: “HTC does not design or manufacture phones for third parties.” But that doesn’t rule out another company playing a part in designing or building both phones, and given just how similar they look, I suspect that’s exactly what happened.\n\nIt’s a little hard to make out in this screenshot, but the Trump phone shares the sharply angled edges of the HTC U24 Pro. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nThe U24 Pro is an odd phone in its own right. It launched in 2024 for €549 (around $600 at the time), and was heralded in some corners as a return from the dead for HTC, despite the fact that it followed the U23 Pro a year earlier, and a string of smaller releases that targeted the Asian market. HTC, once one of the major players in the Android phone industry, had been greatly diminished ever since selling a large part of its smartphone business to Google for $1.1 billion in 2017.\n\nBoth the T1 Phone and the U24 Pro share a slightly asymmetric angular frame, jutting out into a point along every edge, with a heavily curved screen on the front. I cannot think of, nor find, another phone that is quite the same shape — even small details like the positions of the antenna lines around the power and volume buttons line up. Even more telling is the set of sensors along each phone’s top. The U24 Pro splits up its speaker grill, notification LED, and proximity sensor into three, resulting in an unusual design with a long bar, a small dot for the LED, and then a second shorter bar, at the point where the display meets the phone’s top. What looks like the same sensor design can be clearly seen on the Trump phone I was shown, though I can’t confirm that the sensors themselves are the same, or that the T1 Phone will also have a notification LED.\n\nBoth phones have near-identical sets of speakers and sensors about the front selfie camera, with headphone jack and microphone visible behind them on the top edges. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nOther details are subtler. It’s hard to tell exactly from the glimpses I got of the Trump phone, but along the top frame it certainly looks to have both a headphone jack and a microphone in the exact same positions as on the HTC device. Even having a headphone jack in the first place is evidence of the phones’ connection, given how rare the feature is in modern devices. The same can be said for the fact that both phones include a microSD card slot, sharing support for up to 1TB cards on top of a base 512GB of storage.\n\nWhile the rear cameras look completely different, which seems to scupper my theory, look again: The U24 Pro’s cameras are split into a pair close together, with a third lens lower down. The new Trump phone sets all its cameras in one mount, but they’re unevenly spaced, with a larger gap between the second and third lenses. These cameras may look totally different on the surface, but I suspect that underneath you’ll find they’re similar. And what we know of the specs matches too: Trump Mobile told me that its phone will have 50-megapixel sensors for both the main and selfie cameras, and my glimpse of its camera UI showed an ultrawide and a 2x zoom option — all of which you’ll find on the U24 Pro.\n\nThe two phones’ cameras look different at first, but the unusual lens placement might just line up. Screenshot: Dominic Preston / The Verge and Image: HTC\n\nAssuming that the two phones are essentially the same, does the U24 Pro tell us any more about what to expect from the T1? It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, matching what I’d been told about a Snapdragon 7-series chip in the Trump phone. The U24 Pro has a 6.8-inch OLED display, 60W wired charging and even wireless charging support, and an IP67 rating for dust and water protection. There’s reason to be cautious reading too much into the spec sheet, though: The U24 Pro released with a 4,600mAh battery, smaller than the 5,000mAh capacity I’ve been told will be in the Trump phone. If that spec differs, then other elements of the internals could well too — the bigger battery in particular might replace the wireless charging coils of the HTC phone.\n\nThe U24 Pro launched to middling reviews, which may not inspire much confidence in Trump Mobile’s offering. Tech Advisor gave the phone two and a half stars out of five, calling it “hard to recommend over rivals,” while Notebookcheck declared it “modern and yet out of date.” Still, it fared surprisingly well in a JerryRigEverything teardown and durability test.\n\nHe noticed, however, that this didn’t appear to be the HTC of old, lacking the sapphire crystal HTC previously used on its displays and optical image stabilization on the front camera it once pioneered. The U24 Pro and other HTC phones released in the last few years share little consistent design language, and ship with near-stock Android software. Speculation has been rife that HTC isn’t in fact manufacturing the phones internally, but had commissioned an ODM — original design manufacturer — to produce the hardware. ODMs design and manufacture phones for other companies, usually to a set of specifications provided by the consumer-facing brands, and often retain ownership of the designs, allowing them to reuse and repurpose them for other clients. I asked HTC for clarification, but the company wouldn’t confirm whether the U24 Pro was made in-house or contracted out.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that Trump Mobile, or its manufacturing partner, is simply ripping off the design of a little-known HTC device. But I think the most likely answer here is a more mundane one: HTC probably worked with some unnamed ODM to design and manufacture the U24 Pro, and Trump Mobile just happened to work with the same company. That manufacturer may have either dug out its old designs for HTC when developing the T1 Phone, or perhaps gave new life to old, unused components from HTC’s production run. Without knowing the hypothetical ODM involved, it’s hard to say for sure. Trump Mobile has previously confirmed that it’s working with a partner or partners to manufacture its phones outside the US, before their “final assembly” in Miami, but executive Don Hendrickson wouldn’t tell me the name of its manufacturer or where it’s based. I reached out to the company again for comment on this story, and received no reply.\n\nSo no, I don’t think that HTC made the Trump phone. But it does look likely that it is based, more or less, on one of that company’s phones. It remains to be seen how the T1 Phone will differ in its details, but the fact that its origins seem so closely tied to an unpopular midranger from two years ago doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the T1 Phone’s flagship credentials.\n\nGot inside information on Trump Mobile or the Trump phone?

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nOn Thursday morning, I attended a Q&A panel with four top Samsung smartphone executives. Until 2025, Samsung was the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer, and by association, the world’s largest maker of cameras. It’s still the second largest after Apple.\n\nSamsung handed me the microphone first. I asked:\n\nWe see a divide in society between people who want AI to do impressive things with their photos and videos, and those who don’t want AI to do anything with photos and videos because it’s eroding our ability to believe that what we have seen is real, destroying the concept of photographic evidence. Metadata tools like C2PA have utterly failed to stem the tide. Does Samsung have any new and different ideas on how to prevent AI images from taking over the world?\n\nSamsung’s four executives did not have any new and different ideas to share.\n\nI will credit Won-Joon Choi, the mobile division’s COO and R&D chief, for not dodging the question. He told the room that the erosion of reality is a problem and he wants to fix it.\n\nBut he, and other Samsung executives, suggested that the company needs to balance the desire for photographic reality with letting smartphone buyers be “more creative.” They passed the buck by suggesting it’s an industry-wide problem, one that requires a broader conversation, and suggested that Samsung has already partially solved it simply by adding a watermark to AI-generated images. A watermark that can easily be removed.\n\nGiven an opening later, an exec suggested our feelings toward AI-generated content might become more favorable in the future.\n\nHere are some of those answers.\n\n“We recognize the issue, because a lot of content is generated by AI,” Choi began. “On the one hand, people want to be more creative, so we believe we have to provide a solution so people can be more creative,” he said. “On the other hand, it’s really hard nowadays to distinguish the real photos and videos from the fake ones. I think this is a problem, we recognize that, and I think it’s a problem we have to solve at an industry level.”\n\n“The C2PA, you may view it as a failure, but it’s still enough to provide a mechanism if people want to validate that those pictures and videos are made by AI. I think we have to provide a mechanism so people can use it. I think it’s an ongoing effort throughout the industry to solve this problem,” he added.\n\n“I think if we make joint efforts to solve this problem, I believe that we should be able to do it,” he concluded.\n\nAs my colleague Jess Weatherbed wrote earlier this week, we’re starting to worry that this sort of “the industry will solve this together” rhetoric, and the C2PA itself, are substitutes for actual meaningful action.\n\nPerhaps responding to our Samsung AI slop watch reporting, Samsung America exec Dave Das also chimed in to say that the company’s still learning about how much AI is acceptable when creating its own ads. He admitted that the company has “just started utilizing some AI content in our creative, and the feedback has been pretty clear.”\n\n“We’re trying to discern what is the right place to use it, and absolutely how to be very clear about when we are using AI generated content vs naturally generated content,” Das said.\n\nBut Das still frames it as a balancing act between business priorities, not a social responsibility. “It really boils down to giving the creator choice,” he said, suggesting that Samsung’s job is to find “the right balance.”\n\nLater in the morning, KTLA-TV tech reporter Rich DeMuro felt out Samsung’s stance with a very different question. He asked whether Samsung might want to make it easier for customers to remove its AI watermark from AI-generated photos.\n\nThree screenshots taken from AI-generated Samsung ads on YouTube. More on Samsung slop watch here. Image: Samsung / The Verge\n\n“If I’m making a Christmas card with all your fun tools, do I really want that to say ‘AI-generated content?’” asked DeMuro.\n\nDrew Blackard, Samsung America’s SVP of mobile product management, took that one. He concluded by saying that “If we feel like consumers really want that ability to remove watermarks, and there are other ways to address the first point around authenticity at the same time, we’ll do both things and deliver the best of what people are wanting out of the experiences.”\n\n“At least right now, there’s enough concern from consumers around authenticity that that’s the primary thing we’ve solved for, in terms of the watermarking both in the metadata and on the photo itself. Not all services do that,” he said.\n\nBlackard also suggested we might look back one day and realize that AI-generated content isn’t such a big deal, that our perceptions might change over time, the same way perceptions changed toward user-generated content to begin with. People were concerned then with “the amount of content now flowing into the system” and how it wasn’t the professional video product they were used to, he said.\n\nI wonder if Samsung and fellow smartphone makers have considered the opposite: that perceptions of AI-generated imagery might become even less favorable after people lose their jobs in favor of cheap-to-produce AI slop, and after it becomes far easier to lie and cheat and steal in the absence of reliable recorded evidence.\n\nI wonder if they’ve considered solving this problem ”at an industry level” before they break the dam, and whether perception might turn against Samsung for helping create the flood that comes after."

However, a subsequent tweet from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made good on the threat.\n\n“In conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security,” Secretary Hegseth wrote. “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\n\nThe Pentagon dispute centered on Anthropic’s refusal to allow its AI models to be used to power either mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, which Secretary Hegseth found unduly restrictive.\n\nCEO Dario Amodei reiterated his stance in a public post on Thursday, refusing to compromise on the two points.\n\n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters — with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei wrote at the time. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Per the BBC, CEO Sam Altman sent a memo to staff on Thursday saying he shared the same “red lines” and that any OpenAI-related defense contracts would also reject uses that were “unlawful or unsuited to cloud deployments, such as domestic surveillance and autonomous offensive weapons.”\n\nOpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who very publicly fell out with Altman in November 2023 and has since co-founded his own AI company, also waded into the conversation on Friday, writing on X: “It’s extremely good that Anthropic has not backed down, and it’s significant that OpenAI has taken a similar stance.\n\nIn the future, there will be much more challenging situations of this nature, and it will be critical for the relevant leaders to rise up to the occasion, for fierce competitors to put their differences aside.

            "content": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.\n\nSuno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\n\nStill, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more."

It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.\n\nTechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in example workflows on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial, or legal data; creating analysis; and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations.\n\nPerplexity invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company canceled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.\n\nThis tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.\n\nThe company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base — in the tens of millions of users — pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nNow, Perplexity executives say they are aiming for a more boutique set of users, with products that serve people making “GDP-moving decisions.” Executives in the briefing, who asked not to be identified by name, described prioritizing enterprise subscriptions, particularly for deep research.\n\n“You don’t hear us talk about MAUs ever, because we’re not actually on a mission to get as many users as possible,” one executive said.\n\nPerplexity recently released a new benchmark for complex research tasks, called Draco, where (no surprise) its own deep research offering beats out competitors like Gemini.\n\nPerplexity says it is no longer reliant on other companies’ APIs for its web index and now has its own AI-optimized search API. But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.\n\n“Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done in Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.\n\nA visualization of model usage by Perplexity users over time. Image Credits:Perplexity\n\nIf one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.\n\nThe company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear.\n\nStill, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on user fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.\n\nAnd there is more on the horizon: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.\n\nOne executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.\n\nHowever, the execs at the briefing dismiss such complaints: “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” one said."

            "content": "Other Wireless Chargers We Tested\n\nThere are a lot of wireless chargers. Here are a few more we like, but for one reason or another don't warrant a place above.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nKrafted Couch Wireless Charger for $52: I thought this wireless charger that’s designed to be draped over the arm of your couch was a great idea when I saw it, but the ridges failed to keep it in place on my velvety couch, so it kept slipping down the side. The silicone finish with the Krafted logo is also a bit ugly. It's just a silicone mat with a magnetic charger inside, though there is a fairly generous 6.6-foot (2-meter) cable, and it is Qi2 rated. If you’re always rooting around for a charger and one of the colors blends well with your furniture, it might be a good solution for you.\n\nEinova Eggtronic Charging Stone for $70: Made with 100 percent solid marble or stone—you can choose from a variety. Every single pick in this guide looks very much like a wireless charger, but I've had visiting friends ask if this one is a drink coaster. (I'm still figuring out whether that's a good or bad thing.) It has zero LEDs, perfect for bedrooms; just try to hide the cable to truly make it blend into your home. We recommend putting a case on your phone when using it with this charger, as there's a risk of scuffing up the back with these harder surfaces.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nBaseus Nomos 5-in-1 Charging Station for $100: If you liked the PicoGo W2 above but need more gadget-charging power, this 5-in-1 could be worth a look. It also has a tilting pad and retractable USB-C cable, but adds two more USB-C ports and one USB-A, along with a stats-filled display. It’s perfect for your desktop. I also tried and quite liked the Baseus Nomos 8-in-1 Magnetic Charging Station ($70), which combines a similar folding Qi2 pad with three US AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one USB-A.\n\nRapport London Formula Wireless Charging Tray for $475: Yes, this is an obscene price for a Qi wireless charger. You can probably make a version for a fraction of the cost. But Rapport's build quality is quite nice, with a lacquered grey box and a soft-touch fabric to keep your watches and phone scratch-free. It reliably recharged several Android phones without making them too warm, all while offering storage for a few watches. It's attractive, but you have to have cash to burn at this price.\n\niOttie iOS Wireless Duo for $50: This dual-charging system looks pretty—I like the fabric-wrapped stand—and you can charge another device on the rubberized charging pad next to it. The stand can be used in portrait or landscape, though in the latter orientation it'll block the pad. I use the pad to top up my wireless earbuds, but I wouldn't use this iOttie on a nightstand, because the LED on the front can be glaring. A cable and adapter are included, which makes it a good value. It can charge Pixel phones at up to 15 watts, iPhones at 7.5 watts, and other Android phones at 10 watts.\n\nJourney Alti Play Performance Desk Mat for $120: This is a desk mat that doubles as a wireless charging pad. On the left side is a plasticky rectangle with a Qi2 magnetic puck for your smartphone. Above it is a little area to charge wireless earbuds (5 watts). Naturally, there's RGB all over, and there are two buttons you can press to cycle through patterns and colors. It's a smart-looking system, though the quality of the actual mat leaves a bit to be desired. I didn't have issues gliding my mouse on it, and it stays put thanks to the rubber underside, but I just didn't like the look and feel of the Lycra surface. Journey has some other versions of this mat that use different materials, so take a look if you like the overall aesthetic.\n\nCourant Catch:2 Essentials for $75: Wireless chargers should look nice. You shouldn't settle for anything less! This Courant dual charger oozes luxury with its Belgian linen-wrapped surface (especially in the camel color). I've used it by my front door to recharge my partner's and my wireless earbuds for two years. The rubber feet prevent it from shifting around, but even if there are five coils in this pad, you should try to be precise when you put your device down to charge and make sure the LED lights up to double-check. It comes with a color-matching USB-C cable.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nZens Liberty Wireless Charger for $150: I tested the Glass Edition of this wireless charging pad, and it looks stunning with the 16 overlapping copper coils on display (the standard version has a woolen fabric top). It can charge two devices simultaneously at up to 15 watts apiece, and there’s an optional Apple Watch add-on ($19). As stylish as it is, the price is too high. Because you can see the coils, placement is never an issue, but it’s a bulky charger; the fan is audible at times, and while I had no problem charging my iPhone or AirPods, my Pixel 6 Pro got very warm on this pad.\n\nXiaomi Mi 80-W Wireless Charging Stand for $50: By far the fastest wireless charger we have tested, this stand is only worth considering for Xiaomi phones (it seems to charge most other phones at 10 watts or below). I tested with the Xiaomi 13 Ultra, which tops out at 50 watts (some Xiaomi models can go higher). The unusual sail shape combines a white triangular section with a clear acrylic base that has a subtle groove to hold your phone in place and a gap underneath for the exhaust grill from the noisy fan. The USB-C port and LED indicator are on the back.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

            "content": "The snow is melting, the days are getting longer, and I can almost smell the springtime ahead. Soon, we'll be cruising around town on ebikes and electric scooters instead of burning fossil fuels. For now, the weather hasn't quite caught up, which is great for markdowns. Many of the best electric scooters are still seeing significant discounts. If you've been thinking about buying one, now's the best time: prices are low, and sunny commuting days are just ahead.\n\nGear editor Julian Chokkattu has spent five years testing more than 45 electric scooters. These are his top picks that are also on sale right now.\n\nApollo Go for $849 ($450 Off)\n\nThis is Gear editor Julian Chokkattu's favorite scooter. The riding experience is powerful and smooth, thanks to its dual 350-watt motors and solid front and rear suspensions. The speed maxes out at 28 miles per hour (mph), which doesn't make it the fastest scooter on the market, but it has a good range. (Chokkattu is a very tall man and was able to travel 15 miles on a single charge at 15 mph.) Other Apollo features he appreciates: turn signals, a dot display, a bell, along with a headlight and an LED strip for extra visibility.\n\nApollo Phantom 2.0 for $2099 ($900 Off)\n\nThe Apollo Phantom 2.0 maxes out at 44 mph, with plenty of power from its dual 1,750-watt motors. It's a gorgeous scooter, designed with 11-inch self-healing tubeless tires and a dual-spring suspension system for a smooth riding experience. But with great power comes great weight. At 102 pounds, the Phantom 2.0 is the heaviest electric scooter Chokkattu has tested, so I would only recommend this purchase if you don't live in a walkup and/or have a garage.\n\nMore Discounted Electric Scooters"

            "content": "US President Donald Trump announced Friday that he was instructing every federal agency to “immediately cease” use of Anthropic’s AI tools. The move comes after Anthropic and top officials clashed for weeks over military applications of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump said that there would be a “six month phase out period” for agencies using Anthropic, which could allow time for further negotiations between the government and the AI startup.\n\nThe Pentagon and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nShortly after the President’s announcement, defense secretary Pete Hegseth said that Anthropic would also be designated a “supply chain risk,” a move normally reserved for foreign businesses considered a danger to American national security. The designation will bar the US military and its contractors and suppliers from working with the AI company.\n\nHegseth also lashed out at Anthropic and its CEO, Dario Amodei, over the company's refusal to agree to its demands. “Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of ‘effective altruism,' they have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission—a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives,” Hegseth wrote on X.\n\nThe Department of Defense has sought to change the terms of a deal struck with Anthropic and other companies last July to eliminate restrictions on how AI can be deployed and instead permit “all lawful use” of the technology. Anthropic objected to the change, claiming that it could allow AI to be used to fully control lethal autonomous weapons or to conduct mass surveillance on US citizens.\n\nThe Pentagon does not currently use AI in these ways, and has said it has no plans to do so. However, top Trump administration officials have voiced opposition to the idea of a civilian tech company dictating military use of such an important technology.\n\nAnthropic was the first major AI lab to work with the US military, through a $200 million deal signed with the Pentagon last year. It created several custom models known as Claude Gov that have fewer restrictions than its regular ones. Google, OpenAI, and xAI signed similar deals around the same time, but Anthropic is the only AI company currently working with classified systems.\n\nAnthropic’s model is available through platforms provided by Palantir and Amazon’s cloud platform for classified military work. Claude Gov is currently largely used for run-of-the-mill tasks, like writing reports and summarizing documents, but it is also used for intelligence analysis and military planning, according to one source familiar with the situation who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nIn recent years, Silicon Valley has gone from largely avoiding defense work to increasingly embracing it and eventually becoming full-blown military contractors. The fight between Anthropic and the Pentagon is now testing the limits of that shift. This week, several hundred workers from OpenAI and Google signed an open letter supporting Anthropic and criticizing their own companies’ decisions to remove restrictions on military use of AI.\n\nIn a memo sent to OpenAI staff today, CEO Sam Altman said that the company agreed with Anthropic and also viewed mass surveillance and fully autonomous weapons as a “red line.” Altman added that the company would try to agree to a deal with the Pentagon that would let it continue working with the military, The Wall Street Journal reported."

Right now, both Amazon and Best Buy have the 2024 Roku Ultra discounted to $80, a $20 break from the usual price. It sports dual-band Wi-Fi and Ethernet for a more consistent connection, support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and the remote has a headphone port.\n\nWhile there are a ton of great Roku streaming devices to choose from, the Ultra stands out for a few reasons. Streaming in 4K requires a huge amount of bandwidth, and some wireless networks just aren't up to the task, particularly if your TV isn't near your router. A true dual-band Wi-Fi setup in the Roku Ultra helps ensure a stutter-free experience on all of your favorite streaming services. If you really hate buffering and dropped connections, there's an Ethernet port around back for a wired hookup, something most other streaming devices can't claim.\n\nAnother nice upgrade you get with your Roku Ultra kit is the remote, which includes a built-in 3.5-mm headphone jack. That's perfect if you like to sneak in a few episodes of your favorite show after everyone's gone to bed, or want to catch a movie without waking a sleeping baby. The Roku Ultra even includes a pair of earbuds you can use right out of the box, which are surprisingly good for what they are, and they include extra ear tips for getting the fit right.\n\nLike some of the other premium Roku streaming devices, the hands-free voice controls make it super easy to find what you're looking for. Rather than dig through all of your apps and services looking for a movie, you can just say the title into the remote and let Roku go and find it for you.\n\nIf you're ready to take your 4K streaming to the next level, both Best Buy and Amazon have the Roku Ultra marked down to $80. We also have a great guide that breaks down the differences between all of the available Roku streamers, and a roundup of our favorite media streamers, in case you're wondering what the Roku alternatives look like."

            "content": "A few months ago, a family came into Pasadena Cyclery in Pasadena, California, for a repair on what they thought was their teenager’s ebike. “I can’t fix that here,’ Daniel Purnell, a store manager and technician, remembers telling them. “That’s a motorcycle.” The mother got upset. She didn’t realize that what she thought was an ebike could go much faster, perhaps up to 55 miles per hour.\n\n“There’s definitely an education problem,” Purnell says. In California, bike advocates are pushing a new bill designed to clear up that confusion around what counts as an electric bicycle—and what doesn’t.\n\nIt’s a tricky balance. On one hand, backers want to allow riders access to new, faster, and more affordable non-car transportation options, ones that don’t require licenses and are emission-free. On the other hand, people, and especially kids, seem to be getting hurt. Ebike-related injuries jumped more than 1,020 percent nationwide between 2020 and 2024, according to hospital data, though it’s not clear if the stats-keepers can routinely distinguish between ebikes and their faster, “e-moto” cousins. (Moped and powered-assisted cycle injuries jumped 67 percent in that same period.)\n\n“We’re overdue to have better ebike regulation,” says California state senator Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat who sponsored the bill and represents parts of North County in San Diego. “This has been an ongoing and growing issue for years.”\n\nSenate Bill 1167 would make it illegal for retailers to label higher-powered, electric-powered vehicles as ebikes. It would clarify that ebikes have fully operative pedals and electric motors that don’t exceed 750 watts, enough to hit top speeds between 20 and 28 mph."

            "content": "OpenAI has fired an employee following an investigation into their activity on prediction market platforms including Polymarket, WIRED has learned.\n\nOpenAI CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, disclosed the termination in an internal message to employees earlier this year. The employee, she said, “used confidential OpenAI information in connection with external prediction markets (e.g. Polymarket).”\n\n“Our policies prohibit employees from using confidential OpenAI information for personal gain, including in prediction markets,” says spokesperson Kayla Wood. OpenAI has not revealed the name of the employee or the specifics of their trades.\n\nEvidence suggests that this was not an isolated event. Polymarket runs on the Polygon blockchain network, so its trading ledger is pseudonymous but traceable. According to an analysis by the financial data platform Unusual Whales, there have been clusters of activities, which the service flagged as suspicious, around OpenAI-themed events since March 2023.\n\nUnusual Whales flagged 77 positions in 60 wallet addresses as suspected insider trades, looking at the age of the account, trading history, and significance of investment, among other factors. Suspicious trades hinged on the release dates of products like Sora, GPT-5, and the ChatGPT Browser, as well as CEO Sam Altman’s employment status. In November 2023, two days after Altman was dramatically ousted from the company, a new wallet placed a significant bet that he would return, netting over $16,000 in profits. The account never placed another bet.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former tech worker who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at kateknibbs.09.\n\nThe behavior fits into patterns typical of insider trades. “The tell is the clustering. In the 40 hours before OpenAI launched its browser, 13 brand-new wallets with zero trading history appeared on the site for the first time to collectively bet $309,486 on the right outcome,” says Unusual Whales CEO Matt Saincome. “When you see that many fresh wallets making the same bet at the same time, it raises a real question about whether the secret is getting out.”\n\nPrediction markets have exploded in popularity in recent years. These platforms allow customers to buy “event contracts” on the outcomes of future events ranging from the winner of the Super Bowl to the daily price of Bitcoin to whether the United States will go to war with Iran. There are a wide array of markets tied to events in the technology sector; you can trade on what Nvidia’s quarterly earnings will be, or when Tesla will launch a new car, or which AI companies will IPO in 2026.\n\nAs the platforms have grown, so have concerns that they allow traders to profit from insider knowledge. “This prediction market world makes the Wild West look tame in comparison,” says Jeff Edelstein, a senior analyst at the betting news site InGame. “If there's a market that exists where the answer is known, somebody's going to trade on it.”\n\nEarlier this week, Kalshi announced that it had reported several suspicious insider trading cases to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the government agency overseeing these markets. In one instance, an employee of the popular YouTuber Mr. Beast was suspended for two years and fined $20,000 for making trades related to the streamer’s activities; in another, the far-right political candidate Kyle Langford was banned from the platform for making a trade on his own campaign. The company also announced a number of initiatives to prevent insider trading and market manipulation.\n\nWhile Kalshi has heavily promoted its crackdown on insider trading, Polymarket has stayed silent on the matter. The company did not return requests for comments.\n\nIn the past, major trades on technology-themed markets have sparked speculation that there are Big Tech employees profiting by using their insider knowledge to gain an edge. One notorious example is the so-called “Google whale,” a pseudonymous account on Polymarket that made over $1 million trading on Google-related events, including a market on who the most-searched person of the year would be in 2025. (It was the singer D4vd, who is best known for his connection to an ongoing murder investigation after a young fan’s remains were found in a vehicle registered to him.)"

A looming Paramount Skydance merger with Warner Bros. Discovery would expand their empire even further.\n\nNow that Netflix has backed out of its bid to acquire WBD, the Ellisons stand to gain an entirely new trove of significant intellectual property, from DC Comics to Harry Potter. According to Reuters, Warner Bros. agreed to be acquired by Paramount Skydance in a $110 billion deal signed Friday, with Paramount Skydance agreeing to pay a $7 billion termination fee if federal regulators don’t approve the merger.\n\nParamount’s merger with Skydance has already brought about mass layoffs, including at CBS News, where Free Press founder Bari Weiss is leading a cultural overhaul as editor in chief. In January, Oracle became a partial owner of TikTok, giving the Ellisons even more cultural currency.\n\nHere’s everything the family would control if the WBD deal goes through.\n\nCBS and CBS News\n\nBesides its news division, which includes 60 Minutes, CBS is also home to hits like Tracker and Matlock, along with reality stalwarts Survivor and Big Brother.\n\nHBO and HBO Max\n\nAmong the most Emmy-winningest networks to exist, HBO’s library includes classics like Game of Thrones, The Wire, and Veep, as well as newer hits like The Pitt, The Gilded Age, and Thrones spin-off A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. (Outside of Canada, HBO Max is also a key distributor of the hockey smut drama Heated Rivalry.)\n\nCNN\n\nWhile CNN’s ratings dipped last year, it remains a news juggernaut and a top 5 cable network, featuring household names like John King, Kaitlan Collins, and Anderson Cooper (who recently announced he will be leaving 60 Minutes at the end of the current season).\n\nDC Comics\n\nThe merger would put Paramount Skydance in control of storied comic book franchises like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nThe wizarding world of Harry Potter, including all eight fantasy films and the upcoming HBO television series slated to premiere in 2027 would also be under the Ellisons’ purview.\n\nTikTok\n\nAs of a deal finalized in January, Oracle now holds a 15 percent stake in TikTok’s US operations.\n\nStar Trek\n\nAll 13 Star Trek movies and television shows are owned by Paramount Skydance. At a press event last year, Dana Goldberg, cochair of Paramount Pictures and chair of Paramount Television, said the franchise would be a “priority across the company.”\n\nWarner Bros. Studios\n\nHome to blockbusters like Barbie, The Dark Knight, and more recently, One Battle After Another and Sinners.\n\nComedy Central\n\nSouth Park announced a five-year, $1.5 billion deal with Paramount last July, just prior to the merger with Skydance. The show has since skewered Donald Trump and those in his administration regularly.\n\nAvatar Studios\n\nIn December, Paramount+ announced it would be the exclusive streamer of Avatar Studios content, including animated film The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender and series Avatar: Seven Havens.\n\nA Bunch of Cable Channels and Networks\n\nThe Food Network, HGTV, Discovery, TLC, OWN, Adult Swim, Showtime, TNT, and TBS are all part of WBD.\n\nOther Key Franchises\n\nOther notable titles that are or would be controlled by the Ellisons, pending the WBD takeover, include: The Lord of the Rings franchise, the Mission Impossible franchise, and the distribution rights to Dune: Part Three.\n\n2/27/26, 2:34 PM EDT: WIRED updated details about Paramount Skydance's deal with Warner Bros.

            "content": "Before last week the name Alap Shah didn’t ring a bell for many people. The 45-year-old financial analyst and tech entrepreneur had spent the past two decades working in relative obscurity. Then last weekend he coauthored a blog with the research firm Citrini titled “The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis.” It was a “thought exercise” about the impacts of artificial intelligence, and it predicted that in June of that year, AI would jack up unemployment past 10 percent and force the Dow down, down, down. Writing in a confident, Nostradamic tone—as if auditioning for starring roles in the next Michael Lewis book—the authors painted a picture of a flywheel in reverse: AI agents take jobs from workers, people spend less, and struggling corporations conduct layoffs on top of layoffs.\n\nThere wasn’t much in it that hadn’t been previously heard, or speculated about. Tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have already estimated that half the entry level white collar jobs will soon be gone, and earlier this year, Anthropic’s release of new agentic tools spurred a Wall Street selloff. Nonetheless the report hit with the force of the blizzard blowing through lower Manhattan. When the closing chimes sounded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow was down 800 points. The name Alap Shah was now ringing bells.\n\nThe achievement is less impressive than it seems. Wall Street, like the rest of us, is in a persistent state of anxiety about AI, and it doesn’t take much to trigger a mini-panic. Financial markets don’t necessarily map to reality, but the jitters reflect a wider disquiet. The AI future is in a William Gibson zone—it’s here, but unevenly distributed—and the news from those already living in the agent-packed, AI code-writing universe is both exciting and unsettling. Emphasis on unsettling.\n\nNo one—no one!—knows exactly how AI will impact the economy, but clearly it will be significant. Right now stocks are soaring, so it seems to make sense to keep the party going. But then along comes the latest doom manifesto, or a paper indicating that a traditional business sector might be threatened by AI, and suddenly money managers are reminded that the biggest issue of our time is totally unresolved. Case in point: earlier this month, a tiny company (valuation under $6 million) that had previously sold karaoke machines pivoted to AI-powered shipping logistics and put out a report saying that it had discovered some efficiencies in loading semi-trucks. That was enough to erase billions of dollars from the share prices of several major logistics companies, none of which had karaoke experience.\n\nAfter it did its job on Wall Street, the Citrini report came under considerable fire. Critics climbed over each other to proclaim its flimsiness. For one thing, they pointed out, AI has had very little discernable impact on the economy so far. Others cited the long history of resilience after technological upheavals. A mocking response by the respected trading firm Citadel Securities read, “For AI to produce a sustained negative demand shock, the economy must see a material acceleration in adoption, experience near-total labor substitution, no fiscal response, negligible investment absorption, and unconstrained scaling of compute.”\n\nThe most withering critiques disputed the report’s contention that much of the economy involves non-productive “rent-seeking” by middlemen and market makers, taking advantage of the laziness of the general population. When everyone has a few dozen AI agents working on their behalf, writes Shah, consumers will be able to effortlessly find the best goods for the best prices. Apps will be rendered unnecessary—just type what you want into the LLM and an army of agents will do everything for you. The “poster child” for this phenomenon, Shah says, is DoorDash. Instead of being limited to the restaurants on the app, consumers will send out AI agents to find their ideal meal options, contracting directly with restaurants and delivery people—no apps needed. Zero friction! The DoorDashes of the world are avocado toast!"

            "content": "Sick of your smart ring's battery not holding up? Ultrahuman's new $479 Ring Pro smart ring, unveiled on Friday, offers up to 15 days of battery life on a single charge. The Ring Pro joins the company's $349 Ring Air, which boosts health tracking, thanks to longer battery life, increased data storage, improved speed and accuracy and a new heart-rate sensing architecture. The ring works in conjunction with the latest Pro charging case.\n\nUltrahuman also launched its Jade AI, which can act as an agent based on analysis of current and historical health data. Jade can synthesize data from across the company's products and is compatible with its Rings.\n\n\"With industry-leading hardware paired with Jade biointelligence AI, users can now take real-time actionable interventions towards their health than ever before,\" said Mohit Kumar, CEO of Ultrahuman.\n\nNo US sales\n\nThat hardware isn't available in the US, though, thanks to the ongoing ban on Ultrahuman's Rings sales here, stemming from a patent dispute with its competitor, Oura Ring. It's available for preorder now everywhere else and is slated to ship in March. Jade's available globally.\n\nUltrahuman says the Ring Pro boosts battery life to about 15 days in Chill mode -- up to 12 days in Turbo -- compared to a maximum of six days for the Air. The Pro charger's battery stores enough for another 45 days, which you top off with Qi-compatible wireless charging. In addition, the case incorporates locator technology via the app and a speaker, as well as usability features such as haptic notifications and a power LED.\n\nThe ring can also retain up to 250 days of data versus less than a week for the cheaper model. Ultrahuman redesigned the heart-rate sensor for better signal quality. An upgraded processor improves the accuracy of the local machine learning and overall speed.\n\nIt's offered in gold, silver, black and titanium finishes, with available sizes ranging from 5 to 14.\n\nJade's Deep Research Mode is the cross-ecosystem analysis feature, which aggregates data from Ring and Blood Vision and the company's subscription services, Home and M1 CGM, to provide historical trends, offer current recommendations and flag potential issues, as well as trigger activities such as A-fib detection. Ultrahuman plans to expand its capabilities to include health-adjacent activities, such as ordering food.\n\nSome new apps are also available for the company's PowerPlug add-on platform, including capabilities such as tracking GLP-1 effects, snoring and respiratory analysis and migraine management tools."

            "content": "Strength\n\nReading glasses typically range from +0.25 to +2.50 diopters (the unit of measurement for eye prescriptions), though the average starting strength is usually around +0.75. In rare cases, reading glass strength can go up to +4.00.\n\n“Tips for buying reading glasses online are similar to buying ready-made reading glasses at the drugstore: It’s a convenient option but it’s not a good idea for everyone,” says Dr. Ravi Goel, clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. “If you have different prescription needs in each eye, astigmatism, high-power or more complex prescription needs, you should see an eye care professional for updated prescription eyewear.”\n\nReed seconds this, adding, “The wrong prescription can lead to headaches, eye strain or even nausea. If you do choose to buy online, we recommend selecting a lower power when deciding between two strengths, as this is generally a safer choice, and overly strong lenses tend to cause more discomfort than those that are slightly weaker.”\n\nGoel notes that everyone older than 40 should see an ophthalmologist for a medical eye exam because that is the age when presbyopia and potentially blinding eye diseases usually begin developing. Plus, not all eye diseases begin with noticeable symptoms.\n\nType of reading glasses\n\n“There are four main types of reading glasses: single vision, bifocal, trifocal and progressive,” says Goel, defining them as:\n\nSingle-vision reading lenses are typically designed to correct just for near vision.\n\nare typically designed to correct just for near vision. Bifocal lenses have a correction for reading on the bottom half of the lens and another for distance on the top.\n\nhave a correction for reading on the bottom half of the lens and another for distance on the top. Trifocal lenses have three sections: distance, intermediate and near vision. Reed says these can be particularly helpful for people over 50 experiencing reduced depth of focus.\n\nhave three sections: distance, intermediate and near vision. Reed says these can be particularly helpful for people over 50 experiencing reduced depth of focus. Progressive lenses have a smooth transition between distance and near focal areas without visible dividing lines. “They deliver a more natural look and a smoother transition between different viewing distances,” adds Reed.\n\n“When generic OTC readers are no longer enough, prescription reading glasses -- also called single-vision readers -- are a great next step. These are custom-made by an eye doctor to correct for astigmatism, unequal prescriptions or other specific vision needs,” says Reed. “For those who need multiple levels of vision correction, there are multifocal lenses.”\n\nThe best lens material\n\n“This depends on lifestyle,” Goel says. “For example, if you spend a lot of time outdoors, you might prefer polycarbonate, which is lightweight and doesn’t break easily. There are also various lens coatings available for convenience (i.e., anti-reflective coatings) but are not required.”\n\nGoel notes that the American Academy of Ophthalmology doesn't recommend blue light-blocking coatings or lenses because “there is no scientific evidence to suggest blue light-blocking glasses help reduce eye strain.” Instead, take breaks from near-work activity and use eye drops if necessary. If you continue to experience symptoms, see an ophthalmologist.\n\nAccording to Reed, most people choose among the following three lens materials for reading glasses:\n\nCR-39 plastic lenses: Affordable, lightweight and provide good optical clarity, making them a popular choice for basic reading glasses.\n\nAffordable, lightweight and provide good optical clarity, making them a popular choice for basic reading glasses. Polycarbonate lenses : Lighter and significantly more impact-resistant than CR-39 plastic, making them a safer option for people who tend to drop their glasses or want something more durable.\n\n: Lighter and significantly more impact-resistant than CR-39 plastic, making them a safer option for people who tend to drop their glasses or want something more durable. High-index plastic lenses: Thinner and lighter than other materials and are a good choice for people who need a stronger prescription but want to avoid thick, heavy lenses.\n\n“For most reading glasses, especially for occasional or indoor use, CR-39 plastic works well,” says Reed. “If you need extra durability or prefer thinner, lighter lenses, polycarbonate or high-index materials may be a better fit. Your doctor of optometry can help recommend the best lens material based on your specific needs.”\n\nReed adds that not all lens materials and coatings are created equal. That’s why it’s important to check with your eye doctor to ensure the reading glasses you choose are the right fit for you.\n\nStyle\n\nOne of the most fun parts of buying glasses is finding a frame that speaks to your personal style and fits with your face shape. When shopping for glasses online, pay attention to the material, color and width.\n\nPrice\n\nReading glasses can range from affordable to expensive. For instance, if you want a designer pair of reading glasses, be prepared to spend over $100. If you tend to lose your reading glasses, you may want to buy more inexpensive pairs to keep multiple on hand.\n\n“Price of eyeglasses is not necessarily reflective of quality; the real question is if someone finds the ready-made reading glasses helpful or if they need custom reading glasses to meet their vision needs,” explains Goel.\n\n“In general, spending more on frames doesn’t mean you’ll end up with better-quality eyeglasses. You don’t need designer frames to have a good set of glasses. For prescription lenses, such as bifocal, trifocal or progressive lenses, an optician will help you select good lenses that best meet your vision needs. A personalized evaluation of vision needs is a value-add that is often missed by online sellers.”\n\nAdditional coatings\n\nYou can get reading glasses with lenses treated with blue light, anti-glare and polarization coatings. But note that you'll likely have to pay extra for these.\n\nShipping and returns\n\nIf you buy your reading glasses online, you likely won’t get to try them on before you buy. As a result, ensure the company has a return and exchange policy you can work with. As for shipping, if you need your reading glasses ASAP, you’re better off going with a company that offers express or overnight shipping."

            "content": "Two of the largest internet providers in the US are set to merge, as the FCC announced its approval of Charter’s $34.5 billion acquisition of Cox Communications Friday afternoon.\n\nCharter, which sells phone, internet and TV services under the Spectrum brand, agreed to buy Cox in May 2025. The deal will create the largest internet provider in the country, with Cox’s 6.5 million customers joining Charter’s 31 million.\n\nWhile internet monopolies are a major problem in the US -- over a third of Americans only have access to one or no internet provider -- this acquisition won’t necessarily make that problem worse. That’s because Charter and Cox have very little overlap in the areas where they operate.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\n“No consumer is going to lose a competitive offering they currently have,” Blair Levin, a former FCC chief of staff and a telecom industry analyst at New Street Research, tells CNET. “There's no reduction of competition in any relevant geographical product market.”\n\nThe FCC’s announcement doesn’t specify when Cox customers will transfer to Spectrum, but it could be a welcome change for many. Cox received a score of 68/100 in the most recent American Customer Satisfaction Index survey, while Spectrum earned a 71/100.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nHowever, a CNET analysis of internet plans found Spectrum’s price hikes to be steeper, with Spectrum increasing prices by an average of $37 monthly after one or two years, depending on the location. Cox’s plans increased by $28 per month, but only after two years.\n\nSome critics argued that the FCC should have done more to help consumers before granting Charter approval.\n\n“The FCC approved the largest cable merger in nearly a decade and did not require Charter to do anything it wasn’t already planning to do,” John Bergmayer, legal director at the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said in a statement. “Consumers, as always, will bear the costs of reduced competition.”\n\nAs part of the approval process, Charter agreed to move all of Cox’s offshore jobs to America within 18 months. According to a post on its website, Charter says it has a 100% US-based workforce as of Dec. 31, 2025."

            "content": "Key takeaways:\n\nAll five watches tracked steps and distance accurately, but heart rate accuracy varied.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 11 was the most accurate heart rate monitor during workouts.\n\nThe Garmin Venu 4's heart rate tracking has more data, ideal for serious training analysis.\n\nIf steps and distance accuracy are your priorities, you don't need an expensive smartwatch.\n\nTraining for a marathon definitely wasn't in the cards when I began this project. Testing five smartwatches for accuracy looked to me more like a few leisurely jogs, rocking what looked like the entire smartwatch section of Best Buy stacked on my wrists. I've tested dozens of smartwatches over the years, but never five at once, and never under the level of scrutiny this test demanded. Mile after mile, I pushed my heart rate (and my body) well beyond my comfort zone with the finish line in focus.\n\nFitness trackers have come a long way since the early Fitbit days of step counting, and in today's wearable landscape, a reliable step counter isn't enough. Smartwatches, rings, fitness bands and even earbuds compete for real estate on your body to monitor everything from heart rate to temperature. To edge out the competition, they must be accurate enough to catch subtle changes in your vitals and turn that data into results.\n\nI tested five models (one at a time), ranging from $80 to $550, to determine which was most accurate for steps, distance and heart rate. Heart rate, in particular, is the most critical (and the hardest to get right) since so many other metrics depend on it.\n\nFrom left to right: Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, Google Pixel Watch 4, Amazfit Bip 6, Garmin Venu 4 and Apple Watch Series 11, alongside the Polar H10 chest strap and tally counter used in our accuracy tests. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nIt's not like I was starting from scratch. I'd already reviewed the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, Google Pixel Watch 4, Garmin Venu 4, Apple Watch Series 11 and Amazfit Bip 6, and each had proven itself in its category. There's a reason they landed on our best lists. But glancing at a workout summary and dissecting raw data are entirely different beasts.\n\nAfter two months and more than 30 miles of testing, I'm finally ready to share the results (and give my legs a rest). The biggest takeaway: All five watches performed well in real-world testing. None deviated by more than a few percentage points from the control when measuring steps and distance.\n\nHeart rate accuracy proved to be the biggest differentiator. On the surface, the watches looked similar: average and maximum heart rates were often only a few beats apart. But the gaps became clear in the second-by-second data. While most stayed within 8% of our control, the Apple Watch Series 11 remained within 1% of the Polar H10 chest strap, which served as our control, earning it the CNET Labs Award for most accurate heart rate tracking.\n\nThe Garmin Venu 4 came in second, recording heart rate every second compared to every 5 seconds on the Apple Watch. For most people, that level of granularity is overkill, but for serious athletes who depend on second-by-second feedback, it could be the deciding factor.\n\nHeart rate: electrodes vs. optical sensors\n\nHeart rate is one of the most important vitals your smartwatch tracks because it feeds into so many other metrics, like calories burned, intensity, heart rate variability (a measure of the variation in time between heartbeats), and VO2 max (the maximum amount of oxygen your body uses during exercise). As a casual fitness enthusiast, I regularly use live heart rate data from my watch to make runs and strength training workouts more intense.\n\nMost smartwatches, including the five we tested, take background heart rate readings at intervals throughout the day. However, they increase sampling frequency during exercise. Even a short workout can generate hundreds more data points than passive tracking alone.\n\nWe used the Polar H10 chest strap as our control during the heart rate tests. Giselle Castro-Sloboda/CNET\n\nCNET's heart rate test\n\nTo capture a broad range of heart rate data, I tested each watch individually across three separate 1-mile runs on a flat track. I held a moderate intensity for the first half of the run (roughly Zones 3 to 4), then went all out for the second half, pushing myself as close to my peak (Zone 5) as possible.\n\nI cleaned the sensors and secured each watch snugly (about one to two fingers below the wrist bone) before each run. Each watch was tested one at a time alongside a Polar H10 chest strap, CNET's top-rated consumer heart rate monitor. Unlike wrist-based optical sensors, which detect changes in blood flow using light, chest straps like Polar's use electrodes to directly measure the heart's electrical signals. Because of this method and proximity to the heart, chest straps are widely considered more precise than wrist-based devices. Matching that level of precision isn't realistic for a watch, but they're coming close.\n\nDuring testing, I noticed a consistent pattern: most watches lagged behind the chest strap during the first minute of a run, when heart rate rose rapidly from rest. Once I reached cruising altitude (Zones 3 and 4), the readings aligned more closely. But when I pushed into Zone 5, differences reappeared, with some watches struggling to keep up during spikes above 160 beats per minute. The Bip 6, for example, never registered my peak heart rate. That lag helps explain why workout summaries often look similar. Average and peak heart rate were just a few beats away from the chest strap, while the second-by-second analysis revealed significantly wider gaps.\n\nBecause raw, second-by-second heart rate data isn't easily accessible in most apps and can include thousands of data points, I teamed up with CNET Senior Lab Engineer Gianmarco Chumbe to interpret and map the results. The graph above shows just how close the Apple Watch Series 11 was to the Polar chest strap, with an error rate of less than 1% (an average of 1.4 bpm for the three tests). In our results, it tracked almost side-by-side throughout the run, even at the outer edges of the graph where the other watches struggled. This consistency earned it our Labs Award for most accurate heart rate tracking. There is, however, an important nuance.\n\nThe Apple Watch data we extracted (via the HealthFit app pulling from Apple Health) sampled heart rate roughly every five seconds. By comparison, the Polar chest strap and Garmin Venu 4 recorded data nearly every second. Of the data points we could compare, the Apple Watch was closest to the chest strap, but it had fewer data points. The Venu 4 matched the chest strap's sampling frequency, but with a slightly higher error rate of 3.89% (5.5 bpm). Those extra seconds of data could help guide training decisions and, over time, mean the difference between finishing strong and setting a new personal record.\n\nAll of the watches posted heart rate error rates below 8%, which is impressive -- especially at higher-intensity levels. It's worth noting these were short workouts (8-9 minutes per run). Because the Google Pixel Watch (5.6% error rate) and Samsung Galaxy Watch (6.6%) tended to catch up to the chest strap over time, longer runs would likely narrow some of those gaps. The Amazfit posted a similar overall error rate (7%), but struggled to capture the highest heart rate spikes. That limitation makes it less ideal for prioritizing heart rate precision for intense workouts.\n\nAfter over 30 miles of testing, I'm more convinced than ever that heart rate accuracy really does impact training. Over six weeks, my VO2 max climbed from 41.3 to 45.8, according to Apple Health. I haven't reached that level since before my third pregnancy three years ago. Without the watches and chest strap as a guide, I might not have recognized what \"pushing myself\" actually felt like in the moment.\n\nCNET distance test\n\nMeasuring distance proved significantly easier, both physically and technically. Distance accuracy matters because it also feeds into other metrics, such as pace, calories burned and training load (the duration and intensity of exercise over a specific period of time).\n\nThe most reliable way to test distance was on a route with precise measurements and minimal elevation change. (Credit goes to Gianmarco for suggesting a track test.) Most high school and college tracks are built to official specifications: 400 meters per lap. I found an old college track near my house that had been paved over, but remained within regulation length. I even broke out a measuring wheel to be sure. I ran every single test on this track, reliving high school mile day 30 times over, but with more knee pain.\n\nThis is the track as shown in the Polar H10 chest strap app (summary view, not raw data). Vanessa Hand Orellana/Polar/CNET\n\nWhile GPS is a major factor in outdoor tracking, distance is also calculated using accelerometer and motion sensor data. To control for variables, I put the watch's paired phone on airplane mode before each run to prevent it from using GPS. I photographed each watch display after every lap (400m increments) to capture a data point, repeating the process four times (1,600m is a little more than 1 mile).\n\nAll five watches were within a tenth of the actual distance, which is an impressively tight spread. The Apple Watch again led the pack, measuring my runs at 0.99 miles for all three tests. The runner-up was the Garmin Venu 4, which averaged 0.96 miles per test (only 0.03 miles behind the Apple Watch).\n\nAccurate distance tracking isn't reserved for premium price tags. The $80 Amazfit Bip 6 averaged 0.95 miles per test, proving it is more than capable for casual walkers or joggers looking to log miles.\n\nCNET's step test\n\nOnce considered the holy grail of fitness tracking, step count has slid down the metric hierarchy as more advanced health markers have taken center stage. And while the 10,000-step goal is somewhat arbitrary, it set a target and got people moving.\n\nToday, we know it's less important to hit a specific step count and more about walking and your progress over time. Steps remain an accessible starting point for many people, and accuracy is important. \"Extra credit\" from a faulty tracker can lull people into a false sense of accomplishment. And if a device can't nail the basics, it raises questions about the rest of its metrics.\n\nWhile pedometers were once considered the gold standard in this category, a $10 model today is likely less precise than the smartwatches on this list. Traditional pedometers use a simple mechanical switch triggered by hip movement, while most modern smartwatches use accelerometers and motion sensors to detect and measure movement in multiple directions.\n\nThis (photos) is how I'd keep tabs of the steps out in the field: smartwatch on the left and clicker (tally counter) in my right hand. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nTo test accuracy, I went old-school and counted every single step myself with a manual tally counter (like what you use for baseball). I also used StepsApp, a pedometer app on my phone, as a backup. I started with 1,000 steps for each watch on a flat path. I didn't use the track, but didn't follow the exact same route for every test, which may introduce minor variance.\n\nThe results were impressively tight; all within about 10 steps of the clicker. The Galaxy Watch 8's results (18 steps off) were the exception, but I suspected it might be a fluke. So I re-tested and raised the stakes; this time, walking 2,500 steps with each watch. The results were nearly identical. None deviated by more than 11 steps, or less than half of a percentage point.\n\nThe differences were negligible, so all of the watches were winners in this category, proving that you don't have to splurge for accuracy. That Amazfit Bip 6 is looking pretty fantastic right now.\n\nTwists, turns and variables to consider when tracking workouts\n\nEven with the best intentions, 30 miles of testing and a data scientist in my corner, there is no way to eliminate every variable in real-world conditions. These results aren't gospel. They're rigorous, repeated and carefully averaged, but they're still human, and your mileage may vary (pun intended).\n\nIt took more than 30 miles of testing before I felt comfortable putting results down on paper because I kept encountering variables, especially for heart rate.\n\nThe testing order was significant. The first watch in any session was always at a disadvantage because my heart rate started lower and spiked more dramatically. By the second and third runs -- even with deliberate rest periods to bring my heart rate back down -- the jump wasn't as sharp. Your body doesn't fully reset that quickly.\n\nTo mitigate this, I rotated the starting watch for each session. I limited each outing to three runs (three miles total), making sure that every device had a chance to be tested first, middle and last. Our Labs data and results (on the charts in the story) are averages of the error rates across these three tests.\n\nFit and sensor interference were other issues. My jacket sleeve occasionally moved the watch; warmer days meant more sweat by mile three, which can interfere with optical readings, and then there was the time I almost cut off my circulation from wearing the Galaxy Watch too tightly.\n\nThe data extraction nightmare\n\nThis is just a snapshot of the layers of folders and raw data we had to comb through to compare heart rate. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nThen came the data. Polar's raw heart rate data can be downloaded as a .CSV file (spreadsheet) ready for analysis.\n\nGarmin's is almost as easy, as long as you have a data analyst and Reddit thread on hand. It can export workout-specific heart rate data as a .TCX file, which was foreign to me. Gianmarco wrote custom code, based on info he found on Reddit, to extract and convert the data into a format that matched Polar's output. Amazfit required a similar conversion process.\n\nApple, Google and Samsung made us work for it. All three require exporting your entire health archive (and I mean everything, not just workouts or heart rate). For me, this meant downloading more than a decade of health data. Once extracted, the compressed file opens into a maze of nested folders with cryptic labels. The best strategy is to sort by date and hope that one of the files mentions heart rate.\n\nFor Google, I got lucky and found the right file after what felt like hours of searching. For Apple, several third-party apps are available that can do the sorting for you. I downloaded the $6 HealthFit app, which filters and extracts data directly from the Health app. However, the sampling frequency wasn't as dense as the Polar strap, leaving fewer data points for comparison. It's hard to say whether it would've been any different if I'd been able to extract it directly from the Health app.\n\nWith Samsung, the only workable option was to use the Strava app as a middleman. I started workouts in the Strava watch app and exporting the data to the desktop version. All of this took two people many hours across multiple days to figure out. Accessing your own health data shouldn't be this hard.\n\nThe paved college track at sunset where I completed all distance and heart rate testing. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nSmartwatch accuracy bottom line\n\nIf heart rate accuracy is your top priority, the $400 Apple Watch Series 11 is what to buy. It was the all-around winner, consistently strong across every category and the most precise for heart rate, staying within 1% of the chest strap during runs.\n\nBut the bigger takeaway after 30 miles of testing is that you can't go wrong with any of these watches; it just depends on what you value most.\n\nThe $550 Garmin Venu 4 may be better suited for data nerds and serious athletes. It's Gianmarco's pick: \"The combination of high fidelity and clean export access makes it especially appealing for users like me, who want full visibility into their training data.\"\n\nIt's also the best option for Android phone owners wanting elite-level heart rate tracking.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 8 (both $350) are reliable for steps, distance and overall heart rate trends. You may not get the same second-by-second precision during intervals, but for everyday workouts, they're more than capable. And the Amazfit Bip 6 is the reminder that accurate distance tracking doesn't have to be expensive. For beginners looking to build a baseline without a major investment, it's better than its $80 price suggests."

            "content": "President Donald Trump on Friday called for US federal agencies to stop using Anthropic's Claude AI after the company refused to grant the Department of Defense permission to use it for mass domestic surveillance or for fully autonomous weapons systems.\n\nThe president posted on the Truth Social platform, which he owns, that he is ordering the federal government to \"IMMEDIATELY CEASE\" use of Anthropic's tools, saying there would be a six-month phaseout for agencies like the Department of Defense. He also decried Anthropic as a \"RADICAL LEFT, WOKE COMPANY.\" The post signaled the latest step in a showdown that escalated significantly this week between Anthropic and the federal government.\n\nClaude is widely used across the Pentagon, including in classified systems, but the Trump administration has sought to use the technology for \"any lawful purpose.\" Anthropic has insisted in its existing contract that the technology not be used for mass surveillance of Americans or in autonomous offensive weapons systems without human input.\n\nEarlier this week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei that he would invoke seldom-used powers to either force Anthropic to let the Pentagon use Claude for any lawful purpose or label the company a supply chain risk -- jeopardizing its use by the government or defense contractors. Hegseth gave Anthropic a Friday deadline to comply.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a statement that the company, which was founded with a stated focus on AI safety, \"cannot in good conscience accede to [the Pentagon's] request\" that it remove contract provisions stating Claude cannot be used in fully autonomous weapons systems or for domestic surveillance.\n\n\n\nWorries about AI and mass surveillance\n\nAmodei raised concerns that the law has not caught up with the potential for mass surveillance of Americans. The government can already buy information like Americans' browsing history and records of individual movements without a warrant, but artificial intelligence raises the stakes. \"Powerful AI makes it possible to assemble this scattered, individually innocuous data into a comprehensive picture of any person's life -- automatically and at massive scale,\" he wrote.\n\nMichael Pastor, dean for technology law programs at New York Law School, said in an email that it's typical in contract law for those involved to seek clarity on terms. \"Anthropic is right to press hard on what 'for lawful purposes' means,\" he said. \"If the Pentagon is unwilling to clarify whether it would use Anthropic's technology for mass domestic surveillance, that raises flags Anthropic seems justified in waving.\"\n\nAnthropic's Claude is reportedly the most widely used AI system by the US military. Alternatives could include tools from OpenAI, Google or Elon Musk's xAI.\n\nIn an internal memo reported by The Wall Street Journal Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly told employees that the company has the same red lines as Anthropic -- no mass domestic surveillance or autonomous offensive weapons. Altman said he believed those guardrails could be managed through technical requirements, such as requiring models to be deployed in the cloud. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\n\nEmployees of Google and OpenAI circulated a petition calling for their companies to stand with Anthropic in refusing to allow the use of AI models for domestic mass surveillance or fully autonomous lethal weapons systems. The petition said the Pentagon is \"trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in. That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.\"\n\nJust as in consumer technology, artificial intelligence systems have seen widespread adoption in government and military cases. These tools have seen their capabilities grow significantly just in the past few years, and that pace of change has not slowed. Regulation and oversight of AI haven't kept up. AI has magnified the potential harms of corporate or government surveillance by making it easier and cheaper.\n\nPastor said this dispute could have significant ramifications for what leverage governments and tech companies have against each other when their views on the appropriate use of technology clash. \"Anthropic may feel that yielding here opens a Pandora's box of uses for which Claude could be deployed,\" he said."
