            "content": "SOME at Blackburn were stunned that none of the Premier League’s northern clubs made a move for Adam Wharton two years ago.\n\nWharton, who turned 22 only this month, has had a stunning first two years in the top flight.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Blackburn-born midfielder faces uncertainty as he returns closer to home with Crystal Palace this weekend.\n\nNot long ago, it was easy to imagine a manager and a midfielder from Palace at Sunday’s opponents, Manchester United, next season.\n\nNow it would feel a backward step if United were to opt for the outgoing Oliver Glasner, while Wharton has flagged amid Palace’s spiralling form.\n\n\n\nUnited will go all-out for a major midfield signing in the summer, with a preference for a Premier League target. Two midfield recruits are likely, with European football likely to be back on the agenda for United next season.\n\nWharton, a northerner, an England international and so impressive in Palace’s victories over United in recent seasons, ticks most of the boxes.\n\nHe also has aspirations to play in the Champions League. United are on course to have that anthem ringing around Old Trafford again next season.\n\nThose who watched him regularly at Blackburn are adamant that Wharton would be “perfect” for United.\n\n\n\nYet now that Kobbie Mainoo is back in the United fold and, in the words of Thomas Tuchel, back in the picture for England, there is a danger that Wharton could fall behind.\n\nSUN VEGAS WELCOME OFFER: GET £50 BONUS WHEN YOU JOIN\n\nElliot Anderson, Declan Rice and Jordan Henderson are midfield certainties for Tuchel’s World Cup squad but he could struggle to justify accommodating Mainoo and Wharton.\n\nMainoo, on a six-game starting run having gone eight months without a Premier League start under Ruben Amorim, now has the momentum and the cachet of starting in a European Championship final.\n\nWharton is still destined for a big move, probably this summer. Barcelona and Real Madrid are also admirers and Wharton’s fleet-footed playing style would be well suited to La Liga.\n\nBut he is not necessarily the must-have for United that he once was.\n\n\n\nNot for the first time, Wharton played United off the park in the first half at Selhurst Park in November, with his piercing pass leading to Leny Yoro conceding a penalty on Jean-Philippe Mateta.\n\nTicket + hotel room for Man Utd games from £175 GET tickets to see Man Utd at Old Trafford with our hand-picked deals. The packages, offered by Sports Breaks, include an official match ticket and an overnight stay in a hand-picked hotel. Man United Home Games 1 Mar: v Crystal Palace – SOLD OUT\n\nv Crystal Palace – SOLD OUT 14 Mar: v Aston Villa – From £175pp\n\nv Aston Villa – From £175pp 11 Apr: v Leeds United – From £195pp\n\nv Leeds United – From £195pp 25 Apr: v Brentford – From £175pp\n\nv Brentford – From £175pp 2 May: v Liverpool – SOLD OUT\n\nv Liverpool – SOLD OUT 17 May: v Nottingham Forest – From £175pp *If you click on a link in this article, we will earn affiliate revenue.\n\nBut Wharton tired quickly after half-time, was substituted in the 78th minute and United recovered to win 2-1.\n\nWith Palace playing in Europe this season, it is a litmus test of just how ready Wharton is for a demanding schedule at one of England’s elite clubs.\n\nWharton has started in 24 of Palace’s 27 Premier League games and completed 90 minutes 14 times, impressive durability for such a slight midfielder.\n\nBut he has been rotated regularly in the Europa League and United need an imposing presence in their midfield, particularly with Casemiro’s contract scheduled for the shredder in June.\n\n\n\nAnderson is a more robust and rounded option, though Nottingham Forest would demand a higher fee than Palace could command for Wharton.\n\n\n\nUnited do not have a successful hit-rate with buys from Palace. Wilfried Zaha made a meagre four appearances for the club and Aaron Wan-Bissaka was not a forward-thinking enough right back during his five years in Manchester.\n\nThose two grew up in south London, though, whereas a Lancastrian homecoming would help Wharton settle.\n\nPalace chairman Steve Parish drove a hard bargain with Wan-Bissaka, eventually sold for £45million rising to £50m in 2019.\n\nParish was a neighbour of then-United executive vice chairman Ed Woodward, but United sources said Palace “dug their heels in” for a defender who had made only 46 appearances.\n\n\n\nAs recently as last summer, Parish led former Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy down the garden path over Eberechi Eze.\n\nAlthough Arsenal formally moved for Eze after injury to Kai Havertz in late August, Parish had quietly negotiated with the Gunners as he did not want to sell to Spurs.\n\nLevy’s opening offer for Eze earlier in the summer was a mischievous £40m when Palace were always seeking £60m. United would be well-advised not to lowball Parish if they do move for Wharton.\n\nWharton is under contract at Selhurst until 2029 but talk of a renewal with a gentleman’s agreement that he could leave this summer has gone quiet.\n\nIt is probable that he will follow Glasner out of the door. Wharton has played all but three of his games for Palace under Glasner, the man responsible for transforming Wharton from Championship talent to England international within three months in 2024.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nUnited, Manchester City and Liverpool could all be in the market for a midfielder this summer and are all tracking Wharton, a worthy addition to any of those squads.\n\nAnd Ewood Park would be a shorter commute on his days off."

Wesley Fofana is also out after his suspension earned at Burnley.\n\nStrangely enough, the way the Gunners could counter the low block is by throwing fewer players forward.\n\nThe idea behind this would be to use Chelsea’s own shape against them to lure them forwards into a higher-press shape, which would then potentially free up space for attacking options such as Bukayo Saka.\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nThere is also an argument for Ben White to be selected over Jurrien Timber, who has looked tired due to an extraordinary amount of games.\n\nWhite’s ability to overlap and hold width could be the best way to create additional space between the lines for Saka to exploit, as once again he will be at the heart of everything Arsenal do well.\n\nThe Full Arsenal on YouTube SunSport have launched a dedicated Arsenal channel on YouTube! The Full Arsenal Podcast is your home for everything about the Gunners. From match reactions and tactical breakdowns to transfer talk, match previews, tactical analysis and honest fan debate… The Full Arsenal covers it all. Subscribe to The Full Arsenal here\n\nHowever, Arteta also has a selection headache over Martin Odegaard.\n\nOdegaard is the captain, but Eberechi Eze showed his class with a stunning display in last week’s north London derby, second only to Man of the Match Viktor Gyokeres.\n\nBoth provide key attributes for Arsenal, emphasising the strength in depth they have.\n\n\n\nBut it is very much a case of ‘horses for courses’. That indecision in the Arsenal camp will be playing on Chelsea’s mind in their pre-match prep.\n\nOdegaard, when he plays, is the leader of the Arsenal press, and with Chelsea possessing a number of press-resistant players, that will put pressure on the visitors in dangerous areas.\n\nThe Chelsea Blueprint on YouTube Calling all Chelsea fans - we have a brand new YouTube channel! The Sun’s Chelsea YouTube channel will be your go-to destination for the latest news, transfer updates, match previews, post-match analysis, exclusive interviews, fan reactions, and breaking stories from Stamford Bridge. Subscribe to The Chelsea Blueprint on YouTube now\n\nIf Arsenal get their press right, they will win the ball back with Chelsea off-balance, which will free up the Gunners’ firepower going forward.\n\nEveryone who has watched Arsenal this season is well aware of their proficiency at set-pieces.\n\nRosenior used an interesting counter-move the last time the two teams met by placing players high up the field at corners, meaning Arsenal had to sacrifice some of their own numbers in the box to mark them.\n\n\n\nIt is a move that is becoming more popular, and it’s easy to imagine it will be the same again on Sunday.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThat being said, Arsenal are the best team in the league, possibly the world at set-pieces, so this cat-and-mouse tactic may not be used at every single corner.\n\nThe likes of Reece James or Joao Pedro may see fit to make the decision depending on the flow of the game."

The Argentine forward has a number of clubs interested in his services this summer.\n\nArsenal are among the clubs eyeing him, while Barcelona are thought to be plotting a move. Asked about a potential move, the Spanish side’s sporting director Deco has said that talks have yet to be opened.\n\nHe said: “We have not spoken to any club or player. This is not the time to do it, no matter how much we like them. We’ll talk when it’s time. It’s February. There are many players that we like. We’ll see. We have two strikers. This is not the time to make decisions.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAlvarez, 26, joined Atletico Madrid in 2024 and he has gone on to score 42 goals in 94 appearances for the Spanish side. He remains under contract with the Spanish side until the summer of 2030. It has been suggested that Atleti want to bank around £167m should they choose to sell the forward this summer.\n\nArsenal icon Ray Parlour has already spoken out on a move for Alvarez and believes that he would be an excellent replacement for Gabriel Jesus.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

We had four strikers when I played. That’s what I don’t understand. (Regardless of Jesus leaving), bring in another one anyway. That can give the other options a lift because they see the standard being set.\n\n“For me, Alvarez would be a great addition to the squad. There will always be people coming and going in the summer because it’s a big squad and they can’t keep everyone happy.

The original agreement granted United 50 per cent of any future transfer fee Marseille might receive for the forward, though recent reports suggest this could now be 40 per cent.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAs a player with homegrown status at United, Greenwood's transfer revenue was logged as pure profit under the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). To put the possible scale in context: if he were sold for £50m, United could receive £25m under the original terms, or £20m if the clause stands at 40 per cent.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, United would not keep the entire amount. Part of the deal agreed during Greenwood's 2023 loan spell at Getafe entitles the Spanish club to 20 per cent of whatever United earn from his next move. There remains uncertainty over whether that share applies to the total fee or only the profit Marseille make, but in either case it would cut into United's eventual windfall.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGreenwood's situation offers a useful comparison to another former United academy product: Alejandro Garnacho. The Argentine winger moved to Chelsea for £40m last summer after a high-profile falling-out with then-manager Ruben Amorim.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

Any income generated via the sell-on clause would be similarly accounted.\n\nThe 21-year-old signed a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge, keeping him at Chelsea until 2032, meaning any windfall may not arrive immediately.\n\nView 3 Images Man United retain a 10 per cent sell-on clause in Alejandro Garnacho's contract (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat said, his modest start in west London - just one goal in 16 Premier League appearances so far - combined with Chelsea's tendency to aggressively trade players for profit, means an early departure cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\nUnited have also encountered complex sell-on arrangements with other clubs, notably when Manchester City sold Brahim Diaz to Real Madrid in 2019. City included a carefully structured clause to deter a potential transfer to Old Trafford, with a 40 per cent sell-on clause triggered if Madrid sold Diaz to United, but only 15 per cent for any other club.\n\nBy inflating the figure for a United move, City effectively made such a deal financially prohibitive, a strategic safeguard against strengthening a direct rival.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Brahim Diaz had a clause in his contract that all but prevented Real Madrid from selling him to Manchester United (Image: Soccrates Images, Getty Images)\n\nContractual clauses have affected transfers to United in other cases too. During his time at Barcelona, Luis Suarez reportedly had provisions that prevented certain elite European clubs - including United, Real Madrid, Man City and PSG - from signing him directly.\n\nAs a result, when Suarez left Barcelona in 2020, several high-profile routes were blocked. He ultimately joined Atletico Madrid, going on to lead them to the La Liga title in his debut season at the Metropolitano, a reminder that even the most carefully drafted clauses don't always work as intended.\n\nArticle continues below"

I don't mind being unpopular because I get that nobody likes seeing Manchester United down where they are, and nobody likes the decisions we're having to make at the moment.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"If I draw a bit of the ire, I can put up with that. But I'm no different to the average person. It's not nice, particularly for friends and family. So, eventually, if it reached the extent that the Glazer family have been abused, then I'd have to say, look, enough is enough guys, let somebody else do this.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n\"They can't really come to a match, the Glazers. They've retreated into the shadows a bit now, so I'm getting all the bloody stick. We bought in and I haven't seen them since.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It's, 'Thank you, Jim, you're doing a really good job.' At the moment, I don't have security, I don't have to walk around like that. But it would defeat the object, wouldn't it? You couldn't tolerate it at that level, it just wouldn't be fun.\"\n\nUnited currently sit fourth in the Premier League after a season in which they have sacked Ruben Amorim. Michael Carrick was appointed as his replacement in January.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

            "content": "We have a busy day's racing on Friday with action from Doncaster, Lingfield, Newbury and Wolverhampton, live on Sky Sports Racing...\n\n3.12 Lingfield - Last year's winner Ferrous faces El Bodon\n\nA cracking clash in the Midnite Awc Sprint Trial Handicap sees last year's winner Ferrous take on El Bodon.\n\nThe Jane Chapple-Hyam-trained El Bodon arrives unbeaten in three all-weather starts including a win over this track and trip. He kept on nicely when winning at Kempton last time and must have a strong chance despite another 3lb rise.\n\nFerrous was successful in this race last year under same pilot Tom Marquand. That was off a 10lb lower mark however and he will need to be at his best if he is to follow up. An excellent fourth behind subsequent winner Diligent Harry in the Kachy Stakes showed he is in rude health though.\n\nThe best of the rest may be Kevin Philippart de Foy's Lakers. He finished an excellent third from a wide draw in a strong race at Southwell and must be respected if in similar mood.\n\n3.00 Newbury - Miami Magic headlines strong novices' chase\n\nMiami Magic tops a quality line-up for the OLBG 'Chasing Excellence' Novices' Chase at Newbury.\n\nStuart Edmunds' stable star impressed when getting off the mark at the third time of asking at Cheltenham on his penultimate run. He struggled to land a blow in the Scilly Isles Novices' Chase at Sandown but given he did not jump with the same fluency, he should appreciate the drop down in class and is taken to concede the penalty under Charlie Hammond.\n\nWyenot has been a consistent performer for the Henry Daly team and has undergone a wind operation having disappointed at Bangor. Providing that is a success, she could bounce back and rates next best.\n\nThat's Nice, Elysian Knight and Thank You Ma'am complete the quintet.\n\n2.12 Lingfield - In-form Henrythenate and Mr Juggles clash\n\nAn ultra-competitive renewal of the Betmgm Awc 3 Year Old Trial Handicap where in-form pair Henrythenate and Mr Juggles headline.\n\nHenrythenate made it two wins from two for new trainer Stuart Williams when comfortably winning over five furlongs at Wolverhampton 15 days ago and he looks the type to go in again as he steps up in trip to six furlongs.\n\nMick Appleby's Mr Juggles was well-backed when making a winning handicap debut at Southwell earlier this month and he warrants plenty of respect under a 7lb penalty.\n\nOthers with each-way chances are Star Of Albion and Saffron Dandy, while Horace Wallace makes appeal on his first handicap start.\n\nBest of the rest\n\n3.45 Lingfield - AW Marathon Trial - Last year's winner Roaring Legend involved. Enemy another to note.\n\n4.20 Lingfield - AW Middle Distance Trial - Duke's Command fancied for Marquand. Lord Melbourne too.\n\n4.53 Lingfield - AW Mile Trial - Superposition among 10 runners.\n\n2.42 Lingfield - AW Fillies & Mares Trial - Bridget's View tops a field of 11.\n\n3.35 Newbury - Taunton winner Talk To The Man catches the eye for Paul Nicholls.\n\n4.08 Newbury - Fair handicap chase where Carbon Man and Daytime Dreaming feature.\n\n2.30 Newbury - Lady Cecilia is a potential improver for Lucy Wadham.\n\n6.15 Wolverhampton - Charlie Appleby and Conor Planas team up with well-bred Starglow. He is related to Romantic Style.\n\n5.45 Wolverhampton - Benacre and Maximising have claims.\n\n12.25 Chantilly - Vatican will be popular.\n\n1.00 Chantilly - Keep an eye on Turbulante."

            "content": "George Russell is \"ready\" to fight for a first F1 world championship in the 2026 season, says Sky Sports F1's Martin Brundle.\n\nAs the countdown continues to next week's season-opening Australian Grand Prix, live on Sky Sports, Mercedes' Russell remains the bookmakers' favourite for the Drivers' Championship with the Silver Arrows having enjoyed a strong pre-season with their new W17 car.\n\nBrundle believes there is \"not a clear favourite\" for the title as it stands based on the picture from testing, but Russell is among those set to fight for the crown if pre-season expectations prove accurate.\n\n\"I do think he's ready for it,\" says Brundle of the 28-year-old Russell, who is entering his eighth season of F1.\n\n\"He's a smart guy; they're all smart guys. George has got the team around him. Kimi [Antonelli] will be stronger this year in the other car, but George is completely out of Lewis [Hamilton]'s shadow there, he's the king of the castle at Mercedes-Benz.\n\n\"He did all those years at Williams and then he went to Mercedes when they just stopped dominating, so he's done the hard yards.\n\n\"I think he's got the experience, he's got the car control, and I think he will command the respect in the team to help drive what's going to be an incredibly changeable year.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Craig Slater and Martin Brundle review and rank all the F1 teams after pre-season testing\n\nSpeaking during an appearance on Sky Sports News, Brundle added: \"I think his team-mate Kimi Antonelli will have a great season as well, but George has got all the confidence he needs to win races and to go and win a championship, if it's available to him.\n\n\"We questioned that with Lando [Norris] last year, and Oscar [Piastri] too, whether they would wilt under pressure from Max [Verstappen], and they didn't.\n\n\"I think George is in a very good place.\"\n\nAsked how Russell would handle any increased intra-Mercedes challenge from team-mate Kimi Antonelli, the 19-year-old Italian entering his second year of F1, Brundle added: \"Remember, [Russell] grew up in Lewis Hamilton's shadow at Mercedes, and he handled that, and eventually in the final year they were team-mates, he beat Lewis clearly.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Russell admits his two starts in Bahrain have been 'worse' than his worst-ever start in Formula 1\n\n\"So, I have no doubts about him whatsoever. They're all world-class drivers in F1, you've got to beat them somehow.\n\n\"I think George has got so much experience now despite not being 30 yet, that I don't think anything will distract him if he's got a championship-winning car.\"\n\n'No clear favourite' - Brundle expects open 'big-four' battle\n\nWhile Mercedes may be favourites for both titles heading into the 24-race campaign, Brundle believes they will face a challenge from all three of their established rivals on the evidence of the three winter tests.\n\n\"I see Ferrari being strong, I see both Ferrari drivers being strong,\" said Brundle.\n\n\"I think both McLaren drivers will be strong as well. Oscar will come back on a mission after what he learned last year; Lando, I don't think I've ever seen him yet not with that big grin on his face so far this year, he's just got that comfort now.\n\n\"The Red Bull looks really strong, and we know how Max's car control, which you'll need with these cars, will be incredible.\n\n\"So, for me, there's not a clear favourite.\"\n\nWatch every race of the 2026 Formula 1 season live on Sky Sports, starting with the Australian Grand Prix from March 6-8.

            "content": "Football's lawmakers are expected to discuss the idea of a new five-second time limit for goal-kicks and throw-ins, which could put an end to the current long-throw trend in the Premier League.\n\nThey are also expected to increase the scope of VAR to include decisions on second yellow cards, when they meet in Wales on Saturday - with further proposals to crack down on time-wasting also on the agenda.\n\nIf a new five-second time limit is introduced for goal-kicks and throw-ins, it is thought that would effectively mean an end to the increasing trend in the Premier League and EFL for teams to use long-throws as an attacking tactic.\n\nThe International Football Association Board (IFAB) which is made up of the English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish FAs together with FIFA, holds its AGM each spring. Only at this meeting can the laws of the game be amended, and they then have to be applied worldwide.\n\nHowever, the IFAB board may decide to trial some law changes rather than introduce them permanently, with those laws made optional for individual competitions to consider implementing. While any law changes will not come into effect until July 1 (so, effectively for the start of the next domestic football season) it is likely that FIFA will choose to introduce some of them, as a trial, during this summer's World Cup in North America.\n\nMonterosa Monterosa , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Currently, the Premier League has the lowest intervention rates for VAR of any of the 'big five' European leagues.\n\nFA chief executive Mark Bullingham has spoken publicly about his dislike for the idea, but Pierluigi Collina, FIFA's head of referees, is a strong advocate, arguing that VAR would only get involved in corners where there has been a clear and obvious error.\n\nThere is widespread belief in the game that the introduction of the 'eight-second rule' for goalkeepers has been a success in cracking down on time-wasting - largely because there have been very few incidents this season where a 'keeper has held the ball for more than eight seconds, and a corner has been awarded to the opponent as a result.\n\nBecause of that success, IFAB will discuss further measures to speed up stoppages in play.\n\nHow would the 'five-second' rule work?\n\nProposals include introducing a new 'five-second rule' for goal-kicks and throw-ins, whereby a player will have only a very short time to get the game back under way again, or face a penalty. If they go beyond the five seconds, the throw-in would be reversed and awarded to the opponent, and a goal-kick would become a corner for the attacking side.\n\nSome insiders have suggested that five seconds is too short a time for players to adhere to, and others fear long throws would be impossible to organise in that time-frame.\n\nSome referees are also likely to be concerned that, if they have to do visual countdowns for goalkeepers with the ball in-hand, and also for throw-ins and goal-kicks, that could cause too much distraction from their other match-ruling functions.\n\nOther laws on the IFAB agenda include the mandatory 30 seconds that a player must remain off the pitch once they have received treatment for an injury on it.\n\nThere is a proposal that this time should be doubled to one minute, to help player welfare, but also to act as a further deterrent to would-be time-wasters. Similarly, a time limit for substitutions could be introduced to try to help further speed up the game.\n\nAgain, the feeling among the home nations FAs seems to be that the 30-second rule for players receiving treatment is working effectively at present, and so there may be some resistance to this law being introduced, we are told.\n\nEach law change, after discussion, will be put to the vote on Saturday. There needs to be a 75 per cent majority for any proposal to be passed. Each of the home nation FAs has one vote each, with FIFA having four votes, meaning six of the eight votes has to be in favour, for a law to be amended."

Arne Slot has opened his pre-match presser by telling reporters that Florian Wirtz will not be fit for the game and there’s no confirmed time frame on the German’s return. Wirtz missed Liverpool’s somewhat fortuitous win against Nottingham Forest last weekend after being forced to pull out during the warm-up. “I don’t expect Florian to be available,” he says. “It’s a disappointment. Every time a player is not available is a disappointment, it’s something that I didn’t expect after last week. At this moment time, I don’t know [when he will return]. Usually when I say that, I do know and I don’t want to share. But this time, I honestly don’t know. “It’s a big accomplishment for Wirtz to stay fit for such a long time because he had to make a step up from where he played to the Premier League and Liverpool. It tells a lot about his mentality and work rate that he has stayed fit for so long. It is a disappointment for him and for us, because he has played really, really well lately” Slot also reveals that Jeremie Frimpong will be available for tomorrow’s match after being sidelined since the end of January.

            "content": "Two months ago, Aston Villa were just three points off top spot in the Premier League. They were on a run of 12 wins in 14 games that included victories against Manchester City and Arsenal. Their run of eight consecutive wins in the league was their best since they won 10 in a row in 1910. You wouldn’t have blamed Villa fans for daring to dream about lifting their first league title since 1981.\n\nBut success breeds expectation, and expectation carries its own cruel weight. Arsenal tore Villa apart in a 4-1 win in late December and victories have been hard to come by in the new year – they have only won three of their last nine league games. Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea are still below them in the table but the gap is narrowing. With games against United and Chelsea coming in March, the top-three spot Villa have occupied since they beat Wolves in late November suddenly looks in jeopardy. So does their place in the Champions League next season.\n\nThey salvaged a point against Leeds on Saturday courtesy of a scrambled 88th-minute finish from Tammy Abraham, but the 1-1 draw at Villa Park did little to disguise the deeper issues. Unai Emery’s side looked anxious and lacked inspiration for long periods of the game. A slow start left them chasing the game and, not for the first time this season, they relied on a set-piece goal to bail them out of trouble. “It’s a good point,” said a clearly relieved Emery. Daniel Farke’s reaction was telling. “It’s crazy that you can come here as a newly promoted side – to one of the title contenders, one of the best teams in this country and in Europe – and you are slightly disappointed with just one point.”\n\nThe tension from the fans in Villa Park mirrored the hesitancy on the pitch – a rarity in what has been one of Europe’s most difficult venues to visit in recent years. Villa lost just one home game in the league last season and were on a run of eight straight wins at Villa Park this season before their current slump. And yet they were just minutes away from their fourth defeat in their last six home games in all competitions. For a side that has thrived on controlled possession, high-quality chance creation and adaptability, they looked one-dimensional and mistake-prone.\n\nVilla are lacking a creative pulse and their strikers are suffering. They have scored just one goal from open play in their last five matches. Injuries have had a large part to play in this. Three of their first-choice midfielders – Boubacar Kamara, Youri Tielemans and John McGinn – are out injured.\n\nTielemans and McGinn have set up 50 chances for teammates this season (only Morgan Rogers has been more creative) so it’s no surprise to see Villa struggle for goals. Without the physicality and control of their absent midfielders, Villa’s buildup play has been fractured and mistakes have crept in. Their replacements, Douglas Luiz and Amadou Onana, were injured earlier in the season and lack the match fitness required to complete games.\n\nView image in fullscreen Aston Villa have missed John McGinn, their captain, during his injury layoff. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nThe good news for Villa fans is that they have battled back from similar setbacks in the recent past. They failed to score a goal or win a point from their first four league matches this season yet were fighting for the title by Christmas.\n\nAnd they had to show plenty of character the last time they qualified for the Champions League, in the 2023–24 season. They were challenging for the title at Christmas, having lost just two of their first 18 games. But they struggled in the second half of the campaign, lost seven matches and found them themselves grinding out results. That team held on and finished fourth, booking their place in Europe’s top competition for the first time since the 1982-83 season.\n\nVilla are showing similar grit this season. After Abraham’s last-gasp equaliser against Leeds, Villa have won 19 points from losing positions – more than any other side in the division. They also have the third best defensive record, having conceded just 28 goals in 27 games. And they have one of the most experienced and shrewdest managers in Europe.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering that the Premier League is unusually competitive this season. The longest current winning streak in the league is just three matches (Manchester City). All of the top teams – even leaders Arsenal – have gone through periods when they have dug in. Villa’s resilience could prove decisive. Their recent draws against Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Leeds might feel like missed opportunities, but those points may prove crucial come May.\n\nMarch will be a season-defining month for Villa. Their recent form is patchy and their performances have been far from eye-catching. Fluidity in possession has given way to forced passes, and dominance has often been replaced by moments of desperation. But there remains a steel to this side that cannot be ignored. And, crucially given their upcoming games against their fellow Champions League chasers, they have a nice habit of beating the top sides. They have already beaten Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea in the league this season. There are plenty of reasons to go into the run-in with optimism.\n\nThis is an article by WhoScored"

            "content": "Manchester United sacking Ruben Amorim could end up costing the club almost £16m. Amorim’s 14-month reign ended on 5 January after his public attack on United’s hierarchy, with his five coaches also leaving Old Trafford.\n\nA filing to the New York Stock Exchange revealed the potential payments to Amorim and his staff, a day after the club confirmed they had made a £32.6m profit in their second-quarter results to 31 December 2025.\n\nUnited listed it as an “event that occurred after the reporting period”, and said: “A charge of £6.3m for the write off of related intangible assets and a provision of £15.9m, representing the maximum potential amount of future settlement payments, will be recognised in the statement of profit or (loss) during the second half of the year ending 30 June 2026.”\n\nIt has been reported the maximum amount of £15.9m is dependent on certain factors, such as Amorim getting a new job within a specific timeframe.\n\nThe accounts showed United have also paid Sporting £6.3m, which is what they owed the Portuguese club in compensation for hiring Amorim. United said in a November 2024 filing they were paying Sporting £10m to hire Amorim to replace Erik ten Hag, whose exit was costing £10.4m.\n\nThe combined changes around Amorim’s appointment could cost United £36.3m. Amorim won 25 of his 63 games, finishing 15th in the Premier League, United’s worst performance since being relegated from the top flight in 1973-74.\n\nUnited were sixth in the Premier League when Amorim was dismissed, having had a major fallout with the director of football, Jason Wilcox, days before his final game at Leeds.\n\nThey have boosted their hopes of Champions League football next season under Michael Carrick, climbing to fourth with five wins and a draw."

            "content": "For 67 minutes, Nottingham Forest were at risk of matching an unwanted record. At that point Fenerbahce were 2-0 up and full of belief that they could achieve the miracle their head coach, Domenico Tedesco, had been manifesting since their 3-0 first-leg defeat in Istanbul.\n\nOnly one team in the history of European club competitions have lost the first leg of a tie by a three-goal margin at home and advanced in the second. Up in the directors’ box, Evangelos Marinakis, more than an interested party on that occasion, presumably had flashbacks of Olympiakos suffering a 4-1 home defeat by Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Conference League two years ago, only to triumph 6-1 in Serbia in the second leg.\n\nKerem Akturkoglu scored twice to fuel Fenerbahce’s hopes, his second from the penalty spot almost immediately after the half-time restart, but the Forest substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi struck midway through the second half to extinguish the visitors’ dreams. Forest will learn on Friday whether they will face Midtjylland or Real Betis, both of whom they played in the league phase and could not beat, in the last 16. Fenerbahce’s hopes of reaching the Europa League showpiece in May, across town in Besiktas Stadium, are over.\n\nThe way this game was set up, an early Fenerbahce goal was always going to shift the dynamic of the tie and the Turkish side got one when Akturkoglu applied the finishing touch to a counterattack. Vítor Pereira acknowledged the worst mistake Forest could make was to assume their place in the last 16 was secure and his much-changed side were disjointed and sloppy. “It was a thriller – with suspense,” Pereira said. “We had to suffer.”\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate.

The flares thrown on to the pitch by the Fenerbahce supporters within 30 seconds of kick-off paused the game for a couple of minutes. Murillo, who opened the scoring in style in Turkey, was uncomfortable and erratic after being shunted across to left-back, with fellow Brazilians Morato and Jair Cunha doing little to inspire confidence at centre-back. Luckily, Stefan Ortega, one of five Forest players to keep their spots, was alert in goal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elliot Anderson shoots narrowly wide against Fenerbahce in the first half. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nForest were in an awkward spot from the moment Dorgeles Nene released Sidiki Cherif down the right channel in the 22nd minute and suddenly it was two v two. Cherif squared the ball for Akturkoglu and, while Neco Williams got a touch after sliding in desperation, the Forest full-back then lost his footing and now the Fenerbahce forward just had Ortega to beat. Pereira scratched his head as the away end went ballistic.\n\nPereira attempted to stem the bleeding with a quadruple half-time substitution, introducing Hudson-Odoi, Ola Aina, Igor Jesus and Ibrahim Sangaré. Yet just 25 seconds after the restart, the Italian referee, Maurizio Mariani, pointed to the penalty spot after Akturkoglu collapsed in the box. Jair Cunha appeared to make little contact with the Fenerbahce striker but was deemed to have tripped Akturkoglu, who made the most of a clumsy challenge and stepped up from 12 yards to beat Ortega.\n\nThe changes lifted Forest but Pereira was always going to rest players with Sunday’s trip to Brighton their fourth game in 11 days. “We need to go there with fuel,” said the Forest head coach. “When you change half of the team it is not easy to keep the level. I didn’t expect a fantastic game after changing so many players. After we conceded the first goal, we lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at the same time but we needed to do it because the game came into a dangerous situation for us.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Fenerbahce fans threw flares on to the pitch and delayed the first half. Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPA\n\nAfter the penalty, Fenerbahce raced the ball back to the centre circle. Game on? Forest were faced with exactly the kind of scenario they must have dreaded, though the fear seemed to galvanise them. Jair Cunha and Nicolás Domínguez both fired shots at goal and Williams sent a swerving effort wide.\n\nForest commanded greater control and Pereira cut a relieved figure as his side re-established a two-goal aggregate buffer, a pair of substitutes combining to devastating effect. Aina chipped the ball towards the back post where Hudson-Odoi controlled brilliantly, twisted past Nelson Semedo, a half-time arrival himself, and prodded his shot into the far corner.\n\nPereira punched the air with both fists and the underlying tensions evaporated. Forest, for so long fraught with nerves, could finally rejoice. “We lost the chance to qualify at home in Kadikoy,” Tedesco said. “They most probably over-performed in our stadium and we underperformed. We leave the competition with our heads held high.”"

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final European fixture as a manager. He created such wonderful memories for Celtic’s support in this domain during his first tenure that departing with a smile felt appropriate. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts. “The evening is nothing to do with me,” said O’Neill with needless self-deprecation.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal inside 30 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered unexpected cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half – the hosts had 24 attempts at goal – but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that is worthy of huge credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have delivered a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite either set of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday at the start of a spell that will define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart had managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ragged and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe only goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. “I got carried away with myself,” O’Neill said later. “I thought ‘we are going to do this here’.”\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm clash. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident been as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were only 25 minutes from that maiden win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly cancelled for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious as Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement albeit the officials had ushered him back on to the pitch. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "It is a peculiarity particular to Crystal Palace that a season of such upheaval and unrest could still end up with Oliver Glasner’s side winning another trophy. Having left the pitch after last week’s first leg with supporters calling for the Austrian manager to be sacked in the morning, Maxence Lacroix and Evann Guessand made it a much more harmonious evening for Glasner and his side.\n\nAfter being fortunate to escape from last week’s trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina with a 1-1 draw, it could have been very different if Zrinjski Mostar had equalised just before Guessand settled the tie late on. But having been demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League after winning the FA Cup last season, Palace’s first European campaign will continue against either the Cypriot side Larnaca – who they lost to during the group stages – or Mainz from Germany in the last 16.\n\n“There is so much noise, so sometimes we really don’t understand it, but maybe I gave some interviews that were not really helpful, I have to admit,” said Glasner in reference to his comments after the first leg when he told fans to “stay humble”.\n\n“I just had to express it otherwise I would have exploded. I can’t do it differently. If I feel something, I have to say it. Then I have to face the shitstorm. Everyone hopefully knows everything I say and do is for the best of Crystal Palace.”\n\nPalace rejected a request from the supporters’ group responsible for the banner directed against Glasner and the club’s board in their last match against Wolves to turn off the music so they could “back the team during the pre-match warm-up” on the grounds that Uefa’s regulations wouldn’t allow it.\n\nBut the presence of a large group of travelling supporters who took up position two hours before kick-off helped to create a decent atmosphere despite a large number of empty seats in the home sections. “40 quid? Palace fans fleeced = empty seats,” read the latest message that was displayed by the Holmesdale Fanatics during the first half.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

Guessand, who was starting for only the second time since his loan move from Aston Villa after scoring the decisive goal against Wolves, could not take advantage of a mix-up between the goalkeeper Goran Karacic and Igor Savic before the latter blocked Daichi Kamada’s goalbound shot.\n\nView image in fullscreen Crystal Palace fans display a banner protesting against ticket prices.

It was Wharton’s slip that allowed Leo Mikic a first sight of goal for Zrinjski just before half-time but his shot was jeered as it sailed wide.\n\nWharton was withdrawn not long after he had been shown a yellow card for a high boot, with Glasner revealing afterwards that the fourth official had warned he was close to a second booking. “Him and Will Hughes are rotating themselves by fouling too much,” he said.\n\nIsmaïla Sarr headed well over from Tyrick Mitchell’s cross in a rare sight of goal as another of Palace’s issues this season – struggling to break down teams employing a low block – returned. Their best chance of extending the lead was from another set piece and Chris Richards should have done better from close range on two occasions from a couple of Kamada free-kicks.\n\nView image in fullscreen Evann Guessand doubles Crystal Palace’s lead in stoppage time.

Yet it was the hosts who should have wrapped up the victory as the chances came thick and fast. Guessand had a golden opportunity to settle it but saw his shot saved by Karacic and Sarr was also guilty of missing two chances that looked easier to score.\n\nZrinjski’s big moment came in the second minute of injury time but the substitute Tomi Juric could only head over before Guessand finally made sure to send Palace into the next round."

In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three away games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on a direct rival. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season.

Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in match-day chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) and sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL translators will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday.

We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track following a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croatian’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to firstly avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance.

The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge for the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes following the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "Chelsea made a financial loss of £355m in the 2024-25 season, according to new data released by Uefa, the biggest deficit ever recorded by an English football club.\n\nAccording to Uefa, Chelsea’s losses were more than double the ­second-worst in Europe, the £171m posted by Lyon. The figures are also about £260m worse than those posted by the Blues in 2023-24.\n\nWhile Uefa’s report does not fully break down Chelsea’s figures, it does show that while they have spent money on a level with the top clubs in Europe, costs have not been matched by revenues. Chelsea’s wage bill is estimated to be the sixth highest in Europe, at £390m a season. Chelsea’s operational expenditure, or day-to-day costs, were the fifth highest in Europe, meanwhile, at £241m. Uefa also calculates that the Blues have the most expensive squad in history, assembled at a combined cost of over £1.5bn.\n\nIn terms of matchday revenue, however, Chelsea made a reported £1.2m less per game than Liverpool, with Stamford Bridge only the 10th biggest ground in last season’s ­Premier League. Commercial revenue fell year-on-year to £207m, about £165m less than the figure reported by Manchester City and at odds with an overall trend for growth in this area. Chelsea did, though, increase their broadcast revenues, from £167m to £193m thanks in large part to their success at the Club World Cup.\n\nChelsea’s finances have been the subject of debate since the club was taken over by the investment vehicle BlueCo in 2021. The men’s team has largely gone without a front-of-shirt sponsor in the intervening years, while the club have also become known for tying their players to long-term contracts, such as the eight-year deal given to the winger Mykhailo Mudryk, reported to be worth £100,000-a-week. The Ukrainian is serving a provisional ­suspension for doping.\n\nThe ownership have also sold hotels on the club’s grounds to related businesses in order to meet the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules.\n\nAlso on the list of Europe’s ­biggest financial losers are Strasbourg. Ranking at No 8 in Uefa’s list, with reported losses of £69m, the Ligue 1 side are also owned by BlueCo and have spent increasingly substantial figures on transfer fees in the past three seasons. Many of those deals have been struck with Chelsea, including nine transfers from London in this season alone."

On Sunday, the weather is expected to improve.”\n\nWaves of up to five metres are forecast, with coastal alerts in place across Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura.\n\n\n\nSnow is even possible above 1,800 metres around Mount Teide.\n\nStrong gusts have already lashed airports, with 48mph recorded at La Palma and 44mph in Lanzarote.\n\n\n\nCarnival plans in parts of Tenerife have been disrupted as organisers scramble to dodge the “meteorological cocktail” of wind, rain, rough seas and dust.\n\nOfficials are urging tourists to avoid exposed beaches, piers and breakwaters – and to postpone water sports.\n\nMotorists have also been told to secure loose items and take care on exposed roads as gusts could top 55mph in places.\n\nResidents and visitors are bluntly advised not to wash their cars as “mud rain” is likely to fall late today and early tomorrow.\n\nIt comes as a plume of Saharan dust also heads towards Britain.\n\n\n\nThe Met Office has warned motorists they could find their cars dirtier than usual – though proper “blood rain” is not expected.\n\n“There is no blood rain in the forecast, but there could be some Saharan dust residue on some vehicles following spells of rain, most likely Tuesday or Wednesday,” a spokesperson told The Sun.\n\nThe EU’s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service has been tracking the cloud as it sweeps across Europe, warning blood rain could be possible in some countries.\n\nDr Claire Ryder, from the University of Reading, said: “It does indeed look like Saharan dust is on the way to the UK.\n\n“Loadings are forecast by CAMS to be highest across western England and Wales in the early morning of Wednesday and with a further portion of the plume affecting southern England more strongly on Wednesday afternoon-evening and through Wednesday night.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“We’re seeing African dust which has been transported southwest of the Iberian Peninsula being picked up by strong southwesterly winds associated with a low pressure system coming our way.\n\n“This low pressure weather system will continue to advect the dust towards the UK within the warm sector ahead of the cold front.”"

            "content": "VILE CLAIMS Top children’s doctor fired over child sex crime charges – horrified dad warns of ‘monsters among us’ as he is SET FREE\n\nA CHILDREN’S doctor has been arrested and fired after cops charged him with child sex crimes involving over 100 child abuse images.\n\nOhio pediatrician Bryan Shanley Sack, 43, faces multiple felony charges and has been immediately fired from his role as a child’s urologist at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Toldeo.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe had been employed at the hospital for 18 months but was let go after his arrest on Saturday, though none of the alleged crimes have been linked to his work there.\n\nThe doctor faces felony charges including aggravated possession of child sexually abusive material, possession of child sexually abusive material and use of a computer to commit a crime, per court filings obtained by WTOL 11 News.\n\nAn investigation was reportedly triggered by a tip-off from The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).\n\nAfter executing a search warrant at his home in Michigan, investigators seized digital evidence of over 100 child sex abuse images, court docs state.\n\nAt his arraignment, his attorney entered a not guilty plea on his behalf.\n\nThe urologist has been granted a $75,000 bond and posted it on the same day, securing his release until his next scheduled court appearance on March 5.\n\nDetective Sgt. Kenneth Weismiller with Michigan State Police and the Internet Crimes Against Children Taskforce told Fox News that an investigation is “ongoing.”\n\nHe also reiterated that the doctor’s alleged crimes have not been connected to his work at the hospital which issued a statement after his arrest stating it was “deeply shocked and concerned” about the charges.\n\n\n\n“Upon learning of the charge, Dr Sack was immediately terminated and no longer has access to our patients, facilities or medical records,” said a hospital spokesperson.\n\n“At this time, our understanding from law enforcement is that the charges are not related to his clinical work including Nationwide Children’s – Toledo,” they added.\n\n“We are committed to the safety, support and privacy of all children and will continue to monitor this situation closely.”\n\nPARENT SHOCK\n\nMeanwhile, horrified parents have been sharing their shock at the news with one disgusted dad called Sack a “monster.”\n\n“When I think of the thousands of children and babies this monster had access to over his career, it makes me unbelievably angry,” father Noah Griffin wrote on Facebook after claiming he had taken his child to the hospital for a procedure and encountered the disgraced doc.\n\n\n\n“I will not allow strangers to be alone with my children – especially babies – ever again.\n\n“There are monsters among us. Stay vigilant parents.”\n\nGriffin claimed the hospital had a policy that meant parents were not present during procedures on their children.\n\n“From now on, if your policy is to separate us from our child, my policy is to find somewhere without that policy,” he said.\n\nThe U.S. Sun has reached out to the hospital for comment.\n\n\n\n“My initial first meet with him, I got weird vibes,” a mom told WTOL as she recalled her encounter with Slack.\n\n“I even called my husband and I said, I want you to stay on the phone with me because I just get a really weird feeling about this doctor.”\n\n“I did have funny vibes from him. I should have trusted my mom instincts,” said another.\n\nParents are also reportedly upset that they first heard the news via Facebook rather than from the hospital.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“I feel like as soon as this happened, the hospital or somebody from urology’s office could have called me to let me know versus me finding out online,” said another sickened parent.\n\n\n\nSlack has been a doctor for over a decade, public records show, after earning his medical degree at Wayne State University School of Medicine."

            "content": "A HUGE DNA testing effort has been launched to try and find the twisted killer of French toddler Emile Soleil.\n\nAround 100 locals will have samples taken after the murder of two-and-a-half-year-old Emile, who was found dead in the French Alps more than eight months after he first disappeared.\n\n\n\n\n\nDNA testing is already underway, and around 100 people in the village will submit samples – cops hope the evidence could help them finally find Emile’s murderer.\n\nThe tot was staying at his grandparents’ isolated holiday home in the Alpine hamlet of Haut-Vernet, south of Grenoble.\n\nBut he vanished without a trace as the family were getting ready to leave the house on the morning of July 8, 2023.\n\n\n\nA desperate search was launched, with locals and search and rescue teams scouring the area using a helicopter, drones and sniffer dogs – Emile was nowhere to be found.\n\nHis remains were discovered 266 days later by a rambler in what was a major breakthrough for the case.\n\nHe had a fractured skull, and investigations on Emile found he suffered “violent facial trauma”, prosecutors said.\n\nCops said the body had been moved when the child was already dead.\n\n\n\nChillingly, Emile had not died in the clothes he was wearing when he was discovered, police added.\n\nAnd the decomposition of the remains suggests that little Emile’s body was likely preserved in a protected environment – like a freezer.\n\nHe was found in an area which had already been thoroughly searched by police, suggesting someone had brought his body back there.\n\nEmile’s grandparents Philippe and Anne Vedovini, both 59, had their DNA taken at the start of the investigation.\n\nThey were quizzed by cops for 17 hours after Emile was found dead.\n\n\n\nThe Vedovinis were arrested in dawn raids along with two of their adult children, identified as Émile’s aunt and uncle.\n\nAll faced charges of ‘intentional homicide’ and ‘concealing a corpse’, a statement released by Aix-en-Provence prosecutors said.\n\n\n\nBut all four denied the charges and have since been released from custody.\n\nMr Philippe is also still under investigation in connection with an entirely different case relating to sexual abuse at a Roman Catholic School in the 1990s.\n\nHe has always denied the claims and soon transformed his life into being a monk.\n\nThe grandad also admitted to “fifteen minutes of inattention” before the child vanished.\n\nA source close to the investigation told La Depeche the two witnesses who “confirmed that they saw the child walking alone at the time of his disappearance” are “reliable people” who they “trust completely”.\n\n\n\nLast year, in another twist in the case, Father Claude Gilliot, who baptised the two-year-old, allegedly died by suicide and left a chilling suicide note.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nGilliot, 85, reportedly left a suicide note when he was found after “a massive overdose”, according to an investigation source.\n\nThe investigation continues."

They’ve been in my life now for so long that I just feel a real connection with the characters,” she says. Nikki has been all around the world in honour of her love for the show - visiting the apartments in New York in 2008 and 2024, and visiting the Warner Brothers Studio in LA to see the set with husband Kris.\n\n“We’ve seen the stage and the original fountain, the sofa, and Central Perk Cafe. It was really cool,” she said. And Nikki even has two Friends tattoos.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNikki’s bedroom is home to a Friends shrine, crowded with memorabilia; bags, books, t-shirts, colouring sets and Funko Pop toys. She bought them all on Vinted before learning that McDonald’s is giving away collectibles along with the Friends Meal as part of a new campaign.\n\nView 5 Images Nikki Hardy's Friends tattoo\n\nThe limited-edition meal features one of six collectable characters. There is also a chance to win four exclusive Friends inspired mugs, each with an iconic design, when you purchase the McDonald’s Friends Meal using the MyMcDonald’s app.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLike Nikki, Lucy Wilkinson has also been hooked on the TV show since she was a child. At primary school, Lucy got the Rachel haircut and would sit down every Friday night to watch the show in the days before binge watching.\n\n“I loved it. I had all the pencil cases and the board games, and even now, the first thing I do when I get home is put it on the TV”, the mortgage advisor from Sheffield, said. Friends and family buy her Friends-themed gifts for birthdays and Christmas, she has a Friends shrine in her utility room, and her hen party and wedding in 2018 were dominated by the show.\n\nView 5 Images Friends superfan Lucy with McDonalds Friends figurines\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“I even put it on when we’re on holiday. My husband, Will, says ‘I can’t believe we’re abroad and we’re still watching Friends’”, Lucy, 39, said. At her hen party in Tenerife six years ago, all her guests were given name badges in honour of Monica’s fastidiousness, and a laminated itinerary was pulled out. ‘It was called 'The one where Lucy got married', everyone was given their own Friends character to be and it was so much fun,\" she said.\n\nAnd at the couple’s wedding, guests were offered slices of cheese and pork pie cake, which bore the topper “he’s my lobster”, in reference to Phoebe Buffay’s description of Ross and Rachel’s relationship. They signed the register to the background music of U2’s With or Without You - the song Ross and Rachel first kissed to - but Will drew the line at entering the reception to the Friends theme tune.\n\nView 5 Images Lucy and Will's Friends-themed wedding cake\n\nArticle continues below\n\n“He put his foot down on that”, she laughs, before admitting it did get played at the end of the night. When we got back to the bridal suite, there were pinecones and fake fruit everywhere. I didn’t realise why until the next morning when I worked out my friends had put them there in reference to Ross stealing them from a hotel lobby as a child.\n\n“My whole life has revolved around this TV show. Even though we were trying not to eat fast food in February, we gave ourselves permission to have a Friends Big Mac meal. I was really pleased to get the Monica character, as she’s my favourite.\n\nThe McDonald’s Friends Meal will be available in restaurants until March 16 while stocks last."

Her findings left her taken aback\n\nView Image She spends £100 a week at charity shops (stock image) (Image: Getty Images)\n\nLots of people use charity shops, but lately some have admitted there are \"issues\" with using them, with a woman claiming there's a side to them she previously hasn't seen. Jenna Ward confesses to spending around £100 a week at charity shops; however, some people have pointed out they aren't always as they seem.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe recently turned to TikTok to detail her recent shopping experience, and it's fair to say her findings took her, and others, by surprise. Jenna felt compelled to tell her story, as it's the first time she's come across such a problem in Derby, where she regularly shops and hunts for deals.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe's not the first person to shine a light on such issues either. Previously, another woman claimed there's a reason people are not buying second-hand goods.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn the clip, Jenna said: \"Guys, we need to have a serious chat, and I fear this is going to be a massive rant. We all know that I normally find the cheapest charity shops.\n\n\"I find so many that are either everything's £1, everything's £2, you know most things are under a fiver. That kind of thing. Those charity shops are phenomenal, but today I decided to go to the posh area where I live, which is Matlock. Pretty posh.\n\n\"Anyway, there's about six different charity shops. I went in every single one of them and I bought one thing. As we all know, I spend probably £100 a week in charity shops.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I buy stuff to resell and I buy stuff for myself. When I tell you every one of those charity shops were so over-priced, honestly, I haven't even got words.\n\n\"I nearly fell through the actual floor at how bad it was. I wish I took photos, but there was literally Primark tops in the sale for £4.\"\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n‌\n\n\n\nExpanding, Jenna said the pricing was \"ridiculous\" and, while she doesn't expect every charity shop to make everything a pound, she did think the prices were \"insane\". She admitted a lot of people comment on her videos to tell her they think charity shops are expensive, and the experience made her realise that it can actually be a problem.\n\nUsually, she finds many cheap items while bargain hunting, and she visits the same shops regularly as she knows the prices are so good there. Based on what she saw this week, however, she was left confused as to how they were going to sell items at such high prices, as she believes they'll really put people off.\n\nVarious people commented on the video after it was posted, and many were keen to share their thoughts. It's clear they had very different opinions.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOne said: \"I’m not surprised if charity shops are upping their prices because of resellers.\" Another added: \"I went to a charity shop last week.\n\n\"I found a summer dress by Pretty Little Thing (PLT) priced at £15! I genuinely don’t understand how they price their stuff.\"\n\nA third replied: \"Same as my area, prices are crazy!\" Meanwhile, a fourth also commented: \"They're getting greedy.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhat's happening to charity shops?\n\nIf you're wondering why charity shops have become so expensive, it's reported to be for a number of reasons. It's generally a result of increased business savvy, rising overheads (rent, staff) and the higher demand for \"thrifting\" trends.\n\nWhen resellers \"flip\" items, it can lead to charity shop prices being pushed up to ensure they raise funds for their dedicated cause, though this is not always the case. Valuation methods have also become more sophisticated, such as using eBay data, identifying and pricing valuable items higher.\n\nEven though the shops aim to achieve charitable fundraising, the operational realities and increased market demand have changed a lot of charity shops and some are now more commercially focused retail outlets. Some people believe this has impacted their original purpose.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nIn the video, Jenna made it clear that she thinks the prices are too much for people; however, she is a dedicated charity shopper and uses her platform to share her tips and finds with others.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Codeine-based painkillers are opioid medications used for short-term, moderate pain relief when non-opioids like ibuprofen or paracetamol fail.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe worksin the central nervous system and the brain to block pain signals to the rest of the body. It also reduces the anxiety and stress caused by pain.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNow in a new article on The Conversation, Dipa Kamdar Senior Lecturer in Pharmacy Practice, Kingston University said people need to be wary of a number of symptoms. She explained: “Many people assume that medicines sold over the counter are inherently safe. After all, if you can buy something in a supermarket or high street pharmacy, how dangerous can it really be?\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“The reality is more complicated. Several commonly used over-the-counter medicines carry a real risk of dependence, misuse or harm when taken in higher than recommended doses, for longer than needed, or for the wrong reasons. Here are five medicines it is worth knowing about.”\n\nSpeaking about codeine-based painkillers she said some side-effects could impact people of certain backgrounds more than others and make it more dangerous for activities such as driving. She added there is a ‘three day rule’ for most people taking the drug with experts saying it should be taken for ‘as little time as possible.’\n\nMs Kamdar said: “Codeine is an opioid medicine used to treat mild to moderate pain and, in some formulations, to suppress coughing. Over the counter, it is usually combined with either ibuprofen or paracetamol. Once swallowed, the body converts codeine into morphine, which produces its pain-relieving effects.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n”Common side effects include drowsiness, constipation, nausea and dizziness. At higher doses, codeine can slow breathing and impair coordination. Some people are particularly vulnerable. Ultra-rapid metabolisers carry a genetic variant that causes them to convert codeine into morphine much faster than usual. This trait is more common in people of North African, Middle Eastern and Oceanian backgrounds and can lead to dangerous side effects even at standard doses.\n\n“With repeated use, the body can also become tolerant to codeine, meaning the same dose no longer provides the same relief. This process, known as tolerance, occurs as the brain’s opioid receptors adapt to the drug. People may then increase their dose, raising the risk of physical dependence. Stopping suddenly can cause withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, restlessness, sweating and sleep problems.\n\n“To reduce these risks, codeine should be used for the shortest time possible. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency limits pack sizes to 32 tablets and advises non-prescription products should be used for no more than three days.”\n\nArticle continues below\n\nKey NHS facts\n\nThe most common side effects of codeine are constipation, feeling sick (nausea) and feeling sleepy.\n\nIt's possible to become addicted to codeine, but your doctor will explain how to reduce the risks of this happening.\n\nIf you need to take codeine for more than a few weeks, your treatment plan may include details of how and when to stop taking this medicine.\n\nIt may be best not to drink alcohol while taking codeine as you're more likely to get side effects like feeling sleepy.\n\nDo not give codeine to children under 12. Only give codeine to children aged 12 to 18 if everyday painkillers, like paracetamol and ibuprofen, have not worked.\n\nFor more information from the NHS click here.

And a source has claimed that report states the bid was part of a concerted effort by Russia to build a network through business titans.\n\nThe report goes on to state, it has been claimed, that the former Prince, who was arrested last week on suspicion of misconduct in public office \"has a long-standing hatred of his brother Charles, who he sees as weak\".\n\nBBC Question Time crowd erupts into laughter as host Fiona stops Andrew debate READ MORE :\n\nView 4 Images Russian spies were reportedly looking to make Andrew their window into the Royal Family (Image: AP)\n\nThe documents, seen by the Daily Mail, were reportedly issued by an undisclosed US security agency on January 15, with the title: \"Political Corruption: Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor\" and sub heading \"Designated Russian Union\". The report adds that Andrew was being regarded as a \"useful idiot\" and a \"weak link\" by agents from the hostile nation.\n\nA source speaking to the publication said the report lists Andrew as a figure worth cultivating as a link \"close to the British Royal Family \".\n\nThey said: \"It says that Russian intelligence developed networks using figures such as Jeffrey Epstein for access to political and business leaders and to control any possible domestic law enforcement actions.

It adds that \"AMW\" would be used \"as a front provided legitimacy to corruption operations worldwide\".\n\nIt continues: \"AMW was not blackmailed or otherwise coerced into this role - rather he was a willing participant in these schemes due to financial, sexual and personal reward.\n\n\"Russian intelligence used AMW's sexual proclivities to establish a relationship rapport in order to exploit this mental condition for further gain.\" None of the claims in these documents have been corroborated, and Andrew has never been publicly associated with or linked to Russian authorities.\n\nView 4 Images Searches at Royal Lodge concluded this week (Image: Getty Images)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe report comes as Andrew is investigated for potential misconduct in public office, with searches of the former Prince's residences having been completed this week - days after he was arrested and briefly held in police custody on February 19.\n\nThames Valley police confirmed on Tuesday that it had concluded its six-day search of Royal Lodge, Andrew's former home in Windsor, while the investigation remains ongoing. Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement: \"Officers have now left the location we have been searching in Berkshire.\n\n\"We understand the significant public interest in this case and our investigation remains ongoing. It is important that our investigators are given the time and space to progress their work. We will provide updates when it is appropriate to do so, but this is unlikely to be for some time.\""

Manchester didn’t want to put their life in Trump's hands.'\n\nNigel Farage wraps himself in the Union flag, but the moment voters rejected him, he ditched British values and reached straight for Donald Trump’s playbook - cry cheating and trash the result\n\nView 4 Images Within minutes of losing the Gorton and Denton by-election, Nigel Farage ditched any pretence of statesmanship and went straight to his hero’s script: cry cheating. (Image: Ryan Jenkinson/Getty Images)\n\nNigel Farage likes to wrap himself in the Union flag, pose as the champion of “British values”, and lecture the rest of us about patriotism. But the moment democracy delivers a result he does not like, the mask slips.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe leader of Reform UK did not even bother with the pretence of statesmanship. Within minutes of the Gorton and Denton by-election result being declared, the self-styled patriot had already lunged for his hero’s handbook. Lose a vote? Scream cheating. Question the system. Poison the well. The Donald Trump playbook, followed to the letter and followed fast.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThis by-election was undeniably a bad night for Labour. Losing a seat it previously held is serious and demands honesty, not excuses. Voters sent a message, and Labour must listen. That much is beyond dispute. But what happened next was not about Labour’s defeat. It was about Farage’s exposure.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Failed Reform candidate Matt Goodwin (right) was soundly rejected in Gorton and Denton by-election (Image: Getty Images)\n\nWatch new Green MP Hannah Spencer's election victory speech in full READ MORE :\n\nKeir Starmer suffers nightmare defeat in Gorton and Denton by-election READ MORE :\n\nReform UK did not surge. It did not sweep the board. It did not even come close. Farage’s star candidate, Matt Goodwin - a man with all the warmth and charisma of a Dalek on standby mode - was comfortably dispatched into second place by the Greens’ Hannah Spencer, without so much as a recount-worthy wobble.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nComfortably. No recount drama. No marginal cliff edge. Just a clear verdict from voters. And Farage could not handle it.\n\nInstead of accepting defeat - the bare minimum required of anyone who claims to believe in democracy - Farage and his flunkie Goodwin lashed out, alleging “sectarian voting and cheating”. The Green Party was right to hit back, calling out the accusation for what it was: reckless, unfounded and dangerous.\n\nIn Britain, claims of electoral fraud are not pub banter. They are serious allegations that strike at the heart of democratic trust. Farage made them anyway, with no evidence and no shame. It was not a slip of the tongue. It is who he is.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe has spent his entire political career posing as the supposed defender of democracy while treating it with contempt the moment it disobeys him. He demanded referendums. He demanded votes. He demanded that “the people” be heard. Just look at his role in Brexit. But now we see the fine print: the people are only right when they vote for Nigel Farage.\n\nWhen they don’t, they must have cheated.\n\nView 4 Images Trump fan boy Farage has imported the US president's political playbook into the UK\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe speed of his response tells you everything. No attempt to understand why voters might have rejected his message of division and grievance. Just an instant accusation. It was almost impressive in its predictability. You could practically set your watch by it.\n\nThis is what happens when Trumpism is imported wholesale into British politics. Farage is not borrowing policy ideas or campaign techniques.\n\nHe is copying the most corrosive instinct of all: delegitimising elections themselves. Trump lost in 2020 and told America the vote was stolen. Farage lost and immediately suggested the same. Same ego. Same bitterness. Same disregard for the consequences.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd the language he chose matters. “Sectarian voting” is not a neutral phrase. It is a deliberate smear against communities - a way of implying that some voters’ choices are less valid because of who they are. It is not democracy. It is the politics of resentment and exclusion, wrapped in a cheap Union flag.\n\nFarage loves to talk about British values. Well, here is one: in Britain, when you lose, you accept it. You shake hands, regroup, and try again. You do not accuse voters of wrongdoing because they had the audacity to reject you.\n\nWhat makes this episode even more damning is that the winner was not Labour but the Greens - a party Farage routinely mocks and dismisses. Spencer won not by tearing down institutions or crying conspiracy, but by persuading people. That is how democracy is supposed to work. Farage’s inability to accept that is not a flaw; it is a feature.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nYes, Labour has taken a blow. But Reform UK has been shown up. When tested, their movement offers nothing but grievance, paranoia and imported culture-war nonsense. No answers. No humility. Just blame. And this is why Farage’s behaviour matters beyond one by-election.\n\nVoters in south east Manchester have spoken, clearly and unequivocally. They did not just reject a candidate, but the Trump-style politics of grievance, conspiracy and permanent outrage.\n\nView 4 Images Nigel Farage screamed cheating after Reform failed to win Gorton and Denton (Image: Getty Images)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWhen Trump fan boy Farage reached for claims of cheating within minutes, he showed exactly how quickly he will undermine democracy when it refuses to serve him. Baseless accusations of rigged votes corrode trust in the ballot box. They tell people outcomes are fixed and anger matters more than argument. We know where that road leads, because we have seen it in America.\n\nFarage claims to love Britain. But the moment British voters told him “no”, he tried to discredit both them and the system that gave them a voice. It is not patriotism. It is petulance, and Manchester just sent a clear message that Trump-style politics are not welcome here.\n\nStop looking back in anger, Nige. Manchester clearly didn’t want to put their life in your hands."

            "content": "'Binmen refuse to collect my rubbish over 1 rule I didn't know existed'\n\nA woman is locked in a fight with her binmen because they refuse to collect her rubbish, but people have pointed out she's actually breaking one bin collection rule\n\nView Image The woman didn't know she was breaking a bin collection rule (stock photo) (Image: Getty Images)\n\nBinmen often won't collect your rubbish if you've broken one of the rules for collection. Finding out that your wheelie bin is still full after collection day can be frustrating, especially if you live in an area that alternates between general rubbish and recycling, so you know it'll be a fortnight until that bin is up for collection again.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut what many Brits don't realise is that there are some bin collection rules that households need to follow, and if they don't, then it's very likely their rubbish won't be taken away. One woman on social media is finding this out in real time as she claims the binmen have refused to take her rubbish - and she has no idea why.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHolly Laing explained in a TikTok video that her bins alternate each week so that the general rubbish and recycling are emptied once a fortnight. She admitted that her household generates \"a lot of rubbish\" within those two weeks, and they're having to put surplus general waste bags in their shed because they won't fit in the wheelie bin.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe woman's household also generates a lot of recycling, so when it was time for the recycling bin to be emptied this week, Holly decided to be a bit \"cheeky\" by putting both of her bins outside to be collected - but insisted they both only contained recycling rubbish.\n\nShe said her recycling bin was full, and she had some bits that still needed collecting, so she emptied her general waste bin and put the leftover recycling in there, hoping that the binmen would do her a favour and take it anyway. Not only did they not empty the overflow bin, but they also didn't take the rubbish from her actual recycling bin either.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe explained: \"We, with the rest of our neighbours, put our wheelie bins outside the front of our house. So I can see on our doorbell camera that they collected everyone else's wheelie bins and left ours.\n\n\"Fair enough if they don't want to take the general waste bin because it's the wrong day for that, but there was no general waste in it. And the wheelie bin lid had been flung open by the wind anyway. The other bin was too full to close the lid, so basically, they could see what was in both of our bins. And both of them, you can see that it's just cardboard.\n\n\"I wouldn't have minded so much if they only took our recycling bin, because obviously that's what today is. At least then we would have one wheelie bin empty for us to fill back up. But now we just have two bins full of cardboard because they wouldn't take either of them. I just don't understand why they wouldn't take the recycling bin when it's recycling bin day.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, Holly actually pointed out what the likely culprit was without her realising, as she had seemingly made a big mistake that stopped her rubbish from being collected.\n\nMost councils will have a rule that if your wheelie bin is so full that the lid cannot close properly, then the binmen will not empty your rubbish. Holly admitted in her video that the recycling bin was \"too full to close the lid\", which is most likely the reason why her bin wasn't emptied.\n\nIf the lid is propped open, it often means the bin cannot be safely lifted by the mechanical arms on the bin lorry, so it can be a safety issue to empty a bin that is too full. In some cases, a bin that is too full can also pose a weight limit issue. The bin lorry will have a weight limit, and if your bin is too full, it could risk exceeding the lorry's capacity.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSeveral people pointed out this rule in the comments of Holly's video, as they told her that was the most likely reason for her rubbish not being collected.\n\nOne person said: \"I know it's super annoying, but I believe if the bin is too full to fully close the lid, the bin men can refuse to take it. Not sure what the exact reasoning is behind it, but I know they can.\"\n\nAnother added: \"I live in Birmingham and they haven't collected recycling for about a year now. But I know normally if the bin lid is slightly open, they won't collect.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOthers told Holly that she can contact her council to get a larger wheelie bin or a second one, but she would likely have to pay extra for it. Some councils also charge extra for the second bin to be collected, as it is outside of their normal routine, and they would need to account for the extra waste.\n\nWhy binmen can refuse to collect your bins\n\nThere are a number of other reasons binmen may refuse to collect your rubbish that don't have anything to do with your bin being too full or the lid being open. They can also refuse to collect if your rubbish violates council guidelines, such as containing contaminated recycling, being excessively heavy or if you include \"side waste\", which are bags left next to the bin.\n\nBinmen may also refuse to collect your rubbish if you put non-recyclable items like food or soft plastics in your recycling bin, although they will often leave a sticker behind that explains the issue with your bins.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nSometimes recycling rules can vary slightly in different parts of the country. If you're unsure about anything, visit your council website for further guidance."

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

            "content": "Frank Warren gives verdict on Conor Benn's split from Eddie Hearn - as he refuses to speak on his breakdown in relationship with Saudi backers\n\nFrank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\n\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

We came back from that Austria race and I remember you sat on the bed one night and went \"Something really bad's gonna happen\".'\n\nHalliwell confirmed that she had said that they were going to 'fire' her husband.\n\nScenes from the episode later showed Halliwell and Horner watching a race on television - a hitherto unusual way of experiencing raceday for the former team principal, who had held his role since 2005.\n\n'You haven't got any of the data here really!' Horner complained. 'Well, normally I would have a whole bunch of noise in my ears. So it's like you're blind.'\n\nHalliwell admitted that she now felt 'a bit sad watching this' as her eyes filled with tears.\n\n53-year-old Halliwell was a semi-regular fixture on race weekend alongside her husband, often appearing in the paddock at the start and end of the season as well as at proximate races such as the British Grand Prix.\n\nLater in the episode the couple took the unusual decision to watch a race from their home\n\nThe moment was captured at Horner's luxurious mansion in Oxfordshire by Netflix's cameras\n\nHalliwell and Horner were frequent fixtures in the paddock throughout their relationship\n\nWhen in February 2024, the paddock was stunned by a leaked cache of suggestive messages purporting to be from Horner, Halliwell flew to Bahrain to take her husband's side.\n\nHorner was later accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour by a female member of staff, with an internal investigation led by KCs twice clearing him of wrongdoing. Halliwell supported him throughout.\n\nBack at their Cotswolds home, Halliwell tried to lift the mood by suggesting that Horner might be trying to 'eat his feelings'.\n\nIn improved spirits, the pair later horsed around by their swimming pool, with Horner pretending to be on the brink of throwing Halliwell in, before she admonished him, saying: 'You're such a t**t'.\n\nThe episode also saw Horner explain who he believes is responsible for his sacking, after speculation at the time suggested that star driver Max Verstappen and his father Jos may have played their roles.\n\n'His father has never been my biggest fan,' Horner admitted when asked if it had been the Verstappens who wielded the axe. 'He's been outspoken about me.\n\n'But I don't believe the Verstappens were responsible in any way. I think this was a decision that was made by Oliver Mintzlaff with Helmut (Marko) advising from the sideline.\n\n'Ultimately things changed within the business, the group, the founder died and after Dietrich (Mateschitz's) death I was probably deemed to have too much control.'\n\nIn the months since his sacking, Horner has eyed a return to the sport, sharing last week that he felt he had 'unfinished business in the sport' amid swirling links to rival constructors including Aston Martin.\n\n'But I am not going to come back for just anything,' Horner clarified at the European Motorshow in Dublin. 'I am only going to come back for something that can win.\n\n\n\n'I don't want to go back in the paddock unless I have something to do. I miss the sport, I miss the people, I miss the team that I built.'"

'What we couldn't have known then is just how far your joy, combined with your dedication and faith, could take you.\n\n'You have never forgotten your values, faith, or people who have supported you along the way. That means more to us than any goal, trophy, or contract ever could.\n\nBukayo Saka was left unable to speak as he read aloud a letter from his parents after signing a new Arsenal contract\n\n'Remember, success is not measured only in achievements, but in character. Keep smiling Bukayo, enjoy this journey. Keep believing and keep being the example you are to so many young people who look up to you.'\n\nAs he finished reading out the letter on CNN, who had presented it to him, Saka struggled to speak as he was left on the verge of tears.\n\n'Wow,' he managed. 'I don't see my mum and dad speak with me a lot like this.\n\n'I am pretty speechless. It's amazing. I don't know what to say apart from thank you to them. I wouldn't be here without them.\n\n'Their journey is, for me, inspiring. From being in Nigeria to where we are today as a family... the only explanation is God.\n\n'It is not normal. There is a one-in-a-million chance. I am so grateful and this is beautiful'.\n\nHaving won individual plaudits for both Arsenal and England performances, the missing piece in Saka's career to date is silverware.\n\nArteta's Gunners are hunting down a first Premier League title since his promising appointment in 2019, and currently sit four points clear of chasers Manchester City.\n\nThey also remain competitive in all four club competitions this season, with next month's Carabao Cup final against Man City the first opportunity to win a trophy."

            "content": "How Erling Haaland's game has transformed in the absence of Man City wingers - and why Pep Guardiola is loving his new 'main character'\n\nUnlock more from Jack Gaughan inside the Manchester City camp with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight, analysis and more\n\nThe look was perfect. Emile Heskey wore it so well, that strange cocktail of exasperated indignation. You’re asking me about Erling Haaland? Ah, come on.\n\nHeskey, sat on upholstered leather to bring an air of authority to proceedings – those proceedings being to goad an ex-professional into saying something inflammatory on video for social media, all in the name of betting advertising – briefly weighed up the question of whether Haaland is 'world class'.\n\nHe answered 'no' and then the edited footage cuts to the former Liverpool striker explaining why, presumably to somebody who raised surprise in an action that now had him all of a fluster. ‘World class? Tell me what he does apart from scoring goals. Tell me what he does apart from scoring goals.’\n\nHeskey knows a thing or two about goals of course, having registered one in five games at club level and one in nine for England during a career that saw him clean up at Birmingham City’s Player of the Year Awards in 2005.\n\nThese days he spends a bit of his time flogging CBD online but here we are instead focusing on his suggestion that Haaland is selling snake oil to anybody who thinks he’s an elite striker.\n\nHeskey’s sons, Jaden and Reigan, are both products of Manchester City’s academy and have regularly trained alongside Haaland, so are perhaps in a better position to determine the 25-year-old record-breaker’s skillset from the perspective of somebody who has seen him close up.\n\nErling Haaland chases down the ball against Newcastle last Saturday during a dynamic display in which he had his most touches yet in a Premier League match, at 43\n\nHaaland set up Nico O'Reilly for City's second goal. The Norwegian has three assists since City's formation switch\n\nTheir old man’s game was predicated on doing the donkey work, allowing others to grab headlines. He did this expertly by bringing midfielders into play, occupying defenders, creating channels for others, generally enjoying the physicality of the Premier League.\n\nThat description does bring a man to mind, actually. Long hair, Scandinavian. Fastest ever to 100 Premier League goals. Second in this year’s assist charts with seven, behind only Bruno Fernandes. Part of a leadership team handpicked by the great Pep Guardiola. Seems like a full package. World class, you might say.\n\nDiscussion around what Haaland does or does not do came back round last weekend, when City squeezed past Newcastle United. The best all-round performance of his career has been the shout from a section of observers and Wayne Rooney gushed over the nature of it. ‘It’s a performance I will never forget,’ Guardiola said, having already held Haaland up as an example to his team-mates in the dressing room after the 2-1 victory.\n\nBasically the message was to remember what he put in for the cause, the commitment and desire, the sort of which is non-negotiable if City are to beat Arsenal to this title.\n\nHaaland ran, defended, hustled like a man possessed. He bundled Dan Burn about as if the giant defender was a rookie on the slight side. There he was, heading away a dangerous corner in the dying seconds. He didn’t score but assisted beautifully for Nico O’Reilly’s second, standing up a right-foot cross to the back post. Haaland admired it as O’Reilly headed in before darting off to celebrate with the scorer.\n\n‘You can see his joy when other people succeed,’ Norway head coach Stale Solbakken has told Daily Mail Sport. ‘That is big proof of what a team player he is.’ Some City players have been somewhat surprised by his collegiate attitude over the years; that attribute is partly why Guardiola handed him more responsibility last summer.\n\nHis numbers against Newcastle paint a picture. A career-high 12 duels. His most touches in a Premier League match, at 43. No City player completed more clearances, albeit that is dependent on which source and what they determine a clearance to be.\n\nHis average position by the centre circle was about 20 yards deeper than fellow forward Omar Marmoush, which is a product of Guardiola going with two up front and a box midfield in recent weeks. ‘We’ll see what we do when the wingers (Jeremy Doku and Savinho) are back,’ the City manager said. ‘I think he adapted perfectly. I’m not telling Erling to play left back.’\n\nIt’s no coincidence that Haaland has three assists since the formation switch and is now only one from his league-best tally.\n\n‘It’s a performance I will never forget,’ City manager Pep Guardiola said of Haaland's efforts against Newcastle\n\nHaaland's average position by the centre circle was about 20 yards deeper than fellow forward Omar Marmoush (Phil Foden, Rayan Cherki and Abdukodir Khusanov were all substitutes)\n\nThese bits are significant indicators of a complete centre forward, more Harry Kane than Cristiano Ronaldo. And it is a trend. The conversations around how Haaland’s game has been transformed, doing more for the team and not ‘just’ scoring an inordinate number of goals, have now surfaced at least four times this season.\n\nThe draw at Arsenal. Beating United in September’s derby – before which Haaland was a central figure in a team meeting about raising standards and when he completed more defensive actions than that Newcastle match. And after a home win against Bournemouth. Each display prompted discourse about his style, the sort of which that has that guy at the end of the bar earnestly offering that Haaland’s not just about goals anymore, you know.\n\nThat this talk about an improvement outside of his recognised zone, between the posts, happens periodically and presented as new begs the question: has he actually always been like this?\n\nThe answer is yes and no, although it certainly looks to the naked eye that he has grown into a main character of City’s build-up play. And often that is more instructive than the raw stats. Heading and City relying upon his size is the main upturn – and a drastic one. This has been an area that Haaland’s worked on for a long while, particularly with Marco Rose at Borussia Dortmund, and one he knew needed elevating.\n\nWhile the number of aerial duels he battles in is only up marginally per 90 minutes, 3.9 now compared to 3.55 last year and 3.2 during his first season, City are seeing far better results. Haaland now wins 64 per cent of those, up from an average of around 50.\n\nHis dribbling statistics are on an upward curve, one deft slalom against Newcastle given the slow-motion treatment by City’s video team this week. He takes on more of those per game and completes 40 per cent.\n\nBut then there are the others. Winning back possession in the final third is better than last year but not as prevalent as in 2023-24. Passes played into the box is half of the Treble year. Expected assists are broadly the same as his other three campaigns, chances created from open play are actually lower than ever - even if through-balls are now far higher than his normal average.\n\nAverage number of touches – the metric that detractors became obsessed by – are lower than his first two seasons, 24 now and 27 in that blistering first term when plenty mocked his lack of general involvement. But this takes into account the whole season, not just the period that City have been wingerless. Anyway, it's a funny old game. He’d not felt the ball once before a 15th-minute opener in Monaco and nobody mentioned it.\n\nHaaland is now winning far more of his aerial duels: 64 per cent up from an average of around 50\n\nHaaland's stats for winning back possession in the final third are better than last year\n\nOften the sheer weight of goals distract from everything else and perhaps the amazement of those feats wearing off has seen pundits look for other things in his game to highlight.\n\nCertainly working for the team is nothing new, Haaland particularly pleased with a decoy run to distract Juan Foyth, allowing Bernardo Silva to score, away at Villarreal in October as a recent example, even if dropping deep is.\n\nRoughing up William Saliba and Gabriel in the 2023 title showdown with Arsenal is a memorable display of force and doing the dirty stuff, while Norway marvelled at the way he pressed, ran channels and held up possession as they secured a vital World Cup qualification win over Italy in June.\n\nTactically, they are seeing him have a greater awareness of what is required, especially against supposedly superior opposition. And that is maybe where this year’s difference comes: the statistics are similar but it’s learning how best to utilise those opportunities to the betterment of players around him.\n\nEven as the league’s top scorer on 22, there have been struggles. A barren spell in front of goal either side of new year is being worked through and he is still not entirely out of that yet. Coming out of the dressing room at Anfield in his sliders, Haaland insisted there was ‘no excuse’ for his form and he has still only scored one from open play in his last 10 league games.\n\nHe has refused to put this down to fatigue, even if Guardiola has labelled him ‘exhausted’ and attempted to give rest where possible, Haaland benched for victory over Wolves last month. Haaland is between houses at the moment, the family temporarily moving down near Crewe, and spent some of his three days off after Newcastle in Paris.\n\nLeeds United next, the city of his birth, as the first half of the run-in starts motoring. City undoubtedly need him to start scoring regularly now and Guardiola has spoken candidly about the pressures the club’s No 9 places upon himself.\n\nHaaland celebrates scoring against Fulham with Phil Foden but he only has one goal from open play in his last 10 league games\n\n'The problem with Erling is that he has to deal with his own numbers and expectations,’ Guardiola says. ‘We won the Treble because he scored I don’t know how many goals'\n\n‘The problem with Erling is that he has to deal with his own numbers and expectations,’ Guardiola said. ‘That is the challenge for him. When your expectation is five goals a season, you can improve. We won the Treble because he arrived, he scored I don’t know how many goals (52), and the expectations are there.\n\n‘When you go four or five games without scoring, it is like “Oh what happened, what happened?” He puts a lot of responsibility on himself. He is a guy who desperately wants to help the team and the club. I always say to him not to put too much pressure (on himself).\n\n‘He knows how much we need him, he doesn’t want to leave the team disappointed. That is a big attribute. I would prefer that to somebody who doesn’t care. He’s completely the opposite, he suffers when he doesn’t score a goal. Don’t suffer, you do your best.’\n\n\n\nThe best will never be enough for some."

The BBC broadcasts of the Games had 26.3million viewers in all.\n\nIt’s not the only time lately when that experience of tuning in to something transcending clicks and instant gratification was to be found on the BBC. Against a beautiful Peak District backdrop, Macclesfield’s defeat of Crystal Palace unfolded before our eyes on a sunny Saturday lunchtime in early January.\n\nThe ensuing digital clips were fine – bandaged captain Paul Dawson leaping to score and sending the roof off that modest stadium – but it was the unfolding match, the national suspense, the collective willing-on of the underdogs, the excellent Mark Chapman’s half-time talk with the Macclesfield manager’s brother, Wayne Rooney – which made it so fine and compelling.\n\nSport as it actually unfolds. Sport with its myriad dramas and unpredictabilities. Sport as we had once come to expect it from the broadcaster which takes our licence fee.\n\nThe BBC's Winter Olympics coverage showed sport as it actually unfolds. Sport with its myriad dramas and unpredictabilities... not merely social media clips\n\nAgainst a beautiful Peak District backdrop, Macclesfield’s defeat of Crystal Palace unfolded before our eyes on a sunny Saturday lunchtime in early January\n\nThe media landscape is changing at a mesmerising pace. The BBC, in the throes of existential crisis, are facing the financial challenge of streaming platforms which are making the commercial battle for live sport extremely competitive.\n\nBut it was not just those of us brought up on the live football commentary of John Motson, Barry Davies and the great Hugh Johns whose hearts were heavy when hearing the BBC’s director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski tell the Financial Times Business of Football summit that you don’t need to show live sport to stay relevant.\n\n‘We’re not competing against who we were competing with before,’ he said. ‘The BBC might have thought, traditionally, it was up against ITV, or Sky, or other broadcasters. Well, guess what? We’re not. We’re in a race to not be swiped. Up against people selling you holidays, or clothes companies, or two-for-one chicken breasts on sale from the supermarket, or football teams, or athletes.\n\n‘We still have reporting and live pages and digital video that draw in millions and millions and millions of people. You can still be relevant - you can still matter - if you don’t show the sport.’\n\nBBC Sport’s need for intellectual curiosity and imagination in a complicated media landscape extending far beyond outside broadcasts is undeniable. All in the industry are facing the same challenge. Clips are certainly working for them in terms of Premier League, Champions League and cricket coverage.\n\nBut it was what Kay-Jelski didn’t say, as well as his bleak and provocative suggestion that the BBC’s sports output is competing with poultry purveyors, which reinforced the sense that the national broadcaster have given up on live sport, in their pursuit of digital clicks.\n\nWhat you really wanted to hear was that BBC Sport are fighting for their lives to hold on to the rights of sports held dearest by the British public, in the face of aggressive streamers who want to monetise them. That the list of televised sport's free-to-air ‘crown jewels’ must, as a matter of national significance, be extended to preserve them for those who cannot or will not pay for an ever-growing number of commercial bolt-ons.\n\nA group of MPs have let it be known that they are supportive of such an extension. Here was some momentum to seize on. On all of the above, we heard nothing.\n\nThe BBC’s director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski told the Financial Times Business of Football summit that you don’t need to show live sport to stay relevant\n\nSome broadcast staff in the BBC’s Six Nations coverage, already split with ITV, are thought to be wondering how secure the future looks. Wimbledon five years from now? Who knows?\n\nThe Boat Race is the most recent live sport event lost from the BBC, with word coming down last autumn that the corporation had ‘fallen out of love’ with it. Granted, not an event guaranteed to feed the clips or ‘second screen’ culture. But one which is still held in huge national affection, with a 2.6million viewership.\n\nThe event, enthusiastically picked up by Channel 4, has now gone the same way as the Grand National, The Open, Test cricket, the Paralympics and Royal Ascot. Each of those pillars of British sport came with the licence fee in the early 1990s. No more.\n\nThis summer will see the Commonwealth Games not staged on the BBC for the first time – a disaster for organisers involved in their own fight for relevance. The Games have been picked up by TNT Sports.\n\nThat’s the same broadcaster whose low-rent coverage of the Ashes this winter was encapsulated by commentator Rob Hatch mistaking a replay of Jamie Smith's run-out as a live wicket and excitedly announcing that Ben Stokes had been dismissed.\n\nIn December, my colleague Mike Keegan’s reporting provided a graphic sense of how the BBC’s pivot to digital content, and the 16-24-year-old demographic it craves, is being viewed by staffers who believe in the concept of covering sports news on TV. His report related how a Q&A session with senior management, called a ‘culture cafe’ became a ‘slanging match’ at times.\n\nIt also highlighted how, in the same pursuit of the digital traffic, BBC Sport have recruited dedicated correspondents for Liverpool, Newcastle United, Chelsea and the Manchester clubs, as well as a ‘football tactics correspondent’ and a ‘football issues correspondent'. Chasing online audiences which the nation’s big clubs bring does not cohere with a Royal Charter which that states the BBC should be for everyone.\n\nKay-Jelski’s words this week suggested that he is fine with facing down the criticism. ‘It’s OK if a lot of these innovations don’t make everybody happy,’ he said. ‘It’s also OK if some of the traditional forms of its media content or sporting content don’t make people happy.’\n\nHow long before Wimbledon joins Sue Barker in departing our free-to-air screens?\n\nBut for two weeks this month, we were reminded that linear TV is not dead, as we sat together in front of the box in the corner of the room and watched skiers and snowboarders and skaters fly in northern Italy.\n\nWe witnessed the extraordinary outcome when BBC Sport commentators, editors, engineers and studio staff cohere. We were reminded of the understated brilliance of Hazel Irvine, one of the nation’s very best sports presenters.\n\nAnd it was all ours to view, for free. The very best of our licence fee.\n\nMy friend bought his young kids a carpet curling kit and says they were so besotted that they practised every day of the Games. Such is the wonder and absorption that live sport brings. You don’t fall in love with clips."

            "content": "Earlier this week, before his devastating hundred hurtled England into the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup, Harry Brook sauntered into a press conference, clocked the facial expressions of those present and suggested a smile or two wouldn’t go amiss.\n\nNaturally, there have been times during what has been the most harrowing of winters for Brook that facing questions from the media was the last thing he wanted to do. But the jovial nature of that entrance in Pallekele here in Sri Lanka told of his desire to move on and embrace the next chapter of his England captaincy.\n\nThere is no doubt that he is in a much happier place since this World Cup began, despite the revelations on its eve that he lied about being alone on the Halloween night out that ended with him being struck by a Wellington bouncer.\n\nThere is an irony here, because without the Yorkshireman’s honest testimony - coming clean to England coach Brendon McCullum during the final one-day international at Wellington's Sky Stadium on November 1 - there is a chance the episode might never have come out.\n\nFor the original story entered the public domain during England’s Ashes tour not because of the incident itself, but the fact he’d been reprimanded and fined £30,000 by his ECB bosses as a result. Equally, it was loyalty to team-mates Jacob Bethell and Josh Tongue that led Brook, in taking responsibility and apologising for his own actions, to say that he had been on his own.\n\nNot great optics, some will argue, and it led to further scrutiny from the outside world in the form of an ongoing investigation by the Cricket Regulator. But it has arguably strengthened Brook’s standing within the England dressing room - other players respect him. And they are increasingly his players.\n\nHarry Brook's attempts to protect his team-mates have strengthened his standing within the England dressing room\n\nBrook points to the heavens in memory of his grandmother Pauline after reaching his 50-ball hundred in Pallekele on Tuesday\n\nOver the course of his 10-month tenure, Brook’s influence on selection has shown itself with the recalls of Will Jacks and Tom Banton, two of his former England Under 19s team-mates, even if another close friend in Brydon Carse has fallen by the wayside.\n\nJacks has found himself in a new role at No 7, while Brook confessed at the start of this tournament that he did not necessarily have a specific position for Banton, just that he knew he wanted him in his first-choice XI. Liam Dawson was recalled from the international wilderness at the start of last summer. Surrounding himself with old friends, people with whom he shares mutual trust, has had the desired effect on and off the field.\n\nA strong bond has developed with Bethell, the team’s unofficial vice-captain and whose adventurous nature led to walks together through leafy Kandy, seeking out the best coffee shops.\n\nAway from the game, Brook lost his grandmother Pauline - whom he called his ‘rock’ - two years ago this month. She was someone who in typical Yorkshire style told him how things were. Berated him for bad shots. Or poor choices. Loved him unconditionally. Poignantly, he looked to the heavens in her memory when he reached three figures in Pallekele.\n\nGuidance more recently has come from his manager Phil Weston, the former Worcestershire and Gloucestershire player, whom he acknowledged has been an ‘amazing’ support as trouble shadowed him these past few months.\n\nBrook’s mum, Lucy, has been around too and was present for his 27th birthday last Sunday, including a 'cake smash' after victory over the tournament co-hosts Sri Lanka, in which Bethell appeared to take great delight in the smearing of sponge and cream into the England captain’s face.\n\nThat took place at the team hotel in Kandy where two nights later in the bar, a posse of England players, mingling happily with fans, raised glasses to the 100 that had downed Pakistan by two wickets - booking the first ticket to the final four in the process.\n\nThere is a time and a place for such things, of course, and no one would be so prudish as to deny them a chance to celebrate success three nights before what is for England a dead-rubber against New Zealand on Friday.\n\nEngland are operating to a self-imposed curfew of midnight on non-matchdays during this tournament, but there has been no need for an alcohol ban, just a much more mature approach to its consumption in the light of an Ashes dogged by forensic examination of boozy incidents.\n\nBrook smashes a straight six on the way to his 50-ball century against Pakistan\n\nWill Jacks congratulates Brook on his ton. Brook wanted Jacks in the team and the all-rounder's presence is a sign of the captain's growing influence on selection\n\nFor one, there is not much opportunity for nights out in a World Cup schedule that has generally been travel, practice, play, repeat. Although they did stop off in Colombo in transit from Kolkata to Kandy last week, allowing a group of 20 and 30-somethings to act like 20s and 30-something men and enjoy some downtime.\n\nGolf and padel have been on the agenda, but watching Brook’s mastery of the Pakistan bowling attack on Tuesday was a reminder that to him cricket always comes first.\n\nMultiple publishers were interested in Brook writing a book this winter, charting a rise from West Yorkshire village club Burley-in-Wharfedale to a Test batsman averaging mid-50s, but he postponed it, citing a desire to retain full focus on England’s tour Down Under.\n\nSince resuming his limited-overs captaincy, he has orchestrated five wins out of six in bilateral matches here in Sri Lanka - using the defence of just 128 in the final T20 as a reference point during team meetings for maintaining a never-say-die-attitude at this tournament.\n\nImprovements have been noticeable both in terms of tactics and temperament: an instinct call to open the bowling with Jacks despite a competition economy rate touching 14 rushed the Sri Lankans to Super Eight defeat last weekend, while slowing his bowlers down between deliveries to regain composure proved a crucial factor in the last-ball thriller versus Nepal. Pre-match chats have not altered, with input from Brook and Brendon McCullum bookending thoughts from the floor.\n\nBut several members of the squad have reflected on the increasingly symbiotic relationship of Brook and McCullum, which would bode well for the future if the New Zealander were secure in his position.\n\nHowever, the threat of post-Ashes change coincides with Ben Stokes being assigned a ‘coaching’ role with England Lions in the UAE, effectively increasing contact time with Andrew Flintoff following their partnership at Northern Superchargers last August. Such arrangements might just be coincidence, of course.\n\nBrook calls McCullum the best coach he’s known, and immediately credited him as the mastermind behind the move to No 3 that saw him destroy the Pakistan attack.\n\nBrook calls England coach Brendon McCullum the best he’s known and credited him as the mastermind behind the move to No 3 that saw him destroy Pakistan\n\nLike Ben Stokes before him, the responsibility of captaincy appears to be having a maturing effect on Brook\n\nThose close to him joke that Brook wears his intelligence lightly - Joe Root playfully dubbed him an 'idiot' last year. Yet his cricketing smarts are there for all to see.\n\nTake that 50-ball hundred when in conjunction with Sam Curran and Jacks - fellow gym bunnies - the Pakistanis were run ragged on Pallekele’s huge expanses, conceding nine twos in addition to Brook’s 14 boundaries. He later joked that his 2023 self would have carried too much timber to have seen through the plan.\n\nLike Stokes before him, the responsibility of captaincy appears to be having a maturing effect, even if there are blips - like the too-close-to-the-bone Stone Cold Steve Austin beer slam celebration marking his one-day hundred here in Colombo last month.\n\nThe thousands of supporters that flocked to Australia did so in the hope of witnessing such hundreds there, not brain fades that gifted his wicket away.\n\nBut hope remains that his first truly match-defining international innings can raise smiles until what is the very latest point on England’s winter schedule - the final in Ahmedabad a week on Saturday - seeing him emulate Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler as World Cup-winning captains."

(0:18)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Charlotte's Kon Knueppel reached yet another milestone in a remarkable rookie season for the No. 4 pick out of Duke.\n\nThe Hornets swingman broke Keegan Murray's NBA rookie record for 3-pointers, making his 207th on Thursday night against the Indiana Pacers. Knueppel connected on five 3s in the first half and then broke the record in the third quarter off an assist from Sion James, his former college teammate with the Blue Devils.\n\nHe finished with 28 points in the 133-109 win, with his 8 3s (on 12 attempts) tying his career high and landing just one shy of tying the NBA rookie record. He leads the NBA with 209 3s.\n\n\"It's really just about making the right basketball play,\" Knueppel said after the win. \"My teammates are setting good screens and setting me up in good spots. The coaches as well. I'm just out there looking to make the right play for my team.\"\n\nIt took Murray 80 games in 2022-23 to establish the record -- and Knueppel just 59 to surpass it. He said he did not realize the magnitude of the shot that set the mark.\n\n\"Honestly, I thought I needed seven,\" Knueppel said.\n\nGolden State's Stephen Curry holds the single-season NBA record with 402 3s.\n\nKnueppel is shooting 44.2% from beyond the arc, making him a contender for NBA Rookie of the Year along with his former college teammate and roommate Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 pick of the Dallas Mavericks. He has also helped propel the long-suffering Hornets into playoff contention; Charlotte has not made the playoffs since the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"It's what elevates our whole culture when you have a guy that's that good, but that humble, no ego -- it becomes contagious throughout your whole organization,\" Hornets coach Charles Lee told CGTN Sports Scene after Knueppel eclipsed 200 3s on Tuesday night.\n\nKnueppel has been a perfect fit in second-year coach Lee's offense alongside playmaker LaMelo Ball by finding open spots on the court -- a skill he attributes to playing in his father's men's league against taller competition beginning as an eighth grader growing up in Milwaukee.\n\nKnueppel has thrived as a catch-and-shoot player with 93% of his 3s this season coming off assists entering Thursday night, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nHe has turned heads across the league with his high shooting percentage.\n\nCurry, the NBA's career leader in 3s, made 166 on 380 attempts as a rookie with the Warriors in 80 games in 2009-10. Knueppel has now attempted 473 3s.\n\n\"He can obviously shoot the ball at a high level,\" Curry said after a recent game against the Hornets. \"You can't really leave him open at all as he has such a quick release and shoots with confidence. And his playmaking is very underrated. His game just suits the NBA style, whether it's fast-paced or a slowed-down possession game.\"\n\nKnueppel surpassed Donovan Mitchell, who is third on the list of 3s made by a rookie, in a loss to the Cavaliers on Feb. 20.\n\nMitchell joked that he heard about it after the game from Cavs teammate Tyrese Proctor, who played with Knueppel at Duke.\n\n\"He's talented,\" Mitchell said of Knueppel. \"For him to be a rookie and be able to go out there and make it look effortless. ... We know he can shoot the ball, right? But I think him getting to the midrange and play-develop in the small pick-and-roll that is something I think is really unique about his game is being able to do that and create advantages for himself.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting with him and Coop for rookie of the year.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

His Buckeyes teammate Arvell Reese, the No. 3 player on Kiper's big board, also ran a 4.46 in the 40, tying them for the best times among all players who ran Thursday night.\n\nTo put Styles' vertical jump into context, it was better than Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who at 6-5, 239 pounds, had a 42½-inch vertical jump at the 2007 combine. Styles' jump was also better than current Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori, whose 43-inch jump was the best at the 2025 combine.\n\nStyles' broad jump was also best among all players who took part Thursday, and he was the only player among the defensive linemen and linebackers to top 11 feet.\n\nReese did not do any of the jumps in the workout, but did do position drills.\n\nStyles, who played almost exclusively at middle linebacker for the Buckeyes this past season, said earlier this week that he felt ready to show the league's personnel evaluators what he could do on the field.\n\n\"I think I would say that -- the great defenses you look at, there's at least two or three guys who can play a multitude of roles,'' Styles said. \"Like for example, this year for the Seahawks, Nick Emmanwori was a versatile player, and when you have guys like that on your defense, you're able to do a lot of different things as a coordinator.''"

Today I scored two goals, and that's what matters,\" Neymar told SporTV. \"That's football. One day you're no good or you're 'retired'; the next, people say you have to go to the World Cup.\n\n\"I'm dedicating myself and working to get in the best possible shape. This was my third game of the year and only my second full 90 minutes. I felt some cramping at the end, but that's just part of the process.\"\n\nNeymar underwent surgery at the beginning of 2026 and only recently returned to the field for Santos. Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti has said repeatedly that Neymar would be considered for selection for the World Cup if he was fit.\n\nAfter scoring the opening goal in the 25th minute, the Santos No. 10 celebrated by heading to the corner flag to perform the same dance Vinícius Júnior did after scoring in both legs of the Real Madrid's Champions League playoff matchup against Benfica.\n\n\"The little dance [I did] was for Vinicius Jr.,\" Neymar said.\n\n\"I told him, when he scored his first goal in Portugal, they insulted him, were racist towards him and everything else, I told him 'you score a goal and do the same celebration, if I score a goal, I'll do the same'. Vini, it's for you.\"\n\nVasco drew level before halftime, but Neymar scored again in the second half to put the game away for Santos.\n\nThe festive atmosphere for Neymar and Santos fans was briefly interrupted following a heated altercation with Vasco midfielder Thiago Mendes. The friction between Neymar and Mendes dates back to 2020 when a challenge from Mendes resulted in a serious injury for Neymar during a PSG match against Lyon.\n\nNeymar didn't hold back when discussing the confrontation.\n\n\"He always wants to cause trouble and act tough. He already broke me once at PSG, and he threatened me again today. It's always the same with him,\" Neymar said.\n\nThis brace marks Neymar's first goals since December 2025, when he closed out the previous year with a two-goal performance against Juventude."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Division I football rules makers have proposed a one-year trial rule allowing a player disqualified for targeting for the first time to play in his team's next game regardless of which half the penalty was assessed, the NCAA announced Thursday.\n\nCurrently, players disqualified for targeting must sit out the rest of the game and, if the penalty occurs in the second half, sit out the first half of the next game.\n\nUnder the Division I Football Rules Subcommittee's proposal, a player disqualified for targeting a second time during the season would sit out the first half of the next game. A third targeting ejection in the same season would cause the offending player to sit out the entire next game.\n\nTargeting is forcible contact with an opponent's head or neck area in which the offending player often uses the crown of his helmet to make contact or launches his body into the opposing player above the shoulders.\n\nOversight committees for the Bowl Subdivision and Championship Subdivision must approve proposals before they become official. Those committees meet next month.\n\n\"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said A.J. Edds, rules subcommittee chair and vice president of football administration for the Big Ten. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n\nDress code:\n\nThe rules subcommittee proposed that players wear leg coverings from the top of their shoes to the bottom of their pants. Players would have to wear the same covering style and colors for that particular game.\n\nPlayers out of compliance with the rule would have to leave the game for at least one down and correct the issue. A team would receive a warning for the first offense.\n\nIf a team has a second offense under this proposal, the offending team would be given a 5-yard penalty. Any subsequent violations of the rule would result in a 15-yard penalty.\n\n\"The current look of the uniform is clearly not meeting the expectations of the college football community,\" Edds said. \"This will take a collective effort by administrators, coaches and officials to communicate expectations to players and equipment managers. This proposal, we believe, is definitive and gives us a chance for consistent enforcement across Division I football.\"\n\nTexas head coach Steve Sarkisian was amused by the proposal, saying, \"I'm just trying to figure out how we're going to police socks to pants.\"\n\n\"The NFL has that rule and they fine the players when they don't meet their uniform requirements,\" he said. \"Are we hiring uniform police that the NFL does, and they come and they assess every player and they dock them pay and they fine them for when they're suited properly? I would assume instead of worrying about socks to pants, are we going to tuck in our shirts? We've got T-shirts hanging out down to our knees now. There's a lot of things, but for that to come up as being an issue seems kind of odd.\"\n\nFair catch kicks:\n\nUnder a proposal, a team could choose to attempt a fair catch kick after a completed or awarded fair catch. The kick would be a field goal place kick with a holder or a drop kick from the spot where the returner caught the ball. The defense would be at least 10 yards from the spot of the kick.\n\nIf the ensuing kick goes through the uprights, it would be worth three points.\n\nSubcommittee members believe adding the rule would align Division I rules with those in the NFL and high school football. The rarely used play came up in 2024 in the NFL when the Los Angeles Chargers' Cameron Dicker converted from 57 yards against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

(2:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Miami Dolphins ranked first in the NFL Players Association annual report cards, according to survey results obtained by ESPN. The Minnesota Vikings finished second, followed by the Washington Commanders in third.\n\n\"Players consistently describe the organization as 'the best in the NFL,'\" the NFLPA survey wrote about the Dolphins.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished last for the first time in the four-year history of the union's survey. Last year, the Steelers ranked 28th. The Arizona Cardinals finished 31st in the 2026 survey, after a last-place finish in 2025, and the Cleveland Browns finished in 30th, the same as in 2025.\n\nThe NFLPA is not making the report cards public this year after a grievance filed by the NFL, which said the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. Earlier this month, an arbitrator agreed with the league, saying the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses for report cards even if it can't publish them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment.\n\nAn NFL spokesperson also declined to comment, saying that, as in previous years, the league had no knowledge of the survey. The league sent a memo to all teams later Thursday, saying that, as the arbitration hearing showed, the survey results are \"neither reliable nor scientifically valid.\"\n\n\"... We continue to recommend that clubs prioritize feedback and information provided directly by their own players rather than relying on the NFLPA's agenda-driven exercise,\" the league said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by ESPN. \"We further recommend that Clubs refrain from commenting or engaging publicly on the alleged survey and Report Card results.\"\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A-plus to F-minus on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and it was conducted from Nov. 2 to Dec. 11.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" according to the survey.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest-rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" according to the survey. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers' locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers' training room lacks updated recovery technology and \"modalities.\" Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, though the training staff ranked first.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium, \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A-plus to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the survey. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be, according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives, and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

Of those, 12 places are reserved for UEFA qualifying group winners, with the other four coming via the play-offs.\n\nThe 12 group runners-up will be joined by four teams who finished outside the top two of their respective qualifying groups, who were the 'best performers' in the 2024/25 Nations League.\n\nImage: Troy Parrott's stunning hat-trick against Hungary saw the Republic of Ireland secure a shock play-off spot\n\nHere are the final standings from each of the 12 groups:\n\nGroup A: Germany qualified, Slovakia and Northern Ireland into play-offs\n\nGermany qualified, and into play-offs Group B: Switzerland qualified, Kosovo and Sweden into play-offs\n\nSwitzerland qualified, and into play-offs Group C: Scotland qualified, Denmark into play-offs\n\nScotland qualified, into play-offs Group D: France qualified, Ukraine into play-offs\n\nFrance qualified, into play-offs Group E: Spain qualified, Turkey into play-offs\n\nSpain qualified, into play-offs Group F: Portugal qualified, Republic of Ireland into play-offs\n\nPortugal qualified, into play-offs Group G: Netherlands qualified, Poland into play-offs\n\nNetherlands qualified, into play-offs Group H: Austria qualified, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Romania into play-offs\n\nAustria qualified, and into play-offs Group I: Norway qualified, Italy into play-offs\n\nNorway qualified, into play-offs Group J: Belgium qualified, Wales and North Macedonia into play-offs\n\nBelgium qualified, and into play-offs Group K: England qualified, Albania into play-offs\n\nEngland qualified, into play-offs Group L: Croatia qualified, Czech Republic into play-offs\n\nCould every home nation be at the World Cup?\n\nNo!

More often than not, this means the four additional play-off spots are filled by four of the 14 Nations League group winners.\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:"

We share your grief. India stands with Israel, firmly, with full conviction, in this moment, and beyond,\" he said.\n\nEarlier too, India had condemned the deadly attack and expressed solidarity with Israel, while also voicing concern over civilian casualties in Gaza and reiterating its support for a two-state solution.\n\nThe two countries also concluded over a dozen bilateral agreements, including on cybersecurity, trade, space exploration, education, investment, agriculture and economic cooperation.\n\nAdditionally, Israel pledged to allow another 50,000 Indian workers into the country over the next five years while India has said that it would extend its landmark digital payment system - UPI - to Israel, boosting digital finance cooperation between the two countries.\n\nIn the joint statement, the two leaders also \"unequivocally condemned terrorism\" and cross-border terrorism and lauded US President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza.\n\n\"India's thinking is clear: humanity must never become a victim of conflict.

            "content": "Nigerian music producer and artiste, Philkeyz has shared what he says is the major reason why Nigerian musicians are gaining global recognition.\n\nAccording to him, the artistes making it possible are not succeeding because of the country, as most people may think, but because of their individual personalities.\n\nSpeaking with Roselyn Felli on Changes on Joy Prime, the ‘Nesesari’ hitmaker stated that individual musicians must cultivate a strong sense of drive in their craft and be persistent in chasing success.\n\nThis, he explained, helps them reach the greater heights they aspire to.\n\n“It’s not about Nigeria-Ghana. It’s like an individual thing. You have to want it so bad that even when you fail, you’ll come back to the drawing board and strategise what you’re doing wrong from the other person who is doing same and selling out stadiums.”\n\nHe added that an artiste’s craft is like a company; therefore, if it is heading in the wrong direction, it needs to be restructured. This makes success more a result of individual hard work than of the country.\n\n“Let me give you an example, Akon is African, he signed Lady Gaga for crying out loud and he’s huge worldwide. It’s a person thing and if you say I would be this person that I want to be, you’ll do it actually. So it’s not a thing of this artiste is bigger.”\n\nPhilkeyz further noted that Nigerians have a strong go-getter attitude and are always striving to win in every space they find themselves in, which is another reason many of them are successful.\n\nAccording to him, there is intense competition among industry players in Nigeria, pushing every artiste to stand out and garner attention. He believes that if this approach is adopted in other African countries, it would help artistes achieve long-term success.\n\nHe urged Ghanaian musicians to stop rivaling Nigerian artistes and instead strive to reach the same heights, emphasizing that both countries’ music industries are performing well.\n\nOver the past few years, several Nigerian artistes, including Wizkid, Davido, Asake, Burna Boy, Rema, and Tiwa Savage, have filled the The O2 Arena and received global recognition at the BET Awards and the Grammy Awards and other international award schemes.\n\nThis has mounted pressure on Ghana’s music industry, as some musicians feel challenged to achieve similar success for Ghana.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "European football takes centre stage with a blockbuster weekend across Ligue 1, the Premier League, Serie A and La Liga, featuring title implications, historic rivalries and crucial points at stake as the season edges closer to its decisive phase.\n\nIn France, attention quickly turns to Paris Saint-Germain’s visit to Le Havre. PSG’s superior depth and attacking firepower make them favourites, but away fixtures in Ligue 1 can be deceptively tricky, especially against a disciplined side eager to frustrate and counter.\n\nThe headline clash, however, sees Marseille host Lyon in one of French football’s fiercest rivalries. Expect a high-intensity encounter shaped by atmosphere, physical battles in midfield and moments of individual brilliance.\n\nThe Premier League schedule is stacked with defining fixtures. Liverpool against West Ham promises an energetic contest, with the Reds looking to maintain pressure in the race for Europe, while West Ham aim to disrupt with organisation and set-piece threat.\n\nLeeds United face a daunting test against Manchester City, whose control in possession and clinical finishing often prove decisive against high-pressing opponents.\n\nManchester United’s meeting with Crystal Palace carries importance in the race for European places, while the standout game sees league leaders and title favourites Arsenal host Chelsea in a heavyweight London derby that could significantly influence the championship narrative.\n\nIn Italy, Inter Milan welcome Genoa in a match they will view as a key opportunity to assert dominance near the summit, particularly with their strong home form.\n\nAC Milan’s trip to face Cremonese is another test of patience against a compact defensive side, while Roma versus Juventus is the marquee fixture of the round.\n\nThis historic rivalry is rarely short on drama, with tactical discipline, defensive organisation and decisive moments in the final third likely to define the outcome.\n\nLa Liga offers its own share of drama, beginning with Barcelona’s clash against Villarreal, a fixture that often delivers open, attacking football. Atletico Madrid’s visit to Real Oviedo demands focus and efficiency against motivated opposition.\n\nThe Seville derby between Real Betis and Sevilla adds fierce local pride to the mix, while Real Madrid hosting Getafe rounds off the action, with Los Blancos expected to push for maximum points as they keep pace in the title race.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Broader data shared during the engagement revealed that 1,780 Africans from 36 countries are believed to have been recruited under similar circumstances to fight against Ukraine.\n\nDescribing the situation as devastating in a social media post, the minister stated: “These are not mere statistics; they are Ghanaian lives cut short, and families shattered.”\n\nHe stressed that Ghana cannot remain indifferent to the growing exploitation of its youth in foreign conflicts.\n\nRead Also: Ablakwa secures rare access to Ghana’s 2 prisoners of war in Ukraine, pushes for their release\n\n“This is not our war. We cannot allow our young people to be used as human shields in a conflict that does not concern Ghana,” he said.\n\nMr Ablakwa also signalled a tougher domestic response, announcing intensified public education and decisive action against recruitment networks.\n\n“We are determined to track and dismantle every illegal recruitment scheme operating within our jurisdiction, including those on the dark web,” he stated.\n\nDuring the visit, Ghanaian officials laid flowers at Kyiv’s Wall of Remembrance in honour of war victims and held discussions on strengthening bilateral cooperation, particularly in combating human trafficking and illegal recruitment.\n\nThe two captured Ghanaians, who were granted consular access, reportedly cautioned fellow citizens against being enticed by promises of financial reward, describing the dangers on the battlefield as grave.\n\nMr Ablakwa added that efforts are underway to protect vulnerable youth and prevent further loss of Ghanaian lives.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Importers must be reasonable and reduce their prices,” he said, appealing to them to act in the national interest.\n\n\n\nAwingobit was responding to a call by the Greater Accra Market Women Association (GAMWA) for importers to lower prices to reflect economic gains and ease the burden on consumers.\n\n\n\nAccording to GAMWA, prices of imported goods remain high despite improvements in key indicators, including a drop in fuel prices from GH¢15 per litre in December 2024 to about GH¢12 by the end of 2025.\n\n\n\n'We will successfully develop the Petroleum Hub project' - Lands Minister\n\n\n\nThe cedi also appreciated by about 40.7 per cent against the dollar by the end of 2025.\n\nAwingobit noted that the Association could not sanction importers who failed to adjust prices because Ghana operated a liberal market economy where prices were not state-controlled.\n\n\n\nHe said the Association had issued appeals to its members and would continue to engage them to reduce prices.\n\n\n\nHe also advised traders to patronise importers who offer reasonable prices.\n\n\n\n“Market women should move from warehouse to warehouse to find suppliers with fair prices.

The company, therefore, could not have utilised seed funds meant for any other LBCs, including Produce Buying Company Limited (PBC), when COCOBOD did not disburse any seed fund,” the company said in a press release dated 24 February 2026.\n\n\n\nThe clarification follows allegations by the Minority in Parliament, led by the Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, that COCOBOD resources were being redirected to benefit Atlas Commodities.\n\n\n\nThe company’s founding Chief Executive Officer, Ato Boateng, currently serves as Deputy Chief Executive (Finance and Administration) at COCOBOD.\n\n\n\nAtlas maintained that its operations have been fully financed through private offtakers and banking partners, adding that documentation is available to verify all transactions.\n\n\n\nBoateng also confirmed that, for the past two cocoa seasons, COCOBOD has not provided seed funding to any Licensed Buying Company (LBC).\n\n\n\nUnder the previous arrangement, COCOBOD disbursed advance capital to LBCs at the beginning of each cocoa season to facilitate cocoa purchases.\n\n\n\nAccording to Atlas, that model ended in the 2024/2025 season, compelling companies to secure their own pre-financing from private sources.\n\n\n\nThe company explained that its current financing structure involves obtaining pre-financing from offtakers and local banks. Cocoa purchased is allocated through COCOBOD’s Cocoa Marketing Company (CMC), and payments are made to Atlas only after independent buyers settle their accounts with COCOBOD.\n\n\n\n“This structure leaves little room for COCOBOD officials to quietly redirect funds to any company,” Atlas stated, arguing that the allegations of misuse are unfounded.\n\n\n\nDespite the company’s response, the Minority continues to call for a forensic audit of warehouse registrations, cocoa movement records, and full disclosure from COCOBOD and National Security, as well as a constitutional determination on potential conflicts of interest.\n\n\n\nAtlas expressed confidence that a proper review of seed fund allocations will vindicate its position and confirm that no public funds have been misdirected in its favour."

            "content": "Sports News of Friday, 27 February 2026\n\nSource: bbc.com\n\nChelsea recorded a pre-tax loss of £355m for 2024-25, according to financial figures released by Uefa.\n\n\n\nIt is the highest annual loss ever made by an English football club, and the second highest in European history, following the £484m Barcelona lost in 2021.\n\n\n\nSo what is the detail behind the numbers?\n\n\n\nChelsea bring in less money than other wealthy PL clubs\n\n\n\nThe report doesn't break down the loss into its component parts, but there are clues.\n\n\n\nUefa's figures show Chelsea's overall revenue was significantly lower than some of their Premier League rivals.\n\n\n\nThe Blues brought in £511m, compared to £746m for Manchester City and £744m for Liverpool.\n\n\n\nThat difference comes from a few key areas.\n\n\n\nChelsea's income from ticket sales was the ninth-highest in Europe but still £28m less than Liverpool, one place ahead of them.\n\n\n\nThe average amount Chelsea made per matchday was £1.2m less than Liverpool, who again were one spot ahead.\n\n\n\nChelsea's matchday revenue is restricted by the capacity of Stamford Bridge, which at 41,798 is only the 11th-biggest ground in the Premier League, 34,000 smaller than Manchester United's Old Trafford.\n\n\n\nThe Blues also made far less in commercial revenue than some of their rivals.\n\n\n\nThey were ranked 11th for commercial revenue in Europe last year, making £207m - £5m down on the previous year.\n\n\n\nThat puts their commercial revenue £66m lower than Tottenham - the next-highest English club - and £165m lower than Manchester City, who brought in more than anyone else in the Premier League.\n\n\n\nChelsea also made far less from merchandising and kit sales than the five other wealthiest Premier League clubs.\n\n\n\nThey generated £83m from that revenue stream - no improvement on the previous year. That is £46m less than Spurs and £82m less than top-ranked Manchester United.\n\n\n\nThe only area in which Chelsea performed impressively in comparison to their rivals was broadcast revenue, with participation and victory in the Fifa Club World Cup boosting income to £192m, putting them second-highest on the list in Europe, behind Manchester City.\n\n\n\nExpenses continue to rise at Stamford Bridge\n\n\n\nChelsea's outgoings were also part of the problem.\n\n\n\nThey were the sixth-highest spenders on wages in Europe, paying their players £388m - £43m more than they did the previous year.\n\n\n\nOnly Liverpool, whose spend was increased by bonuses paid to players for winning the Premier League, and Manchester City were higher in England.\n\n\n\nChelsea also employ the highest number of full-time non-footballer employees at any club in England, with a staff of 1,169.\n\n\n\nThe club's operating costs - including utilities, transport, insurance, marketing, and administration - increased from £159m to £240m, putting them fifth across Europe.\n\n\n\nThe Uefa report makes clear Chelsea's playing squad is the most expensively assembled in football history, costing £1.52bn - a value up 5% from the previous year.\n\n\n\nChelsea have signed many of their players to long-term contracts in order to ensure their value is 'amortised' - spread out over a longer period of time to reduce the yearly cost in the club accounts.\n\n\n\nThe report states \"English clubs' amortisation costs are impacting profitability\", meaning the amount ending up on the cost sheet at the end of each year - from what are effectively deferred transfer payments - is adding to their losses.\n\n\n\n'Chelsea believe they will comply with Uefa rules'\n\n\n\nSources at Chelsea say a number of factors have caused an unfavourable outlook in Uefa's latest report.\n\n\n\nThose factors include asset impairments (an accounting term for when an asset has a lower market value than that listed on a company's balance sheet), settlements tied to historical regulatory matters, and the exiting of legacy contracts.\n\n\n\nThose disclosures are required under the governing body regulations.\n\n\n\nChelsea say they remain profitable on an operating basis, believe they will comply with Uefa's rules, and deny they will have to sell star players to fulfil any regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nAfter a substantial fine in the summer for breaching spending rules, they remain under Uefa scrutiny. And they could face further fines as part of the settlement should they continue to not be compliant.\n\n\n\nBut they point to a profitable season in the transfer market to highlight how they expect to avoid further punishments under the existing agreement."

It was not a decision that Nkrumah made by himself.\"\n\n\n\nFor Pratt, the idea that Nkrumah woke up and declared himself the supreme ruler is inaccurate. He insists the move followed a national vote, not a personal decree.\n\n\n\nHe also dismissed claims that Nkrumah made himself life president under the 1960 Constitution. According to Pratt, a careful reading of that document shows a fixed five-year presidential term.\n\n\n\n\"There's nothing in the 1960 Constitution which makes Nkrumah life president,” he said.\n\n\"Please, they should stop. They should go and read the Constitution again, get their facts right, get their analysis right, and come back for the debate.\"\n\n\n\nPratt broadened the discussion beyond Ghana, noting that many newly independent African, Asian and Latin American countries adopted one-party systems during that era.\n\n\n\n\"Virtually all of them were one-party states,\" he argued. \"So how is that a Nkrumah problem alone?\"\n\n\n\nTo him, the political climate of the time, shaped by post-independence pressures and nation-building challenges, must be considered before assigning blame."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "Progressive Greens win closely watched election in one-time Labour stronghold, while right-wing Reform comes second.\n\nA candidate for the United Kingdom’s left-wing Green Party has comfortably won a closely-watched election for a vacant parliamentary seat, delivering an embarrassing defeat for Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour Party in one of its former strongholds.\n\nResults announced Friday showed the Greens’ Hannah Spencer, a 34-year-old councillor and plumber, had won 40.7 percent of the vote in the by-election in Gorton and Denton, a constituency in Greater Manchester that has been considered a secure Labour seat for almost a century.\n\nIn an outcome that analysts said pointed to the fracturing of the UK’s traditional two-party politics, the hard-right candidate for the populist, anti-immigration Reform finished in second place.\n\nLabour, which had won more than half the vote in Gorton and Denton at the last general election in 2024, finished a bruising third.\n\nThe Green Party has positioned itself as an alternative to Labour, arguing that the governing party has moved away from some of the values it once championed.\n\nThe Greens, and their party leader Zack Polanski, have been vocal in their condemnation of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and their support for Palestinians. Many Labour voters have been infuriated by the government’s ongoing diplomatic support for Israel through the carnage it has wrought in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.\n\nPolitical scientist John Curtice called the result a “seismic moment” that signalled that the “future of British politics looks more uncertain than at any stage” since the end of World War II, the Reuters news agency reported.\n\n\n\nThe result was “clearly disappointing”, said Labour Party chair Anna Turley.\n\nIn her victory speech, Spencer said she felt compelled to call out “politicians and divisive figures who constantly scapegoat and blame our communities for all the problems in society”.\n\nStarmer’s woes continue\n\nThe loss of what had been considered a safe seat, in the country’s biggest electoral test ⁠in nearly a year, adds to the mounting pressure on the embattled Starmer.\n\nThe British leader has faced calls for his resignation amid Labour’s nose-diving popularity and ongoing turmoil, including the arrest of Peter Mandelson, who Starmer had appointed ambassador to the US last year, following revelations surrounding his links to disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nStarmer had personally invested political capital in the outcome by blocking Andy Burnham, the popular Manchester mayor who is widely touted as a potential challenger for the Labour leadership, from standing in the race, and by visiting the constituency before the vote.\n\nDuopoly challenged\n\nSpencer’s victory – the Greens’ first win in a by-election – gives the party its fifth seat in parliament, while the top-polling Reform, which is widely viewed as posing the biggest challenge to the government at the ballot box, has eight.\n\nBoth parties, along with the centrist Liberal Democrats, are polling in double digits, presenting a threat to the traditional Labour-Conservative duopoly in British politics.\n\nNigel Farage, leader of the anti-immigration Reform, claimed on X, without evidence, that the Greens’ win was “a victory for sectarian voting and cheating”, and welcomed forthcoming local elections in May.\n\n“It will be goodbye Starmer and goodbye to the Tory party,” he said.\n\nA Greens spokesperson dismissed Farage’s comments as “an attempt to undermine the democratic result” that was “straight out of the Trump playbook”.\n\nThe contest was triggered after former Labour MP Andrew Gwynne stood down for health reasons."

            "content": "Pakistan has launched air strikes on Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, and other cities, as clashes escalate along the two countries’ shared border.\n\nOn Friday, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said Islamabad’s patience had run out with the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan, declaring that Pakistan will now wage “open war”.\n\nThe declaration came hours after Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah ⁠Mujahid said Afghanistan was carrying out “large-scale offensive operations” against the Pakistani military along the Durand Line, which separates the two countries.\n\nThis follows weeks of fighting along the countries’ shared border, with both sides claiming that dozens of people have been killed.\n\nHostilities are taking place against a backdrop of an escalation in tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities since the latter’s return to power in 2021.\n\nHere is what we know so far:\n\nWhat has happened?\n\nOn Friday, Pakistani officials said Afghan forces had attacked military positions close to the border, prompting Islamabad to launch air strikes on targets inside Afghanistan, including in the capital, Kabul, and in other cities.\n\nThe first Pakistani strike occurred at about 1:50am local time on Friday (21:20 GMT on Thursday), Al Jazeera’s correspondent Nasser Shadid reported, with Afghan forces responding with anti-aircraft fire.\n\n“Our cup of patience has overflowed. Now it is open war between us and you,” Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on X.\n\nPakistan called this Operation Ghazab lil Haq, which translates to “righteous fury”.\n\nWhich areas in Afghanistan have been hit by Pakistan?\n\nPakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar wrote on X that “Afghan Taliban defence targets” had been struck in Kabul, the southeastern Paktia province and southern Kandahar, while Defence Minister Khawaja Asif declared what he described as an “open war” with the Taliban government.\n\n\n\nAfghan government spokesperson Mujahid also confirmed in an X post that these three provinces had been hit.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the attacks had destroyed two brigade bases in Afghanistan, citing two senior Pakistani security officials who spoke to the agency on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nPakistani state media outlet Pakistan TV claimed in a report that the country’s forces had “destroyed” a number of Taliban locations in a few hours.\n\nAccording to the outlet, the locations attacked in Afghanistan included a Taliban brigade headquarters and ammunition depot in Kandahar, as well as Taliban posts in the Wali Khan sector, near the Shawal sector, in the Bajaur sector and in Angoor Adda.\n\nPakistan’s Ministry of Information said it was also targeting Afghan Taliban forces in several districts of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province: Chitral, Khyber, Mohmand, Kurram and Bajaur.\n\nLater on Friday, gunfire and shelling were reported near the key Torkham border crossing between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from Islamabad, and the AFP news agency reported that shelling had been heard near the crossing in the morning.\n\nAFP reported Afghan soldiers were heading towards the frontier.\n\nThe Torkham crossing has remained open for Afghans returning en masse from Pakistan, despite the land border being largely shut since fighting between the neighbours in October.\n\nWhat do we know about casualties?\n\nReports from each side are conflicting.\n\nMosharraf Zaidi, the spokesperson for Pakistan’s prime minister, wrote on X early on Friday that in the attack on Friday morning, 133 Afghan Taliban forces had been killed and more than 200 were wounded.\n\nHe added that 27 Afghan Taliban posts had been destroyed, and nine had been captured. More than 80 “tanks, artillery pieces, and armed personnel carriers have been destroyed”, he wrote.\n\nPakistani news outlet Dawn reported that two Pakistani military personnel had died in the ongoing clashes.\n\nAl Jazeera could not independently verify the casualty figures released by Pakistan.\n\nThe Taliban government, however, said only eight Taliban fighters were killed and 11 were wounded.\n\nAfghanistan said its military had launched its attack on Pakistani military bases and outposts along the border early on Friday in retaliation against Pakistani strikes across the Afghan border on Sunday. It claimed its forces had killed 55 Pakistani soldiers, and captured two military bases and 19 military posts. Pakistan has dismissed this claim.\n\n\n\nFor its part, Pakistan said its air strikes last Sunday killed at least 70 “militants”, a claim dismissed by Mujahid, according to news outlets. Mujahid, instead, wrote on X that the attacks “killed and wounded dozens, including women and children”.\n\nThe provincial director of the Afghan Red Crescent Society in Nangarhar province, Mawlawi Fazl Rahman Fayyaz, said 18 people had been killed and several others were wounded on Sunday.\n\nFormer Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who does not hold an official position but remains an influential political figure, said the country “will defend their beloved homeland with complete unity in all circumstances and will respond to aggression with courage”.\n\n“Pakistan cannot free itself from the violence and bombings – those problems it has created itself – but must change its own policy and choose the path of good neighbourliness, respect, and civilised relations with Afghanistan,” he wrote in an X post on Friday.\n\nWhy are Pakistan and Afghanistan fighting?\n\nThe current flare-up of violence between the two countries is the culmination of months of tension.\n\nIn October 2025, Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed to an immediate ceasefire during talks mediated by Qatar and Turkiye following a week of fierce and deadly clashes along their border.\n\nThe border between Afghanistan and Pakistan is called the Durand Line and spans 2,611km (1,622 miles). Afghanistan does not formally recognise this border, which it argues was an imposed colonial demarcation that illegitimately divided ethnic Pashtun areas between the two countries.\n\nThe neighbours have been embroiled in frequent clashes since the Taliban took over in 2021. Sami Omari, an expert in South and Central Asian security and strategic affairs, told Al Jazeera there have been 75 clashes between Afghan and Pakistani forces since 2021 – the same year that US and NATO forces withdrew from Afghanistan.\n\nIn particular, Pakistan wants the Taliban to rein in armed groups such as the Pakistan Taliban, known by its acronym TTP, which it says Afghanistan is harbouring. The TTP emerged in Pakistan in 2007 and is separate from the Taliban in Afghanistan, but shares deep ideological, social and linguistic ties with the group.\n\nArmed attacks in Pakistan by the TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which operates in the resource-rich Balochistan province, have surged in recent years. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which border Afghanistan, have borne the brunt of the violence.\n\n“The Afghan Taliban, however, appear unwilling to seriously crack down on the TTP, partly due to prior affinities between the two groups but also out of fear of TTP militants defecting to its main rival, the Islamic State Khorasan Province,” Pearl Pandya, South Asia senior analyst at the US-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), an independent, impartial conflict monitor, told Al Jazeera.\n\nPandya added that a serious escalation is “inevitable” if the Taliban in Afghanistan do not crack down on the TTP.\n\nElizabeth Threlkeld, director of the South Asia programme at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera that the latest clashes are not surprising, as they stem from months of “frayed” tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n“It is significant to the extent that it represents perhaps a shift in strategy,” Threlkeld said, noting the “more aggressive, kinetic attacks” from Pakistan.\n\n“But since then, we’ve seen a couple of terrorist attacks within Pakistan that were quite significant. So, no, I’m not surprised that after those cumulative attacks, that tensions have frayed and things have again gone in this direction, unfortunately.”\n\nHow has the world reacted?\n\n“India strongly condemns Pakistan’s air strikes on Afghan territory that have resulted in civilian casualties, including women and children, during the holy month of Ramadan,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.\n\n“It is another attempt by Pakistan to externalise its internal failures,” he said.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged both sides to adhere to international law, according to a statement delivered by his spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric.\n\nIran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has urged Afghanistan and Pakistan to resolve their differences through dialogue and good neighbourly principles.\n\n“In the blessed month of Ramadan, the month of self-restraint and strengthening solidarity in the world of Islam, it is fitting that Afghanistan and Pakistan manage and resolve their existing differences within the framework of good neighborliness and through the path of dialogue,” Araghchi wrote in an X post.\n\nRussia has urged the warring parties to ⁠halt cross-border attacks ‌immediately and resolve their differences through diplomatic ⁠means, the ⁠RIA news ⁠agency reported on ⁠Friday, ⁠citing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Russia has also offered to mediate."

            "content": "Warning: This story contains details about suicide that some readers may find disturbing. If you or a loved one is experiencing suicidal thoughts, help and support are available.\n\nLondon, United Kingdom – Before Charlotte Head was arrested, she was a charity worker supporting victims of domestic violence. She had also volunteered at refugee camps in Calais.\n\n“Such a terrorist,” she says, tongue in cheek, speaking to Al Jazeera in London.\n\nHead, 29, is part of the so-called “Filton 24”, two dozen pro-Palestine activists alleged to have raided the Bristol branch of Elbit Systems UK, a subsidiary of Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, in August 2024.\n\nLess than a year later, after other activists broke into an airbase in Oxfordshire and allegedly spray-painted two Voyager refuelling and transport planes, the UK proscribed Palestine Action, the group which claimed responsibility for both incidents, as a “terrorist” organisation.\n\n“We were some of the first activists in a very long time to be treated as terrorists,” Head said. “That had a massive impact on our treatment inside the carceral system.”\n\nShe said family and friends encountered overly burdensome administrative difficulties when trying to arrange prison visits while the books she wanted to read were screened, claims that are consistent with the accounts of other Palestine Action-linked activists and their families, but allegations the Ministry of Justice has previously denied.\n\nHead, whose barrister in court likened her to a suffragette, was released three weeks ago on bail. Convicted of no crime, she had served 18 months in prison, well beyond the UK’s usual six-month pre-trial detention limit.\n\n\n\n‘I was so depressed and so isolated’\n\nAfter she was released, Head’s friend asked what she wanted to eat as one of her first meals.\n\n“I sat there completely overwhelmed, so she just said, ‘Right, pesto pasta’, and I swear nothing has ever tasted that good.”\n\nWhile getting used to her freedom, living in a seaside town and continuing her activism – Al Jazeera interviewed Head at the launch of a new database tracking the repression of pro-Palestine voices – she remembers her lowest points in jail.\n\nDuring her detention, she was moved from Bronzefield prison in southern England to Foston Hall, a facility nearly 250km (155 miles) north, far further from her loved ones.\n\nIn August 2025, about a year after she was arrested, she said she attempted to take her own life at Foston Hall.\n\n“I was so depressed and so isolated and was so aware that the public was just being told these lies about us, by the police, by the right-wing press, by the state itself – I had no power to counter that narrative.\n\n“I tried to take my own life … purely out of powerlessness of being used as a political play piece and having very little recourse to [my] own agency.”\n\nShe said she was taken to an emergency department, “where I was handcuffed to a prison officer the whole time”. After blood tests, she was returned to prison from hospital the following day.\n\nThe prison system’s conditions need “massive” reform, she said.\n\nIn 2025, 29 people died in the UK’s prisons in circumstances officially described as “self-inflicted”, while there were about 75,000 incidents of self-harm.\n\nThe hunger striking activists had also called for improved conditions, demanding an end to what they called censorship in prison, accusing authorities of withholding mail, calls and books.\n\nFounded in 2020, Palestine Action’s stated objective has been to counter Israeli war crimes – and what it says is British complicity in them – by targeting weapons manufacturers and associated companies. Its main target is Elbit Systems, which has several UK sites.\n\nThe Israeli firm produces the drones that are used with deadly effect in Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, but the company’s UK subsidiary denies that it supplies the Israeli military.\n\nAll Palestine Action-linked activists have denied the charges against them.\n\nHead is said to have driven a van into the Bristol site, using it as a “battering ram” to get inside the factory.\n\n“It’s so painful to see that so little has changed in Palestine, that the genocide has continued unabated,” she said. “It’s horrifying, but it confirms what we’ve known all along, that state actors like Israel, the US and the UK were never going to abide by international law and that we must continue to voice our opposition and try to bring about true justice for Palestine.”\n\n\n\nNew protests against Elbit Systems UK\n\nIn recent weeks, in a dizzying turn of events, the High Court ruled that the Palestine Action ban was unlawful and all “Filton24” defendants have been acquitted of aggravated burglary. Twenty-three of the 24 were bailed in two rounds, including a group that participated in a life-threatening hunger strike. Only one, Samuel Corner, remains in jail. He faces an additional charge of causing grievous bodily harm to a police officer.\n\nThe jury reached partial or no verdicts on the counts of criminal damage and violent disorder, so Head and other activists now face a retrial.\n\nOn the Palestine Action ban, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has been granted permission to appeal the High Court ruling.\n\nMeanwhile, Elbit Systems UK continues to be targeted.\n\nOn Thursday, activists affiliated with a group called People Against Genocide claimed to have blocked the Elbit UK Systems site in Bristol by “locking on”, a protest tactic that involves attaching oneself to an object.\n\n“The arms firm claim that the Filton facility is a research, development, and manufacturing hub, but quadcopter drones, of the exact type used to kill civilians in Gaza, have previously been discovered here, ready to be shipped to the Israeli military,” they said.\n\nAvon and Somerset Police told Al Jazeera that three people “causing disruption” had been arrested for offences relating to “locking on, contrary to the Public Order Act 2003”.\n\nAt the time of publishing, Elbit Systems UK and the Ministry of Justice had not responded to Al Jazeera’s request for comment."

            "content": "A local governor says authorities found two mass graves in the outskirts of the eastern city of Uvira which the rebel M23 group seized in December.\n\nCongolese authorities and a civil society group have said that mass graves were found in a part of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where the M23 rebel group has recently withdrawn from, as fighting in the region escalates despite a United States-mediated peace deal.\n\nThe governor of South Kivu province, Jean-Jacques Purusi, told The Associated Press news agency on Thursday that authorities found two mass graves with at least 171 bodies in the Kiromoni and Kavimvira neighbourhoods on the outskirts of the eastern city of Uvira.\n\n“At this stage, we have identified two sites: one mass grave containing approximately 30 bodies in Kiromoni, not far from the Burundian border on the Congolese side, and another in Kavimvira where 141 bodies were found,” Purusi told AP over the phone.\n\nThe Executive Secretariat of the Local Network for the Protection of Civilians, a civil society group in the region, said on Thursday it wanted to visit the mass graves but was prevented from doing so by the Congolese military.\n\nInformation gathered so far indicates that the victims were killed by M23 rebels, said Yves Ramadhani, the group’s vice president.\n\nThe governor and the civil society group alleged that the rebels killed the individuals because they suspected them of belonging to the DRC army or a pro-government militia.\n\nBoth the DRC military and M23 have been accused of extrajudicial killings and abuses by rights groups. Al Jazeera could not independently verify Purusi’s or the group’s claims.\n\n\n\nThe M23 is the most prominent of the more than 100 armed groups that are vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern DRC, near the border with Rwanda.\n\nM23 has been in a tense and violent conflict with the DRC government for more than a decade. The first fighting began in 2012 but de-escalated the next year, only to resume in 2021.\n\nThen, in January 2025, the rebels gained ground, seizing Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, before taking Bukavu, the capital of neighbouring South Kivu, the following month. And in December, the group seized control of Uvira in an offensive that killed more than 1,500 people and forced about 300,000 to flee, according to regional authorities.\n\nThe rebel group later announced it would withdraw from the city, in what it said was a “unilateral trust-building measure” requested by the US to facilitate the peace process.\n\nM23 claims it is fighting for the rights of the minority Tutsi community, who it says has been marginalised by the state. The DRC government has condemned the rebels and neighbouring Rwanda, which it accuses of supporting them, for seizing land and resources.\n\nLast year, two separate peace negotiation processes took place – one between DRC and M23 mediated by Qatar, and a separate one between Kinshasa and Kigali mediated by the US.\n\nDespite agreed ceasefires, fighting has continued in the east of the country.\n\nThe conflict has created one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises, with more than seven million people displaced, according to the UN agency for refugees, and thousands killed.\n\nMore than 200 people were also killed in a collapse at the Rubaya coltan mine in eastern DRC last month."

            "content": "Critics are wary of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to send the military to tackle crime, drugs and gangs in three provinces.\n\nCape Town, South Africa – Two ominous letters are spray-painted on a wall at the entrance to Tafelsig, a township in Mitchells Plain on the outskirts of Cape Town: HL – the insignia of the Hard Livings gang, which has threatened communities there for five decades.\n\nIt’s a February day soon after the president’s state of the nation address, in which Cyril Ramaphosa boldly announced he’d be deploying the army to communities across South Africa to tackle the growing crisis of crime, drugs and gangs. But in Tafelsig, which will likely be part of the new military operation, most people seem unbothered by the news.\n\nMitchells Plain is on the Cape Flats – a series of densely populated, impoverished townships about 30km (19 miles) southeast of the wealthy city centre where the president made his speech. While the city boasts hordes of tourists and some of the most expensive real estate on the continent, the Cape Flats accounts for the highest rate of gang-related killings in the country.\n\n“When it was at its worst, [there was a shooting] almost every day,” said Michael Jacobs, the chairperson of a local community police forum.\n\n“Whether it’s day or whether it’s night, they’re shooting somewhere on the Cape Flats,” he added on a drive through the settlement of run-down houses and corrugated iron shacks.\n\nAround him, residents made their way to a home-grown tuck shop, known as a spaza, or sat on street corners while toddlers ran about.\n\n“How is this conducive to raising children?” he asked, recounting the horrors of life in Mitchells Plain.\n\n\n\nIn the past week, four people, including a nine-month-old, had been shot and killed in a drug den in Athlone, about 17km (10 miles) away.\n\nA beloved Muslim cleric who is rumoured to have angered a gang leader over a personal dispute was also shot dead on the first day of Ramadan as he was leaving the Salaamudien Mosque on a nearby street.\n\nAs Jacobs spoke, reports of other shootings filtered through on the many crime groups he is part of on WhatsApp. A few days later, he shared with Al Jazeera a video of two schoolgirls and a taxi driver shot outside a school in Atlantis, about 40km (25 miles) north of Cape Town. One of the girls died.\n\nTafelsig residents now await the probable arrival of uniformed soldiers and armed vehicles in their neighbourhood, but have little hope that it will make a difference.\n\nDespite his weariness with the violence, Jacobs is far from enthusiastic about a decision to deploy the army.\n\nOther critics of the government’s decision said it is window dressing more than a real solution while some question the wisdom of such a drastic step in a country where the military has a history of brutality and where recent explosive allegations about police corruption at the highest levels have surfaced.\n\n‘Do our lives not matter?’\n\nIn his speech on February 12, Ramaphosa said he would deploy the army to the Western Cape, the province that includes the Cape Flats, and Gauteng, home to the country’s largest city, Johannesburg, to tackle gang violence and illegal mining. On February 17, Acting Police Minister Firoz Cachalia announced that the Eastern Cape would be added to the list and a deployment would take place in 10 days – although no soldiers have so far been deployed.\n\nThe president’s decision followed pressure from civil society groups and the Democratic Alliance (DA) party, which runs the Western Cape, to take drastic action to curb widespread gang-related violence in the three provinces.\n\nA day before its province was added to the deployment schedule, the DA joined residents in Gqeberha, the largest city in the Eastern Cape, for a “Do Our Lives Not Matter?” protest to demand that Ramaphosa take urgent action.\n\nIn Gauteng, neighbourhoods surrounding the province’s once-lucrative abandoned mines have often been turned into battlegrounds, resulting in shootouts between police and illegal artisanal miners, known as zama zamas.\n\nGauteng and the Western Cape frequently appear at the top of the country’s organised crime lists while the Eastern Cape made headlines last year for a series of killings linked to extortion syndicates.\n\n\n\nIn the latest crime statistics, police announced the arrests of 15,846 suspects nationwide and the seizure of 173 firearms and 2,628 rounds of ammunition from February 16 to Sunday alone.\n\nGauteng took up the most space in the police’s crime highlights, which included a 16-year-old arrested in Roodepoort for possession and distribution of explosives and the seizure of counterfeit clothing and shoes worth 98 million rand ($6.1m).\n\nOverall, South Africa has some of the world’s most violent crime with an average of 64 people killed every day, according to official statistics.\n\nThe three provinces selected for military deployments have a turbulent history with the armed forces, not least during the apartheid era when the regime used soldiers to unleash deadly crackdowns on antiapartheid activists.\n\n“They were the enemy,” Jacobs said, recalling his own arrest in September 1987 during a student protest on the Cape Flats opposing the racist government, which was replaced in the country’s first democratic elections in 1994.\n\nToday after three decades of democracy, poverty, unemployment and violent crime remain a major challenge in the area.\n\nBut Jacobs, like other critics of the military police, believes the new move will do little to cure the ills that he said gangs exploit to increase their influence. Children as young as eight years old are recruited into their ranks.\n\nThe Town Centre, a shopping mall that was once a hub of economic activity, has been reduced to a ghost town where the drug trade thrives despite the fact that it is right next to a police station, according to Jacobs.\n\nFor him, there is a direct link between the country’s economic decline and the flourishing of gang activity over the past decade on the Cape Flats, where working-class people have seen their livelihoods stripped away as the manufacturing sector shrank.\n\nOn an average weekday when children should be at school, he said, you see children and even women in their 60s in Mitchells Plain digging through rubbish bins to find glass, plastic or other things they can recycle and turn into income. “At least it will put something on the table.”\n\nPlugging a ‘haemorrhage’\n\nSocial issues and not simply military intervention should be put at the heart of government anticrime efforts, analysts say.\n\n“There’s no other way to describe it other than plugging a hole that is haemorrhaging at the moment with regards to these forms of organised crime,” said Ryan Cummings, director of analysis at Signal Risk, an Africa-focused risk management firm.\n\nIrvin Kinnes, an associate professor with the University of Cape Town’s Centre for Criminology, pointed out that constitutionally the army is limited in the duties its members may perform among the civilian population. Their role will be largely to support police, who will retain control of all operations.\n\nHe fears the government has not learned lessons from previous army deployments in South Africa’s democratic era.\n\n\n\nThe army was dispatched to the Western Cape in 2019 during a previous spike in gang violence and was again sent in to help with the enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions the following year.\n\n“It’s a very dangerous thing to bring the army because there’s an impatience with the fact that the police are not doing their job. And so they come in with that mentality and want to beat up everybody and break people’s bones,” Kinnes said.\n\n“We saw what happened in COVID. They killed people as the army. It’s not as if the police don’t kill people, but the point is, you don’t need the army to do that.”\n\nTo the government’s detractors, summoning the army is nothing more than an attempt at political heroics before local elections due to be held this year or in early 2027.\n\nKinnes pointed out that, according to police statistics, crime has been decreasing without the help of the army.\n\n“It’s very much political. It’s to show that the political leaders have kind of heard the public. But the call for the army hasn’t come from the community. It’s come from politicians,” he said.\n\n‘The military is ready’\n\nRamaphosa, who has yet to reveal details of the military deployment, has defended his decision. On Monday in his weekly newsletter, the president sought to separate the South African armed forces from their troubling past, listing several operations that benefitted communities, such as disaster relief efforts and law enforcement operations at the border.\n\nHe made it clear that the army’s role would merely be a supporting one “with clear rules of engagement and for specific time-limited objectives”.\n\nIts presence may free up officers to focus on police work and would take place alongside other measures, such as strengthening antigang units and illegal mining teams, he said.\n\n“Given our history, where the apartheid state sent the army into townships to violently suppress opposition, it is important that we do not deploy the [military] inside the country to deal with domestic threats without good reason,” Ramaphosa wrote.\n\nCummings said it was clear the president’s hand was forced amid an unrelenting wave of violence. “The rhetoric of the president up until now suggests that this was a directive that he was not necessarily too keen on implementing.”\n\nOn the ground, soldiers appear equally reluctant about their pending engagement.\n\nNtsiki Shongo is a soldier who was deployed in 2019 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. He told Al Jazeera, using a pseudonym, that any operation involving the police was almost certainly doomed.\n\n“We [in the army] become so negative when we are working with them [the police] because always we don’t get what we need,” he said.\n\n“We know how easy it is to get these gangsters, to get these drug lords, but unfortunately, the police, they are not cooperating with us because some of them are in cooperation with these criminals,” he charged. “Maybe they are scared for their lives because they are staying in the same areas with them.”\n\nShongo referred to an ongoing commission investigating police corruption that has implicated senior government officials and led to the suspension of national Police Minister Senzo Mchunu.\n\n“So this operation, … is it going to be a success? I don’t know. It all depends on the police,” he said, adding that he and his fellow soldiers long for the day the government lets the military solve the problem on its own.\n\n\n\n“Even when we are just sitting having lunch as soldiers, we talk about the police. We pray that one day the state can say, ‘Let’s take the military inside the country and clean out all these weapons, all these guns, all these gangsters,’” he said.\n\n“The military is ready, and they want to prove a point because we’ve been hungry for these things.”"

            "content": "Probe of Royal Air Force bases comes amid concerns trafficked women were brought to UK on board Epstein’s private jets.\n\nUK Defence Secretary John Healey has called for an investigation into whether convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein trafficked women and girls into the United Kingdom on private jets that landed at Britain’s Royal Air Force (RAF) bases.\n\nBritish newspaper The Telegraph reported on Thursday that Healey had told UK officials to search through two decades of Ministry of Defence files and “leave no stone unturned” in the hunt for any links between the late paedophile’s private jet and RAF facilities.\n\nThe investigation launched by Healey comes days after former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged police to investigate whether the former prince, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, had used taxpayer-funded jet travel and RAF bases to meet with Epstein.\n\nThe Telegraph reported that Brown was particularly concerned about a private flight Epstein took on a Gulfstream jet that landed at an airbase in Norfolk in December 2000, before he visited the royal retreat of Sandringham with Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor was arrested last week over alleged misconduct in public office, while serving as the UK trade envoy, for reportedly sending confidential government documents to Epstein.\n\nUK, EU to ‘look into’ Mandelson’s Epstein ties\n\nThe UK’s Intelligence and Security Committee said on Thursday it hopes it will soon be able to publish documents shedding light on how political insider Peter Mandelson was appointed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as the UK’s ambassador to the United States, despite his longtime ties to Epstein being well known.\n\n\n\n“We are proceeding at pace to publish the first tranche of documents in early March,” a spokesperson for the intelligence committee said.\n\nMandelson, 72, was briefly arrested and then released by London’s Metropolitan Police as part of their investigation.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Starmer fired Mandelson as ambassador last year following more revelations about his relationship with Epstein, the British leader is facing political fallout as questions remain over his decision to appoint him to the role of ambassador in the first place.\n\nThe European Union’s anti-fraud office OLAF also said on Thursday that it was looking into Mandelson’s actions while he was serving in Brussels as British commissioner for trade between 2004 and 2008, following a request from the European Commission."

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nLess than 24 hours before the deadline in an ultimatum issued by the Pentagon, Anthropic has refused the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted access to its AI.\n\nIt’s the culmination of a dramatic exchange of public statements, social media posts, and behind-the-scenes negotiations, coming down to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s desire to renegotiate all AI labs’ current contracts with the military. But Anthropic, so far, has refused to back down from its two current red lines: no mass surveillance of Americans, and no lethal autonomous weapons (or weapons with license to kill targets with no human oversight whatsoever). OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to the new terms, while Anthropic’s refusal had led to CEO Dario Amodei being summoned to the White House this week for a meeting with Hegseth himself, in which the Secretary reportedly issued an ultimatum to the CEO to back down by the end of business day on Friday or else.\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, Amodei wrote, “I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community.”\n\nHe added that the company has “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner” but that in a “narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values” — going on to specifically mention mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons. (Amodei mentioned that “partial autonomous weapons … are vital to the defense of democracy” and that fully autonomous weapons may eventually “prove critical for our national defense,” but that “today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons.” He did not rule out Anthropic acquiescing to the military’s use of fully autonomous weapons in the future but mentioned that they were not ready now.)\n\nThe Pentagon had already reportedly asked major defense contractors to assess their dependence on Anthropic’s Claude, which could be seen as the first step to designating the company a “supply chain risk” – a public threat that the Pentagon had made recently (and a classification usually reserved for threats to national security). The Pentagon was also reportedly considering invoking the Defense Production Act to make Anthropic comply.\n\nAmodei wrote in his statement that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” He also wrote that “should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.”"

The feature takes the load off your device using its own cloud-based computer and browser, allowing it to handle a variety of jobs ranging from scheduling appointments to generating study plans while you do something else.\n\nAs noted by Microsoft, you can describe what you need to Copilot Tasks using natural language, and assign Copilot Tasks to complete jobs on a recurring, scheduled, or one-time basis. Copilot Tasks will provide a report once its work is complete.\n\nYou can call upon Copilot Tasks to do things like organize your subscriptions and cancel the ones you don’t use, as well as turn emails, attachments, and images from your inbox into a slide deck. Some other use cases include having the AI assistant surface urgent emails and draft replies, plan a birthday party from venue to invites; and keep tabs on new apartment listings every Friday, even setting up home tours.\n\nMicrosoft says that Tasks will ask for permission before performing “meaningful actions,” like making a payment or sending a message for you. For now, Copilot Tasks is only available in a research preview with a “small group” of testers. You can join a waitlist for Copilot Tasks from Microsoft’s website."

Gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving. But something has changed. We’re already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. And that’s accelerating rapidly.”\n\nDorsey opted to do a big layoff instead of gradual cuts because “I’d rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome.”\n\nThe layoffs were announced on Thursday as part of the company’s Q4 2025 earnings. In a shareholder letter, Dorsey says that “We believe Block will be significantly more valuable as a smaller, faster, intelligence-native company. Everything we do from here is in service of that.”"

I asked Samsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the executive in charge of both R&D and operations for Samsung’s mobile business. He says the added thickness of magnets is a bad tradeoff to make, because you’re just going to buy a case anyhow.\n\n“About 80 or 90 percent of people are using a case, and cases with magnets are very popular these days,” he tells me.\n\nSamsung would rather use that extra height to give the phone a larger battery or make it thinner, he says.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Samsung isn’t looking into magnets. “We’re still doing a lot of research to make sure we don’t have any sacrifice inside the phone; when we actually achieve that, we’ll integrate,” he says.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with Choi’s premise. I want extra battery and magnets, and I’m willing to sacrifice thinness to get it. Phones are thin enough already, except for the ones that fold.\n\nAnd if Samsung took charge of the magnets like Apple, and replicated Apple’s standard pattern and strength, maybe the magnet case I use with my Galaxy S25 would properly and firmly hold onto magnetic battery packs without them rotating in place. Since there’s no magnets inside my phone, I’m at the mercy of casemakers.\n\nBut I get it. Why make the tradeoff if someone will pay for a case anyhow?

That could result in smaller brands exiting the industry, while allowing Apple and Samsung to grab more market share, according to Popal."

Now, Samsung is confirming what we previously only suspected: RAMageddon is partly to blame.\n\nSamsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the COO of its mobile business, tells The Verge that the memory shortage alone made a “significant contribution” to the price.

And though tariffs may have been a factor as well, Samsung has hiked the price in other regions too, not just the United States. The pricier S26 Ultra does come with intriguing upgrades, however, including a built-in privacy screen and the largest vapor chamber cooling system in a phone.\n\nSamsung chip partner Qualcomm warned in its February quarterly results that it was seeing a big dip in its handset business “100 percent” due to the memory shortage, telling investors that the AI industry’s appetite for components would likely define the entire scale of the phone industry all year long.\n\nAnd today, IDC is forecasting the largest drop ever recorded in worldwide smartphone shipments, a dip of 12.9 percent, across 2026. “What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,” writes IDC."

Discovery.\n\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for the legacy studio, and would walk away from the deal.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\n\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\n\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration shelved or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\n\nNetflix had announced its intent to acquire WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks.

            "content": "Jack Dorsey has long been an open admirer of Elon Musk. Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey announced that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly half its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.\n\nIt isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\n\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\n\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\n\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”\n\nThe two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop. The Pentagon believes it should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.\n\nAmodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday 5:01 p.m. deadline Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. The Department of Defense has attempted to force Amodei’s hand by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding. The DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense.\n\nAmodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”\n\nHe added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”\n\nAnthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.\n\nThe startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.\n\nWith a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round. Form has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook. The company plans to go public next year."

            "content": "Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\n\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nSurprise guests at Prada pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 26, 2026\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\n\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\n\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you."

            "content": "As space companies itch to push the most advanced chips into orbit, the problem of cooling those high-powered processors is top of mind.\n\n“It’s cold in space … [but] there’s no airflow, and so the only way to dissipate is through conduction,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said when asked about space-based data centers during his firm’s most recent earnings call.\n\nNow, Sophia Space has raised $10 million from investors, including Alpha Funds, KDDI Green Partners Fund, and Unlock Venture Partners. The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.\n\nCompanies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob DeMillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monnin — have a different approach.\n\nThe company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.\n\nWhile technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a similar realization.)\n\nSophia, an Nvidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are 1 meter by 1 meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, DeMillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nBy the 2030s, Sophia hopes to be building larger space data centers out of thousands of TILEs, envisioning a 50-meter-by-50-meter structure delivering 1 MW of computing power. DeMillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute.\n\nFirst, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include Earth-observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks.\n\n“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” DeMillo told TechCrunch."

It is Season 50, so we have Survivor players of eons past that are coming back to compete for the million dollars. I am so excited. It's going to be incredible. Zoë, my goal in the next few months is just to make you watch one, one, of the episodes. This is very important to me.\n\nBrian Barrett: If you were to make Zoë watch a historical episode of Survivor in isolation, what one hour of Survivor would you show her?\n\nLeah Feiger: Can I say a season, or does it have to be an episode?\n\nBrian Barrett: I want to go with that, because I don't think you're going to get her for a whole season.\n\nLeah Feiger: So I'm going to do the second-to-last episode of the Micronesia season of Survivor. Absolutely incredible season, known for the Black Widow Brigade. Zoë, I actually think you would really like it. Well, anyway, that is my WIRED. My TIRED—and I'm kind of devastated to say this—is Love Is Blind, which is ... I know that my theme was reality shows this week. Look, I have a lot of I wouldn't say love for Love Is Blind, but I have a lot of interest in Love Is Blind. I am an avid Love Is Blind watcher. I think it is a super interesting concept and a very weird show and produces a lot of very weird people. But there is a excellent WIRED article coming out about how MAGA it's gotten, and that those are the people that are going on the show right now, and the conversations that are happening between these couples who met behind a wall and are off to get married several weeks after knowing each other, the conversations are quite sad. They're making me sad. There's a lot of body shaming and it's just very—it's weird. So this season, it's not doing it for me, which that's OK, because Survivor is here to lift me out of the doldrums. That is my WIRED and TIRED. I stand by it. I swear that I read books and stuff too. I do not want this to be my only brand on this show.\n\nZoë Schiffer: Certainly not. Brian, drag us out. I need to get on firmer ground.\n\nBrian Barrett: OK. Well, I'm going to go TIRED. Samsung just announced some new phones. Those aren't TIRED, but TIRED is AI overload in phones. There's too much. So at this point, the new Samsung Galaxy S26 smartphones—similar to Google's conversational photo editor—they have a photo assist thing that lets you use natural language, so you can just type in. If you have a photo that you took, you can say like, \"Hey, give my dog a party hat,\" and then there will be a party hat on the dog. What's the point of taking photos anymore? Why not just prompt something instead from scratch, or just go touch some grass? I am curious about—they've got agents built into the phone, so you can use the phone. You can just say, \"Hey, order me a pizza,\" and the phone will just do that for you. We'll see if it works. I don't know. It seems like it might go off the rails. Anyway, too much too soon for me. That's my TIRED. I didn't plan a WIRED. I was so caught up on the phone, but because it came up earlier, I'll say the new Muppet Show episode with Sabrina Carpenter is really quite good, and I hope that it got a good enough response that Disney makes more of them."

            "content": "Hearing someone talk about digital censorship in China is always either extremely boring or extremely interesting. Most of the time, people are still regurgitating the same talking points from 20 years ago about how the Chinese internet is like living in George Orwell’s 1984. But occasionally, someone discovers something new about how the Chinese government exerts control over emerging technologies, revealing how the censorship machine is a constantly evolving beast.\n\nA new paper by scholars from Stanford University and Princeton University about Chinese artificial intelligence belongs to the second category. The researchers fed the same 145 politically sensitive questions to four Chinese large language models and five American models and then compared how they responded. They then repeated the same experiment 100 times.\n\nThe main findings won’t be surprising to anyone who has been paying attention: Chinese models refuse to answer significantly more of the questions than the American models. (DeepSeek refused 36 percent of the questions, while Baidu’s Ernie Bot refused 32 percent; OpenAI’s GPT and Meta’s Llama had refusal rates lower than 3 percent.) In cases where they didn’t outright refuse to answer, the Chinese models also gave shorter answers and more inaccurate information than their American counterparts did.\n\nOne of the most interesting things the researchers attempted to do was to separate the impact of pre-training and post-training. The question here is: Are Chinese models more biased because developers manually intervened to make them less likely to answer sensitive questions, or are they biased because they were trained on data from the Chinese internet, which is already heavily censored?\n\n“Given that the Chinese internet has already been censored for all these decades, there's a lot of missing data” says Jennifer Pan, a political science professor at Stanford University who has long studied online censorship and coauthored the recent paper.\n\nPan and her colleague’ findings suggest that training data may have played a smaller role in how the AI models responded than manual interventions. Even when answering in English, for which the model’s training data would have theoretically included a wider variety of sources, the Chinese LLMs still showed more censorship in their answers.\n\nToday, anyone can ask DeepSeek or Qwen a question about the Tiananmen Square Massacre and immediately see censorship is happening, but it’s hard to tell how much it impacts normal users and how to properly identify the source of the manipulation. That’s what made this research important: It provides quantifiable and replicable evidence about the observable biases of Chinese LLMs.\n\nBeyond discussing their findings, I asked the authors about their methods and the challenges of studying biases in Chinese models, and spoke with other researchers to understand where the AI censorship debate is heading.\n\nWhat You Don’t Know\n\nOne of the difficulties of studying AI models is that they have a tendency to hallucinate, so you can’t always tell if they are lying because they know not to say the correct answer or because they actually don’t know it.\n\nOne example Pan cited from her paper was a question aboutLiu Xiaobo, the Chinese dissident who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. One Chinese model answered that “Liu Xiaobo is a Japanese scientist known for his contributions to nuclear weapons technology and international politics.” That is, of course, a complete lie. But why did the model tell it? Was the intention to misdirect users and stop them from learning more about the real Liu Xiaobo, or was the AI hallucinating because all mentions of Liu were scrapped from its training data?\n\n“It's much noisier of a measure of censorship,” Pan says, comparing it to her previous work researching Chinese social media and what websites the Chinese government chooses to block. “Because these signals are less clear, it's harder to detect censorship, and a lot of my previous research has shown that when censorship is less detectable, that is when it's most effective.”"

            "content": "Honorable Mentions\n\nDuring the winter, a whole WIRED crew tests ski clothes almost constantly. Here are a few other items that we like.\n\nCourtesy of REI\n\nHestra Fall Line 3-Finger Gloves for $190: I've long admired Hestra gloves from across the lift line, impressed by the Swedish company's elegant stitchwork and thoughtful design touches. This was the year I finally got to try a pair for myself, and the Fall Line are exactly what they look like. There are six sizes available so you can get the perfect fit in this glove. The cowhide is buttery smooth and has already broken in a bit with five days' use. The wrist strap means you never have to fret about dropping your glove from the lift when checking your phone, and they're very warm without making me sweat. If you do sweat, the lining is removable so you can wash it without damaging the leather. —Martin Cizmar\n\nCourtesy of Crab Grab\n\nCrab Grab Snuggler Mitts for $89: These mini sleeping bags for your fingers are packed full of Primaloft insulation and benefitting from a sherpa fleece lining, they are toasty warm, and with a 15K membrane, impressively waterproof too. All-season mittens with durable construction for under $100? Yes Please!\n\nCourtesy of Mons Royale\n\nMons Royale Yotei Merino Classic Long Sleeve for $98: As I type this, I’m nowhere near a mountain, but I’m still wearing the Mons Royale Yotei long sleeve top. It is ridiculously comfortable, made from 190-gsm-weight, 100 percent merino wool, and has a mercifully relaxed cut, so I remain warm, but don’t feel like a sausage. On the mountain however, the merino wool works its magic, wicking away sweat—especially on a hike up to some fresh powder—and keeping me comfortable. Paired with a shell and the Patagonia R1 Thermal Hoodie, I’m warm enough during a bitter arctic blast.\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket and Bib Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket for $498 and Bib for $398: Seniq is another all-women’s outdoor brand that launched in 2024. It's styled a little more Gen Z, leaning into fun color blocking over the monochromatic look. The Seniq Powder Puff Down Jacket has a dry-touch finish. It’s meant for drier days on the mountain, but a PFC-free DWR coating and YKK AquaGuard zippers do provide water resistance. The asymmetric front zipper helps you avoid chin rub when you have the jacket fully zipped. It also features cool asymmetrical quilting lines, side pockets-in-pockets that provide access to your bib (their bibs have a pocket on the front, so you can get in there without unzipping your jacket), an oversized removable hood, a forearm pass pocket, soft and stretchy wrist gaiters, and a large internal pocket that can absolutely handle a sandwich. This jacket was warm, pillowy, and comforting, like a super-soft hug.\n\nThe silky shell bibs are slightly barrel cut, which gives them a flattering shape without being fitted. The adjustable racer back-style straps and low back (with a stretchy waist) also provide a nice shape and breathability. There are two pockets on the front chest, pockets on either leg, two-way zip thigh vents, and a butt zipper for bathroom breaks. These fit easily over my boots, and the instep guards were a nice touch. With a durable three-layer membrane and a 20,000-mm waterproof rating, these will hold up against any and all weather the mountain throws at you. When I wore them on a wet snowy day, they beaded and sloughed off moisture well. —Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket for $259: This puffy hoodie is a great mid-layer for under a shell jacket. The insulation is made from recycled rope scraps, and the outer is coated in wind-resistant PFC-free DWR coating. The hem falls at the hips, and the high collar and tight hood keep most of the face covered. I like wearing this piece under shells for snowboarding, but I know it’ll pull double duty as a comfy hiking and camping jacket, too, so it’s a solid multipurpose investment. It’s exceptionally lightweight and warm, though from a volume standpoint, it is on the bulkier side for a mid-layer and isn’t the most packable piece. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Evolved Air Half Zip for $112: This fleece pullover has a waffle-like texture that traps heat and wicks moisture. With a high zippered collar and cinchable hem, you can adjust the fit to make it more air-tight or breathable. This mid-layer felt wonderfully lightweight while still keeping my toasty. It’s not bulky at all, only a little thicker than a base layer, laid comfortably under my jackets, and moved with me on the mountain. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Lifa Base Layer Long-Sleeve Crew for $115 and Pants for $115: These base layers hit the weight sweet spot; they’re not too thick or thin, but just right. They’re slightly looser than other options on this list, so if you prefer something that isn’t so fitted, these are a great pick (but note that they run long too). These combine merino wool with Helly Hansen’s LIFA fibers, which add more moisture-wicking capabilities. They’re soft, lightweight, warm, and don’t hold onto smells. I love the cute designs and how well they regulate my temperature under insulated jackets and pants. The waist digs in a bit but doesn’t roll, and they stay in place and move well. —Kristin Canning\n\nHow to Layer AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We have a full guide on how to layer, but here are your essentials. Base layer: A good set of thermals is essential in the fight against cold, especially when you’re working hard. The best fabrics wick away sweat as you heat up, which helps regulate your temperature. Merino wool is the best at this, but also the most expensive. Synthetic fabrics are getting better, though, and please avoid cotton at all costs, as it gets wet and stays that way, making you cold and uncomfortable. Mid layer: Whether you choose a hooded fleece or puffer-style jacket, this layer does the bulk of the work in cold conditions. Combined with the base layer, it traps warm air in, while also allowing moisture to be expelled. Synthetic insulation such as Primaloft Gold is brilliant and doesn’t lose its properties if it gets wet. Down jackets offer the best warmth-to-weight ratio, but they don’t pack down as small, and should never get wet. A fleece with an insulated vest is a great option if you really feel the cold. Jacket: While ski jackets with insulation offer bonus warmth in Arctic-like conditions, for most people a waterproof shell will be enough, as it offers protection from both the snow and the wind. A cold wind will chill you to your bones faster than a bit of wet snow. Ideally choose a jacket with a waterproof membrane such as Gore-Tex (make sure it is free from PFAS, or forever chemicals), but also check for taped seams for added waterproofing, plus plenty of pockets for snacks and lift passes, and wrist cuffs and ski skirts to help keep out the snow. Socks: As with your base layer, socks keep you warm and maintain your temperature when you’re building up a sweat. Natural fabrics work well, but a blend of merino wool with synthetic stretchy fibers is the way to go, as they stay up better and can be used for more than a day. Avoid cotton again, and never wear two pairs, as you’ll almost certainly get colder feet. Gloves: You’ll be surprised by how wet ski gloves get when it’s snowing, even if you don’t fall very often. As a result, waterproof options work best in most cases, although well-made leather designs can be almost as waterproof as a pair with Gore-Tex. Mittens are generally warmer than gloves, but what you gain in toasty fingers you lose in dexterity. Check out our Best Ski Gloves and Mittens guide for more information. Waterproofing and breathability ratings: Waterproofing is measured with a hydrostatic head rating, or HH. That means if you put a 1-inch, endlessly long square tube on top of the fabric, you could pour 20,000 millimeters of water before it would seep through. Breathability is rated in how many grams of vapor per square meter can can pass through the fabric in 24 hours. How We Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I've been reviewing winter sports gear for more than 15 years. In that time, I have worn an untold number of jackets, pants, mid-layers, thermals, gloves, and mittens. I called on industry experts and professional skiers, and solicited opinions from fellow winter sport enthusiasts on the WIRED team. While a basic fit check can be done in the office, nothing replaces on-mountain testing in variable conditions. We put in the time on various trips to the French Alps, as well as in resorts in Vermont, Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "You might think you’ve got enough headphones. Most of us have accrued at least two or three pairs over the years, and might have a few more half-working pairs stuck in a drawer somewhere. But I’m here to tell you, if you haven’t fully explored the fabulous world of specialized headphones that has exploded in the past decade, from open earbuds to sports and travel cans, you’re not maximizing your sonic potential. The best headphones are now so varied that they often depend entirely on what you intend to use them for. That means the best headphones for you probably come in many shapes and sizes, and you might actually want more than one pair.\n\nBalling out on lots of headphones for every one of life's situations doesn’t necessarily mean spending a lot of money. Unless you’re successfully riding the “boomcession,” there’s a fair chance spare cash is tight right now. Luckily, there’s a veritable explosion of impressive budget brands making great stuff, alongside household brands pitching to the cheap seats.\n\nAs an audio reviewer for well over a decade, I’ve tried hundreds of models across every color in the headphone rainbow. Here’s how to shop right so you can get the most out of any and all of them, as well as the best headphones I can think of in every category right now.\n\nNoise-Canceling Earbuds: The 2026 Baseline\n\nLet's start with the modern one-and-done choice: Noise-canceling earbuds are the ultimate jack-of-all-trades. If you only want to own one pair, this is it. The best noise-canceling earbuds sound great, fit neatly in your pocket, and are equally adept at letting in or blocking out environmental sounds to adapt to any situation.\n\nIt’s probably no surprise that the wildly popular AirPods Pro are the best headphones for iPhone owners, thanks to impressive performance, loads of features, and seamless integration with all things Apple. They’re a massive step up from the standard AirPods, which offer similar Apple-friendly features and a touch of noise canceling, but don’t perform nearly as well as even most budget earbuds.\n\nBose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor more phone-agnostic options, Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 are the ultimate noise killers, while Sony’s new WF-1000XM6 offer great sound and utterly natural transparency mode. Technics' EAH AZ100 are among my favorites for sound quality.\n\nIf those are too pricey, fear not! Budget earbud options are varied and plentiful, from Android-optimized midrangers like the Google Pixel Buds 2a to the stylish Nothing Ear (a) or highly affordable Soundcore Space A40. If you’re keeping to one pair, I’d put in all your chips for better performance, but there’s no shortage of great affordable options, and new pairs at all prices keep rolling in.\n\nNoise-Canceling Over-Ears: Comfort Meets Performance\n\nAnyone who’s taken a long flight can probably relate to the fact that sticking something in your ears for five hours-plus isn’t an exercise in comfort. Enter travel headphones like the best noise-canceling over-ears, which have adapted from early models like Bose’s stalwart QC 25 to become among the most advanced and downright luxurious audio products for your money. They’re great for other tasks too, from working in a busy office to commuting or simply chilling at home in tranquil reverie.\n\nAirPods Max Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nThe latest and greatest, like Sony’s WH-1000XM6 and Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra, apply uncompromising noise cancellation, plush comfort for long listening, and a pile of advanced features like pausing when you speak or automatic sleeping and waking. The Ultra are my favorite for sheer comfort, but there are plenty of rivals like Sonos’ equally comfy Ace, the iconic (and heavy) AirPods Max, or the utterly immersive B&W Px7 S3. Cheaper options abound, but some of my favorites include Sony’s high-punching WH-CH720, the crazy-affordable Soundcore Life Q30, or its newer cousin, the Space One. These won’t bring the same level of performance or tranquility, but they still work great for long flights and beyond.\n\nOpen Earbuds: For Keeping Alert\n\nHere’s where things get really fun: Open earbuds have exploded faster than any other audio segment in recent memory, with a kaleidoscope of options from virtually every audio brand. Designed to keep your ears open while delivering satisfying sound, the best open earbuds aren’t ideal for everything you do, but they're fantastic for specialized activities like ebike riding, where wind resistance renders artificial transparency modes useless. Over time, I've found tons of other cool use cases, from walking the dog to sneaking in some Olympics at the bar.\n\nOpen Earbuds come in various design types, from wacky bone-conductors to wraparound models and—my personal favorite—clip-ons. Their light and ergonomic housings aim to essentially disappear on your ears for all-day listening, and it works better than you might think.\n\nYou could spend a lot on pairs like Bose’s excellent Open Ultra, but you really don’t have to, since even the best models are limited in performance. Soundcore’s Aeroclip are my favorite value-to-performance pair, but plenty of cheaper options get the job done, like Acefast’s nearly free Acefit Air or Soundpeat’s Pearclip Pro. Open earbuds are easily my favorite new audio trend.\n\nWorkout Headphones: Keep Moving\n\nThere’s an obvious Venn diagram overlap between open earbuds and workout headphones, but if you don’t like the idea of keeping your ears open, traditional sports models are a great alternative. My favorite is the revamped Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, which offer tons of features in a wraparound design that’s nearly unshakeable. I like that they’re optimized for Apple devices, but still work well for Android, and they come with great noise canceling and transparency mode, but also a high price.\n\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nLike open earbuds, there are plenty of cheap options, including the similarly unshakeable (but much more basic) Jlab Go Air Sport, which run a mere $30 or less on sale. If you’re not into the minimalist thing, WIRED editor Adrienne So swears by the BlueAnt Pump X over-ear headphones for weightlifting, in large part due to their cooling-gel earpads that go in the fridge overnight to keep sweat at bay. They’ve also got noise canceling and plenty of battery life at over 50 hours per charge. For jogging or cycling, open earbuds are likely a better fit, while some folks simply use the AirPods Pro, but it can be nice to just have a dedicated pair in your gym bag.\n\nWired Headphones: Plug It In\n\nCourtesy of Shure Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Shure SE-112GR $69 Amazon $69 Adorama\n\nThe youth delight in resurrecting old tech that the more seasoned among us have long left for dead (cassette tapes?!). In the case of wired headphones, there’s good reason to plug in, starting with improved performance for your dollars. If you’re a content creator, musician, or simply a cash-savvy sound connoisseur, you can get an impressive return from wired options that avoid the sound degradation of many wireless options.\n\nSome of our favorite affordable options include affordable and classic-looking earbuds like Shure’s iconic SE-112 and Sennheiser’s impressive IE200, and studio-friendly over-ears like Audio-Technica’s ATH-M20x, If you’re willing to spend a bit more, the fantastic Sennheiser HD6XX offer the best sound for the money I’ve heard in any headphone segment. Based on the much pricier HD 650, these are open-back headphones that let in exterior sounds, but the performance is incredible. If you want even better sound and design, there are tons of options, but they’ll cost you.\n\nFancy Headphones: The Audiophile Angle\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nCourtesy of Grado Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Grado Signature S750 $1,675 Grado\n\nIf you really want to optimize the wired connection, there’s a whole segment of audiophile headphones made with high-quality materials, innovative speaker technologies, elevated designs, and accordingly elevated pricing. There are a whole bunch of varieties, but for the sake of levity I’ll break them down into two categories: in-ear monitors (IEMs), the fancy version of in-ear headphones, and over-ears.\n\nIEMs generally use dynamic drivers, the traditional driver type in most headphones and speakers, balanced armatures, much smaller and more accurate speakers, or a mix of both. My favorite pairs come from Ultimate Ears, like the UE 18+ Pro, which are customized for your ears using 3D printing and other techniques. (You’ve likely seen these on TV for musicians and broadcasters.) Other IEMs we like include Sennheiser’s IE 900 and models from Campfire Audio.\n\nMeze Poet Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor over-ear headphones, Audeze’s planar magnetic headphones are among my favorites, starting as low as $500 (yeah, I know) in the excellent LCD-S20 closed-back headphones. Another incredible pair I recently tested are Meze’s Poet, which are not only the most gorgeous-looking pair I’ve reviewed, but also offer among the clearest and most articulate sound I’ve laid ears on. There are dozens more to try, as audiophilia is its own journey, but this is a good starting point. We recently reviewed the Grado Signature S750, which have an effortlessly expansive sound that feels like it can't possibly be coming from mere centimeters away from your eardrums.\n\nOther Headphone Types and Upcoming Features\n\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\n\nCourtesy of Best Buy Save to wishlist Save to wishlist SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3P Wireless $110 Amazon $110 Best Buy\n\nAs I’m sure some of you have already noted, there are still more types of specialty headphones, including Gaming Headsets, which are another animal altogether, and even TV Headphones, which quickly transition from the screen's internal speakers to let you listen in silence without latency. I’m currently testing a new TV headphones bundle from Sennheiser, the RS 275, which includes a dedicated pair of headphones in the HDR 275 and Sennheiser’s new BTA1 Auracast transmitter (verdict to come).\n\nSpeaking of Auracast, it’s an increasingly cool new type of Bluetooth protocol that allows connection of an infinite number of devices at up to 100 meters, like an FM radio signal. Its implementation is still in its early stages, but it’s a good feature to look for in new headphones. Other features to consider include an app with an EQ and presets (which the majority of my recommendations include), multipoint pairing to connect to two or more devices at once (again, pretty ubiquitous), and spatial audio features for video formats like Dolby Atmos."

You put a small pellet in a microwave-like box, and in seconds out comes a delicious-looking, home-cooked roast chicken. We've made some progress since the movie came out nearly 30 years ago, but we're not quite there yet. We've had the microwave for a while, but the pellets still need some work.\n\nThe latest attempt at tasty meals from a box is the meal delivery service. These range from meal kits that deliver the ingredients and you cook them, to complete, ready-to-eat meals. The latest I've tried is Factor, which falls into the latter category. Factor's particular spin on that market is that it specializes in high protein meals targeted at anyone on a keto diet, high protein-low carb, or restricted calorie diets.\n\nWhat You Want\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Factor Prepared Meals Shop at Factor\n\nFactor is similar to other meal services in that you subscribe, pick the meals you want, and Factor ships them out on a weekly basis.

The Factor-selected meals arrived at the start of the week via FedEx, though the delivery service will vary by area. These aren't frozen meals, so throw them in the fridge. They will last up to seven days.\n\nThe subscription process walks you through a list of questions that help determine the right meals for you. There are option lists with goals like “Eat more protein,” “Save time in the kitchen,” “Eat a better variety of foods,” and so on. Then you select other things like your spice preference and how many meal you want per week (the options are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 18)."

            "content": "At the beginning of the year, The Cut kicked off a brief discourse cycle by declaring a new lifestyle trend: “friction-maxxing.”\n\nThe idea, in a nutshell, is that people have overconvenienced themselves with apps, AI, and other means of near-instant gratification—and would be better off with increased friction in their daily lives, which is to say those mundane challenges that ask some minor effort of them.\n\nWhatever your feelings on that philosophy, the use of “maxxing” as a suffix assumed to be familiar or at least intelligible to most readers of a mainstream news outlet is evidence of another trend: the assimilation of incel terminology across the broader internet. The online ecosystem of incels, or “involuntarily celibate” men, is saturated with this sort of clinical jargon; its aggrieved participants insulate, isolate, and identify themselves through in-group codespeak that is meant to baffle and repel outsiders. So how did non-incels (“normies,” as incels would label them) end up adopting and recontextualizing these loaded words?\n\nSlang, no matter its origins, has a viral nature. It tends to break containment and mutate. The buzzword “woke,” as it pertains to our current politics, comes from African American Vernacular English and once referred to an awareness of racial and social injustice—this usage dates to the middle of the 20th century, preceding even the civil rights movement. But the culture wars of this century have turned “woke” into a favorite pejorative of right-wingers, who wield it as a catchall term for anything that threatens their ideology, such as Black pilots or gender-neutral pronouns.\n\nBack in 2014, the eruption of the Gamergate harassment campaign set the stage for a different linguistic realignment. An organized backlash to women working in the video game industry, and eventually any sort of diversity or progressivism within the medium, it exposed a vein of reactionary anger that would gain a fuller voice during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. This was a period when many in the digital mainstream got their first taste of the trollish nihilism and invective that fuels toxic message boards such as 4chan and gave rise to a network of anti-feminist manosphere sites collectively known as the “PSL” community: PUAHate (a board for venting about pickup artists, it was shut down soon after the 2014 Isla Vista killing spree carried out by Elliot Rodger, who frequented the forum), SlutHate (a straightforward misogyny hub), and Lookism (where incels viciously critique each other’s appearance).\n\nLookism, named for the idea that prejudice against the less attractive is as common and pernicious as sexism or racism, is the only forum of the PSL trifecta that survives today, and while we don’t know who coined the “maxxing” idiom, it’s the likeliest source for the first verb with this construction. “Looksmaxxing,” which borrows from the role-playing game concept of “min-maxing,” or elevating a character’s strengths while limiting weaknesses, became the preferred expression for attempts to improve one’s appearance in pursuit of sex. This could mean something as simple as a style makeover or as extreme as “bonesmashing,” a supposed technique of achieving a more defined jaw by tapping it with a hammer.\n\nIf the 2000s introduced people to pickup lingo like “game” and “negging,” the 2010s ushered in language that extended the Darwinian vision of the dating pool as a cutthroat and strictly hierarchical marketplace. “AMOG,” an initialism for “alpha male of the group,” gave us “mogging,” a display where one man flexes his physical superiority over a rival. An ideally masculine specimen might also be recognized as a “Chad,” who allegedly enjoys his pick of attractive partners, while a Chad among Chads is, of course, a “Gigachad.” Women were disparaged as “female humanoids,” then “femoids,” and finally just “foids.”"

            "content": "If you drive a car that's newer than 2008, a new study finds your vehicle's tire pressure monitoring system can be used to track you.\n\nA group of researchers at IMDEA Networks Institute -- an English-speaking research organization on data networks based in Madrid -- discovered this privacy risk at the end of a 10-week study in which they collected roughly 6 million wireless signals from over 20,000 cars. Their findings point to a serious hacker threat hiding in the tire sensors of most modern vehicles.\n\nThe TREAD Act of 2000 mandated that modern cars come equipped with TPMS for road safety. The system works by releasing wireless signals through tiny sensors attached to each tire, which communicate each tire's pressure information to the car's electronic control unit. A warning light on the vehicle's dashboard indicates low tire pressure.\n\nInstead of using a camera with a clear line of sight to the car, hackers can hypothetically track it using the wireless signals emitted by the car's tire sensors. That signal is continuously sent out as an unencrypted unique ID number.\n\nBasically, anyone nearby with a cheap radio receiver can pick up the signal and later recognize the same vehicle without ever seeing the license plate.\n\nInformation could help users track drivers\n\n\"Our results show that these tire sensor signals can be used to follow vehicles and learn their movement patterns,\" Domenico Giustiniano, research professor at IMDEA Networks Institute, said in the peer-reviewed report. \"This means a network of inexpensive wireless receivers could quietly monitor the patterns of cars in real-world environments. Such information could reveal daily routines, such as work arrival times or travel habits.\"\n\nThe researchers were able to capture signals from more than 50 meters away from moving cars, through walls and from inside buildings. The tire pressure readings helped reveal the vehicle type, its weight and the driving pattern of the driver. It's a cheap, tough-to-detect, potentially covert tracking method.\n\nWhile this may be a startling discovery, Cooper Quintin, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNET it's not the only privacy threat in your car's computer system.\n\n\"Any method that can be misused to surreptitiously track people's movements without their knowledge is concerning,\" he said. \"But so are all of the technologies in modern cars that intentionally violate drivers' privacy by collecting and sharing data for purposes of advertising, insurance risk assessment, and more. It's sad that drivers have to worry about this, and everyone should learn how to protect themselves whenever possible while manufacturers are pressured to do better.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time a group of researchers has raised the red flag about this sensor system in cars. A 2010 study by researchers at Rutgers University and the University of South Carolina warned of the potential privacy threat hiding in a vehicle's tire pressure system. Sixteen years later, the flaw persists.\n\n\"TPMS was designed for safety, not security,\" said Dr. Yago Lizarribar, one of the study's authors. \"Our findings show the need for manufacturers and regulators to improve protection in future vehicle sensor systems.\"\n\nThe study urges policymakers and car manufacturers to design a more secure and privacy-preserving TPMS for future cars."

            "content": "The projected shortage of memory chips worldwide will have a more serious impact on smartphone sales in 2026 than previously projected, according to new data from International Data Corporation Worldwide. Whereas the company just in November had estimated a drop of between 0.9% and 5.2% (the latter being its \"pessimistic scenario\"), now it sees a 12.9% decline this year, based on its Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.\n\n\"What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,\" Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for Worldwide Client Devices at IDC, said in a statement.\n\nThe hardest-hit companies are expected to be those selling to the lower end of the market, which can't absorb the higher component costs while maintaining profitable margins. As a result, Jeronimo says, many of those players will pass the added costs on to consumers.\n\nThat also includes regional markets like the Middle East and Africa that sell mostly inexpensive smartphones, which could see a steep 20.6% drop year-over-year.\n\nIDC predicts a steep drop in smartphone sales for 2026. IDC\n\nBy contrast, IDC expects Apple and Samsung to be better able to withstand the crisis. \"As smaller and low-end-positioned Android vendors struggle with rising costs, Apple and Samsung could not only weather the storm but potentially expand market share as the competitive landscape tightens,\" said Jeronimo.\n\nMemory has become scarce due to the insatiable demand to feed generative AI. Essentially all of the memory set to be manufactured this year is already earmarked. What started as a demand for graphics processors has expanded to other components. For example, hard drive manufacturer Western Digital announced in early February that it had already sold out of its supply for 2026.\n\n\"We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points,\" said Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC, projecting a 14% rise in the average selling price of smartphones to $523.\n\nPopal expects memory prices to stabilize by the middle of 2027, but doesn't see them coming down to earlier levels. The sub-$100 segment, made up of approximately 171 million devices, will be \"permanently uneconomical,\" she said. \"In short, there is no return to business as usual for vendors and consumers.\""

            "content": "During Nvidia's quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang said that agentic AI has reached \"an inflection point\" and that AI agents are \"solving real problems.\"\n\nThe company's powerful chips have been at the heart of the AI boom over the last few years, especially for use in data centers -- so much so that Nvidia's annual revenue for fiscal 2026 zoomed to $216 billion, up 65% from the previous year.\n\nHuang called Nvidia an AI infrastructure company, a dramatic evolution from the graphics card company it started as.\n\nThe term agentic AI has been floating around for some time, but now the technology is becoming available for real-world use. Unlike chatbots, which stay within their own boundaries to produce text, images or code, AI agents can take specific actions -- for instance, plan and book a vacation -- without a person constantly giving it commands.\n\nIn a live event just hours before Nvidia released its earnings, Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy S26 lineup of phones, devoting a good deal of time to talking about the \"agentic AI experience\" they'll deliver.\n\nDuring Nvidia's call, Huang said that the world has \"awakened to the agentic inflection\" and that it only happened within the last two or three months. He also said he believes the next inflection will be physical AI, a term that describes the embedding of artificial intelligence in machinery, including self-driving cars and robots.\n\nRobots were a notable presence at CES earlier this year, the consumer electronics extravaganza. Companies showed them off doing everything from folding clothes to serving as companions to handling assembly line work.\n\nWe should hear much more about what to expect from Nvidia at its GTC conference in March. It will likely have more to say about its AI-focused Rubin chip, and may also be ready to take the plunge into laptop chip territory."

            "content": "Paramount Skydance appears set to win its bidding war against Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nLate Thursday, Netflix walked away from its planned acquisition of HBO, HBO Max, and Warner Bros. studios' business. The streaming giant said it \"had declined to raise its offer\" after Paramount submitted a revised all-cash bid of $31 per share on Tuesday to buy WBD in its entirety. WBD had reviewed the rival offer and announced that its board of directors found it \"superior\" to the Netflix agreement.\n\nNetflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement: \"At the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive.\"\n\nThe statement went on to say: \"We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.' iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the US.\"\n\nHowever, according to Netflix, the transaction was more of a \"nice to have\" than a \"must have\" at any price.\n\nIf approved, Paramount's new bid would see it not only pay $31 per share in cash, but also be on the hook for a $2.8 billion termination fee that WBD would owe Netflix for backing out of its agreement. Additionally, Paramount would also be responsible for paying \"a daily ticking fee equal to $0.25 per share per quarter beginning after Sept. 30, 2026,\" according to WBD, and pony up $7 billion should the deal not pass regulatory requirements.\n\nParamount's deal is backed by cash from Larry Ellison, the billionaire father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nThe merger-acquisition plan between Netflix and WBD was originally announced on Dec. 5 for $83 billion (stocks and cash). The deal has since seen several takeover bids from Paramount, prompting Netflix to switch to an all-cash deal in January while Paramount engaged in a back-and-forth to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe announcement arrives on the day of WBD's Q4 earnings call, and the same day that Netflix's Sarandos visited Washington, DC, to meet with officials amid the Paramount bid.\n\nCNET's Corinne Reichert also contributed to this report."

            "content": "Instagram will soon alert some parents if their teen repeatedly tries to search for terms related to suicide or self-harm within a short period. Instagram owner Meta said on Thursday that it's rolling out the new notifications to parents in the US, UK, Australia and Canada, with other regions to follow later this year.\n\nThursday's update follows the 2024 introduction of teen accounts. It applies to parents using the platform's optional parental supervision setting, which requires consent from both teens and their parents to participate. Parental supervision allows parents to see the accounts their teen follows, set a time limit for how long their teen can use the app and more.\n\nIf teens repeatedly make suicide-related searches, parents will receive alerts via in-app notifications and email, text or WhatsApp, depending on available contact information. In addition to informing parents of their teen's searches, notifications will allow them to \"view expert resources designed to help them approach potentially sensitive conversations with their teen,\" according to Meta.\n\nAn example of the alerts. Meta\n\nMeta said it would prompt an alert if a teen attempted to search for phrases promoting suicide or self-harm and phrases that suggest a teen wants to harm themselves. The company said its policy is to block searches for self-harm and suicide content and direct people to resources and helplines.\n\nThis move by Instagram is just one of many digital safety measures aimed at protecting young people online. It comes as governments push their own guardrails: Australia recently enacted the world's first ban on social media accounts for children under 16, and the United Kingdom is considering similar restrictions. These efforts reflect a broader trend toward embedding protective technologies and policies around young people and their online use, even as debates about privacy, autonomy, and effectiveness continue."

            "content": "Samsung has introduced three new S26 handsets at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of the year: the S26, the S26 Plus and the uber premium S26 Ultra. The S26 Ultra continues the company's tradition of Ultra handsets that offer top-of-the-line features that are lacking from the rest of their respective series. And this year, the Ultra's Privacy Display is the clear highlight feature, allowing you to customize how visible your phone is to others around you.\n\nAside from that, the S26 Ultra's other improvements are somewhat marginal. Yes, it's now made out of aluminum, the screen is a touch bigger, a 16GB RAM option is available, the processor is improved and the charging speeds are faster, but the rest of the S26 Ultra's features are similar to that of the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Even the price remains the same at $1,300.\n\nHere is how the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra compares with the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nWatch this: First Look at the Galaxy S26 Ultra: Camera, Battery and AI Updates 02:56\n\nDesign and display\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra only has a marginally larger screen compared to the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Both the S24 Ultra and the S25 Ultra have 6.8-inch AMOLED screens with 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution, while the new S26 Ultra has a 6.9-inch AMOLED display also with a 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution. All three screens have a 1 to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate.\n\nBut it's the pixel-level Privacy Display that's particularly impressive with the S26 Ultra. When activated, the display will remain visible when looking directly at the phone while making it difficult to impossible to see what's on screen from the side. In addition to letting you turn the feature on and off for different apps, you can even have the Privacy Display activate exclusively for notifications while keeping the rest of the screen plainly visible.\n\nThe S26 Ultra's screen uses Gorilla Glass Armor 2 cover glass, while the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra both use Gorilla Glass Armor. Gorilla Glass Armor 2 is said to be more scratch and drop resistant compared to its earlier version.\n\nSize-wise, the S26 Ultra is a touch bigger but also a touch thinner compared to its predecessors. CNET Senior Reporter Abrar Al-Heeti describes the new design as feeling thinner and lighter than prior Ultra phones during her hands-on time. It measures 6.44 by 3.07 by 0.31 inches, while the S25 Ultra's dimensions are 6.41 by 3.06 by 0.32 inches and the S24 Ultra measures 6.4 by 3.11 by 0.34 inches. Also, the S26 Ultra has an aluminum frame. That's a departure from the titanium frame found on both the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nThe cameras on the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nCameras\n\nWhile the S26 Ultra certainly has the best camera hardware of the S26 lineup, it has the same exact camera specs as its predecessors. All three Ultra phones have four cameras: a 200-megapixel wide, a 50-megapixel ultrawide, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and a 50-megapixel 5x telephoto. That said, the S26 Ultra does have larger apertures and to capture better low-light photos. They also all have a 12-megapixel front-facing camera.\n\nMany of the S26 Ultra's camera upgrades come from software. There's the Horizontal Lock feature that'll keep the horizon steady while shooting video, selfies can now capture more natural skin tones and screenshots will now be sorted into its own categories within the Gallery.\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nBattery, processor and RAM\n\nAll three Ultra phones have a 5,000 mAh battery, but the charging speeds differ. The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra have 45W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, while the new S26 Ultra has 60W of wired charging and 25W wireless charging. Just like the S25 Ultra, the S26 Ultra does not include magnets but can support magnetic charging accessories when using a case that includes them.\n\nThe processors in the Ultra phones also get progressively faster and more efficient with each generation. The S24 Ultra has Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the S25 Ultra uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy and the S26 Ultra ships with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy.\n\nWhile all three Ultra handsets come in three storage capacity options -- 256GB, 512GB and 1TB -- the S26 Ultra is the only one with a 16GB RAM option. (This ships with the 512GB and 1TB options.) The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra only ship with 12GB of RAM.\n\nCheck out the below chart to compare more details between the S26 Ultra, S25 Ultra and S24 Ultra."
