            "content": "MO SALAH has been dubbed “yesterday’s man” by a former Liverpool star.\n\nThe Egyptian King – a firm fans’ favourite and icon at Anfield – has struggled for form and consistency this season, with his latest numbers against West Ham hammering that fact home.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite a 5-2 win for Arne Slot’s troops, the Reds’ superstar struggled.\n\nThe 33-year-old made just 46 touches including ZERO dribbles.\n\nHe had three shots in the game and again ZERO on target with most of his touches coming out wide with just a handful coming inside the box.\n\nA return of just FOUR Premier League goals this term compared to 29 last season has left many scratching their heads.\n\nBut former Liverpool winger Mark Kennedy didn’t hold back in his assessment.\n\nSpeaking to talkSPORT, he said: “I knew you’d ask me this and I was worried you’d ask me this and I am going to be controversial here.\n\n“When I look at Salah’s stats last year, they are absolutely phenomenal. But every time I watched Liverpool last year I never liked Salah.\n\n“I think his ball retention is really, really poor and he gives up a lot of possession.\n\n\n\nCASINO SPECIAL – BEST CASINO BONUSES FROM £10 DEPOSITS\n\n“I don’t want to be controversial. I am a Liverpool fan and a big fan of Salah, I think he is amazing. But I think he is yesterday’s man.\n\n“I am not surprised by his performances this year. I have been saying it for a long time and I think it has affected Liverpool.\n\n“When you look at what Liverpool have lost this year from last year. They’ve lost a huge amount of goals.\n\n“Salah, 29 last year and four this year. [Luis] Diaz, [Cody] Gakpo got 10 last year and he’s got five this year. They’ve lost a huge amount of goals.\n\n“Then you look Salah’s behaviour and his comments and whilst you may have a point and may have a belief in what you say, it just doesn’t help anybody at all.”\n\n\n\nSalah’s numbers from last season to this are night and day.\n\nIn 52 appearances last term across all competitions he netted 34 goals and chipped in with 23 assists.\n\nThis campaign so far it is just seven goals and eight assists in 29 outings.\n\n\n\nIt was only a year ago that Salah signed a bumper new two-year deal with his current terms up next summer.\n\nHowever, he could exit before that after we previously told you it is “increasingly likely” he could exit in the coming months.\n\nThe MLS and Saudi Pro League are viewed as potential options with SPL sides vocal in the past of their admiration for Salah.\n\nAll the talk over an exit comes in the wake of his major falling out with manager Arne Slot over the winter.\n\n\n\nSalah insisted in December, after being benched for the third game in a row during Liverpool’s horror run, that the club had “thrown me under the bus” and that “someone doesn’t want me.”\n\nTop sport travel deals SEE the New Year in with a bang with these huge sporting events.

            "content": "IT should have been the biggest knees-up of Burnley’s Premier League lives – instead it became the day when VAR all but sealed their fate.\n\nThe Clarets had battled back from three down to snatch the unlikeliest of levellers in astonishing second half, only to blow it again.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut then TWICE more Burnley put the ball in the net – and TWICE more the most controversial of calls from video official Paul Tierney robbed them.\n\nAnd there will be many who feel robbed is the right word, as both occasions were the most hairs-breadth calls against the home side.\n\nFirst when Jaidon Anthony strayed an inch beyond Michael Kayode before the cross that Zion Flemming headed in for another equaliser.\n\n\n\nAnd then, when Mikkel Damsgaard’s second looked to have saved the day, he was denied by an accidental handball before blasting it home.\n\nWhat a cruel end on what started as the most bland of days, because there was no hint of the mayhem to come in a first half so one-side plenty of home fans had already left by the time the teams were back in the dressing room.\n\nIn truth there wasn’t a hint of anything other than an away win – an away cakewalk in fact – from the second Brentford edged ahead after eight minutes.\n\nThat opener came when Mikkel Damsgaard – one of the smallest men on the pitch – was totally unmarked to meet Dango Outtara’s corner.\n\n\n\nKeeper Martin Dubravka claimed he was blocked, yet even without meeting traffic, he wouldn’t have got near the downward header.\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nThe Clarets’ pitiful defensive effort pretty much summed up the resistance Brentford faced in that opening 45-minute stroll – none.\n\n\n\nThere was certainly none when Damsgaard then turned provider to tee up the second for Igor Thiago with a bog-standard ball through the middle.\n\nThiago wasn’t about to pass up the chance and clipped a clinical effort past Dubravka for the second.\n\nIf that wasn’t game over, then it surely was on 35 minutes, when Kevin Schade blasted in number three and Burnley fans blasted the boss and owner.\n\nAnd once again it was hardly a goal of rocket science creation – more one of balls-up defending.\n\nThis time it was a Michael Kayode long throw-in that caused chaos, Sepp Van Den Berg rising highest to flick it goalwards.\n\n\n\nLucas Pires stretched out a leg to hook it away from the net, only for Schade to slam it home and home fans to slam manager Scott Parker and owner Alan Pace.\n\nBurnley were so bad that many couldn’t get to the exits quickly enough. Safe to say it wasn’t the wisest decision they will make this season.\n\nWhen they heard the cheers of a goal pulled back in first half stoppage time most will have seen it as little more than a consolation – and rightly so, you thought.\n\n\n\nThe Clarets didn’t even score it themselves either, in all fairness, because Jaidon Anthony’s far post strike was fizzing wide by some distance.\n\nYet Kayode, sliding back to try and block, had no chance to get out of the way and only managed to bundle it into his own net.\n\nUnfortunate, yes, but game-changing? Not even the most one-eyed of Clarets would have said so with anything more than blind faith at that stage.\n\nSo how unbelievable, incredible, astonishing and amazing that after an hour we were all square, first when Anthony did get his name on the scoresheet.\n\nStrictly speaking Kayode again had the final touch before the ball flew past Hakon Valdimarrson…yet he wasn’t about to claim a double.\n\n\n\nUnbelievably the impossible was on the cards. But this was Burnley…they just don’t come back from three goals down do they?\n\nWell actually, yes. Or at least they did here, because out of nowhere and all of a sudden it was 3-3 and Parker’s men were the ones pressing for a winner.\n\nBy now it was the Brentford backline which was in disarray, once again thanks to as Hannibal delivery – as it had been for the second.\n\nAs the Bees dithered, Zion Flemming darted and rose to plant his header into the corner from Mejbri’s pinpoint pass. Bedlam!\n\n\n\nMind you, nothing compared to the chaos that was just around the corner…you ain’t seen nothing yet, you could say.\n\nFor with 13 minutes to go Flemming was dancing a jig of delight in front of the barely believing fans at nodding in a potential winner.\n\nAnthony was fasted to reach Hannibal’s dinked free kick down the left and drilled over a low cross.\n\nKeane Lewis-Potter slid back to get something of a block on the ball, only for Flemming to bundle it home.\n\nDon’t celebrate too soon, though, eh? Not with VAR around to step in and call a gnat’s nudger of an offside against Anthony and wreck the party.\n\n\n\nEven so, a point was a fair return after that shocking first half…or at least it would have been. Damsgaard had other ideas.\n\nFor he had the final say on an astonishing afternoon by finding a pocket of space in the box to shoot past Dubravka for a fourth.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nStill there was time for Barnes to level it again – and then not, as it turned out.\n\nFootball, bloody hell, as someone once said."

Leeds boss Farke stormed over to Peter Bankes after the referee blew for full-time at Elland Road.\n\nBefore the German even reached Bankes, he pulled out his red card. Farke, 49, continued to remonstrate with Bankes about a number of decisions, and he had to be pulled away by Leeds goalkeeper Karl Darlow.\n\nBoth sets of players were then involved in somewhat of a melee. City manager Pep Guardiola had to intervene while Farke chose to do a lap of the pitch and applaud Leeds' fans.\n\nOn the full-time commotion, Leeds defender Ilia Gruev told Sky Sports: \"Emotions, they want to win, but we also want to win. It was ana exhausting game - emotions involved and this is quite normal.\"\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN CITY FB PAGE! Follow our Manchester City Mirror Football Facebook page\n\nAntoine Semenyo scored the decisive goal for Guardiola's side, who were missing the injured Erling Haaland, as they moved to within two points of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League table. The result extended Leeds' run without a win to three games, with Farke's team only six points above the relegation zone.\n\nSemenyo hailed City's win, saying: \"Definitely a big one. Every game is a big one until the end of the season. We just want to win as many as we can and keep the pressure on.\n\n\"They made it tough, lots of crosses.

The deadlock was broken in the dying embers of the first half when Semenyo ghosted in between Leeds' centre-halves to finish a slick move from six yards.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSemenyo's strike proved to be the game's decisive moment as neither City or Leeds were able to find the net in the second half. Here are Mirror Football's big talking points from the game...\n\nErling Haaland OUT of Man City vs Leeds clash in injury blow for Pep Guardiola READ MORE :\n\nVAR gets EVEN MORE power as football lawmakers make controversial rule changes READ MORE :\n\n1) No Haaland, no problem\n\nThe big talking point pre-match was the absence of Erling Haaland: Manchester City's imperious Leeds-born striker who would have almost certainly led the line for Pep Guardiola's side. Step forward, Semenyo.\n\nCity's January acquisition from Bournemouth predominantly played centrally to try and plug the gap left by Haaland and it was his sixth goal since moving to The Etihad which nudged the visitors in front.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHaaland exudes main character energy and, barring any major change in circumstances, will be City's main man for a long time to come. But Semenyo's impact since linking up with City has been significant - and he's quickly becoming an important figure in this team.\n\n2) O'Reilly worry\n\nView 4 Images Nico O'Reilly impressed again for Manchester City against Leeds (Image: Oli Scarff/AFP)\n\nSemenyo may have caught the eye for City recently, but he's far from alone on that front. And Nico O'Reilly produced another impressive display in an advanced midfield position as he continues to build a compelling case to make England's World Cup squad.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nExcellent filling in at left-back, O'Reilly was at the heart of plenty of good things here, even if he was unable to continue his fine scoring run after plundering three goals in his last two games.\n\nThe sight of him hobbling off the field in the second half, then, was the only sour note on an evening which could prove to be pivotal in the title race. City will hope O'Reilly's issue is nothing serious.\n\n3) Calvert-Lewin and Leeds fail to fire\n\nView 4 Images Dominic Calvert-Lewin led the line for Leeds against Manchester City (Image: Justin Setterfield)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDaniel Farke quipped that Calvert-Lewin was 'the only striker to come close' to Erling Haaland after anointing the City man as the world's best centre forward. And with the Norwegian missing, Calvert-Lewin took centre stage.\n\nThe former Everton man has enjoyed a renaissance at Elland Road and already had 10 goals to his name before Saturday evening's big game. He had two golden chances to add to that tally in the opening 20 minutes but was unable to take either of them.\n\nHe was, though, a constant thorn in the City defence's side and will have a key role to play in Leeds' bid to beat the drop.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n4) City stand firm\n\nWhile it's Semenyo who leaves with the headlines, another of City's January signings, Marc Guehi, played his part here alongside Ruben Dias the rest of the backline.\n\nIt's now two clean sheets in three for City, who have chalked up four straight wins. That should come as no surprise as this is generally the stage of the season where Guardiola's team starts to pur...\n\n5) Game on in title race\n\nView 4 Images Pep Guardiola and Manchester City are closing in on Arsenal (Image: Simon Stacpoole/Offside)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNot for the first time in recent weeks, the onus is on Arsenal to respond after City potentialy propelled themselves to within a game of the league leaders.\n\nArsenal play tomorrow, of course, and could restore the five-point gap that existed between the two teams at the start of the weekend. But we've seen before how the pressure of the title race can affect teams - something both City and Arsenal can attest to this season.\n\nOver to you then, Arsenal.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

            "content": "Virgil van Dijk moment in West Ham win speaks volumes about Liverpool captain\n\nLIVERPOOL 5-2 WEST HAM: Virgil van Dijk scored his third goal in six Premier League games as Liverpool continued their good form in pursuit of a Champions League place\n\nView 3 Images Virgil van Dijk has been talismanic for Liverpool (Image: Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\nAs if it were needed, Virgil van Dijk gave the Kop an old-fashioned reminder of his love for the club. He has always seemed too cool to be a badge-kisser but that is what it looked like the captain was doing after his header provided early confirmation of an incoming Liverpool win.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThis troubled title defence has hurt Van Dijk, make no mistake. He has been the player who has had to field the criticism. He has been the voice of a dressing-room under scrutiny. His own performances have not been immune to negative inspection, Wayne Rooney the most prominent pundit to suggest the centre-half had not been at his imperious best.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd Rooney's remarks were not baseless. No Liverpool player - apart, maybe, from Dominik Szoboszlai - has been exemplary this season. Even here, Van Dijk was not flawless, blindsided by Tomas Soucek for the goal that gave West Ham United a semblance of optimism early in the second half.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut Van Dijk's third goal in the last six Premier League games was crucial in ensuring Liverpool maintained momentum in the battle for Champions League spots. It doubled the lead that had been provided by Hugo Ekitike's 11th Premier League goal of an encouraging first campaign and also highlighted Liverpool's startling set-piece resurgence.\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE! Latest Reds news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nLiverpool surprise transfer confirmed as late deal done in Trent Alexander-Arnold repeat READ MORE :\n\nFrom a corner routine later in the first half, Alexis Mac Allister scored the third. And even though Soucek's sharp thinking brought Nuno Espirito Santo's side a well-deserved reward, it turned out to be one of two consolation efforts in a slightly odd encounter.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn open play, for long periods of the contest, West Ham were more than a match for the Premier League champions but their defending - of set-pieces in particular - was pretty abysmal. Liverpool took full advantage to produce a scoreline that was far more convincing than the performance.\n\nThe fourth goal was an individual effort from Cody Gakpo but continued the theme of abject defending. It was a theme Liverpool warmed to, with Van Dijk and his teammates allowing a Jarrod Bowen corner to bounce before it was headed home by Taty Castellanos.\n\nBACK THE MIRROR! Ensure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Virgil van Dijk made it 2-0 against West Ham (Image: Dan Mullan/Getty Images)\n\nAnd before an Axel Diasi own goal gave the final winning margin a look that distinctly did not reflect the balance of play, Crysencio Summerville wasted a great chance to give Liverpool a really nervous finale. But while the scoreboard flattered Arne Slot's side, this was a third Premier League win on the spin and, from the manager’s point of view, there were some encouraging performances.\n\nThe cameo from Jeremie Frimpong, who was returning from a month's absence and who forced the Disasi mistake, was particularly eye-catching. There was also one dazzling moment from another substitute, Rio Ngumoha, and the noticeable contribution of the 17-year-old, and of Frimpong, actually highlighted another quite frustrating afternoon for Mohamed Salah.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOf course, when you are part of a side that wins 5-2, you should not be THAT frustrated but Salah has now gone 10 Premier League games without scoring. And quite frankly, he did not look like scoring in a game where most people looked like scoring.\n\nView 3 Images Mo Salah hasn't scored a Premier League goal since November (Image: Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\nThere can be no doubt the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold and the restructuring of the attacking system had a negative impact on Salah's form, and too often, he cut an isolated figure. But he also looks to be lacking in physical and mental sharpness, too often taking the wrong options.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLate on, he ignored a goal-threatening run from Frimpong to take on a thankless task of his own and that did not go unnoticed by the home crowd. While his team are winning, Slot will not be overly concerned and Ngumoha is, right now, probably best suited to the role of impact substitute.\n\nBut if Liverpool are to go deeper in the Champions League and maintain their Premier League push, they are going to need Salah to respond to the critical attention. In the same way that Virgil van Dijk has.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Due to airport closures, F1 travellers have been rerouted onto flights via Hong Kong and Singapore, whilst others are taking direct flights to Perth and Qantas.\n\nAn F1 spokesperson said: \"Our next three races are in Australia, China and Japan, not in the Middle East - those races are not for a number of weeks.

In a statement to PlanetF1.com, Pirelli said: \"The two days of development tests for wet-weather compounds, scheduled for today and tomorrow at the Bahrain International Circuit, have been cancelled for security reasons following the evolving international situation.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"All Pirelli personnel currently in Manama are safe in their hotels.

The country has qualified for the 2026 World Cup and is set to play several group stage matches across North America, but FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom has indicated that their situation will be monitored in the lead-up to the tournament.\n\nSpeaking at the International Football Association Board's annual general meeting in Cardiff on Saturday, Grafstrom said: \"I read the news [about Iran] this morning the same way you did.

            "content": "Ashley Barnes saw an equaliser for Burnley vs Brentford ruled out for handball deep into added time during a chaotic defeat for his side at Turf Moor. At 4-3 down, it was a case of last chance saloon for Scott Parker's Clarets, as Maxime Esteve launched the ball into the Brentford box from his own half eight minutes into additional time.\n\nJoe Worrall then connected to put the ball on a plate for Barnes, with the late super sub firing home from close range to level matters as the home crowd erupted in jubilation. However, celebrations were short-lived as VAR swiftly stepped in to scrutinise the build-up, identifying that Barnes had handled the ball before his strike.\n\nIn heart-breaking fashion, referee Sam Barrott then announced his decision to rule to goal out, shortly before the full-time whistle sounded and Burnley left the encounter empty-handed despite their best efforts. Explaining his decision, Barrott was head saying on the field: \"After review - 35 [Ashley Barnes], accidentally handles the ball. That leads to a direct goal. My final decision will be defensive free-kick to Brentford.\"\n\nIt's a decision that Burnley co-owner JJ Watt rued, given the former NFL star was in the stands at Turf Moor to cheer on the Clarets. Taking to X in the aftermath of Barrott's announcement, he wrote: \"If it takes 10 minutes, it’s not clear and obvious...\" in a huge dig toward VAR.\n\nIt will come as a bitter pill to swallow for Burnley fans, considering Parker almost engineered the comeback of the season for his side. Mikkel Damsgaard opened the scoring for the Bees just nine minutes into the match, before Igor Thiago and Kevin Schade incited fears that it may be another stuffing on Burnley's part with further goals ahead of the break.\n\nMichael Kayode gave Burnley fans a slight glimmer of hope with an own goal three minutes into stoppage time, before Parker and his side returned to their dressing room with a mountain to climb if they harboured any hopes of taking anything from the game.\n\nJaidon Anthony reduced the deficit to just one just two minutes into the second-half, as Burnley emerged from the tunnel seemingly invigorated from Parker's pep talk. And Turf Moor erupted when Zian Flemming levelled matters 60 minutes into the encounter, before Burnley pressed on for a much-needed winner.\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

The Reds boosted their Champions League hopes while ensuring that Nuno Espirito Santo's side remain in the relegation zone.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nArne Slot described his side's first-half performance at Nottingham Forest last weekend as the 'worst we've played', but it was different story at Anfield. The Reds raced into a 1-0 lead through Hugo Ekitike.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nVirgil van Dijk soon doubled Liverpool's advantage to continue his fine goalscoring form. West Ham were in the game, though, and had chances to get back in it.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Irons' hopes looked to be dashed when Alexis Mac Allister made it 3-0 before half-time, only for Tomas Soucek to pull a goal back shortly after the break. But Cody Gakpo's strike and an own goal made sure of the three points.\n\nHere are five talking points from Anfield.\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE! Latest Reds news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLiverpool surprise transfer confirmed as late deal done in Trent Alexander-Arnold repeat READ MORE :\n\n1. Liverpool's lightning-fast start\n\nAfter leaving it very late against Forest, Liverpool wasted no time to break the deadlock here. West Ham initially dealt with a corner in the fifth minute, only for Ryan Gravenberch to pick up the pieces on the edge of the penalty area.\n\nGravenberch whipped the ball into Ekitike, who found space and lashed a shot past Mads Hermansen courtesy of a deflection off Konstantinos Mavropanos. The Frenchman celebrated with a thumbs-up to the Kop, where his new banner was unfurled ahead of kick-off.\n\nBACK THE MIRROR!

Van Dijk continues hot streak\n\nYou just can't keep him off the scoresheet. No, not Ekitike, Van Dijk!\n\nLiverpool's captain headed home his third goal in six Premier League games to double the Reds' lead on 24 minutes. Once again, West Ham failed to deal with a corner and it proved fatal.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThere was a brief VAR check for offside, due to the position which Joe Gomez was taking up, but the goal stood. Liverpool were in the mood for goals.\n\nView 5 Images Virgil van Dijk has scored three goals in his last six Premier League games (Image: Dan Mullan/Getty Images)\n\n3. West Ham's set-piece woes\n\nThe Reds had time for another goal before half-time which, you guessed it, came from a corner. With the interval approaching and West Ham still in with a chance of a making it a contest, Liverpool put the nail in their coffin.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMo Salah's delivery was inadvertently flicked to back post by Jarrod Bowen, allowing Ekitike to volley it back to Mac Allister in acres of space. The midfielder then produced a volley of his own, rifling it past Hermansen.\n\nIt was just the kind of first half Liverpool needed after Slot slated their opening 45 minutes at the City Ground. But for West Ham, it was all going wrong.\n\nView 5 Images West Ham conceded three goals from corners (Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n4. Gakpo back in the goals\n\nLiverpool were given a few scares after Soucek's goal and their win was under threat. But Gakpo, who'd missed a guilt-edged earlier in the second half, allayed the home crowd's fears with his first goal in eight league matches.\n\nEkitike provided the assist again, but it was the Netherlands international who did the hard work. Standing up Aaron Wan-Bissaka before cutting inside on his right foot, Gakpo ended his drought in style.\n\nStill West Ham didn't give up, though. Valentin Castellanos scored the sixth goal of the game and fourth from a corner to restore the two-goal deficit. But it was too little, too late, as Axel Disasi's own goal made it 5-2.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Cody Gakpo made it 4-1 with a well-taken goal (Image: Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\n5. Irons resurgence halted\n\nAlthough this only goes down as West Ham's second defeat in seven league games, it's now three without a win for the Irons, who are two points adrift of safety. With the two teams directly above them - Tottenham and Forest - having employed managers, West Ham supporters will be worrying about that gap getting larger on Sunday.\n\nAlthough Santo's side were by no means hammered by Liverpool, they paid the price for poor defending. Things don't get much easier for West Ham, with Fulham away up next before they host Manchester City either side of an FA Cup fifth-round clash tie against Brentford.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

As soon as the eventual runner-up came to us we've gone on again.\n\n\"I thought he would definitely stay and have a good chance.\"\n\nOwner Tracey Lake said: \"What a legend he is. So proud of him.

            "content": "Tawanda Maswanhise's brace earned Motherwell a routine 2-0 victory against Dundee United and moved them to within a point of third-placed Celtic.\n\nThe Zimbabwean striker's 37th-minute penalty and deflected strike 60 seconds after the restart made for a comfortable success and took his tally for the season to 21.\n\nJens Berthel Askou's entertainers were not required to be at their mesmerising best to take the points as they made it one defeat in their last 20 William Hill Premiership matches.\n\nDundee United's top-six hopes suffered a near fatal blow as they now trail Falkirk by 12 points with five games to play before the split.\n\nUnited survived a couple of early scares before growing into the game.\n\nIurie Iovu's well-timed lunge stopped Ibrahim Said from pulling the trigger right in front of goal after neat work from Callum Slattery and Maswanhise.\n\nSlattery flashed an effort right across goal when teed up by Elijah Just.\n\nUnited had no wish to suffer the same fate as St Mirren who were thrashed 5-0 by Well last Saturday.\n\nMotherwell's pre-split fixtures Dundee (a) - March 7\n\nCeltic (a) - March 14\n\nHibernian (h) - March 21\n\nFalkirk (h) - April 4\n\nHearts (a) - April 11\n\nJim Goodwin packed the midfield and tried to prevent Elliot Watt and Lukas Fadinger dictating from deep.\n\nThe visitors fashioned openings from winning the ball high up the pitch.\n\nCalum Ward saved from Max Watters and Luca Stephenson and Julius Eskesen dragged a good chance wide.\n\nMotherwell took the lead from the spot after a lengthy VAR check on a penalty-box flashpoint. Maswanhise took a blow to the ribs from Vicko Sevelj's elbow and a penalty was given.\n\nMaswanhise was fully recovered in time to send Ashley Maynard-Brewer the wrong way.\n\nMotherwell went direct to trouble United - and that was the route to their second goal.\n\nWatt's free-kick from his own half found Maswanhise on the edge of the United penalty area and a great take and turn allowed him to fire towards goal. A deflection was enough to beat the goalkeeper.\n\nMaswanhise was released again in the 50th minute but he sent his hat-trick chance bobbling wide.\n\nGoodwin made a quadruple substitution just after the hour and one of those introduced, Kristijan Trapanovski, hit the far post direct from a corner.\n\nThat apart, Motherwell and their fans enjoyed playing with a lead.\n\nThe excellent Slattery whipped a superb attempt inches wide from 25 yards, while at the other end Stephenson got in behind the defence, only to clip an effort just past the far post.\n\nWhat the managers said...\n\nMotherwell boss Jens Berthel Askou:\n\n\"It's fantastic to have a player [Maswanhise] who can score a penalty every time, then know he'll get chances during the game.\n\n\"He was a little bit lucky, but you have to play the luck and force the luck by having a go.\n\n\"He deserved a goal or two. He does so well to break free of the tight marking and physical duels that go on around him, which can be a mental test.\"\n\nDundee Utd boss Jim Goodwin:\n\n\"A decision like that really takes it out the players. A coming together of two players like that happens 100 times in football.\n\n\"But that's what we're used to this season with the way games are being refereed.\n\n\"Players in general have to take some responsibility.\n\n\"We had a similar incident against Hearts when the Hearts player went down holding his face like he'd been hit hard and conned the ref.\n\n\"And Maswanhise went down like he'd been punched with full force in the ribs.\n\n\"It gives VAR something to look at, but I'd love a referee to see it again and say 'that's not a penalty' and play on.\n\n\"He obviously didn't deem it violent conduct because he gave him [Sevelj] a yellow.\n\n\"It's not a penalty and I wouldn't want penalties like that given.\n\n\"We seem to be saying the same things about refereeing in this country. It's going from bad to worse.\""

            "content": "Brooklyn Kabongolo scored for the second game running as Livingston fought back to earn a point in a 1-1 draw with fellow William Hill Premiership strugglers St Mirren.\n\nThe Lions defender, who scored a stunning volley in last weekend's 2-2 stalemate with Rangers, headed in a second-half equaliser to cancel out Dan Nlundulu's goal for the visitors just before the break.\n\nIt was a result that suited Saints more than Livingston with Stephen Robinson's side maintaining the 10-point gap over the basement side.\n\nLivingston's position at the basement looks increasingly more desperate with every passing week as they continue their search for a first league win since August.\n\nFollowing last weekend's 5-0 collapse at the hands of Motherwell, St Mirren manager Robinson made six changes for the trip to West Lothian.\n\nMarcus Fraser, Jayden Richardson, Keanu Baccus, Scott Tanser, Nlundulu and Mikael Mandron were all restored to the starting XI.\n\nAnd it was Richardson who came close to giving the visitors the lead after just six minutes. The wing-back got on the end of Tanser's delivery and his looping header hit the top of the cross bar.\n\nIn a lively first half, chances came at both ends of the pitch.\n\nMandron swept a left-footed shot from distance just over after the Lions got caught trying to play out before Livingston striker Robbie Muirhead drove an effort wide from inside the area.\n\nBoth of these teams have struggled for goals this term so it was no surprise that they were wasteful in the final third.\n\nThe same theme continued when Scott Pittman whipped a first-time shot wide from 15 yards in what was a promising position after being teed up by Liam Smith.\n\nSt Mirren goalkeeper Shamal George was then called upon to repel a stinging Smith drive after Alex Gogic made a mess of trying to head the ball back.\n\nBut it was the away team that stormed ahead a minute before the break through Nlundulu.\n\nThe striker was involved in the build up and was accused of handling the ball after falling to the ground just outside the box.\n\nSaints recycled the ball and Richardson played in Mandron down the side of the area and his cross was headed back across goal by the striker.\n\nIt was a familiar feeling for Livingston as the second half restarted although the home team should have drawn level through Muirhead.\n\nThe striker found himself in space from a Macaulay Tait pass but his right-footed shot from an angle was pushed behind by George.\n\nThe second period was not so open with the battle becoming more confined to the middle of the pitch.\n\nLivingston kept fighting and their perseverance paid off in the 76th minute with another goal from Kabongolo.\n\nSubstitute Barrie McKay swept a deep cross into the area the unmarked Kabongolo showed great composure to direct his header into the corner of the net from 10 yards.\n\nFellow substitute Joel Nouble then headed a McKay corner over from close range in what was the last meaningful chance of the game.\n\nWhat the managers said...\n\nLivingston boss Marvin Bartley:\n\n\"It's seven points at this moment in time, with nine games to go. It's something that can be turned around really, really quickly.\n\n\"We'll keep chipping away until we get to the split and then we'll see where we're at.\n\n\"But this team's more than good enough to do so.\n\n\"You know we will not give up. We will get out of this situation we're currently in.\n\n\"We spoke to the players when I first came in to take over as manager that we need to get as close as we possibly can by the split. And then after the split, we'll see where we're at but we're a point closer.\"\n\nSt Mirren boss Stephen Robinson:\n\n\"It's a point gained. It was a disappointing goal we conceded because I didn't see Livingston scoring.\n\n\"It's a long loopy ball into the box, that is again another poor individual decision and we get punished by it.\n\n\"It's a really poor goal but there were a lot of positives in it.\n\n\"I thought the first half we were good. We pressed much better, we looked a lot more solid and we hit the crossbar.\n\n\"But ultimately it takes us another point away from Kilmarnock and another point closer to the teams above us as well.\""

I think it would be a big achievement just staying in this league, so getting a sixth place - and we're not there yet, but that's where we are right now - I think it's a big achievement.\n\n\"It would be absolutely huge, probably the biggest achievement of anything that we've done previously.\n\n\"The standard is much, much higher than where we've been and the guys have responded and reacted to it enormously, adapting to it early and recognising that they were good enough to be in the league.\n\n\"That belief and confidence is just growing and growing and growing, and to go on and do that type of performance today is awesome.\"\n\nKilmarnock boss Neil McCann:\n\n\"I can only apologise to the fans here today. We filled out our section and I'm so sorry to them that we have put on that type of performance. That's not acceptable.\n\n\"We haven't served up that type of performance in my time here.\n\n\"It's very raw right now. I'm not going to get personal with any of the players.\n\n\"What I would say though is that we've collectively let the club down today. It's the first time I've felt so disappointed by the performance.\n\n\"Sometimes you've just got to accept that the other team were better on the day - and Falkirk were.\""

Great credit to David Gray, who made some really positive changes. The changes spooked us a little bit.\n\n\"We'd shown great composure with the ball for 80 minutes and then we just lost our way a little bit.\n\n\"Losing the two goals, I think it's easy for a team to go under but we responded again in amazing fashion.\n\n\"It said a lot about the group and the spirit that after that setback we managed to salvage a point so I couldn't be prouder.\"\n\nHibernian boss David Gray:\n\n\"It's real mixed emotions to be honest for me. I think it feels, because you lose a goal in the last second, like a defeat.\n\n\"I think that's natural because it is the last kick of the game.\n\n\"Take nothing away from the strike that got Dundee the point, I thought it was a fantastic hit, I was right behind it, I knew as soon as he hit it, it was going in.\n\n\"But I think the story of the day for us is the fact we've come to a really difficult place and we've had to score three goals to get a point because that's where we've let ourselves down, the defensive side of it.\n\n\"You can always affect it. I'm not saying there's nothing you can do, there's always things you can do, situations to stop things happening earlier in the process.\n\n\"But, unfortunately the feeling we've got right now is that we've been in this position before and it's something we'll address, we'll look at it.\n\n\"The other side to that is if we had scored in the last minute and got a point, the feeling that comes with that.\n\n\"So I have to be careful as the players are very low because of the manner of losing that goal in the last minute.\n\n\"But there is accountability across the board to make sure we learn from the experience and try to get better from it.\""

            "content": "Claudio Braga scored the only goal of the game as Hearts moved seven points clear at the top of the Premiership with a 1-0 win over Aberdeen at Tynecastle.\n\nThe league leaders knew they had the chance to widen the gap at the top, for 24 hours at least, with Rangers and Celtic meeting at Ibrox on Sunday, live on Sky Sports, and they did not miss the opportunity, roared on by a full house at a rocking Tynecastle.\n\nBraga's strike on the half-hour mark was his 15th of the season and could prove to be one of the most vital of the campaign, meaning Derek McInnes and his side can sit back and watch Sunday's Old Firm encounter with interest.\n\nImage: Sir Alex Ferguson was in attendance at Tynecastle to watch Hearts beat Aberdeen\n\nFor Aberdeen, with legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson watching on from the stands, it is another disappointing result in what has been a stuttering season, all but ending their hopes of a top six finish.\n\nHearts dominated the early stages, with Braga forcing Dimitar Mitov into action after 10 minutes before the Portuguese sent a header wide shortly after. At the other end, Toyosi Olusanya was a handful for the Hearts backline and provided a good outball for the visitors.\n\nPierre Landry Kabore should have had the home side in front after 21 minutes, however, after latching on to a ball over the top but he could not direct his lob over the onrushing Mitov on target.\n\nImage: Hearts' Pierre Landry Kabore and Aberdeen's Gavin Molloy in action\n\nOlusanya could have edged the visitors in front shortly after when he got on the end of Topi Keskinen's low cross into the box but he fired his first-time effort well over.\n\nHearts did take the lead just before the half-hour mark, however, with Kabore doing really well to muscle his way down the right-hand side, avoiding the sliding challenge of Liam Morrison, before calmly picking out Braga who slotted his effort into the net from 10 yards.\n\nThe hosts were in no mood to hang around after the break with Kabore stinging the palms of Mitov before the goalkeeper was on hand to deny Braga at the back post after the Portuguese connected with Kabore's flick on.\n\nImage: Hearts Claudio Braga celebrates scoring to make it 1-0 against Aberdeen\n\nThe visitors struggled to carve out clear goalscoring opportunities in a stuffy second half, Kevin Nesbit's wayward first-time volley the best they could muster as they ended the game having failed to have a shot on target.\n\nAberdeen did try to force Hearts back in the closing stages as they sought an equaliser but the hosts were never really in any danger as they held on for a vital three points.\n\nMcInnes: Hearts good value for the win\n\nHearts head coach Derek McInnes on Sky Sports:\n\n\"I was just really pleased with the performance. I thought the application, the approach to the game was spot on. Obviously, when you play the way we did and try to go all in it does leave you with some scary moments in transitions with the pace of [Topi] Keskinen and [Toyosi] Olusanya at times, there were a couple of wee moments in the first half but I thought the performance in terms of shots on target, pressure and set plays, it's the most we have put crosses in in recent weeks.\n\nImage: Derek McInnes said Hearts deserved their win over Aberdeen\n\n\"I thought the output from that side was really good and you look at the stats, you think you'd get more than one goal so we are disappointed from that sense but I don't think Alex [Schwolow] has had a save to make. While it doesn't always feel totally comfortable for everyone in the stadium and ourselves, I think at 1-0 we were actually good value for our win and it was a good three points but just as importantly the performance was good and it is the kind of performance we are going to need at Tynecastle.\"\n\nOn watching the Old Firm game on Sunday:\n\n\"We have just got to try and win our games whenever we play. We don't want to be giving anyone too much encouragement, we just want to concentrate on ourselves and I just think we need to really focus on that and not look too much at tomorrow. Obviously we will watch it and we'll look forward to watching it on the back of winning, that's always the way. But with nine games to go there are a lot of points to play for. It's just under a quarter of the season so a lot can still happen. No one is getting carried away, we enjoyed the win today, I thought it was a win we deserved and from that point of view we just move on to the next one now.\"\n\nLeven: Aberdeen should have had a penalty\n\nImage: Peter Leven says Aberdeen should have had a penalty against Hearts\n\nAberdeen interim manager Peter Leven on Sky Sports:\n\n\n\n\"We've just seen the Stuart Armstrong [incident]. We got a man sent off last week against Dundee, because he was across the player and he took him out, so I don't know why that's not a penalty. Extra frustrating on a day that there's maybe not loads in it, you're looking for that wee cutting edge or that break, however it may come.\n\n\n\n\"We lacked a bit of quality at times, but listen, I thought it was better second half, but it's still not good enough to come here and not compete in the first half. It's the little things that are not going for us right now. We've got another big game on Wednesday, but again, it's the little decisions that are costing us right now. For me, it's a stonewall penalty.\n\n\n\n\"We need to keep going, as I say, we've got a game on Wednesday, but again, we'll go again tomorrow, but we need to start picking up points.\"\n\nWhat's coming up in the Scottish Premiership?"

            "content": "For those wondering if Manchester City are over reliant on Erling Haaland, they offered a riposte at Leeds. It was neither a fluid nor entertaining victory but, importantly, it closed the gap at the top to two points, increasing the pressure on Arsenal in the process.\n\nIt helps that when the league’s top scorer is absent, City can rely on the third man in the charts. Antoine Semenyo scored his 14th of the season on a difficult night for Pep Guardiola’s side, making the full-time euphoria well deserved after what felt like a significant win.\n\nMaybe it was the lack of Haaland or the vociferous nature of the home crowd but Leeds were the dominant force in the opening stages. There was more aggression and intent in their play, leading to Dominic Calvert-Lewin having a glorious chance to open the scoring but he skewed Brenden Aaronson’s cross wide.\n\nThere was a break in play after 13 minutes to allow the numerous Muslim players to break their fast at sunset. This resulted in a chorus of jeers at Elland Road, despite it being clearly indicated on the big screen why the match was paused. It created an incredibly uncomfortable atmosphere, especially for Rayan Aït-Nouri, Rayan Cherki, Omar Marmoush and Abdukodir Khusanov, who are observing Ramadan.\n\nCalvert-Lewin and James Justin came close as City struggled to match their opponents’ tempo. Without Haaland, Semenyo and Marmoush were playing as a wide strike partnership, eager to run in behind but they were witnesses rather than participants in the game. Semenyo ran through and flashed a shot over but it was a rare moment of threat from City.\n\nCity mistakes were becoming more problematic; Rodri, most trusted in possession, gave the ball away on the halfway line, ultimately allowing Aaronson through on goal. Gianluigi Donnarumma was the salvation on that occasion but something needed to change for Guardiola’s side.\n\nNico O’Reilly, playing in an advanced midfield role, forced the previously unoccupied Karl Darlow into a fine save from a powerful close-range header. It was the first sign of panic in the Leeds box and City needed more of it. Cherki was completely anonymous in the opening 45 minutes, in a team short of space and creative ideas, despite enjoying three-quarters of possession.\n\nView image in fullscreen Marc Guéhi is denied by a fine Karl Darlow save. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters\n\nWith 10 seconds of first-half injury time remaining, Cherki announced himself, sliding through a pass for Aït-Nouri to play across for Semenyo to slide home, as artistry outshone industry. It was an undeserved lead but City had weathered the storm and Leeds were possibly the victims of their own exertions, switching off at a key moment.\n\nTiring out Leeds was the cunning City plan as they kept the ball, moving the hosts about. The physical demands were too much for Joe Rodon, who felt his hamstring but was able to continue.\n\nNeither goalkeeper was troubled for a lengthy period after the break, as dangerous positions evaporated through poor passing and finishing. The match became relatively scrappy with quality lacking on both sides, amid a collection of niggly fouls. It took until the 72nd minute for Darlow’s alertness to be tested when Marc Guéhi headed a corner at goal, only for the goalkeeper to palm it out.\n\nIt was the briefest moment of concern from Leeds, who knew they needed to re-energise, sending on Daniel James and Wilfried Gnonto with a quarter of an hour to go. The changes lifted the team and the crowd. City spent spells backed into a corner but showed plenty of fight as they battled to maintain their slender lead. Guéhi and Rúben Dias put their bodies on the line to head and block the ball as they endured adversity to achieve glory."

            "content": "The contrasting strengths of Liverpool and West Ham are reflected on the balance sheet, the team sheet and ultimately the score sheet. Arne Slot’s side improved their prospects of Champions League qualification with a peculiar victory at Anfield, the winning margin far more resounding than the performance.\n\nIn the week Liverpool announced record overall revenue of £703m in their latest accounts, most of it ploughed back into the bank balances of a title-winning team, West Ham warned that players will have to be sold this summer whether they stay up or not having suffered a £104.2m loss in the same financial year. Their prospects of avoiding relegation look bleak in the context of such a heavy defeat yet, strange as it seems, Nuno Espírito Santo could take encouragement from elements of West Ham’s display.\n\nThe visitors had a better xG than Liverpool but found Alisson in fine form and the champions devastating at set pieces. West Ham must have known it was not going to be their day when their bus got stuck on a ramp while attempting to leave the team hotel. “If I say it was a good performance I sound silly,” said Nuno. “But that’s what I saw.”\n\nAnd yet this game was effectively over by half-time. As damning as that was for West Ham, they retained hope of getting back into the contest before Alexis Mac Allister extinguished it in the 43rd minute. The midfielder’s brilliant volley was the third Liverpool goal to originate from a corner as Slot’s side continued their metamorphosis into the Premier League’s set-piece specialists.\n\nPoor at defending them and scoring from them in the first half of the season, resulting in the departure of the set-piece coach Aaron Briggs in December, Liverpool have now scored more set-piece goals than any other team in the division – excluding penalties – in 2026. West Ham were defensively weak as Liverpool took their set-piece goals total to eight for the calendar year.\n\nHugo Ekitiké gave the hosts an early lead after El Hadji Malick Diouf had cleared the first corner of the afternoon. Ryan Gravenberch returned a fine ball into the France international, who took his shot early and saw it nestle into Mads Hermansen’s bottom corner via a slight deflection off Konstantinos Mavropanos. Both the West Ham centre-half and goalkeeper could have done more.\n\nThe visitors responded well to their first setback. Mateus Fernandes and Crysencio Summerville were to the fore as Liverpool were opened up frequently, but West Ham could not find a finishing touch. Mavropanos scooped wildly over when a Jarrod Bowen corner landed at his feet and Mac Allister worked tirelessly to cut out a dangerous counterattack led by Summerville. The threat from West Ham was growing, then Liverpool scored another simple goal from a corner.\n\nView image in fullscreen West Ham captain Jarrod Bowen looks dejected after Cody Gakpo scores Liverpool’s fourth goal. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nVirgil van Dijk headed home Dominik Szoboszlai’s delivery after bumping aside Soungoutou Magassa and beating Tomas Soucek to the ball. It was the Liverpool captain’s second set-piece goal in three games and his team’s seventh of the year. Number eight was executed brilliantly. Mohamed Salah took a corner from the right, Van Dijk flicked on at the near post, Ekitiké cushioned the ball out to Mac Allister and he volleyed into the roof of the net via the head of Aaron Wan-Bissaka. The ball did not touch the ground from the moment it left Salah’s foot.\n\nWest Ham had their moments before the third goal, Alisson saving well from Soucek and gratefully from Bowen after hitting a clearance straight at the visiting captain, but were in for a long afternoon. To their credit, Nuno’s side did not concede to the inevitable. Soucek reduced the arrears early in the second half when sliding in to convert Diouf’s low cross.\n\nAnfield became noticeably edgy as errors crept into the Liverpool display and both Fernandes and Summerville drew good stops from Alisson. But Cody Gakpo restored the host’s three goal cushion when his low shot struck Wan-Bissaka and deflected into the far corner.\n\nWest Ham responded once again when Bowen’s corner sailed over a crowded six-yard box and Taty Castellanos scored with a free header at the back post. But a late, unfortunate own goal by Axel Disasi, who deflected a low cross from the Liverpool substitute Jeremie Frimpong beyond Hermansen, compounded a punishing day for West Ham. “You’re going down with Prince Andrew,” taunted the Kop.\n\nSlot reflected: “I’m very pleased with the set pieces, firstly because that is the reason we won and secondly because we played OK-to-good. We’ve played better this season and lost. We’ve started scoring from set pieces and things look brighter and better than when you don’t.”"

            "content": "Benjamin Sesko’s career at Manchester United breaks into two distinct periods. In the first, he played 1,404 minutes of football and scored two goals. In the second, he has played 274 minutes and scored six goals: 702 minutes per goal and then 45 minutes 40 seconds per goal.\n\nThere’s a very obvious explanation. On 4 January, Sesko toiled in a 1-1 draw at Leeds. He didn’t manage a shot on target. He completed only 76% of his passes. He didn’t attempt a dribble but still lost possession five times. He was caught offside twice. On 5 January, Ruben Amorim was sacked.\n\nOn 6 January, Sesko scored both goals in a 2-2 draw at Burnley. It seems a little unfair to compare Amorim, who always came across as a thoroughly pleasant and decent man, to the White Witch from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, but the similar thawing impact of their removals is undeniable. The snows are melting, the flowers are blossoming and creatures that had been turned to stone are becoming flesh and blood once again.\n\nUnited, of course, have been here before, with an upturn under a beloved former player. The Ole Gunnar Solskjær experience means there is such a determination not to get carried away that there are some around United – fans and pundits – who are adamant Michael Carrick should not be given the job on a permanent basis almost whatever he achieves between now and the end of the season.\n\nBut there is a qualitative difference to what happened in 2019. Back then, there was a sense that United had decent players but they were diminished by the toxicity of the later part of José Mourinho’s reign. This season, there were doubts about how many of United’s players were any good at all.\n\nIt turns out, though, that a manager can make a huge impact by picking players in their best positions, restoring a hugely promising young midfielder ostracised because he didn’t fit a specific profile, and imbuing his charges with confidence.\n\nView image in fullscreen Benjamin Sesko’s early appearances showed a heavy touch and poor movement. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nAfter Sesko came off the bench to score the winner at Everton on Monday, he spoke of the importance of his sense that “everyone believes in me”. Which raises the obvious question of why that wasn’t true before. Did Amorim not rate him? Did Amorim not want him? Or was Amorim just bad at conveying to players on the fringes of the team how he saw them developing? And this is to do with Amorim. It’s not that Carrick is some sort of specialist Sesko-whisperer. The post-Amorim transformation was immediate, the Slovene scoring three goals in his two games under Darren Fletcher as interim manager.\n\nEvery day that has passed since Amorim left the club has made the decision to appoint him look worse. But the villain here is not Amorim, who told everybody he would always play 3-4-2-1 and then always played 3-4-2-1 at least until the very end, when fielding a back four felt like some sort of passive-aggressive act of defiance. The fault, rather, lies with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the process that imposed him on a disparate squad united only by their unsuitability for a manager who would play only 3-4-2-1, over the warnings of the then sporting director, Dan Ashworth, who left his role as a result. Amorim’s biggest fault was taking the job; little wonder he looked suddenly so much younger, so much more relaxed after being relieved of it.\n\nUnited’s upturn in form still doesn’t justify United spending £200m on three forwards in the summer when there were such obvious deficiencies in other areas – although recent events have shown how Ratcliffe struggles with numbers, so that perhaps offers some explanation – but it least it now appears that money was spent on players who may be part of a successful future. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have clicked up a level since Carrick took over, but it’s in Sesko that the starkest improvement has been seen.\n\nLast summer was characterised by Premier League clubs spending big money to sign orthodox strikers, with mixed results. Hugo Ekitiké has impressed. Alexander Isak, after his acrimonious move to Liverpool disrupted his pre‑season, was seemingly never at full fitness even before his broken leg. Rory Delap has struggled with injury at Chelsea. Even after his goals for Arsenal in the north London derby last Sunday, opinion is divided on Viktor Gyökeres.\n\nBut until early January, Sesko looked the most questionable of the lot. Allowances have to be made for the fact he is only 22, but he did not look in those early appearances like a £70m striker. His touch was heavy, his movement poor. But that’s the difference confidence and playing a coherent system can make.\n\nA simple video session with Fletcher before the 2-2 draw with Burnley was enough to restore in Sesko a basic faith in what he has done until now in his career. Sesko excels at making runs in the blind spot of defenders, which is exactly what brought both his goals that day: the first, because his run on to Bruno Fernandes’s through ball wasn’t tracked; the second, because, although Bashir Humphreys knew Sesko was behind him, he didn’t know whether he was going to go left or right to meet Patrick Dorgu’s cross.\n\nHe got away from Kenny Tete to score the winner against Fulham. He got in front of Axel Disasi for his remarkable finish to equalise against West Ham.\n\nView image in fullscreen Benjamin Sesko makes it 1-1 deep in stoppage time at West Ham. Photograph: Adam Davy/PA\n\nSesko’s movement is perhaps his greatest gift, but his physical attributes are obvious: he is good in the air, but also rapid over medium-to-long distances, as he showed in his winner on the break against Everton, confidence evident in every stride as he approached Mbeumo’s pass.\n\nHe’s less effective when given time to think but, given his age, that may come. And in his instincts to find space and finish, he’s already a hugely exciting talent, even if he is for now used mainly from the bench. It is remarkable what can happen when a manager uses a player in ways that accentuate his strengths rather than petrifying him with the wand of conformity to a strict tactical blueprint.\n\nNobody can pretend the background problems have gone away, but the tactical winter is over and Sesko is the frolicking avatar of the post-Amorim spring."

            "content": "Scott Parker was left sad and disappointed by more video assistant referee controversy after Burnley’s spirited comeback came to nothing. The home side were 3-0 down in 34 minutes and facing hostility from their own fans, but fought back to level before having a fourth goal ruled out after Jaidon Anthony was adjudged to be a shoulder-width offside.\n\nMikkel Damsgaard then put Brentford back in front three minutes into injury time only for Ashley Barnes to spark scenes of jubilation with an equaliser that was also chalked off for handball after a long delay.\n\nParker said: “Maybe a little bit of injustice. I’ve not watched it back. I saw it on the big screen and I was thinking it looks like his hand is beside his side. It looks so, so harsh.\n\n“We’ve gone and scored five goals in the space of 60 minutes, which is quite incredible. The world we’re in, we’re all looking for perfection. The game is looking for perfection.”\n\nLoud boos greeted the final whistle, but there had also been jeering and chants against Parker and the Burnley owner, Alan Pace, during and at the end of a woeful first half for the home side. They have not won at home in the league since October and ire towards team and hierarchy has been growing, but Parker hopes the response of his side will have won over some of the dissenters.\n\n“Walking in from half-time, it wasn’t nice,” he said. “Everyone has choices to vent how they want to vent. The fans were brilliant in the second half, but that was down to us. I understand the frustration of course, we’re all frustrated at 3-0 down.\n\n“There’s one thing our supporters can see leaving here , and you can be critical in certain moments, but the one thing you can’t be critical of is this group and what this shirt means, what playing for this team means and what we stand for. I hope the fans can see that.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Ashley Barnes reacts in shock after his late goal is disallowed. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA\n\nThe Brentford manager, Keith Andrews, who signed a new long-term deal this week, said he would not have been happy had the VAR decisions gone against his side, but felt they were ultimately correct.\n\nOn his team’s performance, he said: “The first half we were very good, played with a lot of conviction, we attacked with real speed and venom and belief.\n\n“The own goal just changed it a little bit and I knew we’d have to start the second half really well. I thought they’d make changes, they did, changed the system a little bit, and we didn’t deal with that particularly well. This was never going to be an easy game. If I’d been asked [beforehand] if I would accept a 4-3 victory, I would have taken it. It’s come in very crazy circumstances.”"

            "content": "As rain fell, incessantly, Eddie Howe wandered around the pitch alone. The final whistle had just gone and, with Everton celebrating a deserved win, Newcastle’s lingering hopes of a top-six finish were also blown.\n\nNewcastle look shattered, mentally as much as physically, by a Champions League campaign that will soon pit them against Barcelona and their Premier League form is suffering accordingly.\n\nAdmittedly it took a stunning stoppage-time save from Jordan Pickford to deny Sandro Tonali a late equaliser, but Newcastle’s players have forgotten how to defend, are far too careless in possession and seem alarmingly low on creativity.\n\n“It’s really hard to explain,” said Howe, after Newcastle lost a third consecutive home game for the first time since February 2021 under Steve Bruce; they have kept only two clean sheets in 21 league games. “It’s hugely frustrating, desperately disappointing.\n\n“We think we’re a good team, but we’re wildly inconsistent, even within games. I don’t see players not trying, I sometimes see them over-trying, but they’re not playing smart enough. Chasing the game took a lot out of us. It’s not a good look for us.”\n\nNewcastle were slapdash from the start and swiftly paid the price at a set piece. Jarrad Branthwaite’s expertly flicked header from James Garner’s corner was dispatched from the tightest of angles, brushing the unguarded far post en route into the back of the net.\n\nBranthwaite excelled in central defence, not something that can be said of his Newcastle counterparts. They have not kept a clean sheet in the 11 games since they beat PSV Eindhoven 3-0 here on 21 January, conceding 23 goals along the way. Small wonder cries of “Wake up!” echoed around the ground.\n\nView image in fullscreen Thierno Barry improvises to score the winning goal off his backside. Photograph: Richard Lee/Shutterstock\n\nHowe once again began with the England winger Anthony Gordon at centre-forward and his ineffective £69m Germany striker, Nick Woltemade, in an attacking midfield role. With Gordon struggling to make an impact against his former club, Howe quickly shifted Woltemade to No 9 and Gordon to the left.\n\nA slightly improved Newcastle equalised when Jacob Ramsey’s shot took a hefty deflection off Branthwaite, wrong-footing Pickford.\n\nA bad error on Nick Pope’s part enabled Everton to regain the lead after the keeper spilt a fairly routine shot from the impressive Dwight McNeil straight into Beto’s path. Everton’s No 9 gleefully accepted the invitation to stroke the ball into the empty net. Beto is often criticised for a perceived litany of shortcomings and would later miss a glorious chance, but he reacted with alacrity, moving far more rapidly than any of the defenders.\n\nNewcastle faced further disruption at the outset of the second half, when, after emerging from the tunnel for the restart, Ramsey vomited repeatedly on the pitch, prompting his replacement by Joe Willock.\n\nIt was not long before Anthony Elanga and Woltemade made way for Jacob Murphy and Harvey Barnes as Gordon reverted to centre-forward.\n\nBeto, making his first start since December, left Malick Thiaw for dust and found himself clean through with only Pope to beat. A third Everton goal beckoned, but his shot hit the bar and left Beto standing in isolation, his hands covering his face.\n\nSoon he was replaced by Thierno Barry and on, too, came Yoane Wissa, the hitherto overlooked £55m former Brentford centre-forward.\n\nHome spirits revived, albeit briefly, when Murphy’s slightly deflected volley from Joelinton’s cross flew past Pickford, but Everton recaptured the lead in barely a minute. Gordon’s concession of possession prefaced Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall squaring for Barry to bundle the ball across the line.\n\nIn stoppage time, Pickford reminded everyone why he is England’s goalkeeper. Tonali let fly on the volley and an equaliser seemed inevitable but Pickford tipped the ball over the bar.\n\n“Tonali’s technique was textbook,” said a delighted Moyes, whose side’s away Premier League record is bettered only by Arsenal’s. “Jordan’s save was out of this world.”"

Barcelona have 64 points while second-placed Real are on 60 points before they host Getafe on Monday. Villarreal remain a distant third on 51.\n\nLamine Yamal put the hosts ahead in the 28th minute after Fermin Lopez robbed Pape Gueye and slipped a pass down the right for the 18-year-old to finish low inside the left post. He doubled the lead nine minutes later with a dazzling solo run, controlling a long ball on the right wing before cutting inside past Sergi Cardona and Alberto Moleiro to curl an unstoppable shot into the top corner.\n\nGueye pulled one back from close range in the 49th minute, but Villarreal missed chances to equalise and paid the price as Lamine Yamal completed his hat-trick in the 69th minute with another counter attack. Robert Lewandowski came off the bench to add a fourth in added time, tapping in from Jules Koundé’s low cross from the right.\n\nWerder Bremen finally ended their 13-game run without a win in the Bundesliga by beating relegation rivals Heidenheim 2-0 in their bottom-of-the-table scrap. Bremen missed a host of chances before Jovan Milosevic scored from Romano Schmid’s cross in the 57th minute, and an own goal from Hennes Behrens in stoppage time confirmed Bremen’s first win after three defeats under their new coach, Daniel Thioune. It was enough to lift Bremen above Wolfsburg into the relegation playoff place. Wolfsburg, who haven’t won any of their past six games, visit Stuttgart on Sunday.\n\nView image in fullscreen Weder Bremen’s Romano Schmid heads the ball clear of Heidenheim’s Omar Traoré.

Mathias Pereira Lage scored for St Pauli before the break, lifting the Hamburg-based club out of the relegation zone after its third win from four games.\n\nKevin Diks scored a stoppage-time penalty for Borussia Mönchengladbach to beat Union Berlin 1-0 and end Galdbach’s seven-game winless run. Jarell Quansah scored late for Bayer Leverkusen to salvage a 1-1 draw with Mainz, canceling Sheraldo Becker’s second-half volley for Mainz. But the draw is a blow to Leverkusen’s hopes of reaching fourth place in the race for Champions League qualification. Leverkusen remained sixth, and both Stuttgart and Leipzig could pull further away. Leipzig visit Hamburg on Sunday.\n\nLater on Saturday in Spain, Atlético Madrid, in fourth, travel to bottom-placed Oviedo.\n\nIn the big game in Germany, Bayern Munich could all but end the title race when they travel to the Westfalenstadion, as victory would move them 11 points clear, but Borussia Dortmund – stunned in the Champions League in midweek – will be desperate for a win that would leave them five points off the pace.\n\nInter’s lead in Serie A is already up to 10 points and can stretch that to 13, albeit having played a game more, by winning at home against Genoa. Second-placed Milan visit Cremonese on Sunday.\n\nIn France, Paris Saint-Germain travel to Le Havre seeking to extend their one point lead at the top after second-placed Lens were held 1-1 at Strasbourg on Friday night.\n\nPSG’s Ligue 1 match against Nantes next month has been delayed to give the Champions League holders more rest between the two legs of their last-16 tie with Chelsea. PSG were due to face struggling Nantes on the weekend of 13-15 March, between their first leg against Chelsea on 11 March and the return match at Stamford Bridge on 17 March.

Rudoni capitalised on an error from the onrushing Tommy Simkin in added time to put Coventry eight points clear of second-placed Middlesbrough, who travel to Birmingham on Monday. The last-gasp defeat meant Stoke, managed by former Coventry manager Mark Robins, have just one win in their last nine matches.\n\nRyan Leonard’s stunning first-half strike helped Millwall edge past Preston 2-0 in a game of attrition at Deepdale. The 33-year-old right-back scored his first Championship goal of the season with a delightful curling strike in the 29th minute and substitute Luke Cundle sealed the win in second-half stoppage time.\n\nQuick Guide League One: Cardiff demolish Doncaster Show Cardiff put their League One promotion drive back on track with a convincing 4-0 win at Doncaster. The Bluebirds – thumped 5-2 at Plymouth last weekend – took a first-half lead through Robertson, with Dylan Lawlor on target soon after the restart before Cian Ashford added a third and Callum Robinson wrapped things up in stoppage time. Lincoln kept themselves a point behind top spot with a 4-0 over Blackpool. Conor McGrandle's header gave the Imps a first-half lead, with Rob Street, Dom Jefferies and then substitute Ryan One all scoring in the final 12 minutes. Third-placed Bolton cruised to a 5-1 win at Exeter, extending their unbeaten run to 10 league games. Sam Dalby set the visitors on their way, with Johnny Kenny, Thierry Gale, substitute Ibrahim Sissoko and George Johnston all on target in the second half.

Reading scored twice late on to come from behind and beat Bradford 2-1 at the Select Car Leasing Stadium. Matthew Pennington had put the visitors in front, but Paddy Lane equalised in the 90th minute before Matt Ritchie headed home a dramatic winner in the sixth minute of stoppage time.

David McGoldrick scored a hat-trick as Barnsley won 3-1 at relegation battlers Leyton Orient and it finished 1-1 between rivals Northampton and Peterborough at Sixfields. Rotherham boosted their survival hopes as an early goal from Joe Rafferty secured a 1-0 win over Plymouth, while bottom side Port Vale battled to a 1-1 draw against Luton.

Man-of-the-match Anis Mehmeti gave them the lead with just three minutes on the clock. Ivan Azon added the second in the 41st minute with an acute effort and substitute George Hirst added the gloss with 16 minutes remaining.

The Tigers only managed two shots and relied on Adrian Segicic’s double error for Matt Crooks to score the only goal at Fratton Park, leaving them fifth in the table.\n\nJakirovic said: “We didn’t play our game or our style because it was very demanding. I don’t know the reason but in some parts of the game we lacked energy. We have shown this season that we can win without playing well. I would like us to play much better but it wasn’t on me, it was on the players. There are 12 games to go and we are there. We will push but I would like to enjoy it more.”\n\nHull have won five games in a row on the road for the first time since 1966 – with their last defeat away from the MKM Stadium coming on 23 November. Jakirovic said: “I was born in 1976, so the record is very old! I am shocked. I didn’t know about the record.”\n\nQuick Guide League Two: Bromley stretch lead at top Show Bromley extended their advantage at the top to four points with a 2-1 win over 10-man Accrington. The visitors had Donald Love sent off after only 14 minutes after appearing to stamp on Michael Cheek, who broke the deadlock from the penalty spot just before the break. Dave Abimbola had Stanley level in first-half stoppage time, but another spot-kick from Cheek then got Bromley home as they made it 16 league games unbeaten. Cambridge saw two points slip away after MK Dons snatched a 1-1 draw at Abbey Stadium through a stoppage-time penalty from Aaron Collins to cancel out Shayne Lavery's goal with 15 minutes left. Swindon also had to settle for a 1-1 draw against Bristol Rovers, and Notts County slipped to a 1-0 home defeat against Grimsby - with Lee Ndlovu having been sent off before Charles Vernam's late strike.

The Red Dragons have taken 16 points from a possible 18 on the road to help fuel their hopes of a fourth successive promotion. Oliver Rathbone, who signed a contract extension until the summer of 2028 earlier this week, scored the 30th-minute winner.\n\nBut Wrexham, sixth in the league, had to withstand heavy pressure from the home team and goalkeeper Arthur Okonkwo produced heroics to deny Sonny Carey a late leveller. Parkinson, now gearing up to face Chelsea in the FA Cup fifth round next Saturday, said: “We showed incredible resilience today to get the win. The way we defended the box today was exceptional.”\n\nSeventh-placed Southampton’s good run of form continued as they beat Sheffield Wednesday 3-1 at Hillsborough. The League One-bound hosts showed spirit to keep themselves in the game but ultimately, the Saints’ quality proved too much to handle. They were undefeated in eight in all competitions before coming into this one and knew three points were a must to keep the pressure on Wrexham.\n\nSheffield United maintained their slim hopes of snatching a playoff place with a 2-0 win at QPR. First-half goals from Callum O’Hare and Tyrese Campbell secured the victory against injury-hit Rangers, who have lost three of their last four home matches and were second-best throughout. The west London side, thrashed 5-0 at Southampton in midweek, were again punished for some woeful defending.\n\nAt the other end of the table, Gary Rowett told his Leicester players to show more fight and physicality if they are to avoid dropping out of the Championship.\n\nSecond-half goals from Anis Ben Slimane and Ali Ahmed gave Norwich a 2-0 win at the King Power Stadium and kept the Foxes in the relegation zone with 11 matches of the season remaining. Leicester have won just once in the league in 2026 – against fellow strugglers West Brom on 5 January – and Rowett’s first home game in charge could not inspire them to victory.\n\nRowett had inspired some confidence by starting his tenure with back-to-back draws on the road at Stoke and promotion-chasing Middlesbrough, but his first home match was preceded by a small protest from fans and ended with a chorus of boos.\n\n“Today, it just felt flat from the start, if I’m being honest, it was really disappointing,” said Rowett. “As a group, as a team, as a club we’ve got a fight to get out of it. We’ve got good players, but there’s no point having good players if we don’t do the basics of the game. There has to be a physical element in the games in order to win them. Today, we lacked a little bit of physicality, I thought, and athleticism.”\n\nElsewhere at the bottom, Oxford scored twice from set pieces in the first half as they beat managerless West Brom 2-1 in a tense relegation clash at the Kassam Stadium. Stan Mills headed them in front in the 14th minute from Jamie Donley’s corner, arching back to guide the ball beautifully into the top-left corner.\n\nThat was Oxford’s first goal at home in more than nine hours – since Boxing Day – and they added another 12 minutes later when Will Lankshear nodded in a Cameron Brannagan free-kick from six yards which goalkeeper Max O’Leary maybe should have come for. Substitute Ollie Bostock pulled a goal back for Albion after 33 minutes with a 25-yard shot that took a big deflection off Sam Long.\n\nView image in fullscreen Derby’s Ben Brereton Díaz wheels away after scoring his side’s first goal against Blackburn. Photograph: Nigel French/PA\n\nAnd Michael O’Neill called on his Blackburn team to be more “durable” after they were beaten 3-1 at Derby. Rovers, in 20th, were well placed at half-time through Hayden Carter’s header but the game turned on a miss by Andri Gudjohnsen early in the second half and Derby took advantage. The former Blackburn forward Ben Brereton Díaz slammed in a 55th-minute equaliser and, after Matt Clarke punished tentative defending in the 74th minute, Rhian Brewster sealed victory with an 82nd-minute header.\n\nO’Neill said: “The squad is not strong and we don’t have depth and at times the team that finishes the game is not as strong as the team that starts the game. We are going to need some players back and we are going to need some resilience in the current group too.”\n\nOn Friday, Jeremy Ngakia’s 77th-minute strike secured a 2-1 win for Watford over Bristol City at Ashton Gate. The visitors took a seventh-minute lead when Luca Kjerrumgaard fired home from six yards. But the home side were level in the 36th minute when Scott Twine powered a close-range header past Egil Selvik. A draw looked the likely outcome, but Ngakia found the top corner with a sweetly struck right-foot shot from 25 yards out."

Régis Le Bris’s team claimed the point their determined performance deserved.\n\n“To have a natural leader like that come into the team is great,” said the Sunderland defender Dan Ballard. “We’ve missed him.” Patrolling in front of defence, Xhaka maintained constant dialogue with his colleagues, encouraging, directing into position, veering into the territory of player-manager. “After three defeats it’s not easy to react and for a newly promoted side, confidence is always a topic,” said Le Bris. “I am happy with the team spirit.”\n\nWhen Eliezer Mayenda scored Sunderland’s goal, Xhaka clenched his fists in triumph, celebrating first with Le Bris. For Bournemouth, for whom a draw dents outside hopes of European football next season, a wholly preventable goal. Habib Diarra had been shown inside from Ballard’s pass. Their goalkeeper, Djordje Petrovic, could only direct Diarra’s shot into Mayenda’s path.\n\nBournemouth have not lost since 3 January but struggle to kill off their opponents; this was a 12th draw of the season. The goalless draw at West Ham had forced a rethink, Evanilson benched. “I was looking to match their midfield because they have very good players in the middle,” explained Andoni Iraola. That plan was torn up at half-time, the Brazilian scored the equaliser, Iraola’s in-game management coming up trumps. “We know the first half wasn’t ourselves,” said Bournemouth’s Marcus Tavernier. “In the second half we knew we needed a reaction.”\n\nSunderland did not start like a team in the doldrums. Noah Sadiki’s shot forced an early save from Petrovic and when Enzo Le Fée was floored by Álex Jiménez, a penalty looked like a credible claim. And yet Jarred Gillett, the referee, waved that away, his judgment of “normal contact” backed by video assistance, to the incredulity of Le Fée who said ruefully: “We can’t change the decision now.” Iraola’s view: “It would have been a soft one.”\n\nWearside muscle took a stronghold in those early stages, their twin towers, Ballard and Omar Alderete, overpowered Eli Junior Kroupi while Trai Hume did a decent job of keeping Rayan quiet until the game’s dying embers.\n\nView image in fullscreen Eliezer Mayenda gives Sunderland the lead.

Roefs got luckier yet when, out of his penalty area, he lost possession and collided with Kroupi. That decision went Sunderland’s way, to audible disgust from Iraola, wanting a straight red, though he afterwards said Gillett should have let play go on, which would probably have resulted in a goal. Roefs, otherwise excellent, would have been a profound loss.\n\nXhaka was at the centre of a second-half flashpoint when he and Tyler Adams crunched together, the American clattering his opponent’s ankle. “Really dangerous,” said Le Bris. Adams escaped a red on the video verdict, though was quickly removed by Iraola as a sending off waiting to happen. To compound the confusion, Gillett had also awarded a Bournemouth free-kick. On came Ryan Christie, his first touch supplying Tavernier for a cross that evaded Sunderland’s defenders, the ball knocked in by Evanilson’s shoulder. “The gaffer pointed out that we had to put in balls early,” said Tavernier.\n\nView image in fullscreen Evanilson shoulders the ball home after a great cross from Marcus Tavernier. Photograph: Ian Walton/Reuters\n\nRoefs’ booking for time-wasting marked the shift in momentum towards Bournemouth. Xhaka’s departure in the 76th minute left his teammates to see out a result, part of the plan according to his manager. “At the end our togetherness was strong,” said Le Bris. Without Xhaka, Sunderland had the ball in the net but when Ballard bundled home Lutsharel Geertruida had strayed offside.\n\nThe chase for a winner became frantic, fiery when Christie and Le Fée went up in each other’s grill while both sets of fans were united in railing at Gillett. Rayan at last found space in fully 12 minutes of time added on and a rasping shot from the flank deflecting off Alderete and behind had the home support gasping in expectation for a goal that never arrived."

Emergency services were immediate.”\n\nCouncillor Stevyn Ricketts added: “I was out in my ward of Leon Solent today and could hear all the emergency sirens going off across the town.\n\n“I headed to the seafront and saw the damage luckily the pilot got out unscathed and enjoyed a nice cup of coffee while the emergency services dealt with the incident.\n\n“Just 30 minutes before the plane crash I was walking along exactly where it came down so I’m very glad nobody else was injured as it was busy due to the nice weather.\n\n“Eyewitnesses told me that the plane was coming down very low before it crashed.\n\n\n\n“Police put a cordon in place and Hampshire fire winched the plane up the beach.\n\n“As a local councillor, I want to say a big thank you to the emergency services for their quick response.”\n\nFellow councillor, Graham Burgess, said: “I’m aware that a plane crashed just a few feet from the shingle on the waterfront.\n\n“I understand and am very grateful to hear that the pilot got out okay.

They have not yet arrested the suspect.\n\nA Durham Constabulary spokesperson said: “A 52-year-old man remains in hospital in a serious condition.”"

            "content": "LABOUR MP Josh Simons has resigned as a Cabinet Office minister, and claimed he had “become a distraction from this Government’s important work”.\n\nMr Simons made his announcement on social media this evening amid a probe into claims the MP broke ministerial code.\n\n\n\nHis statement read: “The Independent Advisor on Ministerial Standards has cleared me of breaching the ministerial code.\n\n\n\n“But with regret, remaining in office has become a distraction, so I have resigned from government.\n\n“I will continue serving the people I’m proud to represent in Makerfield and pushing for the radical change our politics and country needs.”\n\nMr Simons’ resignation follows those of Peter Mandelson, Angela Rayner, Louise Haigh, Rushanara Ali, Tulip Siddiq, and Andrew Gwynne.\n\nAnd, Kemi Badenoch accused the Prime Minister of using the conflict in the Middle East to “sneak out yet another ministerial resignation”.\n\nThe Conservative leader said: “Keir Starmer has used the conflict in the Middle East to sneak out yet another ministerial resignation. Another time he’s lacked the backbone to sack a minister who was obviously in the wrong.\n\n“Josh Simons was in charge of a group that deliberately smeared journalists, even using a journalist’s Jewish faith to call him into question. Labour hasn’t changed.\n\n“The ‘think tank’ Labour Together has donated or provided support to over 100 Labour MPs, including many of the Cabinet. Their former staff members are in positions of influence across Government, including serving as civil servants.\n\n“Simons has resigned so it’s clear Labour Together is utterly finished as an organisation.\n\n\n\n“Keir Starmer must tell us immediately if he will now end Labour Together’s links with his Government and return the tainted money they’ve donated.”\n\nThis comes as Sir Keir Starmer had ordered a formal probe into Mr Simons after claims he ordered a dirty dossier on British journalists.\n\nThe PM asked ethics chief Laurie Magnus to investigate whether Mr Simons broke the ministerial code while running Labour Together before entering government.\n\nIt followed allegations the thinktank paid US lobbying giant APCO to look into the personal background of reporters who exposed £730,000 in undeclared donations.\n\nChief Secretary to the Prime Minister Darren Jones told the Commons: “The Prime Minister has been advised that the matter should be referred now to the independent adviser on ministerial standards, which the Prime Minister has done today.”\n\n\n\nSir Laurie looked into whether Mr Simons misled colleagues about the work he asked APCO to carry out.\n\nA separate Cabinet Office propriety and ethics inquiry has already cleared him of wrongdoing.\n\nDocuments posted online by US writer Matt Taibbi show APCO was asked to probe how the Sunday Times investigation was put together and who was behind it.\n\nTheir work included digging into reporters’ backgrounds, speaking to contacts and carrying out financial and digital checks — far beyond what Mr Simons later claimed.\n\nThe row stems from a 2023 Sunday Times story that revealed Labour Together had hidden the source of £730,000 in donations from the elections watchdog.\n\n\n\nThe revelations sparked a whispering campaign in Westminster against Mr Pogrund and investigative journalist Paul Holden, whose then-unpublished book uncovered the undeclared cash.\n\nMr Simons previously said he was “shocked” that APCO “extended beyond the contract” by including unnecessary personal information about Pogrund.\n\nHe admitted he asked the firm to explore whether Labour Together’s data was obtained in a hack, and that he passed some material to GCHQ — but denies ordering any investigation into British journalists.\n\nTories, Lib Dems, the SNP and several Labour MPs had called for him to be sacked or to consider his position, especially as he is the minister responsible for the PM’s digital ID rollout.\n\nIn previous statements, Mr Simons said Apco had been hired to investigate an illegal hack.\n\n\n\nBut in a letter to the Prime Minister, ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus said the former minister now accepted the terms he agreed with Apco were “wider than he had understood” and he had acted “too hastily in confirming their appointment”.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nWhile Sir Laurie said Mr Simons had acted “in good faith”, he said the MP acknowledged the “perceived gap between his public statements and what he now accepts appears to be a more extensive scope has been damaging”.\n\nSir Laurie added: “I see no basis for advising you of any breach of the Ministerial Code by Mr Simons but you will wish to consider, in the light of this distraction and potential reputational damage, whether he continues to hold your confidence as a member of your Government.”\n\n\n\nMore to follow… For the latest news on this story keep checking back at The Sun Online\n\nThesun.co.uk is your go-to destination for the best celebrity news, real-life stories, jaw-dropping pictures and must-see video.\n\nLike us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/thesun and follow us from our main Twitter account at @TheSun."

State Police are increasing their presence at religious, diplomatic, and cultural sites statewide in coordination with federal, state, and local law enforcement partners. “Additionally, in advance of the Jewish holiday of Purim, State Police remain alert and have already begun outreach to religious organizations to offer support. “While there have been no specific, credible threats to New York identified, we continue to monitor online activity for any potential threats, and we encourage New Yorkers to remain vigilant and report suspicious activity.”\n\nThe FBI has also confirmed to Fox News that counter terrorism and counter intelligence teams have been placed on an “elevated” alert nationwide.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump has urged the people of Iran to seize the moment and overthrow their government.\n\n“United States military began major combat operations in Iran,” he said in a post on Truth Social at 2:30am.\n\n\n\n“Bombs will be dropping everywhere. When we are finished, take over your government.\n\n“It will be yours to take; this will be probably your only chance for generations.\n\n“America is backing you with overwhelming strength and devastating force. Now is the time to seize control of your destiny.\n\nAs the conflict continues to unfold, shocking footage shows a popular Dubai hotel engulfed in flames after being struck by a ‘kamikaze drone.’\n\nTerrifying footage also shows the moment debris from a missile smashes into a packed street in Qatar.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIt is currently being reported that top Iranian leaders have been killed in the blitz but the Ayatollah’s fate is unknown.\n\nFollow The Sun’s live blog to get the latest updates."

            "content": "WHEN Michele Warden first heard that a bright young nurse from her old ward had been arrested her blood ran cold.\n\nLike Lucy Letby, Michele had worked on the Countess of Chester Hospital’s neonatal unit, where she was a senior nurse for 13 years – and she was immediately certain that police had made a terrible mistake.\n\n\n\nThe retired NHS veteran, who is now speaking for the first time about the ward, told The Sun how it was plagued by understaffing, lack of equipment, sewage and infestations.\n\nAll of which were regularly flagged to bosses – and which she believes created the environment for increased baby deaths and ultimately the finger to be conveniently pointed at Letby.\n\n\n\nMichele, who is now part of the Nineteen Nurses campaign group, which is calling for a review into the case, says: “It came together to be an absolute perfect storm… I’ve been calling this out for a long, long time.\n\n“I think there was a witchhunt… But I don’t know why they earmarked Lucy.”\n\nLetby was sentenced to 15 whole-life orders after being convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven more between June 2015 and June 2016, following two trials.\n\nHowever, since her second trial concluded in July 2024, there have been growing concerns that she may be innocent and the victim of a miscarriage of justice.\n\nA panel of 14 international medical experts early last year found “no evidence” that any babies were murdered or deliberately harmed – with prosecutors having largely relied on circumstantial proof, including analysing probabilities based on unit rota patterns.\n\n\n\nLetby’s legal team, led by top barrister Mark McDonald, subsequently sent an appeal application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) – which reviews possible miscarriages of justice – and is still awaiting a decision that could take months or years.\n\nIt was in 1994 that Michele, from Chester, joined the neonatal staff at the Countess of Chester hospital.\n\nAn Advanced Neonatal Nurse Practitioner (ANNP), she worked there until 2007 – around four years before Letby’s arrival – when the unit was first downgraded and could no longer able to take on the most complex cases, and she and several other senior members of staff were made redundant.\n\nMichele says they often took on more patients than there was capacity for and even during her tenure the building was so rundown they regularly had water problems and at one stage an infestation of insects resulted in a rudimentary bug zapper being installed.\n\nAfter leaving, she remained in contact with staff there – many of whom, she says, also believed their colleague Letby was innocent – and claims the indictment period, they would regularly tell her: “We’re so busy, we’re so short-staffed… They had more babies than they should have on the unit; they’ve had more deaths.”\n\n\n\nFollowing Letby’s arrest in July 2018, Michele decided she had to speak to the police.\n\nShe said: “I was phoning Cheshire Police about Lucy when I first heard she’d been arrested… I really felt quite sick about it.”\n\nThe building was not fit for purpose… it was a crumbling concrete disaster. Michele Warden\n\nSpeaking to an officer involved in Operation Hummingbird, which had been launched to investigate the rise in deaths on the unit, she questioned whether they’d read the independent review by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), which in 2016 had found systematic issues, including a severe shortage of nursing staff.\n\nShe said: “I don’t think [the officer] read the report. She wasn’t interested in the report, really all she wanted to know was, did I work with Lucy, did I know her and did I have any evidence against Lucy?\n\n“My answer to all of those was no, I wasn’t there, I’ve never met Lucy.\n\n\n\n“But I’m telling you the problem’s on this unit. She just wasn’t interested. I never heard from them again.”\n\nMichele said the RCPCH review “made me crack out laughing” because one of its recommendations was to hire two ANNPs, which they’d had before she was culled.\n\n\n\nOn top of the systematic issues, Letby’s trials would later hear about plumbers being called out weekly, with “raw sewage” coming out of the sinks.\n\nMichele said: “The building was not fit for purpose… it was a crumbling concrete disaster.”\n\nIt emerged earlier this year that the sewage issues could even be linked to the spread of a deadly waterborne bacterium detected in one of Letby’s victims.\n\nTissue from the lung of Baby I – who the nurse was said to have murdered with an overdose of air and milk – tested positive for Stenotrophomonas maltphilia, something the jury was never told during her trials.\n\n\n\nWhen Letby was first moved off the neonatal unit in July 2016 and into a clerical role, Michele said other staff were told everyone was being retrained one by one to expand their skills, and she was the first.\n\n“We now know that was just a lie,” she says.\n\nMichele said the other nurses were told “not to communicate” with Letby after she was moved off the unit.\n\n\n\n“She was still in contact with her friends; she didn’t understand why she’d been moved off the unit either.\n\n“They hadn’t told her; they kept her in the dark.”\n\n‘Lucy had lots of friends on the ward’\n\nAfter failing to be reinstated as a nurse, Letby filed a grievance and won – but before she could come back onto the unit, she was arrested.\n\nMichele continued: “A lot of my nurse friends were kept completely in the dark about the extent of what ended up being the charges against Lucy.”\n\nMany of them were interviewed by police, and told “they shouldn’t confer”, but Michele said they were only asked about specific babies that were in their care – and not told the bigger picture.\n\n\n\nMichele went on to say: “None of them believed that Lucy had done anything.\n\n“These girls are completely traumatised because they were all very good friends.”\n\nI go to bed now and think they did me a huge favour [making me redundant] because that could have been me in the dock. I know a lot of my friends feel the same way. Michele Warden\n\nShe added: “There’s always going to be the odd nurse who doesn’t get on with another nurse, that’s human nature, but on the whole Lucy had lots of friends on the unit and they believed her and thought this was all nonsense.\n\n“By the time you get to the guilty verdicts, many of them were shellshocked… because how could the British justice system have got this so wrong?”\n\nMichele said in conversations she had with many of her ex-colleagues after Letby was jailed: “they were saying what did we miss? Was she doing this? How did we not see any of this? Then you’re questioning yourself.”\n\n\n\nAnd while she was devastated at the time to be made redundant after 30 years in the NHS, she believes perhaps she was lucky.\n\n“As the ANNP, I was always with the sickest babies, like Lucy was,” Michele explained.\n\n“I go to bed now and think they did me a huge favour because that could have been me in the dock. I know a lot of my friends feel the same way.”\n\nMichele went on to say: “It’s done such a lot of damage to neonatal nursing, they (her former colleagues) know a lot of nurses who are still working in other hospitals, who are saying it’s affected our relationship with the parents, because if I get too friendly, am I going to get the finger pointed at me.”\n\nThe charges Letby has been convicted of in full Child A, allegation of murder. The Crown said Letby injected air intravenously into the bloodstream of the baby boy. COUNT 1 GUILTY. Child B, allegation of attempted murder. The Crown said Letby attempted to murder the baby girl, the twin sister of Child A, by injecting air into her bloodstream. COUNT 2 GUILTY. Child C, allegation of murder. Prosecutors said Letby forced air down a feeding tube and into the stomach of the baby boy. COUNT 3 GUILTY. Child D, allegation of murder. The Crown said air was injected intravenously into the baby girl. COUNT 4 GUILTY. Child E, allegation of murder. The Crown said Letby murdered the twin baby boy with an injection of air into the bloodstream and also deliberately caused bleeding to the infant. COUNT 5 GUILTY. Child F, allegation of attempted murder. Letby was said by prosecutors to have poisoned the twin brother of Child E with insulin. COUNT 6 GUILTY. Child I, allegation of murder. The prosecution said Letby killed the baby girl at the fourth attempt and had given her air and overfed her with milk. COUNT 12 GUILTY. Child K, allegation of attempted murder. The prosecution said Letby compromised the baby girl as she deliberately dislodged a breathing tube. COUNT 14 JURY COULD NOT REACH VERDICT AT ORIGINAL TRIAL, NOW GUILTY AFTER RETRIAL Child L, allegation of attempted murder. The Crown said the nurse poisoned the twin baby boy with insulin. COUNT 15 GUILTY. Child M, allegation of attempted murder. Prosecutors said Letby injected air into the bloodstream of Child L’s twin brother. COUNT 16 GUILTY. Child N, three allegations of attempted murder. The Crown said Letby inflicted trauma in the baby boy’s throat and also injected him with air in the bloodstream. COUNT 17 GUILTY, COUNT 18 JURY COULD NOT REACH VERDICT, COUNT 19 JURY COULD NOT REACH VERDICT. Child O, allegation of murder. Prosecutors say Letby attacked the triplet boy by injecting him with air, overfeeding him with milk and inflicting trauma to his liver with “severe force”. COUNT 20 GUILTY. Child P, allegation of murder. Prosecutors said the nurse targeted the triplet brother of Child O by overfeeding him with milk, injecting air and dislodging his breathing tube. COUNT 21 GUILTY. Child Q, allegation of attempted murder. The Crown said Letby injected the baby boy with liquid, and possibly air, down his feeding tube. COUNT 22 JURY COULD NOT REACH VERDICT\n\nShe also said much of what was used against Letby in court to paint her as “macabre”, she’s done herself as a nurse.\n\n\n\n“I’ve sent parents bereavement cards, I’ve been to babies’ funerals, that’s what you do as a kind nurse,” she explained.\n\nIn court, it was heard that Letby had kept her shift handover notes as “trophies”, storing around 250 such documents in bags under her bed and in the garage, but Michele believes this was mispresented.\n\nShe explained: “They’re not medical notes, they’re an aid memoir for a nurse on that particular shift, and I’ve kept handover notes, they come home in your pocket.”\n\nEverything’s been weaponised against Lucy to say that was macabre. She was portrayed as a lying, macabre, horrible, gloating killer. Michele Warden\n\nShe added: “I have friends who say we’re so paranoid now of going on duty – have we emptied all of our pockets before we walk out of the hospital?\n\n“Everything’s been weaponised against Lucy to say that was macabre. She was portrayed as a lying, macabre, horrible, gloating killer.”\n\n\n\nAsked to describe what her ex-colleagues thought of Letby, Michele went on to say: “To her friends she was fun-loving, they’d go out salsa dancing, they’d go out drinking cocktails – what most 25-year-old people do.\n\n“They went on holiday together. She was a bit quirky, popular, she was very ambitious, she wanted a career, she was very focused, she did her QIS training, I’ve been told she wanted to be an ANNP.”\n\nShe added: “She was just a normal, young girl who had a great job she loved, worked hard, got a degree and then was completely called out.”\n\nMichele says: “I really hope they’re going to get back to the court of appeal and she’s going to be exonerated.\n\n“There has to be massive changes in the way these cases are investigated.”\n\n\n\nThe Sun has approached The Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Cheshire Police for comment."

His romances - especially his stint as half of the ultimate power couple with S Club 7's Rachel Stevens - mesmerised the nation and resulted in a huge offer for wedding photos.\n\nYet by February 2026, circumstances have shifted considerably. The 55-year-old is now focused on his responsibilities as a dedicated father to his two youngsters, Scarlett, seven, and Teddy, four. Outside his commitments to his family with wife Lydia Metz, the actor has told how he felt \"ignored\" by Hollyoaks bosses after \"begging\" them to let him be in the 30th anniversary.\n\nAdmitting he was \"desperate\" to be a part of the soap's milestone celebrations last year, he told 'Secure The Insecure' podcast last Spring: \"I wrote to the casting and said I wanted to go back, because they brought me back, but unfortunately it was still COVID time.\"\n\nWhere the Hollyoaks original cast are now - from famous flings to surprise career switches READ MORE :\n\nView 4 Images Jeremy has been a Hollyoaks heartthrob since the 90's (Image: CHANNEL 4)\n\nHe added: \"So I asked to go back to the 30th, but I haven't had a reply, and they’re doing a tour apparently.

And I'll always be that guy everywhere I go and get it every day.\"\n\nLooking back on his celebrity years, Jeremy told The Sun: \"I had the best time of my life when I started out; I was going to elite showbiz parties,\" Jeremy reminisces. \"I was young, good-looking, and had loads of money - the money was insane - so make of that what you will.\"\n\nHe continued: \"But now things are different. I'm a husband, a dad, and my kids are my main priority. I like to be around for them as much as possible, having breakfast together and doing the school run. Although, I do still hear mums at the school gates saying, 'Yeah, I fancied him when I was younger'.\"\n\nView 4 Images Now the 54-year-old lives a quieter life as a dad-of-two (Image: Jeremy Edwards Instagram)\n\nJeremy's ascent to stardom extended beyond television as his pairing with chart-topping vocalist Rachel mesmerised the country, securing their status as Britain's premier celebrity duo - even surpassing Posh and Becks. During the early 2000s, Jeremy and Rachel were regarded as the ultimate celebrity power couple.\n\nTheir romance seemed like something from a storybook, with Jeremy proposing to Rachel on Valentine's Day at London's Dorchester Hotel following merely 18 months together. Rachel was over the moon - after previously admitting she'd fancied her fiancé since the first moment she saw him on screen.\n\n\"I really didn't have a clue he was going to do it and am thrilled to pieces,\" Rachel said in an interview at the time. \"We are both so happy.\"\n\nTheir fame reached a fever pitch during this time, with one magazine offering a staggering £2 million offer for photos of their wedding and firstborn child.\n\nSpeaking on the Soap From the Box podcast, he revealed: \"We were offered stupid amounts of money to sell our wedding photos, honeymoon photos and our first born, and I turned it down. I just thought, 'This is ridiculous'. I wish I'd done it. I could've made a s***load of money and had a bit more privacy. I'd be living in The Bahamas or something.\"\n\nThe picture-perfect romance didn't last, with the pair parting ways in early 2004. At the time, they said it simply \"hadn't worked out\" but behind the scenes, Jeremy was privately spiralling.\n\nView 4 Images Rachel Stevens and Jeremy Edwards were the 'ultimate' celebrity power couple (Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe death of his Holby City co-star Laura Sadler, who plunged 40 ft to her death from a balcony while watching the sunrise at her boyfriend's home in Holland Park, London, left Jeremy devastated by the sudden loss.\n\nAdmitting he turned to alcohol, he told Heat magazine: \"It was a tough time for me. After Laura's death I got really messed up. I was drinking a hell of a lot and got seriously depressed. It really shook me up. Losing such a close friend pushed me off the rails and sadly Rachel got caught up in my mess.\n\nDespite initial reports suggesting it was an amicable breakup, Jeremy later hinted in 2017 that there was a \"lack of trust and concerns about a potential fling\" that contributed to the split.\n\nRachel went on to marry childhood sweetheart Alex Bourne in 2009, but the pair split in 2021. She then dated her Dancing On Ice partner Brendyn Hatfield, 40, but the pair split in 2025 three years together.\n\nAccording to Jeremy, the revelation that Rachel had starting dating Brendyn just months after her divorce, sparked alarm, with the star claiming she'd had a fling – a claim Stevens has strenuously denied.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe actor told The Sun: \"Since this story came up, it's brought all this up again. And I’ve thought about it more, I’ve thought about our relationship, and I think she did have a fling. I would never in a million years have thought she would do something like this. But because of the story that has come out, it just makes me question our relationship.\"\n\nIn a statement shared with The Mirror a representative said: \"This is a completely false story, the interview is absolute lies, and this did absolutely not happen.\"\n\nEight months after the breakup with Rachel, Jeremy met his wife Lydia. Looking back, Jeremy now believes his ADHD, which was diagnosed four years ago, played a role in the separation and his capacity to cope with the pressures of fame. Presently, Jeremy juggles four different projects, including an unlikely career teaching neurodiverse pupils at the UK Film Academy, writing books, performing, and hosting on the teleshopping channel Ideal World.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHe's also launched TWIST: The Way I See Things on his TikTok account @jeremytwist,, which explores critical topics in Britain, from homelessness and mental health to inequality and the cost-of-living crisis."

As the virus is often 'silent', countless individuals may be unknowingly carrying it for years, putting themselves at risk of life-threatening complications. In a recent post on X, formerly Twitter, the UKHSA cautioned: \"Hepatitis C often shows no signs until serious damage is done.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It can be treated, so testing is key to help you help reduce your risk.\" Without treatment, the virus can result in permanent liver scarring (cirrhosis), liver failure, or even liver cancer.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, advances in modern medicine mean the virus is now readily curable with a brief course of tablets, provided it is detected early enough.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe UKHSA has identified several groups who may have been unknowingly exposed to the virus. You may face a higher risk if:\n\nYou received a blood transfusion in the UK before 1996, or blood products before 1986\n\nYou have ever shared needles or equipment for injecting drugs\n\nYou have had medical, dental, or cosmetic treatment (such as tattoos or piercings) abroad in unsterile conditions\n\nYou have had condomless sex or shared a razor or toothbrush with someone who may have the virus\n\nYou were born in a nation where hepatitis C is more prevalent, including regions of Africa, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia\n\nPeople aged 18 and over, and living in England, can receive a free and confidential home testing kit on the NHS.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHow do I take a free hepatitis C test?\n\nOrder : Request a free kit online\n\n: Request a free kit online Sample : Use the kit to prick your finger and collect a small amount of blood\n\n: Use the kit to prick your finger and collect a small amount of blood Post : Send the sample to the lab in the pre-paid packaging provided\n\n: Send the sample to the lab in the pre-paid packaging provided Results: You will be contacted within two weeks. If the result is positive, an NHS professional will call you to discuss the next steps\n\nWhile hepatitis C treatment previously required painful injections with considerable side effects, the virus is now managed with a straightforward course of tablets typically lasting between 8 to 12 weeks. These contemporary treatments have minimal side effects and successfully cure the overwhelming majority of patients.\n\nIf you're worried about your risk or wish to request a kit, you can visit the official NHS website to verify your eligibility and safeguard your health."

Disturbing videos on social media showed the 5-star hotel burning with thick red flames and black plumes of smoke licking the sky.\n\nNearby, the the City Walk, close to the Burj Khalifa, also seemed to have pockets of fires. Residents reported 'explosions' and windows shaking.\n\nImage: @clashreport/X) @clashreport/X)\n\nFurther footage has also shown the moment a high-rise building in Bahrain suffered an alleged suicide drone ploughing into it. Seconds after the smash, the building erupted into a burning inferno.\n\nIt remains unclear if there have been any casualties.\n\nThe strike comes as panicked residents across the Middle East can be seen ducking for cover and running through the streets as missiles fly overhead.\n\nIran warned that it has \"no red lines\" as it looks to take revenge for the strikes.\n\nIsrael's defence minister confirmed it had launched a 'preventative attack' against Iran. Israel Katz said strikes were being carried out \"to remove threats\".\n\nThe US also confirmed its participation in Israel's strikes against Iran, with President Trump demanding the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) surrender or \"face certain death\".\n\nImage: @clashreport/X) @clashreport/X)\n\nTrump also appealed to the Iranian people to \"seize control of your destiny,\" in an explicit call for regime change.\n\nIranian cities that have been hit reportedly include Tehran, Isfahan, Tabriz, Kermanshah and Qom, according to Telegram posts.\n\nIn Bahrain, its US base near Juffair housing area was seen billowing smoke today after the island kingdom confirmed a strike targeted the US Navy's 5th Fleet Headquarters.\n\nA woman living near to the Bahrain base told The Sun about the impact the missle had on her home.\n\nShe said her \"entire apartment was shaken and the windows shattered when the missile hit\".\n\n“I know that all US military bases in Bahrain were emptied the day before, so there was no military personnel there,\" she added.\n\n“But no one had told us to evacuate. My family has now left the neighbourhood.\n\n“People across Bahrain – because of how small the country is – heard the blast and the fighter jets. People living as far as 20-30 miles away from the base. I hope it is over for now.”\n\nThis is a Breaking News story.

            "content": "Former world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr has announced a surprise return to the ring, revealing plans for a fourth comeback that will begin with an exhibition against Mike Tyson before a blockbuster professional rematch with Manny Pacquiao later this year.\n\nThe rivals are set to meet again on September 19 at the Sphere - 11 years after their long-awaited 2015 showdown, when Mayweather claimed a unanimous-decision victory in the so-called 'Fight of the Century.'\n\nPacquiao, now 47, returned to action in July 2025 and fought Mario Barrios to a majority draw for the WBC welterweight title, insisting his comeback is driven by a desire to become world champion again. Mayweather, meanwhile, says he 'still has what it takes to set more records,' despite questions regarding his financial status.\n\nA recent report by Business Insider suggested Mayweather’s widely publicised fortune may be overstated, citing liens, outstanding debts, foreclosures and heavily leveraged assets including property holdings and his private jet.\n\nBack in 2024, I caught a glimpse of life inside Mayweather's orbit - a whirlwind casino evening filled with luxury excess, eye-watering tips and one surprising moment of frugality.\n\nFloyd Mayweather invited Daily Mail Sport for a night out in Las Vegas in an extraordinary offer\n\nCharlotte Daly hit the strip with Mayweather for a big night out in Las Vegas (pictured above)\n\nWhen Floyd Mayweather invites you for a night out in Las Vegas, you know it will be extraordinary. Picture this: the neon lights of the strip reflecting off luxury cars, the pulsating energy of the city that never sleeps, and 'Money Mayweather' at the centre of it all.\n\nFrom exclusive cigar lounges to high-roller tables, this was no ordinary night out. We sipped 'Good Money Whiskey' and indulged in caviar before discussing Mayweather's relationship with his father, the key moments in his career, the current crop of boxers, and his exhibition earnings.\n\nIn true Mayweather style, he arrived at Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot, in a blacked-out SUV, wearing a £2,000 Gucci jacket and a gleaming Rolex. Fans clamoured for photos as he was greeted by models holding sparklers and a glowing Mayweather sign.\n\n'I do like the finer things in life', Mayweather quipped when asked about his love for luxury. 'I enjoy my cars and my watches but money don't make me, I make money.\n\n'I don't just keep all the money either, I give back to the less fortunate. My mother don't want for nothing, my loved ones don't want for anything. My team live a pretty good life. They travel the world, stay at five star hotels. But, the most important thing is, we are happy. I was happy before I made money. With or without money I am a happy person.'\n\nA fixture on the Vegas Strip with his 7,000-square-foot gentleman's club and top-tier boxing gym, Mayweather took charge behind the bar, crafting an Old Fashioned cocktail with his Good Money Whiskey - a brand now available in 10 states including Nevada, California, and Florida.\n\nWhen handed the five-year-old whiskey, Mayweather joked, 'She's come all the way from the UK, and you're giving her the five-year-old whiskey? She deserves the 10-year!'\n\nThough not drinking himself, Mayweather passed the cocktail with a knowing smile. 'It's just like boxing,' he said confidently. 'I had the best team, so I got the best results. I've got the best team working on my brands, too. Just try it and you'll see.'\n\nIn true Mayweather style, he arrived at Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot, in a blacked-out SUV, wearing a £2,000 Gucci jacket and a gleaming Rolex\n\nWith a drink in hand, we moved to Mayweather's exclusive area, adorned with Le Bon Argent Champagne and attentive waitresses ensuring my glass was always full. Intrigued by highlight reels of his career playing on the screens overhead, I asked the boxing legend about his favorite memory.\n\n'I'm not sure which one was my favourite fight but the best fighter I ever fought probably was Manny Pacquiao. I can see why he won so many fights, it's all the moves he would make. But, I reckon the roughest fight I ever had was Emanuel Augustus, he was very tough competitor. When I faced him, I think he was 26 with 14 losses but extremely tough.\n\n'That being said, I think around half of my 50 fights were world title fights, so they were all good fights'.\n\nMayweather faced and defeated some of the biggest names in boxing, including Manny Pacquiao, Oscar De La Hoya, and Canelo Alvarez. He also claimed world titles in five different weight classes: Super Featherweight, Lightweight, Light Welterweight, Welterweight, and Light Middleweight.\n\nBut the true highlight of his career was walking away unharmed—a poignant topic given his father and uncle, Roger, both suffered neurological damage resulting in memory loss.\n\n'The real highlight of my career is that I am still able to communicate. That I am still able to speak well. I am still able to read and write. I am able to spend time with my children and I am able to travel. I still have all my faculties. That's the part about my career I am most pleased with. Not everyone gets that luxury and I've seen it first hand.'\n\nMayweather's relationship with his father has been complex but pivotal. Mayweather Sr. was instrumental in shaping his son's career, developing the defensive style that became his hallmark. Despite public disagreements and periods of estrangement, their bond remains strong.\n\n'My dad was my inspiration growing up. Without my dad I wouldn't have any of this. Without my dad I wouldn't have the crazy real estate portfolio I have. I wouldn't have met my two best friends, James McNair and Ricki Brazil. I wouldn't be here with you today. My dad is my driving force, my dad is everything to me.'\n\nFans clamoured for photos with him as he made his way to Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot\n\nA stark contrast to when Mayweather lashed out at his father in 2011, shouting: 'You couldn't fight for s***. You weren't nothing but a motherf***ing cab driver... bum a** trainer. You weren't s*** as a fighter, so how you gonna be something as a trainer. Get the f*** out my gym f*****t!'.\n\nWhile other kids played, Mayweather's childhood was a whirlwind of responsibilities, juggling time between caring for his drug-addict mother and training with his father.\n\n'My dad was about business, ever since I was a kid. From 1985, my dad had me running five miles a day. He wouldn't let me run in sneakers either. He made me run five miles every day in combat boots while I was a child.\n\n'He also brought me out into the garden and made me chop wood. He always told me, there is no room for excuses. He said no matter how many fights you win, it's never good enough, you can always get better. There is always room for growth.\n\n'But, my dad gave me structure. He helped mould me into the man I am today. A man of honour, a man of dignity. A stand-up guy. A person that believes he can get better. It's all because of my father.'\n\nAs we chatted, one of Floyd's friends casually offered spoonfuls of caviar around the room. This wasn't your average caviar; it was the kind that likely costs more than my entire monthly salary. The nonchalant manner in which it was served, however, made it seem like an everyday snack.\n\nMeanwhile, Eddie Griffin, a comedian from American sitcom Malcolm & Eddie, flitted around the room casually cracking jokes before diving into the high-stakes action at the casino tables.\n\nHaving accompanied him to the high-roller area, I watched in awe as players casually dropped $500k per round on craps. It was clear I'd be spectating rather than participating in this high-rolling spectacle.\n\nA fixture on the Vegas Strip with his 7,000-square-foot gentleman's club and top-tier boxing gym, Mayweather took charge behind the bar, crafting an Old Fashioned cocktail\n\nWhile Mayweather wasn't one to splurge at the tables, he was exceptionally generous with his tips. When $500 slipped from his pocket, he handed it to a waitress without hesitation and quickly pulled out another $500 for her colleague, making sure everyone felt appreciated.\n\nMayweather's wealth stems from his boxing prowess. Known for his defensive mastery and unmatched ring IQ, he earned the nickname 'Pretty Boy' for his flawless, unmarked face. He firmly believes no boxer will ever match his unique skills.\n\n'There will never be another boxer like me because my IQ was just on another level. You've got guys that have fast hands, you've got guys who have great punching power but they will never compete with my IQ.\n\n'My IQ was just on a whole different level. I could make adjustments that other people wouldn't be able to do. Go look at the Shane Mosley fight. Guy hit me with a couple of good shots, I came back the next round and put on a master class.\n\n'I was zoned in and knew exactly what he was going to do. I didn't hear the crowd, I didn't hear my trainer, I just listened to myself. I knew exactly what he was going to do. I had the ability to turn a fight on its head like that. Completely change the dynamic of a fight. That's what it takes, a sharp mind, a good chin and the heart of a lion.'\n\nYet, despite his undefeated boxing record (50-0) and iconic status, Mayweather acknowledged personal defeats beyond the ring.\n\n'Losing my uncle was a defeat. Losing my grandmother was a defeat. Losing my housekeeper of 20-something years was a defeat. Losing the mother of my children was a defeat. Losing my best friend was a defeat. I have been defeated in ways like that. Everything you go through in life is an experience you can grow from. I just try to use those experiences to become stronger every day.'\n\nMayweather's resilience in the face of such personal trials is mirrored in his approach to the racism he faced during his career.\n\nEddie Griffin, comedian from American sitcom Malcolm & Eddie, flitted around the room casually cracking jokes before diving into the high-stakes action at the casino tables\n\nGriffin joking told Mayweather he was going to steal a couple bottles of his whiskey\n\n'You're going to get racism and you're going to have to deal with it. I knew I was going to deal with it but that never stopped me from being who I wanted to be. It never stopped me from believing in myself.\n\n'It was never going to stop me from taking myself to the top. I knew I was the best and nothing was going to hold me back. There are many fighters that will come after me that will experience the same thing.\n\n'I want them to be great and I don't want them to be held back by it. I want them to surpass me if they can. Records are there to be broken but there will never be another Floyd Mayweather. I know that for a fact.'\n\nEven in retirement, Mayweather keeps his love for boxing alive through exhibition bouts, taking on the likes of Deji Olatunji, Tenshin Nasukawa, and Logan Paul.\n\nHowever, the pinnacle was his 2017 clash with MMA's Conor McGregor. While Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and LeBron James collectively earned $259 million that year, Mayweather surpassed that sum in a single night, shattering boxing's pay-per-view record with 6.5 million buys.\n\n'People have such a problem with my exhibitions. Jeff Bezos is well off but he's still working. Warren Buffett, he's probably in his 90's now and he's still working. The Walton's who own Walmart are still working. Elon Musk is still working. So, it's okay for me to work.\n\n'There is no risk with these exhibitions. I am taking on former MMA guys and YouTubers. They can't get near me. It's not a crime for me to have some fun with them and entertain the crowd.\n\n'I feel like I deserve it. I am still one of the most talked fighters in the sport of boxing and I'm not even boxing professionally anymore. So, it's only right I am getting the payday to match it. I have plenty of offers I could show you on my phone. $300million, $100million, $50million, $20million, $17million. They are all offers sat on my phone right now. It all depends but if you pay, we play. It's as simple as that.'\n\nMayweather popped into the local doughnut shop. After ordering two boxes of doughnuts, Mayweather was floored when he was told the total would be $90 (pictured above)\n\nPulling out a thick wad of cash, he went to pay before pausing dramatically, spreading the bills across his hands and playfully quipping 'I've got the money, I just don't want to spend it!'\n\nThe hilarious encounter ended with him handing over the money and taking the doughnuts\n\nDespite having the potential to rake in $300million from an exhibition bout and being nicknamed 'Money Mayweather,' the 47-year-old had a hilariously human moment at the end of our night out.\n\nJust as Brits might hit a kebab shop on their way home, Mayweather popped into the local doughnut shop. After ordering two boxes of doughnuts, Mayweather was floored when he was told the total would be $90.\n\nPulling out a thick wad of cash, he went to pay before pausing dramatically, spreading the bills across his hands and playfully quipping 'I've got the money, I just don't want to spend it!'.\n\nMayweather will return to the ring this summer for a rematch against John Gotti III - the grandson of the late mob boss - having first faced the 31-year-old back in June 2023, with the fight ending in chaos after a brawl broke out when people stormed the ring.\n\nThe Good Money is a global brand created in direct partnership with Floyd Mayweather. The brand produces high-quality Champagne and Whisky, with their bourbon available to purchase at large retailers such as Total Wine, Specs, Lee's Liquors and WalMart."

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

A date and location has not yet been confirmed.\n\nMeanwhile Pacquiao, 47, has a warm-up fight against Ruslan Provodnikov on April 18, almost a year after his draw with then-WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios."

            "content": "Frank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980.

The cameras were forced to cut away before medics attended to the fighter.\n\nReplays show that late in the first round, the two boxers clashed heads, with George coming away dazed and shaken. It appears this was the reason for his sudden fall to the canvas.\n\nThe 36-year-old made it back to his feet following medical attention and was taken to a Detroit hospital to be monitored.

'I'm a true champion, true warrior. We can do whatever you want to do it, but I'm just happy that he's OK.\n\n'I just wanted to make sure he was safe. At the end of the day, we're warriors, but we want to leave here the same way we come out.'\n\nLater in the night, Shields defended her undisputed heavyweight championship in dominant fashion, dispatching Crews-Dezurn by unanimous decision.\n\nThe 30-year-old American won 100-90 on all three judges' scorecards and remains unbeaten in her professional career, with a record of 18 wins."

'We have good nutritionists and they adapt to what the team needs.\n\n'We cannot adapt the schedule for the Premier League [kick-off] times and I think they are used to it - they are not young and have been playing [for] many years during this period.\n\n'For the players I think it is not new. Both Rayans, Omar and Khusa, it is not the first time for [observing] Ramadan and they know perfectly how to handle it.'\n\nThe break in play lasted for around a minute as Pep Guardiola relayed instructions to his team\n\nSpeaking on BBC Five Live, former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson highlighted the importance of the breaks.\n\nHe said: 'I think it's very good for the players. We talk about the athletes and how fine-tuned they are at the moment.\n\n'To go that long without food and drink, it is vitally important that they have that break.'\n\nThe Premier League confirmed earlier this month that Ramadan breaks would be used in matches again this season to allow players to break their fast during the holy month, which runs from February 17 to March 19.\n\nGiven sunset in the UK ranges from around 5PM to 6.30PM during this period, the only games that are affected are 5:30PM kick-offs on a Saturday and the 4:30PM kick-off on a Sunday.\n\nThe protocol for these breaks sees teams and match officials discuss pre-match whether a pause is required, before they settle on an approximate time when the stoppage will take place.\n\nIt was in 2021 when Ramadan breaks were introduced, with Leicester City's clash against Crystal Palace in April of that year being the first occasion they were seen.\n\nDuring that match, play was paused at a goal-kick on around 30 minutes to allow Leicester's Wesley Fofana and Palace's Cheikhou Kouyate to take on board liquids and energy gels.\n\nIt has since become a regular occurrence to see games halted during Ramadan.\n\nMan United's FA Cup clash against Fulham last March was one example, with the match stopped to allow Noussair Mazraoui to break his fast.\n\nAlongside the City quartet, Muslim names in the Premier League include Mohamed Salah, William Saliba, Fofana and Amad Diallo, while City legends Ilkay Gundogan, Riyad Mahrez and Yaya Toure are also followers of Islam.\n\nSpeaking back in 2023, former Everton and Watford star Abdoulaye Doucoure hailed the top flight for its work in making Muslim players feel welcome.\n\n'In the Premier League you are free to do whatever suits you. They will never do anything against your faith and this is great,' he told BBC Sport.\n\n'I fast every day, I don't miss any day. It has become normal and very easy for me.\n\n'Training is still the same during Ramadan but when we go [for away matches], we might need to eat later than the others so the chef prepares food for us, making sure everything is in place as at home. We get halal food so there are no problems.'\n\nIn 2022, former Liverpool player Sadio Mane also revealed the club altered their training schedules to support their Muslim players during the month of Ramadan."

            "content": "Liverpool fly out of the blocks to pick up crucial victory against plucky West Ham on an afternoon that felt like spring 2025, writes LEWIS STEELE\n\nA first outing of the season for sunshine and bright blue skies made this Anfield afternoon feel rather like spring 2025 – but the weather was not the only reason.\n\nFor the first time since the famous day of April last when Liverpool won the Premier League title by thrashing Tottenham, the Reds scored three in a first half and put a game to bed.\n\nThe weather makes everything feel better and, like the lyrics to Here Comes The Sun by local band the Beatles, it has been a long, cold, lonely winter for Liverpool.\n\nBut the green shoots of spring are now showing after a taxing mid-season slump-cum-crisis for the champions, who have now won four games in a row.\n\nHugo Ekitike, Virgil van Dijk and Alexis Mac Allister were the first-half goal-scorers as the Reds broke with tradition to put their chances away, unlike far too often this season where poor finishing has bugged Arne Slot.\n\nIt highlighted the importance of starting games strongly as it gave Liverpool the safety cushion of a rather sloppy second half where West Ham came out fighting and pulled one back through Tomas Soucek just after the break.\n\nLiverpool beat West Ham 5-2 to boost their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League\n\nThe Reds burst out of the traps and were 3-0 up by half-time. Hugo Ekitike (right) and Virgil van Dijk (left) were among the scorers\n\nThe result was slightly harsh on Nuno Espirito Santo's side yet it was a huge blow in their battle to avoid relegation\n\nFirst halves have been a major problem for Slot this year. His team had scored just 13 goals in opening periods this season, compared to 29 after the interval.\n\nToo often they have left themselves with mountains to climb, too often they have allowed opposition teams to grow in confidence against them.\n\nDespite the fast start, the overall performance still left a bit to be desired. In terms of expected goals (xG), West Ham created more and maybe classed themselves as still in the contest until Cody Gakpo put it out of reach on 71 minutes with a much-needed goal.\n\nThat xG statistic counts for nothing, though, in either the relegation battle or the scrap for Champions League places. All history will remember is Liverpool giving the Hammers a shellacking and putting a huge dent in their hopes of safety.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo’s charges came here on a run of just one defeat in their last eight – a loss to Chelsea in a game they led 2-0 – but he would have travelled back to London knowing the Hammers’ top-flight future is dangling by a thread.\n\nSlot, meanwhile, will know this was another crucial victory on the way to achieving Champions League qualification again for next season, after last week’s last-second winner at Nottingham Forest.\n\nThe importance of staying in Europe’s premier competition was highlighted in financial accounts published this week: they made a profit and posted record revenues last year, compared to a significant loss the year before when they were only in the Europa League.\n\nVan Dijk's header from a corner highlighted Liverpool's improved strength at set-pieces\n\nAlexis Mac Allister scored for the second successive week to double his tally for the season\n\nTomas Soucek pulled one back at the start of the second half, but Liverpool held their nerve\n\nWith Aston Villa losing to Wolves on Friday night, Unai Emery’s men have been reeled from a title race to a battle for the top five – so this was points gained on them for Liverpool, with tricky games for Chelsea and Manchester United on Sunday.\n\nGiven a tricky run-in for the Reds that sees them play all three of those teams in their last four games, two away from home, getting points on the board now might be of the utmost importance come squeaky bum time in May.\n\nAnother problem area in Liverpool’s tricky season has been set-pieces but this game was another step in the right direction in that regard.\n\nThe ‘set-piece table’ is rather pretentious but it is worth referring to with this team. At the turn of the year, no team had scored fewer set-piece goals than Liverpool. In a mini-league since the start of 2026, no one has more than the Reds.\n\nIt is a remarkable turnaround for a team who looked so weak at the so-called small margin of the game that actually is having a rather decisive influence on this season, something that Slot – and other managers – discuss every day.\n\nThe first goal technically came from a set-piece as West Ham twice failed to defend a corner and Ekitike, on the half-volley, powered his 16th goal of the season past Hermansen, who was not helped by a minor deflection.\n\nIt was soon two thanks to the captain, Van Dijk, who headed home a Dominik Szoboszlai corner which took the Hungarian to eight goal involvements for the calendar year. Unlike Liverpool’s up and down form, Szoboszlai’s supremacy has been unwavering in a stellar campaign.\n\nMac Allister, who pulled off a great robbery in Robin Hood country last weekend with a last-gasp winner in Nottingham, doubled his league tally for the season with a nice volley which, again, came from a corner.\n\nCody Gakpo ended his goal drought and Jeremie Frimpong forced an own goal late on\n\nTaty Castellanos did pull the score back to 4-2 at one point, but the Hammers remain two points adrift of safety\n\nClearly, this was a day to right the wrongs of this season. From set-piece vulnerability to putting Mikel Arteta’s dead-ball kings to shame, from slow starts being an unwanted theme to flying out of the blocks and having the game won by half-time.\n\nSoucek pulled a goal back on 49 minutes to add a few nerves to Anfield, which were only furthered when Gakpo shanked one wide at point-blank range minutes later. The Dutchman soon atoned by cutting in to score his first goal in eight games.\n\nWest Ham’s January signing Taty Castellanos scored his third goal for the club on 75 minutes to prove Liverpool’s set-piece problems may still exist in a defensive sense, but substitute Jeremie Frimpong soon forced a Reds fifth, via a deflection off Axel Disasi, to put the gloss on the win.\n\n\n\nIt was the first time Slot’s men have scored five in the league since they confirmed their status as champions last April. We know they won’t be doing the same again this year but this was a significant victory on the way to achieving their new goal of Champions League qualification."

            "content": "Jordan Pickford makes miraculous save in stoppage time as Everton secure 3-2 away win over nauseating Newcastle, writes CRAIG HOPE\n\nWhen Jacob Ramsey was sick on the pitch before the start of the second half, it was grimly symbolic of what had gone before and what was to follow for Newcastle - a nauseating performance regurgitated, just when they thought a cure had been found.\n\nThis was a third straight defeat in the Premier League at St James’ Park. Last time, against Brentford three weeks ago, there were home boos and a dressing-room inquest. Eddie Howe and his team responded with three wins on the road, leading to talk of a corner turned. Here, they stumbled back down a dark alley.\n\nJust when it felt like a glimmer of light had appeared at the death, and with Sandro Tonali’s booming volley headed for the back of the Gallowgate End net in salvation of a point, Jordan Pickford somehow flicked the ball onto the crossbar.\n\nThe home fans applauded in recognition of Tonali’s 20-yard blast, but the appreciation could easily have been for the save, had it not been the former Sunderland goalkeeper, pantomime villain turned Everton’s hero.\n\nPickford’s intervention preserved what was a deserved win for David Moyes’ side, who led in the 20th minute when Jarrad Branthwaite headed in from a corner.\n\nHe was outstanding at the other end, too, making a strong case for starting at centre-back in front of Pickford at the World Cup this summer.\n\nJacob Ramsey was sick on the pitch and it was a nauseating Newcastle performance\n\nJordan Pickford made an extraordinary save late in the game to deny Sandro Tonali\n\nRamsey levelled on 33 minutes but, 105 seconds later, Beto punished a Nick Pope spill for 2-1. There was another equaliser in the 82nd minute, Jacob Murphy’s volley taking a nick beyond Pickford, but again Newcastle proved allergic to parity.\n\nAnthony Gordon surrendered the ball in midfield seconds after the restart and substitute Thierno Barry slid in at the far post to convert from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s low centre.\n\nThe substitute turned in with his buttock but it was Newcastle again making the proverbial backside of their defending. Leeds, Bournemouth, Brentford and now Everton have all scored three times on Tyneside in 2026.\n\n‘We dominated the second half, scored and then self-imploded,’ said Howe. ‘It is a strange situation. We started the season so strong defensively. That has flipped on its head and it’s been building.\n\n'Our resilience to keep the ball out of the net is not good enough. Too many individual errors are costing us goals. Our home form has tailed off and we need to grab that back as quickly as possible.’\n\nNewcastle will now have to win all 10 remaining matches to equal last season’s points tally of 66, when they finished fifth. If they are to qualify for next season’s Champions League, then, they’ll have to do it by beating Barcelona in the last 16 and going all the way to the final in Budapest, scene of their only European trophy in 1969.\n\nNot that they looked like continental champions here. Their league form, five defeats in six, means they are justifiably closer to the bottom three than the top five.\n\nThis was an afternoon of many shortcomings, but the Nick Woltemade midfield experiment is surely reaching expiry. He started as a No.8 for the fifth straight game but after half an hour was moved back to No.9, where he did not fare any better.\n\nLow on confidence and short of the physicality to compete in the Premier League, the German is a conundrum who needs time on the training ground. The football ground is proving an unforgiving environment of late.\n\nHe was substituted after 56 minutes and the numbers did not make for good reading. Of just 14 touches, none were in the penalty area. He also lost his three midfield duels, which prompted Howe’s first-half tactical change.\n\nIt was a deserved victory for Everton and the Magpies are now closer to the bottom three than the top five in the Premier League\n\nEddie Howe and Co look downcast after full time having lost another game at home\n\nJoelinton had started on the left wing to accommodate Woltemade in midfield and the Brazilian looked like a heavyweight in a ringside seat.\n\nHe wanted to be the other side of the ropes and, as Everton ran through Newcastle’s midfield at will, it was clear his team needed him there.\n\nWithin three minutes of the reshuffle that saw Gordon moved to left wing and Joelinton shifted to the canvas in the middle, Newcastle were level when Tonali fizzed into Ramsey and his shot deflected off Branthwaite and in.\n\nThe home celebrations had only just subsided when Dwight McNeil’s shot was fumbled by Pope and Beto pounced. Likewise, St James’ was still noisy in exultation of Murphy’s strike when Barry scored Everton’s winner.\n\n\n\nHowe looked sick on full-time. He’s been fighting the same symptoms for too long."

            "content": "Richard Keys was forced off air with beIN Sports after the UK government warned Brits abroad to 'take immediate shelter' following the US bombing of Iran.\n\nThe former Sky Sports presenter took to X, writing: 'Thank you all for your messages. It was a bit lively earlier. I don’t have space to express my feelings about that idiot Trump. No show today.\n\n'You’ll be in the capable hands of our colleagues in London. Thoughts & prayers for everyone in our region. Ramadan Kareem.'\n\nHis comment came after the UK government's foreign office had issued a stark warning.\n\n'Due to reported missile attacks, British nationals in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates should immediately shelter in place,' came the instruction.\n\n'Remain indoors in a secure location, avoid all travel and follow instructions from the local authorities.'\n\nRichard Keys was forced off air after Brits abroad were warned to take shelter\n\nSmoke rises in Iran after a bomb strike from the US and Israel with conflict escalating\n\nKeys, who has lived in Qatar for 13 years while working as a presenter for the sports channel, has been told by the network that his contract will not be renewed when it expires at the end of the football season but is still working up until that point.\n\nOn Saturday morning, however, he was unable to take to the airwaves, with the frightening instability in the Middle East causing chaos in the region.\n\nThe US and Israel launched an attack on Iran, with President Donald Trump warning 'major combat operations' are taking place, as they aim for regime change.\n\nIsrael say Iran have launched retaliatory strikes of their own and explosions have been heard in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait.\n\nDoha, the capital of Qatar, is next to largest US airbase in the Middle East at Al Udaid, which could be one of the targets for Iranian strikes.\n\nKeys and beIN are based in Qatar and the presenter made it clear what he thought of the military action, calling Trump an 'idiot'.\n\nIn a video statement to the world, Trump had earlier urged the Iranian people to rise up and topple the clerical government.\n\n'When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations,' he declared.\n\nHe also said the Iranian army would be given 'immunity' if they laid down arms - vowing that they would face 'certain death' if they chose the alternative.\n\nKeys called US president Donald Trump an 'idiot' after he was forced off air\n\nEarlier this year, the Iranian government killed 6,480 during widespread protests against their rule. Trump said the government 'would pay a big price' and promised help is on the way.\n\nThe ramifications of the conflict and possible escalation are still not known but the impact on the region is already significant, with Keys' no-show just a microscopic example.\n\nThe controversial broadcaster and long-time colleague Andy Gray, 70, have resided in Doha since 2013, two years after they both lost their jobs at Sky Sports in the wake of a sexism scandal.\n\nA series of sexist remarks made by Keys and Gray about female assistant referee Sian Massey were picked up and leaked in January 2011 when they thought their microphones were off.\n\nGray was sacked by Sky Sports after a video showing him making inappropriate comments to presenter Charlotte Jackson was released. Keys resigned from his £500,000-a-year role shortly afterwards.\n\nKeys, 68, is set to move in permanently with his 37-year-old wife, Lucie Rose, with whom he has been in a long-distance relationship since they secretly married in a private £20,000 ceremony in Devon in June 2023.\n\nHis son Joshua and daughter Jemma, who was previously one of Lucie Rose's closest friends before her romantic involvement with Keys, did not attend the wedding.\n\nThe presenter split with Julia Keys after 36 years of marriage when news of his shock relationship emerged in 2016, with his ex-wife revealing how the affair 'devastated' her as she recovered from thyroid cancer and also wrecked the lives of their two children.\n\nLucie Rose, above, was previously one of Keys' daughter's best friends before their romance\n\nKeys (centre) pictured with his ex-wife Julia (left) and their daughter Jemma (right)\n\nJulia said the affair ruined the career of her Hollyoaks actress daughter as she spiralled into alcoholism and depression. Jemma also faced legal action over a string of abusive texts she sent to Lucie Rose before charges were dropped by prosecutors.\n\nSince joining beIN Sports, Keys and Gray have fronted coverage of the Premier League and Champions League across 24 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, while also presenting for the network at the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\n\nIt is also claimed that the broadcasting pair could quit live football presenting altogether when they return to the UK.\n\nA spokesman for Richard Keys told the Mail: 'Richard decided some months ago that, after 13 great years, the time had come to leave beIN with Andy. Following his decision it was mutually agreed that his final broadcasts for the channel would be in May this year.'"

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Now 30 years since the Dallas Cowboys' last Super Bowl appearance, owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he has let the fans down with his team's championship drought.\n\n\"I really can't accept just the thought of winning one Super Bowl and then what?\" Jones said Friday night from the NFL scouting combine. \"I've got more time on my clock than that in my mind. And so I don't see it that way. I see a chance to put a team together and basically be knocking at the edge and get another one or get a chance at a another one.\n\n\"It runs that way in my view. ... Make no mistake about it now, if you told me I could, because I've done a lot of hitchhiking in my life. ... I'd start here with you right now and hitchhike back to Dallas to win a Super Bowl.\"\n\nAfter a 7-9-1 finish in 2025, Jones promised change. One change will be the team's approach to free agency.\n\nThe Cowboys have not relied heavily on free agency in years, choosing to pick their spots to shore up holes on the roster with cost-effective players.\n\n\"I would bet that we will spend more money in free agency than we have,\" Jones said.\n\nTo do so, the Cowboys will first have to create salary cap room. Well over the $301.2 million cap that was set Friday, they will restructure the contracts of quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and left guard Tyler Smith, which will create $66 million of room.\n\nJones said the Cowboys will rework the contracts of defensive tackles Kenny Clark, Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa, who are scheduled to count around $63 million against the cap. With Clark and Williams, the Cowboys can look to add voidable years to their contracts then restructure that way.\n\n\"I want you to know that the only way to push more [out] is for me to go borrow some of my future, OK?\" Jones said. \"Expect me to go borrow some of my future.\"\n\nTo Jones, it goes beyond his personal Super Bowl wishes.\n\n\"I look at where we are with Dak and I look at where he is in his career. And I look at some of the pluses that we have on our front and what we think we can do there. And what we can do with [George] Pickens and Lamb and what we can do with our running back that we just signed [Javonte Williams],\" Jones said. \"And so all of those things I want to do everything we possibly can to stop somebody and to basically win some third downs more than we did last year. And so I think that would be the area that you would see me bust the budget. Where you would see me do that is what we're doing defensively.\n\n\"And I would expect anybody that's a Cowboy fan or a critic of the Cowboys to say, 'Duh, that's not hard to see, Jerry, to do.' But I guess what I'm doing is saying, yes, I intend to do that if given the opportunity.\"\n\nThe Cowboys defense finished at or near the bottom of the league in yards and points allowed in 2025. Christian Parker has been hired as the new defensive coordinator, and Jones acknowledged the need for more than just one or two new players, while also saying players that were on the defense in 2025 will be better in 2026 \"because the situation has changed.\"\n\nWith two first-round picks, the Cowboys have an opportunity to add more talent to their defense. Jones would not rule out the possibility of making trades, like the additions of Williams from the New York Jets and Clark from the Green Bay Packers for Micah Parsons.\n\n\"I don't know that I'd expect it but we have the ammunition to be good at it,\" Jones said. \"And I wouldn't hesitate to be good at it if it will help our team and help the timeline that we're talking about.\"\n\nNow 83, Jones was introspective at times during the hourlong meeting with reporters. His resolve to win a championship is strong.\n\n\"It's every bit the prize of anything I have, with the exception of family and your love for family,\" Jones said. \"I guess what I would say is make no mistake about it, I don't have a higher priority than to go and win a Super Bowl.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- After Denver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic tumbled to the Paycom Center court early in the fourth quarter Friday night, he determined that he needed to react to what he considered a dirty tactic by Oklahoma City Thunder guard Luguentz Dort.\n\nA chippy game between rivals who faced off in a seven-game series in last season's Western Conference semifinals escalated into a heated confrontation at that point, resulting in Dort's ejection and double technical fouls on Jokic and Oklahoma City center Jaylin Williams.\n\nThe fracas began when Dort appeared to trip Jokic as he ran up the court with 8:03 remaining in the fourth quarter. Dort backed into Jokic and stuck out his right foot, knocking down the big man, who quickly pounced to his feet to angrily confront Dort.\n\n\"It's an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction,\" Jokic said after the Nuggets' 127-121 overtime loss to the defending champions. \"There is no such thing -- I think there's not supposed to be those things on a basketball floor. So, it was just an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction by me.\"\n\nAfter Jokic chest-bumped Dort, Williams rushed over to intervene. Jokic and Williams exchanged shoves and grabbed each other's jerseys as a scrum of players, coaches, officials and staffers formed around them and eventually separated them.\n\n\"Just competing,\" Williams told ESPN. \"Two teams competing, that's it. That's all I got.\"\n\nAfter a review, the foul called against Dort was upgraded to a flagrant foul 2, resulting in an automatic ejection. Crew chief James Williams told a pool reporter that the officials \"deemed [Dort's] contact on Jokic to be unnecessary and excessive with a high potential for injury.\" Williams also cited the contact leading to an \"altercation that did not dissolve\" as a reason for upgrading it to a flagrant foul 2.\n\n\"I will say this: If [Williams] is running up the floor and gets tripped, we expect a flagrant 2 from this point forward,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \"That's all. If that's the precedent, if that becomes a malicious play and flagrant 2 is the line in the sand on that, we would expect that if it's [Williams]. We would expect that if it's anybody. And if that's the case, we're good.\"\n\nAsked if he believed the play was ruled a flagrant 2 because the foul was committed against a three-time MVP, Daigneault said: \"No, I'm not going to answer the question like that. I said what I needed to say about it.\"\n\nNuggets star Nikola Jokic confronts Thunder guard Luguentz Dort, who was called for a flagrant foul 2 after an apparent trip in the fourth quarter. Jokic and OKC's Jaylin Williams received technical fouls. Photo by Joshua Gateley/Getty Images\n\nThe referees determined that the actions of Jokic and Jaylin Williams during the altercation did not rise to the level of an ejection, James Williams said in the pool report.\n\nThe fracas overshadowed the return of reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had 36 points on 12-of-29 shooting and dished out nine assists in 34 minutes. Gilgeous-Alexander sat out the overtime period because he had reached his minutes limit after missing the previous nine games because of an abdominal strain suffered Feb. 3.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was called for a technical foul in the first quarter when he responded to Jokic's post-whistle contact by throwing the ball at him. James Williams told the pool reporter that Jokic was not called for a technical on that play because the officials determined that his contact with his left forearm did not rise to the level of an unsportsmanlike act.\n\n\"They're obviously a high-level team, we're a high-level team, and we've seen each other a lot in the past couple of years, so we might be a little bit more into the game just because we know the opponent,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"It was fun. It was good out there. End-of-season basketball is like that. It's that chippy, that physical, so it was good to get one of those in the regular season.\"\n\nThe Nuggets fell to 4-7 since Jokic returned from a monthlong absence, including 1-6 in clutch games (within five points in the final five minutes) during that span. Jokic recorded his league-leading 22nd triple-double with 23 points, 17 rebounds and 14 assists against the Thunder, but his uncharacteristic recent shooting struggles continued, as he went 9-of-25 from the floor and 2-of-10 from 3-point range.\n\nJokic, who was 3-of-5 from the free throw line, animatedly protested no-calls after several of his shots. There were also multiple instances of Jokic bumping and shoving with Thunder players during the game.\n\n\"I think his frustration is sometimes because the game's officiated differently out on the floor than it is near the basket, and I think he was reacting to what was being done to him,\" Nuggets coach David Adelman said. \"And his reaction's not going to be to cower away. He's competitive. ... I know why he's frustrated. I can feel his frustration with all the contact out there. He shot five free throws.\n\n\"It's just part of the game. The closer you get to the basket, it seems like for a bigger guy, it seems like it's called a little bit different, but he has to react to that the right way. Concentrate and finish through contact. And obviously with Dort's play, I think that took it to a different level for him. He felt like it was malicious, also.\"\n\nThe Nuggets and Thunder meet again March 9 in Oklahoma City."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nBOSTON -- The Celtics have been one of the NBA's hottest teams since returning from the All-Star break.\n\nThey can add one of the best offensive performances in league history to their list of accomplishments as they await a possible return of star Jayson Tatum to action.\n\nBoston shot a season-high 66.7% (52-of-78) from the field in their 148-111 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Friday. Including the playoffs, it was the club's third-highest percentage in a game in the shot clock era (since 1954-55), behind 67.9% in 1984 and 67.0% in 1990, according to ESPN Research.\n\nThe Celtics also shot 64.7% from the 3-point line Friday, which equated to an 80.8% effective field goal percentage -- the highest in the shot clock era. Effective field goal percentage measures shooting efficiency by adjusting for the fact that 3-pointers are worth more than two-point shots\n\nAll-Star Jaylen Brown led the way, finishing with 28 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. But he got plenty of support from his teammates, with trade deadline acquisition Nikola Vucevic adding 28 points and 11 rebounds for his third double-double as a member of the Celtics.\n\n\"I thought we just did a good job reading the game,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"I thought we made the right reads throughout most of the entire game. I thought tonight Vooch really looked comfortable in his offensive reads and his offensive screening. He unlocked a lot of stuff for us.\"\n\nAll 13 Celtics players scored, with Boston committing only three turnovers after halftime.\n\n\"We just try to read the game and take what's there,\" Brown said.\n\nBoston, winners of five of its six games since the All-Star break, will wait to see if Sunday night's home matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers will mark the return of Tatum.\n\nThe game, originally scheduled to be played earlier in the day, was moved by NBC into an 8 p.m. ET prime-time slot, creating speculation it could signal Tatum's plan to return.\n\nIt's been 41 weeks since Tatum ruptured his right Achilles tendon in May in the waning minutes of the Celtics' loss to the New York Knicks in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe Celtics are required by the NBA to release an initial injury report by 5 p.m. ET on Saturday ahead of Sunday's home game against the 76ers.\n\nAfter practicing with the Celtics' G League team two weeks ago, Tatum said he hadn't decided whether he would return.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that I'm coming back or I'm not, it's just following the plan. So it's just another step,\" Tatum said. \"I don't know percentage. I just know I feel a little bit better every day. I just try to focus on that.\"\n\nTatum said in the same interview that he is also mindful of not wanting to disrupt the progress of a Celtics team that at 39-20 sits in second place in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\n\"I'm just hyper aware of what's going on. I think it would just stem from that. Obviously, I know what I bring to the table and bring to the team. But I'm also aware that these guys have been playing extremely well,\" Tatum said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Former Miami offensive lineman Francis Mauigoa has heard the buzz about teammate Rueben Bain Jr.'s supposed short arm length here at the NFL combine.\n\nAnd as far as Mauigoa is concerned, he doesn't want to hear it. In fact, it is Miami's pair of defensive ends, Bain and Akheem Mesidor, who have helped Mauigoa develop into the force he's become, he said.\n\n\"Nobody comes close to what we got,\" Mauigoa said when asked about his toughest matchups last season. \"I mean, Rueben Bain and Akheem Mesidor, they gave me all the work. They built who I am right now.\"\n\nMauigoa, the projected first offensive lineman to be selected in the April draft, helped anchor a dominant Miami offensive line. But their unit was rivaled by their own team's defensive line, headlined by Bain and Mesidor.\n\nBain has been the subject of some debate at the combine because of his arm length, measured at 30⅞ inches. That's much shorter than teams prefer for the position, but it shouldn't be a factor in evaluating one of the most dominant players in the country in 2025, Mauigoa said.\n\n\"That don't matter,\" he said. \"I mean, if you look at the tape, it doesn't matter... Rueben Bain, he's got that mentality. He's got that heart to do whatever it takes.\"\n\nAs for the practice matchups between the Miami lines, Mauigoa borrowed an analogy from his head coach.\n\n\"Every day, we're going head-to-head,\" he said. \"Like coach [Mario] Cristobal said in one of his interviews, it's like Jurassic Park.\"\n\nAs for his own prospects, Mauigoa said he'd like to be the first lineman selected and believes his willingness to play any position will help in that endeavor.\n\nMauigoa is a candidate to play tackle or guard in the NFL, something he said teams have discussed with him during his combine interviews. He responded by explaining that he would embrace the idea and had requested his college offensive line coach give him practice reps at guard in preparation for the possibility.\n\n\"They all talked to me about how do I feel if I move to guard,\" he said. \"And it's the same thing. I mean, Coach [Alex] Mirabel can attest. I asked Coach Mirabal if I can get some reps at guard. I already know I'm going to play right tackle [at Miami], but for the next level, I mean, I'm not sure. If they want me at whatever position, I'm going to do it. And like I said, it's five positions. I'll make sure I take one of them.\""

Spohr was killed, and Wood survived, though she died a year after the shooting.\n\nPlacer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said in a statement Friday that Spohr and Wood were loving grandparents and that Serafini's crimes greatly impacted family members and friends.\n\n\"The impact of this attack has extended far beyond the immediate victims, deeply affecting family members and the broader community, and highlighting the lasting harm caused by deliberate violence,\" Gire said.\n\nSerafini's attorney did not return requests for comment.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Serafini addressed the court and maintained his innocence, according to MyNews4. He said he was out partying with his wife the night of the shooting and described himself as a \"broken, imperfect man that makes mistakes.\"\n\nSerafini was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 1992. In a career spanning 11 years, the left-hander played for the Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies.\n\nProsecutors said Serafini hated his wife's wealthy parents and was heard saying he was willing to pay $20,000 to have them killed, according to the Sacramento Bee. Prosecutors showed jurors transcripts of angry emails and text messages between Serafini and his in-laws.\n\nDuring the six-week trial, Serafini's attorney, David Dratman, argued that there was no physical evidence linking his client to the crime scene. Dratman told the jury that although Serafini had a rocky relationship with his in-laws, he did not have a motive to kill them.\n\nAfter his conviction, Serafini filed multiple motions for a new trial, but those were denied.\n\nSerafini will serve his sentence at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the Placer County District Attorney's Office."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Convenor of DYMOG, Edward Seyram Tuttor.\n\nA coalition of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) has called on President John Mahama to declare a state of emergency over the escalating illegal mining crisis, insisting that the government’s anti-galamsey taskforce has failed to deliver results.\n\nThe protest, led by the FixTheCountry Movement and supported by groups such as the Dynamic Youth Movement of Ghana (DYMOG), took place on Friday, February 27, 2026, and coincided with the President’s State of the Nation Address to Parliament. The demonstrators, who later presented a petition at the Ministry of Interior in Accra, say the fight against galamsey has stalled despite earlier assurances.\n\nIn an interview with JoyNews, DYMOG convenor Edward Seyram Tuttor did not mince words. “Our demand is just one, that galamsey must stop now,” he said. “As we speak, NAIMOS has failed.”\n\nHe was referring to the National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS), the government’s anti-galamsey taskforce. According to him, when the President previously met with CSOs, NAIMOS had promised decisive action.\n\n“When the president met with CSOs, NAIMOS was clear that we’re going to smoke out galamsey’s campaign financiers and labourers,” he recalled. “But as we speak, looking at what happened at Hwediem in the Asutifi constituency alone, it tells us that whatever is in the bush, the military cannot handle it.”\n\nFor DYMOG, the situation has moved beyond routine enforcement.\n\n“So we need the President to trigger his emergency powers under Article 31,” Tuttor stressed. “Article 31 says that whenever anything that sustains life comes under threat and is harmful to life, the president must invoke the emergency powers.”\n\nHe argued that illegal mining poses a direct threat to water, food security and public health.\n\n“If galamsey fails, potable water is affected. If galamsey fails, the food that we eat, our staples, are under attack. If galamsey fails, the health implications are with the citizens,” he said.\n\nListing the potential consequences, he warned of “kidney failure, acute liver issues, brain damage, and even the attack on fetuses during pregnancy.”\n\n“All of that is an attack on the citizens,” he added. “So, for the welfare of the citizens, we are calling on the president to declare a state of emergency. Only he can declare, and he must do what the president of Ghana must do.”\n\nDYMOG also questioned the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) claims that it has deployed nano-ionic copper technology to cleanse polluted rivers.\n\n“The EPA is saying that they have a nano-ionic copper technology that can cleanse rivers,” Tuttor said. “From what we saw, it was not a river that they were actually piloting to cleanse. It was stagnant water.”\n\nHe dismissed the efficacy of the method against heavy metal contamination.\n\n“We all know from bioengineering that heavy metals like mercury, cyanide, arsenic and lead cannot be removed,” he argued. “The only thing it does is that it can help floating substances to subside, to make the water look clean, but it cannot.”\n\nIn a pointed remark directed at the EPA leadership, he added, “After that water has settled, she cannot drink it. And no medical practitioner will advise anybody to drink water that has been filtered through ionic aggregation.”\n\nThe DYMOG convenor further cited continued illegal mining activity across major water bodies as evidence that enforcement efforts have not succeeded.\n\n“Just yesterday, River Ankobra, we saw changfans over there. The Black Volta, changfans are on there. When you go to the River Bia, changfans are on there. Galamsey is still going on,” he said.\n\n“So the question is, where is NAIMOS? Where is that energy? Where is the reset?” he asked, referencing the government’s broader economic reform agenda.\n\n“If there’s a reset happening in the economy, but the reset is not affecting the fight against galamsey, then it means that the reset is not happening,” he argued.\n\nDYMOG also raised concerns about alleged complicity at the local government level.\n\n“It is a surprise that as we speak, the DCE for Amansie Central, who has been captured, that under his watch, money is being taken from galamseyers — 6,000 Ghana Cedis is being charged for changfan — that DCE is still at post,” Tuttor alleged.\n\n“Are we really serious about the fight against galamsey?” he asked. “Look, we are making a mockery of the fight against galamsey.”\n\nDYMOG has warned that if the President does not act decisively, the pressure will intensify.\n\n“If that is not done, we will keep protesting, and we will keep demanding that the right thing be done,” Tuttor declared.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Ghana's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has activated an emergency preparedness plan and begun a partial evacuation of its embassy in Tehran, as a joint US-Israeli military strike on Iran on Saturday triggered retaliatory missile attacks across the Gulf — putting Ghanaian nationals in Bahrain, Israel, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates directly in harm's way.\n\nIn an official press release issued on February 28, 2026, the Ministry said it was \"closely monitoring with serious concern the escalating hostilities in the Middle East\" and was already assessing whether full evacuations of Ghanaian nationals would be necessary.\n\n\"An emergency preparedness plan has been activated, and assessments are ongoing regarding the evacuation of Ghanaian nationals where necessary,\" the Ministry stated, adding that the Government had \"at this time initiated the evacuation of several staff of the Embassy of Ghana in Tehran, retaining essential personnel to coordinate assistance to Ghanaians in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\"\n\nThe Ministry urged all Ghanaian nationals across the affected countries to remain indoors, avoid large gatherings and sensitive locations, comply with directives from local authorities, keep travel documents accessible, and maintain contact with the nearest Ghanaian diplomatic mission.\n\nAll Ghanaians were also advised to avoid non-essential travel to and from the Middle East until further notice.\n\nOn February 28, the United States and Israel carried out a series of joint military strikes on Iran, with explosions reported in central Tehran.\n\nThe attacks followed the largest US military buildup in the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with two aircraft carriers — including the USS Gerald R. Ford — deployed to the region.\n\nIran's retaliation was swift and wide-ranging, targeting US military assets across the Gulf. The US Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the US Consulate in Dubai both issued shelter-in-place alerts for all staff, urging Americans in the UAE to take cover until further notice. Qatar, home to the US Central Command's regional headquarters at Al-Udeid Air Base, was among the hardest hit — and had already prompted Ghana's Doha Embassy to issue its own shelter-in-place advisory to Ghanaians earlier in the day.\n\nThis is not the first time Ghana has had to move fast to protect its citizens caught in the Iran-Israel conflict.\n\nWhen an earlier wave of hostilities escalated in June 2025, Ghana closed its Tehran embassy and successfully evacuated the first group of Ghanaian nationals to Turkey by June 20, 2025, following intense diplomatic engagements with both Iranian and Israeli ambassadors.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa personally coordinated that effort, covering Ghanaian diplomats, students, professionals, and other compatriots evacuated via land borders.\n\nGhanaians requiring emergency consular support may contact the Ministry on +233 240 913 284 or +233 240 793 072, or reach the Ghana Embassy in Israel on +972 54 931 6007.

            "content": "Ghana’s Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has intensified surveillance of industrial facilities across the country, introducing a real-time monitoring system aimed at cutting emissions and improving compliance with environmental standards.\n\nThe following mounting evidence suggests that air pollution remains one of Ghana’s most pressing public health threats. In 2019, the country’s annual average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 11 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s 2021 recommended guideline. Air pollution is now ranked as the second-highest health risk factor for death and disability in Ghana.\n\nAccording to Selina Amoah, Director of Air Quality at the EPA, industrial activities remain a major contributor to pollution levels.\n\n“Yes, the sources of air pollution in the country have been identified first from industrial activities,” she said in an interview. “Industrial activities making reference to both the formal and the informal industrial activities.”\n\nShe explained that emissions come from a wide range of operations: “If you take the cement industry, for instance, because it is gravel that they are grinding, the grinding of the gravel itself generates emissions.” She added that wood processing industries, boiler operations, generator sets, forklifts, spraying in metal fabrication and carpentry shops, and even small-scale food processors using firewood all release pollutants into the air.\n\nUnder Ghana’s updated Environmental Assessment Regulations, LI-2504, industries are required to obtain environmental permits and comply with strict conditions, including emissions monitoring.\n\n“As part of the permit conditions, they are required to conduct monitoring,” Amoah noted. “You may have the system in place. How do you know whether the system is working or is not working? It is only the data that can tell.”\n\nHowever, she acknowledged that previous monitoring systems had limitations. “The results that we get from industry is mostly passive,” she said. “Passive, I mean that by the time they bring the results to us, the pollution episode would have passed.”\n\nTo address this gap, the EPA has introduced the Ghana Online Continuous Emission Monitoring System (GOCEMS), which enables real-time tracking of emissions from industrial stacks.\n\n“This is a real-time monitoring from industrial operations,” Amoah explained. “And that gives the pollution levels as and when the activity is going on.”\n\nThe system allows regulators to detect spikes instantly and intervene quickly. “When you look at the results, and then you see the spikes, you can quickly check what is causing the pollution level,” she said, adding that timely mitigation measures can then be enforced.\n\nIndustry accounts for an estimated 11 per cent of air pollution in Accra, alongside emissions from road transport, open waste burning, biomass cooking, and energy generation. A World Bank report estimated that environmental degradation cost Ghana US$6.3 billion in 2017, about 11 per cent of GDP, with air pollution alone accounting for over US$2.4 billion.\n\nAlthough Ghana is one of only seven African countries with real-time air quality monitors, access to comprehensive data has remained limited. EPA officials believe GOCEMS marks a significant shift toward transparency, accountability, and proactive enforcement — a critical step in reducing industrial emissions and protecting public health.\n\nThis story was a collaboration with New Narratives.

It also indicated that only 17% used AI daily.\n\nMr Tsey indicated that there is significant excitement and curiosity across Africa regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to him, many employees are optimistic about how AI will transform the workplace. He explained that there is “a lot of excitement, a lot of curiosity, and a lot of positive feeling” about the impact AI will have on work.\n\nMeanwhile, the CEO of the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission, George Smith-Graham, emphasised that Ghana has reached a stage where AI is being adopted to enhance productivity within the public service.\n\nHe noted that if productivity improvements are not achieved through AI, the country risks paying employees who are not working as effectively as expected.\n\nDr. Smith-Graham further stressed that salary increases should no longer be automatic but must be directly linked to measurable productivity.\n\nAccording to him, Ghana has moved beyond the point where employees can simply demand salary increments without demonstrating improved performance. Instead, compensation growth must now be tied to increased efficiency and output, supported by AI adoption.\n\nHe said, “But what I take for me is that we've gotten to a stage where we are not going to just allow employees coming and just asking for salary increases. But we need to make sure that the increases are linked to productivity”\n\nThe survey also reveals that whilst AI introduces uncertainty, 64% of African workers feel confident in their job security.\n\nThe Forum debated how employers can proactively manage employee fears by investing in reskilling and upskilling programmes that enable workforce transformation without denting trust.\n\nWorkforce Transformation Africa Leader at PwC South Africa, Dr Dayalan Govender, advised leaders to understand their organisation.\n\nHe said, “What makes your employees tick? Next thing is, you get those millennials, or you get this Gen Z coming to your business. You know what they like? They like flexibility in terms of how they work. It's more output-driven. But we want to see your output.\"\n\nA Partner, Consulting and Risk Services at PwC Ghana, Winfred King, said leaders must be prepared to lead the change.\n\nHe outlined how leaders can effectively integrate upskilling, technology-driven transformation and human-centred approaches to build sustainable performance and ensure well-being across Africa’s diverse workforce.\n\nThe PwC Africa Workforce Hopes and Fears Survey Forum brought together leading voices from industry, academia, government and policy to explore how Africa can rewire the future of work in ways that deliver sustainable performance and build lasting trust at a time when Artificial intelligence and rapid technological acceleration are rewiring workplaces across Africa.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "An associate professor at the Department of Physics of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Professor Bright Kwakye-Awuah is raising scientific and cost concerns over the Environmental Protection Authority’s (EPA) technology to clean water bodies polluted by illegal mining activities.\n\nThe EPA on February 24, 2026, commenced a pilot application of the Copper-based nano liquid technology on the Birim River in the Eastern region.\n\nAfter days of the clean-up trial, the EPA released images of what appears to be a visibly clear state of the diverted and stagnant pool of the Birim River.\n\nBut a section of the public and local scientists critiqued the technology, with some doubting the feasibility of the trial in fighting the illegal mining menace.\n\nProfessor Bright Kwakye-Awuah, in the underlisted concerns, analyses the scientific and economic underpinnings of the technology while proffering viable solutions to restoring the polluted water bodies.\n\nIn his submission, Prof. Kwakye-Awuah explained that the scientific validity of the technology for polluted rivers, highlighting that the technology exhibits established antimicrobial and catalytic characteristics when applied under controlled parameters to facilitate flocculation – aggregation of dispersed particles to form larger clusters - or induce oxidative destabilisation of suspended particles.\n\nHowever, he believes rivers polluted by galamsey are multifaceted, involving extreme turbidity from clay and silt, a spectrum of dissolved and particulate heavy metals (including mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, and manganese), potential cyanide residues, high suspended solids, and disrupted hydrodynamics.\n\nWith copper itself being a heavy metal, and introducing copper nanoparticles into an open river system, he says, raises significant concerns regarding secondary contamination, bioaccumulation in aquatic life, sediment enrichment with copper, and long-term ecological risks.\n\n“While rapid water clarification may be observed, visual improvements do not equate to compliance with regulatory standards for dissolved heavy metals. The dynamic nature of river systems means nanoparticles may disperse downstream, accumulate in sediments, or become resuspended during flooding events,” he added.\n\nPro. Kwakye-Awuah elaborated that any of such intervention would require robust validation, including ICP-MS analysis of residual metals, total copper quantification, sediment and ecotoxicity studies, before they can be deemed scientifically sound.\n\n“Without comprehensive chemical and ecological assessments, the approach may yield superficial results rather than true environmental remediation,” he noted.\n\nWith the EPA estimating that $200,000 is needed per kilometre of the river for cleaning, Prof. Kwakye-Awuah suggests the real means to stop the pollution is to fight off the illegal miners.\n\n“This assumes homogenous contamination, uniform effectiveness, and a one-off treatment capable of resolving pollution permanently. However, if illegal mining persists upstream, continuous or repeated applications would be necessary, causing total costs to escalate well beyond initial projections.\n\nHe continued that: “A thorough economic evaluation should consider treatment durability, reapplication frequency, long-term environmental liabilities, ongoing monitoring, and sediment management. Addressing symptoms in the river, rather than eliminating pollution at its source, risks creating a cycle of recurring public expenditure without sustainable outcomes. Cost justification must therefore be grounded in long-term effectiveness and risk of recurrence, not solely on immediate visual results”.\n\nHe recommended some possible technology-based solutions to clean the river, other than the experimental copper-based nano liquid technology.\n\n“Treating river segments with chemical nano-dosing primarily addresses downstream symptoms, whereas source-based interventions target pollution at entry points prior to dispersion,” he noted.\n\nProf Kwakye-Awuah asserts that treatment technologies must aim at physically removing suspended solids and adsorption of dissolved heavy metals without introducing additional toxicants.\n\n“Modular deployment at pollution nodes, coupled with water recycling for operational reuse, creates a closed-loop system that minimises river discharge,” he added.\n\nHe continued that: “When enforced alongside the cessation of in-stream mining and a polluter-pays model (requiring miners to fund water treatment) the economic burden shifts from the public to those responsible for contamination”.\n\nBy focusing on discharge points rather than the entire river, he says, the treated volumes decrease, capital and operational costs are more manageable, and long-term sustainability is enhanced.\n\n“Over time, source containment with engineered adsorption and flotation proves more structurally and economically viable than ongoing, river-wide chemical dosing, particularly when ongoing contamination is anticipated,” he noted.\n\nIn conclusion, Prof Kwakye-Awuah believes restoring the degraded water bodies or any other natural resource must not introduce harmful measures.\n\n“Environmental restoration must not introduce new environmental hazards. Rivers are dynamic, living ecosystems whose water chemistry and/or biochemistry are different from non-laboratory systems. The deployment of copper nanoparticles in natural water bodies, absent comprehensive ecotoxicological validation, poses potential long-term risks,” he noted.\n\nHe continued that: “Effective remediation begins at the source of contamination. By intercepting pollution from illegal mining, treating it with advanced adsorption and flotation systems, and responsibly reusing treated water, we can safeguard our rivers without imposing further chemical burdens. Ghana must prioritise science-based, economically sound, and ecologically responsible solutions to ensure the preservation of our rivers for future generations.”.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Their leader, Sergeant Adjetey, explained their mission, but the British officer insisted they leave the petition with him—an offer they rejected, insisting on seeing the governor in person.\n\n\n\nTensions escalated when the officer ordered one of his men to open fire. When the subordinate refused, the officer seized the rifle and shot into the unarmed crowd, killing Private Odartey Lamptey, Corporal Attipoe, and Sergeant Adjetey.\n\n\n\n“I narrowly escaped death. If the bullet had missed Sergeant Adjetey, I would have been the next victim,” he recalled.\n\n\n\nHe also shared the broader trauma endured by Ghanaian veterans men who fought for the British Empire abroad, only to return home to hardship, neglect, and broken promises.\n\n\n\nThe February 28 Shooting became a catalyst for widespread riots and political agitation, accelerating the push toward Ghana’s independence and cementing the ex-servicemen’s legacy in the nation’s history.\n\n\n\nWatch the video below\n\n\n\nDetails of February 28 shooting – WWII tells it all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRA/EB\n\n\n\nWatch NPP MPs in all-black as President Mahama delivers 2026 SONA"

Partial relief is expected within one to two weeks as works around Berth 14 are finalised.\n\n\n\nOfosu-Adjare, addressing the gathering, emphasised that port inefficiencies directly increase production costs, which can translate into higher cement prices.\n\n\n\n“If we want good prices, we must also perform our part of the bargain to ensure that production costs remain efficient,” she said.\n\n\n\nKofi Nsiah-Poku, President of the Association of Ghana Industries, praised the Ministers’ proactive approach but cautioned that until dredging and interim measures fully take effect, continued congestion could place pressure on cement costs for consumers."

Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "Tehran, Iran – Iranians are being directly addressed by leaders inside and outside the country after the United States and Israel launched attacks across Iran, prompting Tehran to respond with a wave of ongoing missile and drone attacks across the region.\n\n“In light of the continued joint operations by the US and the Zionist regime against Tehran and several other major cities, if possible while remaining calm, please travel to other centres and cities where it is feasible for you to do so,” read a text message sent to the 10 million residents of Tehran by the government on Saturday afternoon.\n\nAll outbound roads from the capital were heavily congested with traffic from the morning, shortly after the US and Israel began joint strikes that targeting more than 20 of Iran’s 32 provinces.\n\nInside Tehran, people also formed long queues in front of petrol stations, even as government authorities emphasised that they remain in control, saying that food and fuel supplies would not be a problem and that contingency plans were in motion.\n\nAuthorities also accommodated civilians trying to exit the city, including by setting up roadside refuelling stations. Many families were headed to three provinces to the north near the Caspian Sea, as they did during the 12-day war with Israel.\n\nLast June, during the war, US President Donald Trump issued a direct warning telling all Tehran citizens to immediately evacuate.\n\nBut in a video message released shortly after the strikes began on Saturday, he urged the Iranian people to stay in their homes and wait for a suitable time to rise up and overthrow the theocratic establishment governing Iran since a 1979 Islamic revolution. He framed it as “probably your only chance for generations”.\n\n\n\nSimilar sentiments were echoed in separate video messages released by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the US-backed shah who was overthrown by clerics led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini during the revolution.\n\n“Be vigilant and prepared so that at an appropriate time, which I will inform you precisely, you return to the streets for the final effort,” Pahlavi said.\n\nThis was in reference to nationwide protests that gripped Iran in January, during which thousands of civilians were killed, many on the nights of January 8 and 9.\n\nIranian authorities claim that civilians were killed by “terrorists” and “rioters” armed, funded and trained by the US and Israel. But the United Nations and international human rights organisations have blamed state forces for an unprecedented crackdown against peaceful protesters, and say tens of thousands have been incarcerated and some face execution.\n\nStudent protests also took place last week in Tehran and major cities, including the holy Shia city of Mashhad to the northeast and Shiraz to the south of Iran. A number of students were suspended, while others were arrested or summoned by intelligence authorities.\n\nUniversities and schools were declared closed after the strikes on Saturday until further notice, according to a directive by the Supreme National Security Council. Most had already been moved online until the end of the Iranian calendar year on March 20 in response to the unrest at other universities.\n\nBut dozens of people, many of them children, were killed after two schools were hit in southern Iran’s Minab and in Tehran.\n\nState media showed paramilitary Basij members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) patrolling the streets of downtown Tehran on Saturday afternoon on motorcycles and vehicles and waving flags.\n\nA similar gathering was recorded in Palestine Square, where pro-state groups shouted “Death to America” and “Death to Israel”.\n\nIranians forced into another internet blackout\n\nThe opening salvo in Tehran targeted the Pasteur neighbourhood in the downtown area, where government offices are located.\n\nA satellite image and videos of the area showed that the compound housing the offices of the supreme leader was largely destroyed in the strikes. It was not immediately clear if Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was present at the time of the attack, but the foreign minister later told NBC News that Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian were alive “as far as I know”.\n\n\n\nMinutes after the start of the war, Iranian authorities began shutting down internet connections and mobile phone connections across multiple areas of Tehran. Some mobile connectivity was restored, but the internet shutdown was expanded across the country, with almost all traffic blocked and leaving only few proxy connections working to access the global internet.\n\nThe Islamic Republic had imposed an unprecedented 20-day total internet shutdown in January, and heavy state filtering was in place prior to the shutdown on Saturday.\n\nIranian authorities urged citizens on Saturday to only follow official state media, to report any suspicious activity, and to refrain from collaborating with “enemies” on pain of heavy punishment.\n\nAs daylight waned, Tehran’s streets emptied, but the sounds of explosions continued to ring loud."

            "content": "US, Israel launch attacks on Iran in a move that risks destabilising the Middle East.\n\nAs soon as a truce that ended a 12-day assault on Iran took effect in June last year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared victory, saying Israeli attacks had sent Tehran’s nuclear programme “to oblivion”.\n\nNearly nine months later, Iran is facing another assault, with both Israel and the United States launching attacks and saying they are seeking regime change in Tehran in a major escalation that could destabilise the entire Middle East.\n\nSaturday’s assault came amid negotiations with the US over Iran’s nuclear programme. At the end of a third round of nuclear talks in Geneva on Thursday, Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Albusaidi, acting as a mediator, announced that “significant progress” had been achieved and said technical talks were expected to resume on Monday.\n\n“Iran has agreed to give up its stockpile of enriched material – zero accumulation and allow for full verification by the IAEA of its nuclear programme,” CBS News reported, quoting Albusaidi as saying. “With zero stockpiling, it becomes impossible to build a bomb regardless of enrichment levels,” he added, according to CBS.\n\nTehran, a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, has repeatedly said its nuclear programme was intended for civilian purposes and it has no intention to build atomic weapons.\n\nNetanyahu has been calling for military action to destroy Iran’s nuclear capabilities, saying that Tehran’s atomic facilities constitute an existential threat to Israel.\n\nUS and Israeli officials have said the attacks on Saturday targeted Iranian officials, missile storage and launching sites, and Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\n\n\nIranian media reported strikes on the Ministry of Intelligence, the Ministry of Defence, the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran and the Parchin military complex.\n\nIran responded with attacks on Israel, as well as on bases used by the US military across the Gulf region, including in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nNegotiations under threat\n\nNetanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s history, has long built his career around an objective of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nIn 2015, he vehemently opposed a nuclear deal that then US President Barack Obama had reached, together with Western allies, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which imposed curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for easing of sanctions imposed on Tehran.\n\nTrump officially withdrew from the agreement in 2018, calling it a horrible deal, and reimposed sanctions on Tehran as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign to force Iran to renegotiate the deal.\n\nNetanyahu found his opportunity to move against Tehran after Trump won his second term in office. With Israel embroiled in its genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza following the October 7, 2023, raid on Israel, Netanyahu, with a green light from the United States, launched his attack on Iran on June 13, 2025. The US briefly joined in the campaign, bombing several nuclear facilities.\n\nAlthough Trump had proclaimed that US strikes had destroyed Iran’s nuclear capabilities, he had pushed for Iran to completely dismantle its nuclear programme, a demand Tehran rejects.\n\nThe US has amassed its biggest military arsenal in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the world’s biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford.\n\nAnalysts say that while Trump had spoken about the need to ensure that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon, Netanyahu was pushing for Tehran to agree to negotiate its missile capabilities, including reducing their range to a “300-kilometre (185-mile) red line”.\n\nNetanyahu also demanded that the United States push Tehran to stop supporting proxy allies in the Middle East, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.\n\nWhile Israel says it emerged from the 12-day war in June with a strategic victory, Iranian missiles also inflicted heavy damage on Israeli cities. Up to 33 people were killed in the attacks, compared with more than 600 Iranians, while more than 3,000 others were hospitalised.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nWhile it is clear that Iran’s military capabilities do not compare with those of the United States and Israel, it is too early to predict how this confrontation will end.\n\n\n\nUS officials have been wary of the possibility of being drawn into a prolonged conflict in the Middle East, like the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Trump had criticised as a “disastrous mistake”, while Iranian officials have said that the US would find itself in a quagmire if it attacked.\n\nThe Washington Post has reported that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine had warned him of potential risks of attacking Iran, including becoming entangled in a prolonged conflict and the possibility of US casualties.\n\nOn Thursday, Vice President JD Vance was quoted by The Washington Post as saying that there is “no chance” that US strikes on Iran would result in the United States becoming involved in a years-long, drawn-out war.\n\n“The idea that we’re going to be in a Middle Eastern war for years with no end in sight — there is no chance that will happen,” Vance said on Thursday, according to the outlet."

Villarreal remain a distant third on 51.\n\nYamal put the ‌hosts ahead in the 28th minute after Fermin Lopez robbed Pape Gueye and slipped a pass down the right for the 18-year-old to finish low inside the left post.\n\nHe doubled the lead nine minutes later with ⁠a dazzling solo run, controlling ⁠a long ball on the right wing before cutting inside past Sergi Cardona and Alvaro Moleiro to curl an ⁠unstoppable shot into the top corner.\n\nGueye pulled one back from ⁠close range in the 49th ⁠minute, but Villarreal missed chances to equalise and paid the price as Yamal completed his hat-trick in the 69th minute ‌with another counterattack.\n\nRobert Lewandowski came off the bench to add a fourth in added ‌time, ‌tapping in from Jules Kounde’s low cross from the right.\n\nLamal said he was delighted personally and for the team with the win.\n\n“I think Villarreal are a really good team, who are third [in the standings]. I am very happy with our win and my goals,” he told reporters after the game.\n\nAsked about his spectacular second goal, he said, “When I have the ball, I decide where we are going, so I waited for the defender to go one way and I went the other.”"

            "content": "The Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s automated alert system is online and already bombarding astronomers with things to look at in the night sky. The system went live publicly on Tuesday, February 24th, and on the first night dropped some 800,000 alerts about asteroids, supernovas, and feasting black holes. And that number is only expected to climb to the multiple millions per night.\n\nThe observatory released the first images taken with its car-sized Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) camera in June of last year. But researchers and stargazers have been eagerly anticipating the launch of this system. Every night, the camera captures about 1,000 images and then compares those against a reference image taken when the telescope first went online. Differences are automatically flagged, and an algorithm can distinguish between potential supernovas and approaching asteroids to send alerts to interested parties, all in just a matter of minutes. This means scientists can quickly turn their attention to fleeting celestial events.\n\nThankfully, the alerts aren’t all-or-nothing. They can be filtered by event type, brightness, or even the number of events within a given time period. That should help keep researchers from becoming overwhelmed by alerts as the Rubin Observatory ramps up the rate of discoveries."

            "content": "Here’s what we can tell you. If you’re thinking of picking up the Galaxy S26 Ultra at launch, putting in your preorder now isn’t a bad idea. It’s also a great time to pick up the midrange QuietComfort Headphones and what many of us at The Verge consider to be the game of 2024: Astro Bot. And who doesn’t want to save on a slick handheld vac?\n\nNow let’s get to it.\n\nIf you’re craving a little peace and quiet, Bose’s QuietComfort Headphones are currently on sale at Amazon in multiple colors for $199 ($150 off), which is the best price we’ve seen this year.\n\nThe standard QC Headphones are essentially a refresh of the last-gen QC45s with some new software tricks, including the ability to adjust noise cancellation levels and set custom listening modes. That being the case, you still get up to 24 hours of battery life, excellent comfort, and multipoint support, making it easy to switch between Bluetooth devices on the fly. They lack Bose’s immersive audio mode and the higher-quality Bluetooth found in the newer QC Ultras, though, as well as support for lossless audio over USB-C. Then again, that probably shouldn’t come as a surprise given they’re retailing for $250 less.\n\nAs we alluded to earlier, Samsung announced its Galaxy S26 lineup this week. There are already plenty of preorder deals to consider, but one of the best comes courtesy of Amazon, which is throwing in a $200 gift card alongside a free storage upgrade when you preorder the 512GB Galaxy S26 Ultra starting at $1,299.99. Other retailers are also running promos ahead of the phone’s March 11th release date, mind you, though they’re not as impressive; Best Buy is only providing a free storage upgrade, while Samsung is offering a mere $150 in credit.\n\nWhile the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus both feel like underwhelming, iterative updates, the 6.9-inch Galaxy S26 Ultra actually impressed our resident phone reviewer, Allison Johnson. That’s largely because of the new Privacy Display, which can help shield your screen from people sitting near you (if desired), and a more powerful camera array that should improve low-light performance. Plus, like the rest of the S26 lineup, the Ultra is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, which supports more advanced generative AI tools and a souped-up version of Gemini that can carry out certain tasks in third-party apps on your behalf. No one likes calling an Uber themselves, anyway.\n\nYou can still grab a physical copy of Astro Bot at Walmart for $32.99 ($27 off), an all-time low. The fantastic PlayStation 5 exclusive — which won Game of the Year at the 2024 Game Awards — has players take on the role of Astro, a lovable robot who sets off on a space adventure after his crew is lost in a sudden attack. Despite the prior game being a pack-in title for the PS5, Team Asobi’s full-sized sequel brims with inventive platforming, whimsical power-ups, and a kind of lighthearted fun that recalls the best of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon. Thankfully, it never feels outdated, even if ‘90s vibes are totally there.\n\nIf you’re looking for a relatively compact handheld vacuum that can reach into car crevices and suck up crumbs on your desk, Fanttik’s foldable Fold V10 Apex is still on sale at Amazon for $85.49 (about $65 off), matching its best price to date.\n\nFanttik’s 17,000Pa vac features an extendable nozzle that pivots up to 210 degrees, along with a built-in LED light to help illuminate the dark corners of your vehicle. An onboard display, meanwhile, indicates the remaining battery life and suction mode, as well as the status of the washable filter. It also comes with a range of useful add-ons, including an upholstery tool, two brush heads, and an extendable hose with a crevice tool for hard-to-reach areas. It even charges via USB-C, making it easy to juice after the battery runs out in about 30 minutes or so.\n\nMore ways to save this weekend\n\nsecond-gen AirTags for $99.99 ($24 off) at You can pick up fivefor $99.99 ($24 off) at Costco , though non-members will have to pay a $5 surcharge. That’s the first discount we’ve seen on Apple’s latest location tracker, which builds upon its predecessor with an upgraded ultra-wideband chip and extended range, allowing for more precise tracking from up to 50 percent farther away. It’s also better at locating items in multi-story homes, and the built-in speaker is up to 50 percent louder, making it easier to hear.

The 1440p display is a great entry-level OLED, with a sharp 16:9 panel and a speedy 240Hz refresh rate. As a QD-OLED monitor, it delivers the deep blacks and vibrant colors the technology is known for, along with G-Sync compatibility to help reduce screen tearing. It also includes a three-year warranty for added peace of mind.\n\nSharge Pixel 100 from You can snag thefrom Amazon (with Prime) and Sharge for $69.90 ($30 off) right now, which is its lowest price to date. The small, retro-inspired GaN charger delivers up to 140W of power, which is enough to charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50 percent in about 25 minutes. It also features three USB-C ports for powering multiple devices, along with a customizable dot-matrix display that shows the real-time wattage for each port."

On one end of the tracker you’ll find an integrated metal loop that can be attached to a keyring or clipped to a carabiner without the need for an extra case.\n\nThe Xiaomi Tag is compatible with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub tracking networks and mobile apps, but not at the same time. You’ll need to choose one or the other during setup. Like Apple’s AirTag, the Xiaomi Tag is powered by a replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery good for up to a year of use, and boasts an IP67 dust and water resistance rating, so it can survive a short dunking. There are also NFC capabilities that others can use to load your contact details should they find a lost device with the tag attached.\n\nAlthough it doesn’t have a clip, the Xiaomi Tag has a metal loop on one end so you can attach it to other things without needing a case. Image: Xiaomi\n\nOne big differentiator is that unlike Apple’s AirTags, the Xiaomi Tag lacks ultra wideband (UWB) functionality for pinpointing its exact location. You’ll instead have to rely on audible alerts to locate it once you’re nearby. If that’s not a deal-breaker, the Xiaomi Tag will be a cheaper alternative to Apple’s AirTags, selling for £12.99 (around $18) each, or £44.99 (around $61) for a four-pack. A single second-gen AirTag is $29, or $99 for four."

            "content": "is a news editor with over a decade’s experience in journalism. He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nXiaomi and Leica’s long-running phone partnership just got a little closer. Alongside the new international release of its 17 Ultra flagship, Xiaomi has been entrusted with manufacturing a separate version that is the first Leica Leitzphone to release outside of Japan, following three Sharp-made models exclusive to the country.\n\nIn truth, the Leitzphone is a 17 Ultra with Leica branding and a rotatable camera ring, and apart from a few design tweaks, it’s mostly the same as the Leica Edition of that phone already available in China. But the branding is a big deal: Leica hasn’t let Xiaomi use its red dot logo on hardware until now, even though the companies have partnered on Xiaomi’s flagship cameras since 2022. The jump to a fully Leica-branded phone is a vote of confidence from the camera company.\n\nAfter two weeks using the Leitzphone version of the 17 Ultra, it’s clear that confidence was well placed. This is my favorite phone of 2026 so far, Leica logo or not, though most buyers would be better off saving money with the standard 17 Ultra.\n\nThe 17 Ultra and its original Leica Edition launched in China on December 25th, 2025. The international version and the Leitzphone were launched at Xiaomi’s pre-MWC press conference in Barcelona on February 28th, alongside the regular Xiaomi 17. The 17 Ultra starts from £1,299 / €1,499 (about $1,750) with 512GB storage, rising by £400 / €700 for the Leica version. That’s a hefty premium, but there are a few differences from the regular 17 Ultra.\n\nLet’s start with the Leica of it all. It’s obvious first and foremost in the design: an ever-so-slightly glossy black finish on the back, an industrial touch in the knurled aluminum-alloy edges, and Leica’s red dot logo in one corner. It’s a slightly different design to the 17 Ultra Leica Edition that released in China at the end of December, which has a two-tone finish and orients the Leica logo the other way. It also ships with branded accessories, including a faux leather case with a Leica lens cap, a microfiber cleaning cloth, and a bright red wrist strap.\n\nThe Leica logo isn’t just printed on; that lettering is raised metal. The textured edges make the phone more grippy, even without a case. My favorite accessory by far is this case, which preserves the red dot logo and adds a lens cap.\n\nOther changes run through the software. While both versions of the 17 Ultra run Xiaomi’s HyperOS 3, based on Android 16, the Leitzphone’s interface has been customized. There are dedicated Leica widgets, including photo galleries and a golden-hour timer, and custom monochrome app icons for the most popular apps from Xiaomi and third parties — which look great when you first turn the phone on, but less so once they’re mixed in with all the non-monochromatic apps you’ll inevitably download from elsewhere.\n\nLeica and Xiaomi’s design languages coexist in the camera app.\n\nMost of the customization is in the camera. There’s an expanded array of Leica filters, and the interface uses Leica fonts and red as its accent color, instead of Xiaomi’s usual yellow. A new Leica Essential shooting mode lets you pick between two camera simulations: a color re-creation of the M9 and a monochromatic take on the M3. The Leitzphone also adds the option to enable C2PA content credentials on every shot you take.\n\nNone of this is as novel as the Leitzphone’s unique hardware feature: a rotatable camera ring. The edge of the camera island can be twisted round, with a satisfying haptic buzz to emulate the feel of gears clicking. It makes for an excellent fidget spinner, though its real purpose is to control zoom in the camera app, or cycle through exposure settings or filters if you prefer.\n\nThe metal rim of the camera island is the part that twists round.\n\nThis sounds like a great idea, and it’s something I’ve wanted to see on more phones since spotting it on Nubia’s Focus 2 Ultra. In practice, it’s not that useful. The camera island may be enormous by phone standards, but it would be small on a real camera, and it’s too flush against the body to hold comfortably. I’ve had to force myself to use the camera ring to zoom, finding the onscreen controls quicker and more natural every time. Perhaps with persistence I could drill it in my muscle memory; for now, I mostly rotate it by accident and get annoyed when I do.\n\nThe addition of the zoom ring makes sense given the 17 Ultra’s headline photography feature: a telephoto with continuous optical zoom. While Xiaomi’s 15 Ultra featured two telephoto cameras, the 17 Ultra combines them into one. (The company skipped 16 to catch up with Apple.) A single 1/1.4-inch type 200-megapixel sensor is paired with a Leica APO zoom lens that covers 3.2-4.3x magnification — the equivalent of 75-100mm — adjusting the aperture from f/2.39-2.96 as it goes.\n\nThe obvious criticism is the same we levied at Sony’s Xperia 1 IV, which boasted continuous 3.5-5.2x zoom: This is too short a spread to make much difference. It’s rare that the framing of a photo changes drastically as you move through the range, and outside those limits you’re back to the same digital zoom and sensor cropping that every other phone offers.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 20 I took all of these photos using the 17 Ultra’s telephoto camera.\n\nPhotos are excellent. The large sensor delivers natural bokeh, along with macro support at a minimum distance of 30cm. It can handle challenging lighting conditions, with good results in dim light — though it did once struggle with the inverse, blowing out highlights on an especially bright day. Mostly I’ve shot exclusively on the Leica Authentic mode — the other option being Leica Vibrant — which I like for its filmic qualities, preserving more of the highlights and shadows than most phones and avoiding the flattened sheen of excessive HDR.\n\nThe other lenses are just as impressive, though I do find myself defaulting to the telephoto. The main camera has a large 1-inch-type sensor, and the same 50-megapixel resolution as the ultrawide and selfie camera. It’s one of the first phones to include a LOFIC (lateral overflow integration capacitor) sensor, which expands the dynamic range for highlights, helping me take some of the most dramatic skyline shots I’ve managed on a phone, and contributing to excellent performance in nighttime shots with bright lights.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14 These are a mix of photos from the other lenses.\n\nDespite the Leica logo, this isn’t just a camera. The Leitzphone has all of the flagship specs you’d expect: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, 16GB of RAM (in this economy?!) and 1TB of storage (with an option for 512GB on the regular 17 Ultra), a 6.9-inch 1-120Hz LTPO OLED display, and IP68 protection.\n\nThe battery is another standout feature. The 6,000mAh silicon-carbon cell isn’t the biggest around, and is smaller than the phone’s Chinese edition, but it’s still impressive. Even powering a demanding phone with a big display, I’ve usually been able to just about get two days of use from it between charges, though with very little left in the tank afterwards. 90W PPS wired charging and 50W wireless top it back up fast, though you’ll be limited to slow Qi speeds over third-party wireless chargers, and there’s no support for the magnetic Qi2 standard.\n\nThis is my favorite phone of the year so far.\n\nThe biggest problem the Leitzphone has is that it’s mostly a more expensive version of the 17 Ultra, which shares most of its best features. I prefer the look of the Leitzphone, and like a few of the Leica-specific shooting styles and the included case. But those aren’t worth £200, and the rotatable camera ring isn’t either. Unless that little red dot is very dear to your heart, there’s not quite enough reason to shell out extra for it — but mostly because the 17 Ultra is such a good phone in its own right.\n\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nAgree to Continue: Xiaomi 17 Ultra Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.

He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nXiaomi has just given a global launch to two of its latest flagship phones, the Xiaomi 17 and 17 Ultra, along with a Leica-branded Leitzphone edition of the Ultra. There’s no sign, however, of the 17 Pro, which launched in China with an additional display mounted next to the rear cameras.\n\nThe 17 and 17 Ultra will apparently be available soon in the UK, Europe, and select other markets. The 17 — pitched as a rival to the likes of the iPhone 17 and Samsung Galaxy S26 — will cost £899 / €999 (about $1,200), while the larger and more capable Ultra starts from £1,299 / €1,499 ($1,750). The limited-edition Leitzphone will be substantially more expensive at £1,699 / €1,999 ($2,300), though it includes 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, along with a few extra accessories.\n\nI like the simple, sleek aesthetic of the phone. The 6.3-inch display isn’t tiny, but it does make the phone small by modern standards. All three of the phone’s rear cameras are 50-megapixel.\n\nThe 17 is an extremely capable small-ish flagship, with a 6.3-inch OLED display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and large 6,330mAh silicon-carbon battery (though sadly smaller than the 7,000mAh version launched in China). I won’t be writing a full review of the 17, but did spend a week using it as my main phone, and found that the battery cruised past the full-day mark, though wasn’t quite enough for two full days of my typical usage. That’s far better battery life than you’d find in similarly sized phones from Apple, Samsung, or Google.\n\nThe cameras impress too, with 50-megapixel sensors behind each of the four lenses, selfie included. Pound for pound, you won’t find many better camera systems in any phone this size.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 10 I’ve been largely impressed by the Xiaomi 17’s cameras.\n\nThe Ultra, unsurprisingly, takes things to another level. It’s much larger, with a 6.9-inch display, and weighs a hefty 218g. Despite that, the 6,000mAh is actually smaller, though I found it delivered pretty similar longevity.\n\nThe 17 Ultra is larger in just about every respect, but strangely has a smaller battery.\n\nThe enormous camera is, as ever for Xiaomi’s Ultra phones, the highlight. There are 50-megapixel sensors for each of the main, ultrawide, and selfie cameras, with a large 1-inch-type sensor behind the primary lens. The periscope telephoto is even more impressive: 200-megapixel resolution, a large 1/1.4-inch sensor, and continuous optical zoom from 3.2x to 4.3x, the equivalent of 75-100mm. Xiaomi isn’t the first to pull off a true zoom phone — Sony’s Xperia 1 IV got there first in 2022 — but the telephoto camera here is far more capable than that phone’s, with natural bokeh and impressive performance even in low light.\n\nThis is the Leica-branded Leitzphone version of the 17 Ultra.\n\nThe camera capabilities are supported by Xiaomi’s ongoing photography partner Leica, but it’s the pair’s Leitzphone that really emphasizes that. Slightly redesigned from the 17 Ultra Leica Edition that was released in China last December, this includes Leica branding across the hardware and software, a range of Leica filters and shooting styles, and a rotatable rear camera ring that can be used to control the zoom. It’s the first Leica Leitzphone produced by Xiaomi — after a trio of Japan-only Sharp models — and comes with additional branded accessories, including a case with a lens cap and a microfiber cleaning cloth.\n\nXiaomi has plenty of other announcements alongside the 17 series phones at MWC this year, including a super-slim magnetic power bank, the Pad 8 and Pad 8 Pro tablets, and a smart tag that supports both Google and Apple’s tech-tracking networks.\n\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge"

            "content": "I never knew how easy it was to die in an orgy. But that’s just one of the many threats facing Geralt of Rivia in his latest adventure. The studio behind the Reigns series of Tinder-like choose-your-own-adventure games has now adapted The Witcher, following a handful of original titles and a take on Game of Thrones. And for Francois Alliot, creative director at Reigns studio Nerial, the series’ structure actually makes it an ideal way to ease players into sprawling fantasies like this. “There’s something about the way you can bring really complex universes, lore, and storylines to simple actions,” he says. “It can work in a lot of contexts.”\n\nWhat makes Reigns so approachable is the way it distills every action into a binary choice. As you play, you’re presented with cards, and you progress by either swiping right or left. In the case of The Witcher, for instance, an elf might ask Geralt for protection, and your options are simply to say either yes or no and then deal with the consequences. Each run through the game involves making a number of these decisions to progress a storyline until, well, you die.\n\nThe idea was for Reigns: The Witcher to work on two levels. For existing fans, it’s a fun way to play around and experiment in the world. “It’s not a new Witcher,” Alliot notes. “It’s a meta game around this universe, a bit like a fanfiction simulator.” But for those who might be intimidated by the franchise, which spans multiple books, games, and TV shows, it’s also a good place to start. “It works nicely as an entry point because you can really get a feel for the tone and rules, or lack of rules, of the world,” says narrative designer Oscar Harrington-Shaw. “But you’re not having to commit to a complex RPG.”\n\nThere are several aspects of the Reigns formula that had to be tweaked to work with The Witcher. One of the key conceits in the games is that you can die; in the original Reigns you played as a king, and when that was over you picked up as their successor. But that doesn’t really work when you’re playing a character like Geralt who can’t die. So you aren’t actually playing as Geralt; instead, you’re his bard pal Dandelion, singing tales of Geralt’s exploits that may or may not be true. This allowed the team at Nerial to “free ourselves from the lore,” as Alliot describes it, and have fun with things. This is especially apparent in the deaths, which come in the form of the aforementioned orgies or even from Geralt drinking himself to an early grave.\n\n“It really helped in two ways,” Harrington-Shaw says of coming up with the Dandelion idea, which came about from discussions with Witcher studio CD Projekt Red. “One is that it helps explain the loop; it gives a really neat end point. And we can have loads of fun deaths because it’s just a satisfying ending to a song. But we think it adds a really fun tension because you are playing as Geralt and you’re trying to survive, but you’re also trying to write good content.”\n\nImage: Devolver Digital\n\nAs I played, this setup made me much more open to experimenting. Instead of trying to roleplay as Geralt, I would often make odd choices just to see what happened. This, in turn, helps open up new storylines, giving some payoff for making the seemingly wrong decision. Even an early death can lead somewhere interesting in future runs.\n\nThe other notable addition in Reigns: The Witcher is a combat system. It wouldn’t be The Witcher if Geralt wasn’t slaying some monsters, but the idea of battles also had the potential to complicate the streamlined Reigns structure. The team settled on a sort of rhythm game, where you’re moving Geralt side to side on a board to attack or avoid monsters. What makes this system work within the confines of Reigns is that you’re still using the same commands; whether you’re making a pivotal decision or staring down a striga, everything comes down to swiping either right or left.\n\nDespite those changes, Harrington-Shaw says that The Witcher universe is an almost ideal fit for Reigns thanks to its dark sense of humor and frequently bleak world full of opposing factions. More important, though, is the main witcher himself. “Geralt is always facing these tricky binary choices,” he says. “The world of The Witcher is full of murky, gray morality, and that seemed perfect to translate.”\n\nReigns: The Witcher is out now on PC and mobile."

(If you’re new here, welcome, please send Android tips, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)\n\nI also have for you the first big phone launch of the year, a new-old weather app, a way to maybe make your YouTube a little cheaper, a bunch of stuff to watch this weekend, and much more.

The more I get to know Meredith, a new(ish) editor here at The Verge, the more I realize how correct my first assumption was. Meredith has written about fashion and culture and brands and TV shows and also recently made a Pride and Prejudice joke that made me laugh so hard I spilled coffee all over my keyboard. Technically, Meredith owes me a keyboard.\n\nI asked Meredith to share her homescreen with us, both because I think it’s a fun way to get to know new people here and because I want her to tell me about cool things but I don’t want to just constantly badger her for TV recs. Here’s her homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why:\n\nThe phone: An iPhone 17. Until very recently, I was clinging to an iPhone 12 mini that I’d gotten as a hand-me-down corporate gift from a friend; it was so tiny and good and I had the perfect phone case. (Ben Affleck smoking a cigarette in a mask. A conversation starter!) But the battery became glacial, even after a couple of trips to the Genius Bar, and I had to give it up.\n\nThe wallpaper: A screenshot of Roku City, fall edition. I find Roku City very calming, so I decided to keep it with me.\n\nThe apps: Spotify, Messages, Mail, Chrome.\n\nI’m especially dependent on Notes, and here you can see my three main categories of Note: things I need to do, things I need to buy, thoughts I probably would have tweeted a few years ago. I love that the MTA app will tell me when I should leave for the train, but I almost never check it before I leave my house. For the weather, I actually rely on the New York Metro Weather Instagram account; my boyfriend hates it when I tell him what number the vibes are.\n\nTo be clear, this attempt to simplify my homescreen hasn’t alleviated my time-wasting at all. Beyond this page, I have a loopy number of apps, mostly put into folders to keep me away from them, which doesn’t work. I’m still always scrolling to the last page, to the last folder, to the last page of that last folder, so I can play a mobile game I don’t enjoy called Drop the Cat. There’s maybe nothing worse in my life than the hold that mobile games I don’t enjoy have on me. I’m not even a cat person.\n\nI also asked Meredith to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she sent back:\n\nLove Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette . I’m appropriately ashamed of watching this show (I’m sorry, Schlossberg family!), but it’s a fantastic combination of cool and dumb. One second it makes smoking a cigarette in 1994 while wearing Calvin Klein look like the apex of human existence; the next, Fake JFK Jr. is pointing to an actor in a thick white wig, saying, “Have you met my uncle Teddy?” We shouldn’t even talk about the scene where Jackie O dances to Camelot.

It parses the deluge of recommendations from TikTok or Instagram, if you happen to be on the “wealthy children pose with food” side of those apps. You screenshot the clip, send it to Rodeo, and it grabs the relevant information and can save it in fairly handy lists.\n\nThe library. This might be stolen valor from the Meredith who had not yet downloaded Drop the Cat, but a little over a year ago I moved closer to the library and have really been cashing in on how free those books are. Plus, the Brooklyn Public Library app is so good, letting me put things on hold whenever I happen to think of them. I’m currently reading Louise Erdrich’s The Sentence , which I am probably incorrectly not as into as her The Mighty Red , and we don’t have to talk about how many times I’ve renewed it because I’ve been playing phone games instead.\n\nNirvanna the Band the Show the Movie . I’d never watched Viceland’s Nirvanna the Band the Show before I went to see the movie, and you currently cannot do so legally, so probably I still haven’t. I didn’t need it to enjoy the movie, though, which is hilarious and sweet and made me go “How did they do that???” so many times.\n\nCrowdsourced\n\nHere’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads and this post on Bluesky.\n\n“Marathon (a new extraction shooter game by Bungie) is having an open play-test / demo this weekend so that’s what I’ll be into for the next few days.” – Janego\n\n“Really enjoying Agnes Aubert’s Mystical Cat Shelter by Heather Fawcett (author of the delightful Emily Wilde series). Feels like a cross between Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell and Howl’s Moving Castle.” — Spencer\n\n“Since 1Password have upped their price I’ve spent a few hours moving over to Apple Passwords and Uplock. Was mostly okay, but it’s a shame you can’t transfer over all your passkeys to Apple Passwords. Uplock having a lifetime purchase is a big plus.” — Matthew\n\n“Been watching Demon Slayer this past month, and FINALLY watched the Infinity Castle movie in a theater, and, it’s so clear how these anime movies are wildly different (and spectacular!) in tone, direction and characterization from our current crop of Hollywood blockbusters.” — Anshuman\n\n“I just yesterday switched my family from my grandfathered free Google Apps plan for our custom domain email to Fastmail. Fastmail is private but supports industry standard IMAP and CalDAV protocols, so we can use the built-in mail apps on our phones and computers.” — Mike\n\n“I’ve been listening to Comedy Bang Bang! Still super funny. Big Paul F. Tompkins fan.” — Mo\n\n“Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown. Despite the occasionally brutal RNG, it’s so fun to be able to dive into my favourite Trek stories and tweak the outcomes.” — Jono\n\n“Reading the first book in the On the Calculation of Volume series. It’s a time loop story, like Groundhog Day but way more realistic and sorta sad but it’s great so far!” — Colin\n\n“The news of the YouTube app coming to the Apple Vision Pro made me re-watch the only good use of 360 video I’ve seen: ‘How TV screens made watching movies worse,’ a fully 3D-animated, 20-minute video essay about how the home releases of movies differ from their theatrical cuts and why that matters, and how the physical size of TV screens makes an impact on content. If you have a Vision Pro it’s worth pulling out just for this video. After that, watch everything else that YouTuber (Noodle) has made.” — Nathan\n\nSigning off\n\nThis winter has been a disaster, where I live and many other places. So much snow, so many snow days, so much chaos. First of all, I hope you’ve all stayed safe and warm and well! Second of all, there is one bit of good news in all this: Casey Neistat is out in New York City vlogging again. All these years later, nobody YouTubes quite like Casey YouTubes. Between this and the return of Paul Ford’s blog, it almost feels like the good internet is coming back. Here’s hoping.\n\nSee you next week!"

So why not buy one and share it?\n\nThat’s the idea behind the Tenways CGO Compact e-bike I’ve been sharing with my wife and teenage daughter for the last two weeks. It adapts in seconds without any tools to comfortably fit riders of varying heights thanks to its low-entry frame, quick-release seat post, and height-adjustable handlebar.\n\nIt also takes up less space than an ordinary bike with its 20-inch wheels, folding pedals, and a handlebar that twists to create a slim, wall-hugging profile that goes flat inside a car or train.\n\nThe CGO Compact’s geometry puts riders into a comfortable upright body position. Combine that with wide tires and a heavy aluminum frame – heavier than many full-sized e-bikes – and it feels remarkably sturdy despite its size, with a rear carrier system strong enough to hold a child or a few days of groceries.\n\nThe shareable e-bike isn’t a new idea, but Tenways comes close to perfecting it with the €1,999 (about $2,365) CGO Compact.\n\n9 Verge Score Tenways CGO Compact e-bike $ 2365 $ 2365 The Good Saddle and handlebar adjust quickly\n\nTwists and folds to go flat\n\nRides big and sturdy\n\nGood hauling capacity for size\n\nNo service upsells\n\nLow battery alerts The Bad App is just fine\n\nQuick release seat easy to steal $2365 at Tenways How we rate and review products\n\nTenways, the Amsterdam-HQ’d e-bike company of Chinese origin, has been on a tear in Europe thanks to the post-pandemic chaos that took out much of its competition.

It seemed big enough to fit the CGO Compact fully assembled and with the handlebar twisted, yet I still had to attach the steering column and front wheel myself. The e-bike took about 20 minutes to unbox, but I’ve been assembling direct-to-consumer e-bikes about once a month for the last decade.\n\nQuickly adjusts to fit my wife who is 164cm (5ft 5in) tall. The handlebars and shock-absorbing seat can be raised in seconds to fit my 183cm (6ft) frame. Open the release to raise and lower the handlebars, lift that little pin to twist them out of the way. The folding pedals help create a wall-hugging profile that’s easy to walk past.\n\nThe first thing I did after assembly was play with the Byschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem. It’s magical. Open the lever to quickly raise and lower the handlebar, or to gain access to a pin release that lets the handlebar twist out of the way. It took a little practice for everyone to master but we soon got the hang of it.\n\nThe small LCD dashboard is bright and colorful even in the sun. You have to enter a four-digit PIN code at power-on, which can only be changed in the rudimentary app over Bluetooth. It’s the only theft-deterrence Tenways offers on the CGO Compact, which also means it won’t try to upsell you on subscriptions or software-locked features.\n\nDespite our height differences, ranging from 164cm to 183cm (5ft 5in to 6 feet), everyone found the CGO Compact to be very comfortable. Adjusting the handlebar and saddle takes less than 10 seconds, and the suspension seatpost did a good job of soaking up small bumps. But the seat’s quick release mechanism offers no additional security to prevent the post and saddle from being stolen. A no-no in the big European cities this bike targets.\n\nThe e-bike’s torque sensor made the ride exceptionally intuitive, ensuring that the power delivered by the 250W rear-hub motor was tuned to match the downward force exerted on the pedals. The motor was also very quiet, masked entirely by the sound of the wide, 2.4-inch tires riding over asphalt.\n\nThe Tenways motor is only capable of 45Nm of torque. And without additional gears, the CGO Compact is best for mostly flat environments. It still did better than I expected on hills, easily besting the 35Nm Raleigh One I recently reviewed. For example, I was able to cross a bridge with a 10 percent incline that stymied the Raleigh One, but only if I had a rolling start — otherwise, I had to get off and push. On downhill slopes, the large chainring allowed me to pedal comfortably at speeds approaching 30km/h without my legs frantically spinning out. The pedal-assist, however, quits helping at 25km/h (16mph) in Europe.\n\nI also didn’t experience any of the twitchiness you get from folding bikes with relatively short wheelbases, smaller 16-inch wheels, and narrow handlebars. In general I rode in pedal-assist levels 3 or 4 out of 5, with 3 feeling the most natural, and 4 for when I was in a hurry.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 25 The suspension seat post soaked up bumps on a variety of road surfaces.\n\nOn a full battery I managed to travel 65kms (over 40 miles) before needing a recharge. I received alerts on my iPhone and Apple Watch when the battery dropped to 10 percent, and power dropped noticeably when the estimated remaining range hit 4km. Charging the 494.36Wh battery took a relatively slow 4.5 hours from the bundled charger.\n\nThe CGO Compact was obviously designed by people that actually ride bikes in compact European cities. It comes standard with integrated lighting, mudguards, a loud bell, kickstand, and a partially covered transmission to protect trousers, skirts, and long coats from getting snagged. The little crossbar in the step-through frame even doubles as a handle to help hoist the bike up stairs.\n\nCity bikes need to haul things, which is why the CGO Compact comes fitted with the click-and-go MIK HD rear carrier system. It supports loads up to 27kg (almost 60 pounds) — enough to fit a compatible crate or child seat. The e-bike also has mounting points up front for a bottle cage or rack.\n\nIn general, the Android and iOS app is fine, but it’s rarely needed. It might eventually be useful for buying accessories and insurance, or starting a chat with support and finding the nearest service center. It also promises to show riding data collected by date, but this never worked for me, only showing zeroes.\n\nTenways’ CGO Compact is an excellent e-bike for €1,999 (about $2,365). The riding experience, everyone agrees, has been stellar. And when it eventually needs servicing, Tenways has a solid network of local bike shops in Europe to provide support, with a ready supply of the off-the-shelf parts from brands you know.\n\nThe CGO Compact is a highly adaptable e-bike that rides big and tucks away small, making it an ideal companion for European city life. It’s also exceedingly shareable — but nobody would blame you for keeping it all for yourself.\n\nCGO Compact Specs Tenways C9 Hub Motor (250W, 45Nm torque)\n\nSingle-speed Gates CDN Carbon belt drive\n\n494.36Wh removable battery\n\nSuspension seat post for Selle Royal saddle\n\nTektro hydraulic disc brakes\n\nByschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem\n\nBike weight: 24kg (almost 53 pounds) with all accessories\n\nMax load: 145kg (320 pounds)\n\nMIK HD Rear Carrier system with 27kg (almost 60 pounds) max load\n\nFits riders 160cm and 190cm (5ft 2in to 6ft 2in)\n\nAccessory mounting points on head tube\n\nIntegrated front and rear lighting with daytime running light\n\nLCD display\n\nBasic app for iOS and Android\n\nPhotography by Thomas Ricker / The Verge"

            "content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced late on Friday that his company has reached an agreement allowing the Department of Defense to use its AI models in the department’s classified network.\n\nThis follows a high-profile standoff between the DoD — also known under the Trump administration as the Department of War — and OpenAI’s rival Anthropic. The Pentagon pushed AI companies, including Anthropic, to allow their models to be used for “all lawful purposes,” while Anthropic sought to draw a red line around mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons.\n\nIn a lengthy statement released Thursday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said the company “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner,” but he argued that “in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.”\n\nMore than 60 OpenAI employees and 300 Google employees signed an open letter this week asking their employers to support Anthropic’s position.\n\nAfter Anthropic and the Pentagon failed to reach an agreement, President Donald Trump criticized the “Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic” in a social media post that also directed federal agencies to stop using the company’s products after a six-month phase-out period.\n\nIn a separate post, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth claimed Anthropic was trying to “seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military.” Hegseth also said he is designating Anthropic as a supply-chain risk: “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\n\nOn Friday, Anthropic said it had “not yet received direct communication from the Department of War or the White House on the status of our negotiations,” but insisted it would “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "China’s humanoid robots grabbed global attention with kung fu flips at the nation’s televised Spring Festival Gala, while Chinese phone maker Honor is set to unveil its first humanoid robot at MWC in Spain.\n\nRobotics was flagged as a priority under the country’s “Made in China 2025” plan, albeit originally focused on factory automation, rather than humanoids. Now, rapid advances in multimodal AI are accelerating so-called embodied AI — autonomous machines operating in the real world — a push officials say could help offset labor shortages and drive productivity gains.\n\nAt this early stage of humanoid robot development, Chinese companies are outpacing their U.S. rivals in both speed and volume, Selina Xu, a China and AI policy lead at the office of Eric Schmidt said.\n\n“China has a more robust hardware supply chain — much of it built up through the EV sector, from sensors to batteries — and the world’s strongest manufacturing base, allowing companies to iterate far faster than Western competitors,” Xu told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result, not only are Chinese robots cheaper but companies can also release new models more quickly, Xu noted, adding that leading Chinese player Unitree shipped roughly 36 times more units last year than U.S. rivals Figure and Tesla.\n\nGlobal humanoid robot shipments totaled just 13,317 units last year, according to a Forbes report released last month. That is a tiny base for an industry expected to nearly double annually and reach 2.6 million units by 2035. (Still, the figures should be viewed with caution. The report notes it remains unclear how many units represent commercial sales versus demo models or pilot deployments, underscoring the early-stage nature of the industry.)\n\nThe top humanoid robot makers by 2025 shipments were led by China’s Agibot and Unitree, followed by UBTech, Leju Robotics, Engine AI, and Fourier Intelligence, underscoring Beijing’s early dominance in the sector.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe biggest shift recently has been from “demo-driven excitement” to “operations-driven adoption,” Yuli Zhao, chief strategy officer at Galbot, told TechCrunch. Galbot’s humanoid robot, the G1, appeared at this year’s Spring Festival Gala, China’s annual, state-run lunar New Year’s Eve television show, alongside robots from Unitree Robotics, Noetix, and MagicLab.\n\n“More customers are asking: Can the robot run stably in real environments and actually take work off people’s plates? That practical pull is strengthened in China because policy and industrial strategy encourage automation upgrades, and the manufacturing ecosystem makes iteration extremely fast,” Zhao said.\n\nWhile increased funding toward humanoid startups “has definitely accelerated” the pace of progress, “the most durable adoption comes when you can show reliable and repeatable value in production or service operations, not just a one-off showcase,” Zhao added.\n\nStill, investing helps and Chinese robotics makers are securing it. Last year Unitree was valued at around $3 billion after closing its Series C, with ambitions to reach as much as $7 billion in a future IPO. Meanwhile, Galbot has raised more than $300 million in fresh funding, reportedly pushing its valuation to $3 billion, one of the largest financings in China’s humanoid robotics sector to date.\n\nU.S. companies are moving beyond flashy demos as well to focus on real-world deployments. Plus, they are pursuing their own aggressive goals. U.S. startup Foundation, for instance, plans to build 50,000 humanoid robots by the end of 2027.\n\nBut China is already targeting a mix of affordable mass-market models and high-end applications, rapidly expanding humanoids across industrial, consumer, and rehabilitation sectors, according to a December TrendForce report.\n\nBottlenecks to China’s dominance\n\nWhen it comes to AI systems and integrated software, it’s still unclear where Chinese humanoid firms truly stand. The industry is largely betting on vision-language-action models and “world models,” but both technologies remain in early stages. Nvidia currently leads the space with its end-to-end humanoid software stack, according to Xu, so naturally most humanoid startups in China are powered by Nvidia’s Orin chips. However, domestic chipmakers are developing homegrown alternatives, she said.\n\nYet humanoid robotics makers are still working on fundamental problems. The challenge is enabling robot foundation models to predict the “next physical state” the robot will face in unpredictable environments, like how large language models predict the next word. But unlike LLMs, humanoid robotics companies can’t simply scrape the internet for training data, Xu said. So most are relying on simulation environments, which generates synthetic data, though real-world data collection remains essential.\n\n“Because of the data scarcity problem, humanoids are still far away from autonomy. The hardware is currently ahead of the software — the robot body can handle a lot more dexterity today than years ago (though it has reliability issues, as we saw with the robots that broke down at humanoid marathons), but the brain is still nascent,” the analyst said.\n\nSafety is a major hurdle for humanoid robots, too. One high-profile accident could trigger public backlash, and China is likely weighing how to roll out the technology quickly without moving too fast. As the industry matures, more regulations are expected.\n\nGiven the lack of data, Zhao believes that demand for humanoids will grow first in fairly contained workplaces.\n\n“Early momentum is likely to be in industrial manufacturing, warehouse logistics, and retail, where tasks are repetitive, hours are long, and processes are clear — creating real demand and ideal conditions for humanoid robots to deliver value at scale,” he said.\n\nOther APAC players\n\nHumanoid robot development is not a two-country race. Japan’s robotics ecosystem — from startups to semiconductor heavyweights — is targeting humanoid mass production by 2027. Long a pioneer through projects like Honda’s Asimo, Murata Manufacturing’s Murata Boy, and SoftBank Robotics’ Pepper, Japan leans on precision and advanced control. One area unique to this nation: Humanoid robots are increasingly used in eldercare.\n\nCoral Capital CEO James Riney, who invests in tech companies in Japan, believes Tokyo will continue to thrive in the humanoid robotics industry. “There are three factors likely to drive the adoption of robotics in Japan. One is the labor shortage and the desire to depend less on mass immigration. The second is the widespread cultural view of robots as our friends — more Doraemon vs. Terminator. The third is that Japan is already dominant in many parts of the robotics supply chain.”\n\nHyundai Motor’s Boston Dynamics unit introduced a new Atlas humanoid for factory use by 2028, with plans to produce up to 30,000 units annually in the U.S. as part of its AI-driven robotics push.\n\nStill, for China, government policy, industrial strategy, labor shortages, and private capital are all converging to turbocharge the country’s humanoid robotics push.\n\n“China’s leadership is best understood as a speed-to-scale advantage,” Zhao said. “The ecosystem here compresses the entire cycle — R&D, supply chain, manufacturing, integration, and customer deployment — into a very tight loop. That means humanoid companies can move from prototype to real-world deployment faster, learn from real operations, and iterate at a pace that’s difficult to match elsewhere.”"

            "content": "Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.\n\nThe blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.\n\nThe Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.\n\nAccess to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.\n\nWe understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase. We acknowledge the difficulties this is causing for our users there. Supabase continues to follow up through all available channels to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nWe continue to advise affected customers… — Supabase (@supabase) February 27, 2026\n\nAn Indian founder, who asked not to be named to avoid potential repercussions, told TechCrunch they had stopped seeing new user sign-ups from India over the past two to three days. A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.\n\nWhile Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.\n\nAt the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.\n\nThe incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.\n\n“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.”\n\nIndia has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted access to developer platform GitHub, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also reported that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.\n\nFounded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has gained traction amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its valuation to $5 billion.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond."

However, a spokesperson said that such actions violated a company policy that bans workers from using inside information for personal gain, including on prediction markets.\n\nPrediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi allow people to make wagers on the outcomes of real-world events. For instance, on Polymarket, there are wagers being made around the kind of products OpenAI will announce in 2026 and when the company will go public. They can cover any event, and some eye-popping money can be made. As we recently reported, an accountant won a $470,300 jackpot on Kalshi by betting against DOGE believers.\n\nPrediction markets insist they are not gambling sites, preferring to label themselves as financial platforms. Kalshi is a regulated exchange and, in fact, it fined and banned a MrBeast editor for similar alleged insider trading earlier this week. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment."

The president allowed for a six-month phase-out period for departments using the products, but emphasized that Anthropic was no longer welcome as a federal contractor.\n\n“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again,” the president wrote in the post.\n\nNotably, the president’s post did not mention any plans to designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk, as had been previously mentioned as a consequence. However, a subsequent tweet from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made good on the threat.\n\n“In conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security,” Secretary Hegseth wrote. “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\n\nAnthropic said Friday that while the company has not heard from the government directly, it will “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.”\n\nThe Pentagon dispute centered on Anthropic’s refusal to allow its AI models to be used to power either mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, which Secretary Hegseth found unduly restrictive.\n\nCEO Dario Amodei reiterated his stance in a public post on Thursday, refusing to compromise on the two points.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Per the BBC, CEO Sam Altman sent a memo to staff on Thursday saying he shared the same “red lines” and that any OpenAI-related defense contracts would also reject uses that were “unlawful or unsuited to cloud deployments, such as domestic surveillance and autonomous offensive weapons.”\n\nOpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who very publicly fell out with Altman in November 2023 and has since co-founded his own AI company, also waded into the conversation on Friday, writing on X: “It’s extremely good that Anthropic has not backed down, and it’s significant that OpenAI has taken a similar stance.”\n\nBut within hours of the Trump administration ordering federal agencies to cut ties with Anthropic, OpenAI moved to fill the void, announcing a deal with the Pentagon that Altman said preserved the same core principles Anthropic had fought for — prohibitions on domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, OpenAI and the government began meeting about a potential tie-up on Wednesday of this week.\n\nSurely, there will be more twists to come.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI and Google each received contract awards from the U.S. Defense Department last July. While some Google employees have come out in support of Anthropic, Google and its parent company have yet to comment.\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

            "content": "“This is just not the right pathway forward,” Isaacman said.\n\nA senior NASA official, speaking on background to Ars, noted that the space agency has experienced hydrogen and helium leaks during both the Artemis I and Artemis II prelaunch preparations, and these problems have led to monthslong delays in launch.\n\n“If I recall, the timing between Apollo 7 and 8 was nine weeks,” the official said. “Launching SLS every three and a half years or so is not a recipe for success. Certainly, making each one of them a work of art with some major configuration change is also not helpful in the process, and we’re clearly seeing the results of it, right?”\n\nThe goal therefore is to standardize the SLS rocket into a single configuration in order to make the rocket as reliable as possible, and launching as frequently as every 10 months. NASA will fly the SLS vehicle until there are commercial alternatives to launch crews to the moon, perhaps through Artemis V as Congress has mandated, or perhaps even a little longer.\n\nIs Everyone on Board?\n\nThe NASA official said all of the agency’s key contractors are on board with the change, and senior leaders in Congress have been briefed on the proposed changes.\n\nThe biggest opposition to these proposals would seemingly come from Boeing, which is the prime contractor for the Exploration Upper Stage, a contract worth billions of dollars to develop a more powerful rocket that was due to launch for the first time later this decade. However, in a NASA news release, Boeing appeared to offer at least some support for the revised plans.\n\n“Boeing is a proud partner to the Artemis mission and our team is honored to contribute to NASA’s vision for American space leadership,” said Steve Parker, Boeing Defense, Space & Security president and CEO, in the news release. “The SLS core stage remains the world’s most powerful rocket stage, and the only one that can carry American astronauts directly to the moon and beyond in a single launch. As NASA lays out an accelerated launch schedule, our workforce and supply chain are prepared to meet the increased production needs.”\n\nSolid Reasons for Changing Artemis III\n\nNASA’s new approach to Artemis reflects a return to the philosophy of the Apollo program. During the late 1960s, the space agency flew a series of preparatory crewed missions before the Apollo 11 lunar landing. These included Apollo 7 (a low-Earth-orbit test of the Apollo spacecraft), Apollo 8 (a lunar orbiting mission), Apollo 9 (a low-Earth-orbit rendezvous with the lunar lander), and Apollo 10 (a test of the lunar lander descending to the moon, without touching down).\n\nWith its previous Artemis template, NASA skipped the steps taken by Apollo 7, 9, and 10. In the view of many industry officials, this leap from Artemis II—a crewed lunar flyby of the moon testing only the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft—to Artemis III and a full-on lunar landing was enormous and risky."

            "content": "Residents across Tehran and other Iranian cities were jolted awake by sounds of loud explosions in the early hours of Saturday morning, as Israel and the US launched joint attacks on Iran.\n\nThe attacks, which the US and Israel are calling “preemptive strikes,” come after a period of failed negotiations between the countries, and on the heels of mass protests in Iran earlier this year that saw the death of at least 3,117 civilians, according to government statistics.\n\nShortly after the first set of explosions, Iranians received bursts of notifications on their phones. They came not from the government advising caution, but from an apparently hacked prayer-timing app called ‘BadeSaba Calendar’ that has been downloaded more than 5 million times from the Google Play Store.\n\nThe messages arrived in quick succession over a period of 30 minutes, starting with the phrase ‘Help Has Arrived’ at 9:52 am Tehran time, shortly after the first set of explosions. No party has claimed responsibility for the hacks.\n\nScreenshots shared with WIRED Middle East show messages urging Iranian military personnel to surrender their weapons with the promise of amnesty. They also urged army personnel to join “the forces of liberation” and to “defend your brothers.”\n\nThe push notifications are all titled “Help is on the way”, and call on Iranian military members to surrender. Screenshot: WIRED Middle East\n\n“The time for revenge has come,” one notification received at 10:02 am read (translated from Farsi). “The regime's repressive forces will pay for their cruel and merciless actions against the innocent people of Iran. Anyone who joins in defending and protecting the Iranian nation will be granted amnesty and forgiveness.”\n\n“For the freedom of our Iranian brothers and sisters, this is a call to all oppressive forces—lay down your weapons or join the forces of liberation. Only in this way can you save your lives. For a free Iran,” another message sent at 10:14 am read.\n\nCybersecurity analysts confirmed that BadeSabah users had received notifications around the time of the strikes, but have not been able to identify the source of the hack. “At this point, we genuinely do not know who is behind them, whether it was Israel or other anti-government Iranian groups,” says Narges Keshavarznia, digital rights researcher at the Miaan Group, adding that no hacker group has claimed credit.\n\n“Attribution in cases like this is always complex, and it’s still too early to draw conclusions.”\n\n​​Morey Haber, the chief security advisor at BeyondTrust, however, pointed out that a cyber operation of this nature would almost certainly have been planned in advance.\n\n“The compromise of assets [likely] happened some time ago, and these messages of ‘help’ were timed” strategically, he claims. “This is not a smash-and-grab style of attack. It is nation-state versus nation-state and is being executed with intent and precision.”\n\nIran on Saturday launched retaliatory kinetic attacks targeting key military bases across the Middle East. Explosions were reported in Bahrain, Kuwait, the UAE, and Qatar on Saturday, including multiple missiles that were intercepted.\n\nDigital Blackout, Cyber Warfare\n\nAs the war unfolds, the Iranian public has already faced internet blackouts and weeks of severely reduced connectivity. “The country has been experiencing a widespread internet disruption, and access to the internet has significantly decreased in several parts of the country, including Tehran,” Keshavarznia says.\n\nAccording to internet monitoring tool NetBlocks, overall network traffic has dropped to 4 percent. Data from ArvanCloud’s Radar monitoring system, an Iranian-operated cloud service, indicates that many of the country’s main data centers and domestic PoP sites have either lost connectivity to the international internet or are experiencing severe disruption, Keshavarznia pointed out.\n\nCommunication networks are also down with outages in phone lines and SMS services, and severe degradation of both mobile data and fixed broadband connections. “Incoming international calls to Iran are also reportedly affected. Even using VPNs has become extremely difficult,” she says."

            "content": "After Israel and the US launched joint attacks on Iran on Saturday, Tehran responded with missile attacks across the Gulf, targeting US military bases in those countries. Within hours, the UAE Ministry of Defense confirmed that its air defense systems had successfully intercepted several incoming ballistic missiles.\n\nAccording to the ministry, the missiles were destroyed before impact. However, debris from one interception fell in Abu Dhabi, killing one civilian. Abu Dhabi sits near several strategic military installations, including Al Dhafra Air Base, which hosts Emirati and US forces.\n\nFor many residents, the event unfolded as a series of distant flashes and muffled explosions in the sky. Behind those brief moments, however, is a complex network of radars, interceptors and command systems designed to detect, track and destroy ballistic missiles traveling at hypersonic speeds.\n\nUnderstanding what happened in those seconds means understanding how the UAE’s layered missile defense network works.\n\nThe System Designed to Stop Ballistic Missiles\n\nThe UAE’s missile shield includes multiple layers of defense, such as the high-altitude Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and the lower-altitude MIM-104 Patriot."

            "content": "I’ve been reviewing Xiaomi’s smartphones for several years, and I always look forward to the new Ultra. If you’ve never sampled its wares, preferring the latest Apple or Samsung iteration, you might be surprised at just how good these devices are. The Chinese company is the third-largest phone maker in the world behind Apple and Samsung, and it packs all the latest cutting-edge hardware into its annual flagship release. Xiaomi’s Ultra line has long battled for the camera king title.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nAmusingly, Xiaomi skipped the 16 series to compete directly with Apple’s latest iPhone generation. There’s no radical redesign for the 17 Ultra over last year’s Xiaomi 15 Ultra, but there is refinement and a special version called the Leitzphone, designed with Leica, that may prove irresistible to fans of the German camera brand. The Xiaomi 17 Ultra is easily one of the best phones you can’t officially buy in the United States. While importing a Chinese smartphone is not without potential pitfalls, this one will tempt keen American photographers.\n\nLeica a Lot\n\nI’ve always appreciated Leica’s minimalist industrial design. Textured black and silver materials with a splash of red add some identity. It strikes me as a careful balance between form and function, and it comes through very strongly in Xiaomi’s Leitzphone. The aluminum alloy frame is ribbed for enhanced grip, you can rotate the ring around the camera for fine zoom control, and the user interface has an elegant Leica-themed makeover. I’m surprised there’s no dedicated shutter button, though you can add one with the optional photography kit (more on that later)."

            "content": "Others We Tested\n\nThere were multiple great bags we tried whose features or designs just didn't add up to a place in the top spots above. However, everyone has something different they're looking for in a toiletry bag, so while not perfect for us, some of these options may still be perfect for you.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nPatricks BB1 Bathroom Bag for $189: This crush-resistant, shock-absorbing rectangular bag is basically a heavier-duty, unisex version of the Flat Lay, below, except it costs four times as much. I tested it in the Triple Black colorway, which is “strictly limited to 1,000 pieces globally.” This one’s got two interior flaps with a slim, shallow zippered pouch on either side, but otherwise is just one big compartment that led to too much clinking and clanking of contents during my test. It’s great for full-sized products, but my testers and I all preferred bags that hold the products securely upright, as in the less expensive Parallelle Kit, above.\n\nFlat Lay Makeup Box Bag for $37: Available in opaque-fabric and clear (\"jelly\") styles, this unassuming pouch looks like a chubby rectangle with a handle on the end but actually unzips into a flat tray for easy access. There's only one compartment, so I didn't love it as a toiletry bag, but I did love it as a pool and beach accessory bag for sunscreen and makeup.\n\nMonos Metro Toiletry Case for $95: This durable, structured case, available in either nylon or vegan leather, exhibits the class and quality construction Monos is known for. It has one main roomy compartment with three small pockets inside; one zippered. It did a great job of protecting its contents while still being squishable enough to fit in a tightly packed carry-on, though I did find myself wishing it had a handle for carrying.\n\nCalpak Clear Cosmetics Case for $85: Constructed largely of water-resistant, wipe-clean PVC, this clear cosmetic case (I tested the Medium size) zips all the way around and folds flat to reveal two zippered compartments and one smaller zippered mesh bag. It also looks like a cute little purse with its 16 trendy color options, dual handles, and metal bottom studs. However, contents aren't as easy to access as other cosmetic bags that just open from the top—you have to lay the Calpak flat to open both sides, which requires a 16-by-10-inch footprint.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nVera Bradley Toiletry Bags for $30: The erstwhile must-have accessory of both early-aughts Southern sorority girls and their grandmothers, Vera Bradley bags are back with a new spokesperson (Zooey Deschanel), new designs, and updated fabrics like smooth twill and cotton gabardine. (Die-hard fans can rest assured that the staple quilted paisley options are still available.) The new line includes multiple styles of toiletry bags and makeup bags that are lightweight, giftable, and can add a pop of color and personality to your travel setup. I tested several, and my favorite was the Lay-Flat Travel Organizer—its two interior clear zippered compartments and three mesh slip pockets were roomy yet snug enough to keep all contents of my morning routine secure, and a rather large spill of soap in the large pocket cleaned up quickly. However, even though the fabric is padded, which provides some protection for the interior contents, the exterior is somewhat absorbent and not machine washable (though other designs are), so be forewarned that light-colored options could attract stains.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBagsmart Blast 4.5L Toiletry Bag for $30: This rectangular toiletry bag can sit on a counter (with about a 10 x 5-inch footprint) or hang with a 360-degree rotating hook. It's machine washable and has a bright orange interior for visibility, sporting five mesh pockets. Both my testers and I liked it a lot. The only thing that kept it from nabbing a top spot is how much space it took up when not hanging, and when it did hang, it stuck out more than the traditional flat hanging styles.\n\nBeis the Dopp Kit for $68: I’ve had Beis' Dopp Kit for four years now, and it’s still my go-to for any trip. The poly canvas material is durable and easy to spot-clean. Plus, I opted for the black version to mask the inevitable scuffs and smaller stains. What I love the most, though, are the compartments. The water-resistant section is a total game-changer when packing liquids or fragrances. If something leaks, a quick wipe gets the job done. The waterproof bottom is also a huge bonus when I’m getting ready at a bathroom sink. —Boutayna Chokrane\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nThule Aion Toiletry Bag for $65: This spacious, 5-liter bag with an 11 x 5-inch footprint features many thoughtful touches, including a wipe-clean interior with a rubbery, water-resistant bottom to protect it from wet countertops. (Though there's also a handy strap that snaps to hang on any-diameter hook or rack.) The sides snap down to compress, almost like a packing cube, and I like that it's squishable to fit into a smaller suitcase. It also comes with a removable translucent bag for taking liquids through the airport security line. However, it does take up a lot of space when not snapped down, and the waxed canvas does attract a lot of lines and marks, which may not be to everyone's aesthetic taste.\n\nNex Dopp for $73: The small and large Dopp kits I tested, part of Nex’s 2024 Hawaii collection, consisted of a roomy, single compartment with a dual zippered strip. They’re made of microfiber leather, which is a higher-quality synthetic leather, said to be softer and more durable. The bags were stiff and well-structured, which felt protective of my cosmetics when jammed into my carry-on. There is a slight synthetic smell from the microfiber leather, which is hard to miss, since you must lean your face quite close to the bag to see the contents in the cavernous single compartment. I also felt that when the bag was unzipped, the zippered strip was either in the way or had to be splayed out, which took up too much space on my tiny hotel-bathroom shelf. Otherwise, this is a fine option that offers both a lifetime warranty and an unlimited trade-in program.\n\nCotopaxi Nido Accessory Bag Cada Día for $50: Cotopaxi’s trim little bag is meant not just for hygiene items, but any collection of odds and ends. It’s made from light recycled deadstock nylon (so, probably not for you if you are carrying glass bottles or anything that needs padding) and weighs in at a modest 6.5 ounces. Your colorway will be unique! I like the surprisingly capacious 4-liter capacity spread over three different compartments, with a big middle compartment for your quart-size, TSA-approved bag of liquids and two other compartments with separate, smaller pockets. I do have to admit, though, that I like hooks better than loops, and hanging is more convenient with a clamshell toiletry bag design than with this one, which can't be hung while open. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nKusshi Hair Tools Bag for $89: Unlike similar bags that just bunch up your hair tools into a roll, this hair tool carrier has two organized pocket sections; a zippered pouch in the middle for hair products or, in my case while I was testing, attachments for my Shark FlexFusion; and a pocket on the outside for rubber bands or small accessories like lip balm. It's also made of neoprene that's heat-resistant up to 380 degrees Fahrenheit, so you don't have to worry about waiting for your tools to cool down before packing them away. Keep in mind, though, that the initial off-gassing is strong with this one—you may want to let it sit in a well-ventilated area for several days before packing it in your suitcase, lest it make everything else smell plasticky. This included the air from my hair dryer when I used it. There are also reports online of it not accommodating some Dyson tools, though it did fit an Airstrait and Corrale.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nAer Travel Kit 2 Ultra for $79: Does the average traveler need a toiletry bag made partially of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which is 15 times stronger than steel by weight? Perhaps not, but it definitely makes for an interesting bag. Part of Aer’s 10th Anniversary Ultra Collection, this hardy, chunky little Dopp kit incorporates the collection's Ultra400X fabric (in black only) by Challenge Sailcloth, known for its high-performance sails for yacht racers and kite surfers. Despite its strength, the Travel Kit is still pretty lightweight at 8 ounces. However, the hook is thick plastic and too small for a towel rack, and the rubbery “Aer” brand tags on the outside and inside seem to accumulate toothbrush and soap residue, as does the mesh zippered pouch in the top compartment. Both proved somewhat difficult to clean.\n\nEagle Creek Pack-It Trifold Toiletry Kit for $50: Eagle Creek's travel accessory game is extremely strong. Its toiletry bags, packing cubes, and various organizers are affordable, sturdy, and exceedingly well designed, and this toiletry bag is no exception. At first glance, it looks like two toiletry bags snapped together, but each side unzips to make a hanging organizer with six compartments. The only problem is that one side of the bag holds products upside down until it's unfurled, which led to items falling out in my tests.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nState Bags Benson Toiletry Kit for $65: This is a solid, simple bag with three mesh pouches and a snap-in/snap-out plastic envelope that can hold a toothbrush and toothpaste or shower items like soap. The navy version I tested had a coated polyester wipe-clean exterior and interior made from recycled bottles, and I liked that it had the option to hang. However, the organization was more rudimentary than similar-category bags we tested, and it was missing some of the thoughtful details featured on other bags in the same price range, like a quick-access pouch on the back and a larger hook with a rubber tip to prevent slipping. (This bag's thick, small plastic hook wasn't even wide enough to hang on a towel rack.)\n\nCuyana Travel Beauty Case for $298: Those still chasing the quiet luxury aesthetic will love this elegant zippered cosmetic case, available in black or pale pink. It’s made of high-end-feeling Italian pebbled leather both inside and out, with gold hardware and “Cuyana” discreetly printed on the bottom. It opens clamshell-style, and the lid contains a snap-close cover concealing a brush holder with elastic loops. A removable pouch snaps onto that lid cover, and the main compartment has a pocket for securing tubes, bottles, and small tools. Contents aren’t as immediately accessible as they are in other cosmetic cases I tested, but they are more secure. This bag is also on the heavy side, even for a cosmetics case, weighing in at 1.6 pounds, but if you can swing the price, this is a well-made, timeless investment for your travel arsenal.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nCincha the Toiletry Bag for $55: After testing nearly every style of toiletry bag in existence, I thought I had seen it all, but this thoughtfully designed bag from Cincha surprised me. The large size is essentially the tackle box of toiletry bags. It zips open in the middle to reveal four roomy compartments—two on each side, each topped with a small, translucent vinyl zippered pouch. I could not believe the amount of stuff I was able to fit into this thing, and yet I never had trouble closing it, despite packing it to the absolute max. I ended up taking it on a five-day getaway where I had to share a bathroom with two other people, and I found that I loved being able to flip it over and lift the “lid” of whatever side I needed, in order to keep the counter footprint small.\n\nJuly Hanging Toiletry Bag for $85: I own and love July's carry-on suitcase, so I was excited to try the brand's popular hanging toiletry bag. It's a great design with a zippered pouch on the back, plus a body that zips flat to reveal PVC and pouch zip compartments and a large, rubber-tipped metal hook that tucks away. It looks well-made and stylish with leather trim and gunmetal hardware, but my husband took it on a business trip and found that its pockets are actually quite small, confirming a worry I had when I tested it in my bathroom at home. It wouldn't be an issue if the bag itself were small, but it took up a full quarter of the carry-on.\n\nTumi Alpha Bravo Response Kit for $225: This rugged-looking, ballistic nylon bag has the classic Tumi Tracer inside to help facilitate its return to you if it gets lost, as well as an antimicrobial lining. It can hang, stand up, or lie flat and has several convenient internal pockets and an external zipped pouch. It's a lot of money for a toiletry bag with many of the same features as ones half the price, but if you're a Tumi fan and need a toiletry bag to match your luggage, you could do worse than this model.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBeautifect Go Mini for $177: WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe loved the larger Beautifect Box, and I tested the Mini to see if it would work for travel. While the smaller size does make it more portable (along with a purse-like carry strap), the multifunction lighted mirror and its battery made the lid top-heavy, so it kept flopping forward when I tried to use it on a soft, uneven surface like my lap or a bed. It's also got a very hard case and is a bit heavy at almost 2.5 pounds, so as much as I wanted to take it with me on a plane, I ended up bringing a smaller bag instead. Worth a buy if you want a makeup case with a lighted mirror, but it's definitely best for day trips.\n\nFjallraven Kanken Toiletry Bag for $60: I love this thing, which makes me feel like a Red Cross nurse on the battlefields of World War II. It’s made from a proprietary Fjallraven fabric blend that combines organic cotton with recycled polyester, so it feels like fabric but is more waterproof and durable. It has a clamshell design with a sturdy interior plastic hook. My quart bag of bottles goes into the enormous lower zip compartment, my toothbrush and deodorant in the top compartment, and there are mesh pockets and MOLLE webbing so that your tiny things are easily visible. However, its dimensions are very large, so this might not be for you if you’re a minimalist with just a toothbrush and a comb. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nTom Beckbe Canvas Dopp Kit for $195: Known for its high-end jackets, field hats, and vests for fishing and waterfowl hunting, Birmingham, Alabama-based sports outfitter Tom Beckbe also makes a Dopp kit made of full-grain distressed leather and the brand’s proprietary Field Canvas. It matches the genteel Southern vibe of Tom Beckbe’s collection of other travel bags and related accessories like camo whiskey totes and insulated shooting gloves. If the Marlboro Man ever left the ranch, this is definitely the Dopp kit he would have used. The only downside is that the bag is relatively large—and dark inside—for what’s essentially one compartment.\n\nEagle Creek Pack-It Isolate Quick Trip for $25: This little bag is a simple design, made from recycled bottles, with a zipper on the top and on the side. However, its light weight and semi-structured shape make it perfect for holding a wallet and keys at the gym, or even as a tech pouch for work purposes.\n\nKusshi Neoprene Wristlet Clutch for $39: It's a purse! It's a toiletry bag! It's a purse that doubles as a toiletry bag! This clutch is the perfect size for a larger phone, e-reader, or small tablet, with a couple of mesh pockets for makeup. I used it to tote a day's worth of makeup and skincare around town and found it was just heavy enough to be burdensome, but if you like the neoprene look and your essentials are lightweight, this clutch, like most Kusshi products, is sturdy and well-made.\n\nSympl Dopp Kit for $75: I liked this bag’s durable Cordura exterior and stow-away clip for hanging, as well as the fact it has a lifetime warranty. The bag opens clamshell-style to reveal four simple waterproof zip pockets—two thin and horizontal, one small rectangle, and one larger rectangle. It's an interesting idea, but in practice, this severely limits utility since a user is restricted to specific toiletry-sized products that fit the shape of each of the pockets. (My deodorant did not fit, nor did a toothbrush in a case.)\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBagsmart Paz Hanging Toiletry Bag for $35: With its stylish, padded exterior; generously sized carry handle; and ability to transport up to eight full-sized products, this one had me reaching for it long after the testing period was over. The thin, tipped metal hanger makes it easy to hang anywhere, and there's an easy-access compartment on the front with loops for makeup brushes or other long, thin items. In fact, this is almost a small toiletry briefcase rather than a bag—the whole thing unfurls into a 33-inch-long organizer with four separate compartments (two with sections to hold full-sized products). It will almost certainly be too much for anyone who likes to travel light, but if you check your luggage, will be on the road for a long time, or just don't want to deal with decanting your personal care products, this is a well-designed and easy-to-use solution.\n\nSaltyface Everywhere Bag for $36: Technically designed to store Saltyface self-tanners and bronzers, this puffy black fabric bag spent an indordinate amount of time on my counter, simply because I liked how it looked. Practically speaking, though, the handle was too small for an adult-sized hand, and I found myself becoming irritated with the single zipper pull, so it's not ideal as a general-purpose travel toiletry bag.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow I Test Toiletry Bags AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron For bags our team hasn’t already been using for years, I spend a four-week period rotating new toiletry bags during my morning routine. I note any annoyances or unique details, volume, how easy it is to store and retrieve items, how much space each one takes up on the vanity, how they survive being splashed with water and soap, and, if the bag can hang, how easy it is to retrieve items once hanging. About every three months, my family goes on trips that require stays in hotels. I always take different groups of bags and determine how easy it is to use multiple bags at once in a small space, if hook designs allowed for multiple places to hang, and whether the contents spilled in or otherwise dirtied the bags, and if so, how easy they are to clean. For bags I am not able to take on trips, I lend them to friends and family members who are traveling and take down their notes to consider alongside my own home testing. How Does WIRED Obtain Toiletry Bags for Testing? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Some toiletry bags are review samples requested from the manufacturer, while others are purchased and expensed. Review samples are only accepted without promise of editorial coverage. Toiletry bags chosen as picks are reused for durability testing purposes, while all other bags are donated upon completion of testing. What Kind of Toiletry Bag Do You Need? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Dopp kits, cosmetics cases, hanging bags … the differences between categories aren’t always clear. Here are some of the more common types of toiletry bags you'll come across, and what to consider with each. Dopp kit: Named for leather craftsman Charles Doppelt, who provided “Dopps,” or toiletry kits, for WWII soldiers. “Dopp kit” has evolved over time to indicate any kind of portable toiletry organizer, but commercially, toiletry bags labeled “Dopp kits” tend to be smaller and hold just a handful of necessities for short trips as opposed to larger fold-up hanging bags and cosmetics cases. Cosmetics case: Designed for those who need more than just the necessities, a cosmetics case is usually a much larger boxlike container with specialized compartments for makeup, skin care, hair care, and other necessities. They often come with extras like brush holders and mirrors. Hanging toiletry bag: A bag that, as the name indicates, comes with a hook so that it can be hung on a hook, towel rack, tree, or someplace it won’t take up space on the counter. Often, the user needs to hang them to be able to access all the storage compartments. Something to consider is that hooks can be used up quite quickly if everyone in your hotel room has a hanging bag. All the hooks in our bathroom were taken almost immediately, so my husband ended up having to hang his bag over the toilet, which he wasn’t thrilled about. A good hanging toiletry bag will also have a hook that's thin enough to slip over just about any hook, and be rubber-tipped so it won't slide off.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "Shopping for a MicroSD card can be a little daunting. There are a ton of numbers to consider, a huge number of brands producing cards with similar-sounding features and names, and words like Pro, Extreme, and Express getting thrown around everywhere.\n\nTo make a long story short, unless you're shooting a ton of photos and videos, and doing so even semiprofessionally where losing those shots might be detrimental to your professional reputation, you're fine to buy a MicroSD card from any company whose name you've heard before. I prefer cards from PNY, SanDisk, and Lexar. Keep an eye out for the “U” symbol with a 3 inside, or a “V30” on the card for the best balance of speed and price. There are two exceptions to that suggestion:\n\nIf you're shooting on a high-end camera, you should consider a V60 MicroSD card, if you can find one for a reasonable price. Some cameras have extra video features you can enable with a faster MicroSD card, so check your manual for more info on whether you need to upgrade.\n\nIf you're buying for a Nintendo Switch 2, you'll need an unfortunately more expensive MicroSD Express card. While you can transfer images and videos from your Switch 2 with most regular MicroSD cards, you'll need an Express version to use it for actually running games.\n\nCapacity\n\nHow much storage you need will largely depend on your needs, but there are a few things to consider when debating between 128 GB and 1 TB. The first is that MicroSD cards are tiny, and having to swap them out on the road can be a risky proposition. Costs tend to go up exponentially for 1 TB and 2 TB cards, but the gap between 256 GB and 512 GB isn't that large, so I recommend sizing up a bit.\n\nThe other factor is that storage sizes are also separated into different standards, so you'll want to make sure your device actually supports that larger card. Cards that are 64 GB are higher are technically “SDXC” for Extended Capacity, and are currently the most common type, and you should be able to use them in most modern situations.\n\nSpeed\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about MicroSD speeds, we have a write-up with a full explanation of the different speeds and how they interact, but I'll give you the quick rundown here too.\n\nEach MicroSD card will have its actual minimum sequential write speed indicated by a letter and number on the card. The number indicates the speed in MB/s, with the letter representing the generation. A C10, U1, and V10 are all essentially the same speed, just written differently, so you're likely to see multiple symbols printed on each card. I'd recommend checking out the SD Association's page on speeds with a handy chart showing the full comparison.\n\nIn practice, you have to go out of your way to find a MicroSD card that's slower than V30/U3 at most retailers, though you may find them included with some electronics that don't require anything more substantial."

            "content": "The idea of using a laptop cooling pad feels antiquated. These days, laptop chips have become extremely efficient. The fans on MacBooks (if they even have them) are barely used, and both Intel and Qualcomm are pushing efficiency on the Windows front.\n\nBut people keep buying laptop cooling pads, so surely there is a use case in 2026 that actually makes sense, right? I tried out a couple cooling pads paired with a couple of different gaming laptops, and walked away surprised at how effective they could be.\n\nDo Cooling Pads Actually Work?\n\nPhotograph: Luke Larsen\n\nLaptop cooling pads have been around for decades, and the idea has always been simple: provide extra air to blow through a laptop that’s otherwise restricted by its own cooling system. In theory, more air means lower temperatures—and, ultimately, better performance. This is the whole idea of the power modes that exist in Windows, which ramp up the RPMs (rotations per minute) of the fans to add more air to both improve performance. More than that, less heat also means a longer-lasting laptop that doesn't degrade as quickly over time. It’s by that same logic that laptop cooling pads offer help.\n\nThe problem, however, is that a cooling pad is a rather inefficient way of transferring air into your device. Most laptop cooling pads, including the two that I tested, use one large fan or two smaller fans to blast cold air across the bottom of the laptop. This is the first reason why the vast majority of modern laptops won’t benefit much from a cooling pad, as these laptops tend to only have vents along the hinge. Without vents or open holes, blowing air across a sheet of metal or plastic isn't going to do anything to cool the components on the other side. It'll only generate a bunch of fan noise.\n\nGaming laptops are the main exception, though, which is why they are the primary use case for such an accessory. Most gaming laptops have a few open vents, usually above the fans, like the Razer Blade 16, which is one of the laptops I used to test these cooling pads. Laptops like the Blade 16 are designed for intensive tasks like gaming, video editing, or local AI processing—and use a high-wattage GPU and CPU to get the kind of performance you need. My model has two of the most powerful laptop components on the market: the RTX 5090 and Ryzen 9 HX 370. As you might guess, they generate a lot of heat when cranked up. Modern chips tend to max out at 100 degrees Celsius, before throttling back performance to bring down temperatures.\n\nMost laptops use fans to cool these components, but the thickness of the laptop chassis is also a determining factor in how much the system will need to throttle back performance to keep temperatures down. In the end, it's geometry and physics, and every millimeter of space in the laptop chassis has an effect on how cool it can keep its internal components. And unlike in a large desktop PC, you have very restricted space. That's especially true in the modern era, where even gaming laptops have become increasingly thin."

            "content": "Congressional Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee released a report this week pinpointing more than $20.9 billion in consumer losses stemming from identity theft that came out of four major breaches of data broker firms. US senator Maggie Hassan launched the investigation in August after an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, copublished by WIRED, found that some data brokers were hiding opt-out tools from Google and other search engines.\n\nThe US Department of Justice’s recent release of 3 million documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein included grand jury subpoenas to Google that shed light on how federal investigators interact with tech companies and how they respond to government requests for information.\n\nThe Mexican drug cartel CJNG may survive the killing of its longtime leader Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes in part thanks to its prolific use of technologies like drones, social media, and AI. Meanwhile, the Mexican Navy announced on Thursday that it had seized a semi-submersible vessel carrying nearly 4 tons of cocaine as part of a recent initiative to deter drug trafficking in the Pacific Ocean. The effort comes as the US has launched its own purported campaign against maritime trafficking via a series of deadly attacks on boats in the Caribbean.\n\nMeanwhile, as AI assistant agents like OpenClaw explode in popularity—and sow chaos around the web—a new open source project called IronCurtain is using a unique design to secure and constrain agentic AI before it can go rogue.\n\nAnd there’s more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nSetting an autonomous internet-enabled robot loose in your house should give anyone a moment’s pause. When that robot is a roving vacuum cleaner equipped with a camera and microphone that could be hijacked from anywhere in the world with nothing more than its serial number, it becomes an actual privacy horror story.\n\nOne such robovac owner, Sammy Azdoufal, discovered that absurd security vulnerability while attempting an experiment in piloting his DJI Romo robot vacuum cleaner with a PS5 controller. He found that he could instead control 6,700 of the robots in 24 countries around the world, with full access to the floor plans they generated of their owners’ homes and their video and audio feeds. When The Verge contacted Azdoufal, he was able to instantly access a Romo owned by a staffer at the tech news outlet just by knowing its 14-digit serial number. DJI has now fixed the vulnerability in response to Azdoufal essentially live-tweeting his findings. But the story nonetheless raises serious questions about the security of other audio- or video-enabled internet-of-things gadgets—not to mention ones capable of freely roaming your home.\n\nWhile the Department of Homeland has been hugely empowered under the Trump administration in its mission to deport millions of immigrants, the organization within DHS that serves as the United States’ primary cyber defender, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, has been neglected. Now its acting director, Madhu Gottumukkala, has been replaced as CISA seeks to find new footing.\n\nEven before that news, CyberScoop this week reported on the crises that have plagued the agency for the entire first year since Trump’s inauguration: A third of the staff has been laid off and entire divisions of the agency have been closed. Nominations for a permanent director have been blocked in Congress. Its capabilities have withered, and organizations that had sought out CISA for assistance and partnerships have looked elsewhere. Gottumukkala has suffered his own more personal scandals such as ousting security personnel after he failed a polygraph test and sharing sensitive contracts on ChatGPT. Now Nick Andersen, who has served as CISA’s executive director for cybersecurity, will replace Gottumukkala at the beleaguered agency.\n\nA researcher at King’s College London pitted three popular large language models against each other in simulated war game scenarios and found that, 95 percent of the time, at least one of the models opted to deploy tactical nuclear weapons. The researcher also found, when an AI model deployed a tactical nuclear weapon, its AI opponent only deescalated a fourth of the time. None of the companies behind the three models—OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic—responded to New Scientist’s request for comment.\n\nAI’s role in war-fighting has lurched into the spotlight this week. Anthropic and the Department of War are embroiled in a contract dispute over whether Anthropic’s AI models can be used to power fully autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance. Dario Amodei, Anthropic’s CEO, wrote in a statement that these types of use cases “can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.” In turn, President Donald Trump has threatened to ban the use of Anthropic products, including its Claude chatbot, within the US government. Meanwhile, hundreds of Google and OpenAI employees have signed an open letter asking for their bosses to “put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War's current demands for permission to use our models for domestic mass surveillance and autonomously killing people without human oversight.”\n\nA new app for Android phones called Nearby Glasses lets users scan for smart glasses in your vicinity, revealing the presence of the wearable gadgets, which are sometimes indistinguishable from normal glasses and let wearers record people without their knowledge. The app scans for the unique Bluetooth signatures that the glasses emit, and sends users a notification if it detects a nearby source.\n\nThe developer told 404 Media that he was inspired to build the app after reading about several incidents involving smart glasses. Over the summer, 404 Media reported that a Customs and Border Protection agent had donned a pair during an immigration raid, and this fall the outlet also reported that men were using smart glasses to film massage parlor workers, seemingly without their knowledge or consent. In February, The New York Times reported that one smart-glasses developer, Meta, had plans to integrate face recognition into its glasses, spurring fresh concerns among privacy experts."

To capture them on video, I tried out the Galaxy S26's new Horizontal Lock, an extremely forgiving image stabilization mode. As my colleague Abrar Al-Heeti noted in her first take, with the camera feature turned on, you can tilt the phone as much as you want while the horizon remains steady.\n\nFirst, I reviewed CNET's hands-on sessions with the new mode. I overrotated the phone 90 degrees in one direction and flipped it 180 degrees in the other. Horizontal Lock worked exactly as advertised, showing smooth footage you'd believe was shot with a phone held very still.\n\nThis was a great feature to try out on Barcelona's streets, turning my wiggling arm into a steady hand behind the camera as I tracked flashy autos speeding down Passeig de Gracia and Carrer d'Arago in the Quadrat d'Or.\n\nWith Horizontal Lock straightening my footage, I could send videos back to my friends at home with undeniable proof that I'd seen some beautiful cars -- like the Porsche Carrera GTS in the image above (a 904 from around 1964, if my Googling skills are to be believed).\n\nThe Galaxy S26's Horizontal Lock is a perfect assistant if you're shooting fast, agile subjects darting around unpredictably. The feature could also salvage videos from unusably shaky footage, a clear advantage when recording during emergencies, disasters or in war zones.\n\nAnd for everyday Galaxy S26 owners, Horizontal Lock makes casual videos easier to watch, ensuring they end up on the good photography subreddits rather than the bad ones."

Motorola's also attending, and considering the company revealed its upcoming Razr Fold at CES 2026, we'd expect the company to provide more details about the book-style folding phone.\n\nWe've also historically seen concepts at MWC that have never made it beyond the development stage but are still so cool to see. That's included Motorola debuting a flexible phone concept that you can wear on your wrist and Lenovo showing a solar-charging laptop.\n\nAnd even though Apple isn't expected to attend MWC, it's quite possible that the company might be debuting the rumored iPhone 17E over the course of the week. Apple has announced that it's going to be making new product announcements starting Monday in the lead-up to a March 4 event in New York, London and Shanghai.

            "content": "When you go to perform the dreaded chore that is cleaning your toilet bowl, you likely notice that simply flushing your toilet isn't enough to get the rim clean. However, this may soon be a problem of the past.\n\nAt KBIS 2026, the CNET team saw a new toilet from Japanese toilet manufacturer Toto, the Aurora Washlet Plus S7A, designed to increase toilet bowl cleaning coverage by up to five times compared to standard gravity-flush toilets.\n\nThe Aurora Washlet Plus bidet toilet uses a new flushing technology that cleans the entire bowl and rim in a single flush. Toto\n\nHow the Aurora Washlet Plus cleans itself\n\nAt KBIS, Toto unveiled its new Integravity System within the Aurora Washlet Plus. It's a dual-valve, gravity-driven flush engine that uses rim wash and siphon-jet action in sequence to keep your toilet bowl cleaner for longer. It also works in concert with Toto's Tornado-style flushing (which the company calls \"the best flush in the industry\") and the Cefiontect ceramic bowl glaze, which prevents mold and grime from sticking, to clean all 360 degrees of your toilet bowl in one flush.\n\nA diagram showing how the Toto Integravity System works inside the Aurora Washlet Plus toilet. Toto\n\nExtra fancy features on this porcelain throne\n\nIn addition to its cleaning capabilities, Toto designed the Aurora Washlet Plus to quietly flush with water efficiency. Per flush, it uses 1 or 1.28 gallons of water. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, the current federal standard is 1.6 gallons per flush, meaning this toilet uses at least 0.32 gallons less per flush.\n\nThe Aurora Washlet Plus also has an integrated bidet. If you're a bidet user, then you know how challenging it can be to keep the bidet wand clean, as well as the toilet bowl. To help with this, the Aurora Washlet Plus uses an electrolyzed water cleaning agent called Ewater Plus to auto-clean the wand before and after every use, and Premist to mist the bowl before every use to prevent debris from clinging. The stain-resistant Clean Resin material makes it easier for both the wand and toilet seat to stay pristine.\n\nThe Aurora Washlet Plus was named after the aurora borealis and inspired by its quiet power. Toto\n\nThe only setback\n\nThe toilet is impressive but you'll have to dump a lot of cash to get it. David Watsky/CNET\n\nWhile there's a lot to love about this toilet, there's one hitch: It costs $3,648 at full price. You can bring that price down to $2,418 if you go with the Washlet S2 bidet model instead of the Washlet S7A, but you'll lose some features. Certain retailers offer discounts, depending on your location, but paying thousands of dollars for a toilet is still a pretty penny. However, as humans, we do tend to spend quite a bit of time in our bathrooms, so if a futuristic toilet can make our time in there more efficient, it could be worth it.\n\nThe future of the toilet\n\nToilet designs like this one make us think there will one day be a future in which we no longer have to clean our own toilet, and that it will do all the dirty work (literally) for us. This type of feature, especially at a more accessible price, could transform the bathroom into a space for solely self-care rather than another item to check off our cleaning to-do lists. That's a future we can get behind."

            "content": "Downloading a VPN app, creating an account, choosing a plan and connecting to your VPN shouldn't take longer than a minute or so. Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nWith so many iPhone VPN apps available, it can be difficult to choose the right one. Based on our extensive research and hands-on testing of VPNs over the years, these are the factors to look out for when choosing the best VPN for iPhone:\n\nPrivacy\n\nThe most important factor to consider with any VPN is privacy. You should never use a VPN provider if you can’t trust that it's taking your privacy seriously, even if you have nothing to hide. Every VPN worth its salt should provide AES 256-bit or ChaCha20 encryption, depending on the VPN protocol you're using.\n\nYour VPN should also have basic privacy features such as a kill switch, DNS leak protection and a solid no-logs policy that is regularly audited. We recommend checking any provider’s privacy policy and reading its audit reports closely, as it’ll give you a good understanding of whether a VPN provider is serious about your privacy. If you notice a mention of data collection or sharing practices in a VPN's privacy policy that don't sit well with you, then it's best to trust your gut and look for a different provider.\n\nIf your privacy needs are critical, then you’ll need to look for a provider that goes above and beyond the standard privacy considerations. Your VPN should be based in a jurisdiction that has strong privacy laws that don't mandate data retention or logging. Choosing a provider that offers obfuscation is also necessary if you’re in a region or network that restricts or bans VPN use outright because it can help hide the fact that you're using a VPN in the first place.\n\nMany of the best VPNs are also rolling out post-quantum protections that help protect against potential future threats from quantum computers, which is essential for privacy-critical users now and in the future. Finally, your provider should offer either a RAM-only server infrastructure or employ full-disk encryption on its hard drives, both of which can help ensure that your data remains secure. There are also some other privacy features that aren’t as vital but still useful, such as ad-blockers, Tor over VPN and multihop connections.\n\nSpeed\n\nYour VPN's connection speeds can have a major influence on the quality of your streaming, downloading, video conferencing, gaming and general web-browsing activities. All VPNs slow down your internet somewhat, simply by nature of encrypting your traffic and routing it through one or more remote servers. To keep things running as smoothly as possible, you'll want a VPN that will have as minimal an impact on your regular internet speeds as possible. Generally, we've found that the best VPNs for iPhone only drop your internet download speed by an average of 25% or less. In our testing, we've seen as low as an average 3% speed loss. For bandwidth-demanding applications like competitive gaming or video streaming, you'll want a fast VPN.\n\nProvider Speed loss Surfshark 21% ExpressVPN 18% NordVPN 3% PIA 49%\n\nUsability\n\nA good VPN for iPhone should run smoothly and be easy to use, regardless of your technical expertise. It should have all of the features you need easily accessible with a tap of your finger. Many of the best iPhone VPN apps also include an easy way to get in touch with support directly from the device, which can be helpful if you need assistance on the go. Basically, your VPN app should be as easy for you to use as your iPhone itself. It should have a large network of servers around the world so you can connect easily and reliably from wherever you may be traveling and be able to help you access geo-restricted content from various regions.\n\nServer network\n\nThink about the cities, states and countries you travel to the most, or want to make it look like you're connecting from. Most of our top-rated VPNs feature thousands of servers in 100-plus countries. Large server networks benefit travel, since you can find a server near where you are for a fast, reliable connection -- usually, the closer you are physically to a VPN server, the less speed loss you'll experience. Additionally, a generous VPN server network is great for unblocking streaming content, since you've got a better chance of finding servers in countries you need to make it look like you're in. Plus, more servers may help maintain better internet speeds, because servers overloaded with users may slow down.\n\nAlongside the total number of servers and countries, think about specialty servers. Some VPN providers, including ExpressVPN, let you torrent on any servers, whereas other VPN providers, like NordVPN and Proton VPN, have P2P servers optimized for peer-to-peer file-sharing.\n\nCertain VPN providers offer servers with beefed-up privacy. For instance, you might find a double VPN, or multihop, VPN servers that feature a second VPN connection to make it even more difficult to trace your web traffic back to you. Likewise, some VPN companies have Tor over VPN, or Onion over VPN servers, which tout similar benefits, with the main difference being that multihop relies on a pair of VPN connections, while onion VPN uses a combination of Tor and a VPN connection simultaneously.\n\nStreaming content unblocking\n\nBecause VPNs route your web traffic through a remote VPN server and change your IP address, apps you use and websites you visit will register your connection as originating from a different location. For instance, if you're in New York City but connected to a VPN server in the UK, apps like Netflix will think you're across the pond. Many streaming services, like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, BBC iPlayer and CBC Gem, rely on your IP address to load content. Depending on your IP address, which contains general geographical information, the content library might vary a lot or you may not be able to access anything at all. But with a VPN, you can bypass regional restrictions to unblock content on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other services. Using a VPN for streaming could even help you save money.\n\nCost\n\nDepending on your budget, you may want to take into account the cost and overall value of your iPhone VPN before making a purchase. VPN pricing can vary greatly from provider to provider but you can typically expect to spend about $5 to $15 per month for a monthly VPN subscription plan. If you want to save some money, you can choose an annual subscription, where prices can range from roughly $30 to $100 or more per year.\n\nYou'll want to be careful with free VPNs because you may end up risking your privacy instead of protecting it. Many free VPNs have slow speeds or have unreliable connections that frequently drop because of overloaded servers. Some even actively degrade your privacy, logging any internet activity through the VPN for sale to third parties or injecting ads into your browsing sessions. Proton VPN is currently the only free VPN that CNET recommends.\n\nMost premium VPNs offer a money-back guarantee anywhere from a week to 45 days. You can also get a seven-day free trial with many VPNs when you sign up through Apple's App Store, so you have options to try various iPhone VPNs risk-free before you decide whether to fully invest in one. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to save money on your VPN subscription.\n\nDevice support\n\nWhile you'll want a VPN for iPhone that works well on iOS, you may have other devices that you want to run a VPN on. Many VPNs work on Windows, MacOS, Linux PCs and Android devices. While Android TV and Fire TV apps are common for use on streaming devices, Apple TV apps are still on the rise. Providers like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Proton VPN, Surfshark, PIA and IPVanish offer Apple TV VPN apps. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) Think about the devices you want to install a VPN app on and make sure your desired VPN provider supports those gadgets.\n\nIPVanish Surfshark PIA ProtonVPN ExpressVPN NordVPN Windows ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ MacOS ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Linux ✔️ ✔️ (with GUI) ✔️ (with GUI) ✔️ (with GUI) ✔️ (with GUI) ✔️ (with GUI) Android/AndroidTV ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ iOS/iPadOS ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Fire TV ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Smart TV* ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Apple TV ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Router ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Browser plugin** ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Simultaneous connections Unlimited Unlimited Unlimited 10 8 10"

That's a gap Splendid Spoon aims to fill with its plant-based, gluten-free smoothies, soups, noodle and grain bowls, wellness shots and oats, which come frozen and ready to defrost in the fridge or heat in the microwave in just a few minutes.\n\nTo see how Splendid Spoon fares in the prepared meal delivery category, I spent two weeks trying the brand's dishes. I also had CNET's wellness editor, Anna Gragert, a vegetarian of 21 years who often eats plant-based, try all the offerings in its Five-Day Detox. It includes a set menu of oats, soups, smoothies, grain bowls and wellness shots, along with intermittent fasting. In early 2026, Splendid Spoon added four new oat bowls and two new grain bowls, which Anna tried and added to this review.\n\nBased on our testing, this is what we think of all the gluten-free, vegan dishes that Splendid Spoon has to offer.\n\nSplendid Spoon's Five-Day Detox includes oats, soups, smoothies, wellness shots and frozen grain bowls. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nHow does Splendid Spoon work?\n\nAs with most meal delivery services, Splendid Spoon is a subscription service, so deliveries will keep coming every week unless you pause or cancel, which you can do at any time.\n\nTo get started, you'll pick a meal plan with either six, 12 or 18 meals per week. The more meals you choose per week, the cheaper they'll be. Depending on what you order, you can pay anywhere from $4.25 to $13.49 per serving, plus $10 shipping. With the 12-meal plan, you get $10 off for free shipping. The 18-meal plan has $20 off, so you get free shipping and an extra $10 off your order.\n\nSplendid Spoon's three plans, plus savings. Splendid Spoon/CNET\n\nAfter you select your plan, you'll pick your meals, choosing smoothies, grain bowls, soups, noodle dishes, oats or shots. Meals are delivered to you frozen with dry ice and recyclable Climacell insulation. Your delivery day will depend on your zip code, and you can see all available options during checkout. As of now, Splendid Spoon delivers only to the lower 48 states.\n\nOn any given week's menu, you'll have over 50 meals to choose from, including around 17 smoothies, with sweeter options like mint-chip and more savory blends like carrot ginger and power greens. There are 10 grain bowls and about 20 soups, along with heartier rice and noodle bowls.\n\nSplendid Spoon has some interesting smoothie recipes. Some flavor combos worked better than others. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nWhat are Splendid Spoon meals like?\n\nAll the food is 100% vegan (no meat, dairy or animal byproducts) and gluten-free. The recipes are made with lots of healthy fruits, vegetables and superfoods like kale, spinach, beans and whole grains. The website says about 95% of the smoothies and wellness shots are organic and that it's all 100% GMO-free.\n\nThere's no shortage of interesting smoothie flavors to choose from, many of them packed with superfoods such as almond butter, kale and goji berries. Splendid Spoon/CNET\n\nMuch of the food is what I'd categorize as healthy food with a good deal of global culinary influence. Think brown rice taco bowl with beans and tomato salsa, or cauliflower tikka masala soup. You won't find many soy-based meat substitutes; these are mostly whole ingredients. Portions aren't huge but they aren't skimpy either, in keeping with the idea of healthy, balanced eating.\n\nBefore choosing any item, you can see the full ingredient list and nutritional information. You can also filter for more specific dietary needs, such as high-fiber, low-carb and high-protein foods.\n\nWhat's on the menu for the Five-Day Detox. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nWhat we tried and how we liked it\n\nI'll preface my critique of Splendid Spoon's smoothies by saying I make a lot of smoothies at home and so I can be particular. Because Splendid Spoon smoothies are preblended, they're a bit more like juices to drink and don't have that creamy, frozen texture I'm used to. Beyond the main ingredients, each one is fortified with healthy superfoods like chia seeds, hemp seeds and pea protein. These additions don't alter the flavor dramatically but deliver dense nutrients and antioxidants.\n\nSmoothies\n\nStrawberry and goji berry with cashew butter: This was just OK. A bit sour for my taste.\n\nCarrot and ginger with mango and dates: An excellent smoothie, with savory and sweet elements in perfect harmony. Anna agrees and especially enjoyed the zing offered by the ginger.\n\nThe carrot-ginger smoothie was tangy, tasty and not too sweet. David Watsky/CNET\n\nPower greens: This green juice smoothie is loaded with good stuff, including organic hemp seeds, chia seeds, spirulina, pea protein and kale. The banana and coconut balanced all the vegetable components with just enough sweetness. Anna, on the other hand, found the addition of lemon to give the smoothie a salad dressing-like taste, but still appreciated all the ingredients individually.\n\nBanana, flax and almonds: I make a nut butter and banana smoothie most mornings. This was different, and the lemon gave it a bright zing, but I still prefer my freshly blended version. This also wasn't Anna's favorite smoothie, as it was a bit tart with a texture that she didn't love.\n\nThe green smoothies taste more like cold-pressed juices. David Watsky/CNET\n\nBlueberry and coconut with acai and cinnamon: Another very good smoothie. The cinnamon and vanilla made it sing.\n\nBlue Majik smoothie with banana, dates, vanilla and cinnamon: A bit sweeter than the smoothies I'm used to, but still extremely tasty and satisfying. Anna also enjoyed this one.\n\nTasty and a fun color to boot. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nDragon fruit berry with pineapple juice, raspberries and avocado: Anna enjoyed the combination of pineapple, dragonfruit and raspberry, especially in smoothie form, as it was an easy way to get in some fruit.\n\nMint chip with Swiss chard, banana and almond butter: This was one of Anna's favorite smoothies, as it tasted like a chocolate-mint dessert. She especially appreciated the extra iron and fiber.\n\nThis one tasted like a chocolate-mint dessert. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nHidden greens smoothie with kale, almond butter and banana: Anna preferred this greens smoothie over the Power Greens one, as the vanilla and cinnamon gave it a sweeter, less savory flavor.\n\nCacao almond smoothie with almond butter, vanilla and cacao: This was another smoothie Anna enjoyed with its simple ingredients and sweeter flavor profile.\n\nNoodle and grain bowls\n\nKimchi fried quinoa: This dish was a good source of fiber and protein, but it was Anna's least favorite out of the three she tried. It was just a bit too spicy for her personal taste.\n\nThe kimchi fried quinoa was a bit too spicy for Anna's taste. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nFried tofu korma with peas: Reheated cooked tofu is often chewy and tough. Unfortunately, Splendid Spoon hasn't solved the puzzle.\n\nCreamy mushroom and spinach noodles: This rich noodle dish was 100% dairy-free but still satisfied my craving for a creamy alfredo.\n\nI reheated most of Splendid Spoon's rice and noodle bowls in a nonstick skillet, which I find gets better results than the microwave. David Watsky/CNET\n\nCoconut curry rice: This was really tasty. Anna found that the rice was nicely cooked, chickpeas and greens were a great addition, and the curry sauce was delicious. This was also a good source of fiber and iron.\n\nPurple grain bowl: In addition to loving this dish's punny name, I enjoyed its ingredients: chickpeas, cauliflower, red cabbage and tricolor quinoa.\n\nThe purple grain bowl, which is as tasty as it is punny. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nKale-pesto noodles with roasted tomatoes and vegan meatballs: A flavorful vegan pesto over al dente noodles. One of the better noodle bowls I tried.\n\nWild rice ragout: Anna liked the mix of grains (wild rice and quinoa), which paired nicely with the veggies and tomato sauce. It was also low in calories, fat and carbs.\n\nSplendid Spoon's wild rice and veggie ragout. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nDan dan noodles with bok choy and peppercorn: This noodle dish was packed with Sichuan flavors and had nice heat. The noodles were chewy and not mushy, just the way I like them.\n\nTofu teriyaki grain bowl: This tofu, brown rice and broccoli meal has a very light coating of teriyaki sauce, which makes it taste a lot healthier than other teriyaki meals I've had.\n\nThe tofu teriyaki veggie bowl had a light coating of sauce, giving it a fresher, less heavy flavor. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nSoups\n\nCauliflower tikka soup: I really liked this one. Light but full of warm Indian spice. Anna agrees.\n\nSpiced lentil and chickpea soup: Solid but not terribly flavorful for a soup that is billed as \"spiced.\"\n\nGarden minestrone soup: Filled with tomatoes, zucchini and kale, this soup tasted fresh and offered a nice mix of ingredients.\n\nThe garden minestrone soup is packed with veggies and greens. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nFennel consommé with dill: The bright fennel was overpowering and the only thing I could taste. I didn't enjoy this one very much.\n\nButternut turmeric soup: While the flavor was good (the orange zest was especially fun), Anna does wish this soup had more ingredients to make it heartier and more filling.\n\nSplendid Spoon's butternut turmeric soup is made even better with the orange zest. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nLentil kale soup: A delicious mix of lentils, kale and spices, this soup packed a flavorful punch.\n\nRed lentil dal soup: This 350-calorie soup was a good source of fiber (10g) and protein (17g) while offering a comforting flavor.\n\nA comforting, hearty dal. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nTomato quinoa chili: Tasty and satisfying, this was low-calorie at 290 calories and not as salty as some chili can be,\n\nGreen split pea soup: Tarragon and mint gave this soup a unique flavor different from other pea soups Anna has tried. It was also a good source of potassium and iron.\n\nThe tarragon and mint were nice additions. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nCauliflower potato soup: Anna was expecting this soup to be bland, but was pleasantly surprised by the addition of great northern beans, which added flavor and made the soup more filling.\n\nKabocha congee soup: While this soup was tasty, it was high in saturated fat (75% of the daily value) likely caused by the addition of coconut milk. However, if you're following the Five-Day Detox exactly, this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nBeans and greens soup: As promised in the title, this was a great mix of beans and greens. Another hearty soup.\n\nSplendid Spoon's beans and greens soup is a great way to get in your greens. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nBlack eye pea stew: A good source of iron, the black eyed peas in this stew were especially tasty.\n\nMasala khichri soup: Anna loved this soup with the addition of okra. The rice made it feel hearty and wholesome.\n\nThe okra was perfection. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nButternut ratatouille soup: The tomato broth paired nicely with the butternut squash and kale.\n\nOats\n\nGolden milk oats: This was previously the only oat-based dish in the ,detox and Anna thought it was tasty, especially with the addition of blackberries, almonds and cardamom.\n\nStrawberry milkshake oats: Made with coconut milk, strawberries and monk fruit extract, this oat dish tasted like a heartier version of a strawberry milkshake.\n\nThe strawberry milkshake oats actually tasted like a strawberry milkshake. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nCarrot cake oats: Along with carrots, these oats contain applesauce, pineapples, golden raisins and walnuts to create a filling and delicious morning meal.\n\nBlueberry almond oats: Anna loved the addition of lemon and almond butter in these oats. The lemon, in particular, brought a brightness to the dish.\n\nThe lemon perfectly complemented the blueberry in the blueberry almond oats. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nCherry berry oats: This was another tasty oat meal made even more fruity by the addition of strawberries and raspberries.\n\nWellness shots, various: My order came with five free wellness shots. I especially liked the watermelon, beet and ginger \"recovery\" shot, but all of them were tasty and went down smoothly. Anna also enjoyed her five wellness shots as part of the Five-Day Detox plan. She especially liked the blackberry-elderberry Immunity Shot and ginger-orange-lemon Wellness Shot.\n\nThe ginger paired nicely with the orange and lemon. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nHow to prepare Splendid Spoon meals\n\nThe drinks come completely ready to drink. They're also good to pop into the freezer if you need more time to get through them. The soups and bowls can be microwaved but I suggest reheating them gently in a saucepan or nonstick skillet. This method always produces more even heating and reduces the chance that you'll overcook the food.\n\nAnna's soups instructed her to rinse the package under warm water for about 30 seconds but sometimes it took more than that. After, she popped the soup in a microwave-safe dish and microwaved while covering for the recommended amount of time.\n\nWhat the Splendid Spoon soup packaging looks like. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nIs Splendid Spoon healthy?\n\nOur wellness editor found her meals to be healthy with no surprising nutrition facts. However, she emphasizes that anyone who is changing their diet in any way or planning to detox should speak with their doctor beforehand.\n\nWho is Splendid Spoon good for?\n\nBecause the food is truly ready to eat, Splendid Spoon is perfect for anyone looking to cut cooking -- or even blending -- completely out of the equation for a few meals per week.\n\nThe food is all gluten-free and vegan, making it a good choice for anyone following those diets. The portions aren't huge, so if you're trying to cut total calories per week, this meal delivery service might help. Splendid Spoon is also very Whole30-friendly if you're looking to eat less processed food and meals with more natural ingredients.\n\nThe wild rice and veggie ragout nutrition facts Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nThis is also a good option for habitual smoothie and juice drinkers looking to mix up their recipes and flavors but who don't feel like shopping for all the ingredients needed to make them.\n\nAnna agrees. For those looking for a detox program, the Five-Day Detox could potentially be a good option, as long as you speak with your doctor about it beforehand to make sure you're getting what you need from this plan. For instance, some may not get enough calories, as these plans are not one-size-fits-all.\n\nWho is Splendid Spoon not as good for?\n\nIf you have a smoothie routine that you have down to a science, the Splendid Spoon smoothies might feel like a slight downgrade. Yes, you'll taste new recipes and interesting flavor combinations but they're more like juices in texture.\n\nBecause the food is all vegan, this isn't a good pick for anyone who craves meat for breakfast and lunch or other protein-dense foods such as eggs. Because a lot of the smoothies contain fruit (sugar) and the bowls have grains, beans and noodles, this isn't the ideal meal delivery for someone keeping to a low-carb or keto plan, either.\n\nHow much does Splendid Spoon cost?\n\nSmoothies are $9.99 per serving; soups are $12.49; noodles and other dishes are $13.49; oats are $5.49; and each shot is $4.25. Shipping is an extra $10. With the 12-meal plan, you get $10 off to cover shipping, while the 18-meal plan offers $20 off, so you get free shipping and an extra $10 off.\n\nSplendid Spoon pricing is on par with plant-based competitors like Daily Harvest. My favorite plant-based meal delivery service, Mosaic Foods, is a few bucks cheaper at about $12 per meal.\n\nWhat Splendid Spoon looks like when it arrives. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nPackaging and eco-friendliness\n\nThe smoothies and wellness shots are all packaged in recyclable plastic. The soup bowls are made of post-consumer recycled plastic that can be rinsed and put in the recycling bin. As for the grain and noodle bowl trays, you can peel the plastic away from the cardboard and recycle the cardboard. The liner can be rinsed and may be accepted for recycling at your local recycling center (call to confirm).\n\nSplendid Spoon also uses dry ice instead of ice packs, which are rarely fully recyclable. The cooler box is also made from recyclable materials. Pound for pound, this is one of the most eco-friendly meal delivery services I've tested.\n\nThe Splendid Spoon Five-Day Detox frozen meals in Anna's freezer. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nShould you try Splendid Spoon? Our final verdict\n\nIn my second go-round with Splendid Spoon, my feelings about the healthy subscription service remain largely unchanged (hey, there's something to be said for consistency). Splendid Spoon smoothies, soups and meals are solid and mostly good but rarely great, made from healthy ingredients and largely free of allergens. There are enough recipe options to keep things interesting, with plenty of flavor combos for adventurous and safe eaters alike. At $4 to $13 per serving, Splendid Spoon feels pricey for a single smoothie or soup, and the better value can be had by ordering more full meals, such as the vegan, gluten-free noodles and rice bowls.\n\nAnna agrees. Although she didn't follow the Five-Day Detox program she received, she did try all the meals and smoothies and found them to be tasty. However, anyone looking to follow any sort of detox program should consult their doctor first.\n\nSplendid Spoon vs. the competition\n\nDaily Harvest vs. Splendid Spoon\n\nIf you don't mind a few minutes of smoothie prep, I might recommend Daily Harvest, which sends all the ingredients diced, frozen and ready to be blended with milk. If it's just the soups and bowls you're after, Splendid Spoon has a host of pleasant lunches or light dinners to choose from each week. They arrive fresh and ready to be eaten or popped in the freezer, saving you precious time during the morning and afternoon.\n\nMosiac Foods vs. Splendid Spoon\n\nFor bigger eaters looking for full meals that are more dinner-friendly, there are better plant-based services out there. Mosaic Foods is my No. 1 pick, featuring more interesting food for a slightly lower price per meal (and even cheaper if you choose family meals). Mosaic Foods recipes were more interesting and the food was very filling and well-prepared."

            "content": "If you have an Oura Ring, then you're likely familiar with Oura Advisor, the company's in-app AI chatbot that can answer questions about your health. Now, Oura, the maker of the smart ring, has launched its first proprietary AI model, like Oura Advisor, but specifically for women.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company announced that it would eventually launch this new women's health AI model within Oura Advisor to answer questions about menopause, the menstrual cycle, fertility and more. But as of right now, it's currently in testing under the app's Oura Labs tab.\n\n“This custom model is a fundamental shift in how we responsibly deploy AI in health to meet the needs of our members,” Ricky Bloomfield, Oura's chief medical officer, said in a press release. “Women’s health is too complex -- and too often overlooked -- to rely on one-size-fits-all systems. By designing a model specifically for women and grounding it in trusted clinical science and real-world biometric data, we’re setting the standard for how responsible intelligence should be built and expanded across more areas of health.\"\n\nWhat the new AI model testing looks like in Oura Labs. Oura\n\nHow this new women's health AI model was designed\n\nCreated by Oura's own team of board-certified doctors and women’s health experts, the new AI model is the company's first custom large language model, built using Oura Advisor's generative AI and Oura's biometric tracking and health-sensing algorithms. So, when a women's health question is asked, this new model is able to comb through its curated women’s health research library while analyzing the data collected by the user's Oura Ring to provide evidence-based answers.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, this new version of Oura Advisor was created to answer questions in a supportive way that doesn't dismiss the user's concerns.\n\nChris Curry, clinical director of women’s health at Oura and a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist, adds in the press release that this model aims to help people prepare for appointments with their doctors: \"For example, if someone asks, ‘Why has my cycle suddenly become irregular, and is that something to worry about?’ Oura Advisor can walk them through what’s typical, what their data may be showing and what would be most helpful to surface in conversations with their provider.\"\n\nOura, AI and privacy\n\nThis women's health AI model is currently available only for testing and feedback in Oura Labs, for which participation is optional. Even if you opt in, you can always opt out. Oura also states that it will never sell or rent your health data, and won't share your sensitive information without your consent.\n\nOura has outlined a future vision for what it calls “private AI,” which means all AI insights are processed and generated only on your device. The company also partners with webAI, an AI tech company that Oura describes as a \"platform for intelligence to operate securely, scale autonomously and evolve with users’ needs.\" Some of its processes, such as population-level algorithms, may use cloud or hybrid architectures when it makes sense for the task at hand.\n\nCorrection, Feb. 26: This story initially contained incorrect information about Oura's privacy policy. Oura's \"private AI\" is not a current feature, but is a future vision the company has outlined. Right now, AI insights are still processed in the cloud."

            "content": "There's a lot your smart ring or fitness tracker can do from your finger or wrist, but there is still certain information you have to manually log yourself in the app. Think meals you've eaten or the exact type of exercise you've completed. Until now.\n\nOn Thursday, health tech company Luna announced that its Luna Ring Gen 2 became the world's first smart ring you can talk to about your health. This is thanks to Luna Voice and the company's AI engine, LifeOS, which is powered by Gemini and compatible with Siri, meaning only Apple users can use this feature.\n\nAs the Luna Ring Gen 2 is the only ring the brand currently sells, it is the only one available with Luna Voice.\n\nCNET spotted this technology at CES 2026, when Luna unveiled its Luna Band, a wristband health tracker similar to the Whoop 5.0 in that it doesn't have a screen. Like the Luna Ring, the band can also use your voice and its AI engine to track your health information.\n\nLuna Voice is compatible with Siri and will answer your health questions through compatible earbuds or a smartphone. Luna\n\nNow, you can tell your smart ring when you eat a meal, take a supplement, drink a cup of coffee or when you just went for a run, so it knows what type of activity it picked up from your finger. You can also ask it questions about your health, and it will respond through a compatible smartphone or earbuds.\n\nYou won't need to open your app to add this information yourself, giving you one fewer screen to check.\n\n“This marks a fundamental shift in what a wearable is,” Luna founder Amit Khatri said in a press release. “The Luna Ring no longer just measures the body. It understands context, connects daily behavior with biometrics and communicates back in a way that fits naturally into real life.”\n\nIn a world full of screens, not having to log data your smart ring can't track is a welcome sight. Luna\n\nPlus, unlike other smart rings and wearables, the Luna Ring doesn't come with a subscription fee. Perhaps this is its greatest selling point.\n\nHere's the catch\n\nWhile the Luna Ring Gen 2 is priced at $329, it's not available in the US right now. This is a recent development, as on Nov. 19, Oura, makers of the Oura Ring, filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission against Samsung, Reebok (for the Reebok Smart Ring), Zepp Health (for the Amazfit ring) and Nexxbase (owners of the Luna Ring), stating that the companies are unlawfully importing and selling products that infringe on Oura Ring patents.\n\nOn Jan. 8, Luna Ring maker Nexxbase consented, stating that it would voluntarily stay out of the US.\n\nA representative for Luna told CNET that it is working toward once again making the ring available in the US in the next couple of months. As for the Luna Band, presales will go live in April with the launch planned for the end of May."
