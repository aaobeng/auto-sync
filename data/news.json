            "content": "BARCELONA have reportedly agreed to buy Marcus Rashford in a permanent deal.\n\nThe forward joined the LaLiga giants on an initial loan deal last summer after falling out of favour at Manchester United.\n\n\n\nRashford, 28, has been enjoying his time in Spain and has previously admitted he would like to stay beyond the end of the season.\n\n\n\nSpanish outlet SPORT have now claimed that Barcelona are committed to activating the release clause in his deal.\n\nIt was agreed in the loan deal that the Catalans would have the option to make his loan permanent for £26million.\n\nThe report has now stated that Barca chiefs and Rashford’s agents have been in discussions over the deal.\n\nThe update comes after it was suggested that Barcelona tried to get the fee lowered.\n\nRashford is happy with the deal despite having to lower his salary from £315,000-per-week to fit into the club’s salary structure.\n\nBarcelona have had to trim the wage bill in recent seasons in order to stay in line with LaLiga’s financial fair play system.\n\nIt is claimed that he would be handed a three-year deal to play at the Camp Nou.\n\nRashford’s wage would also drop to roughly £190,000-per-week in order to facilitate the deal.\n\n\n\nHe convinced Barcelona that he was worthy of a permanent deal with his performances on the pitch this season.\n\nThe forward has bagged ten goals as well as 13 assists in 34 appearances in all competitions.\n\nBarcelona did try to re-negotiate the fee with United but the English club rejected.\n\nThe Red Devils believe that the £26m fee is already a reasonable one for Rashford.\n\nMORE TO FOLLOW…."

            "content": "UP at the top of the Premier League, there is only one side who appear calm and relaxed — Manchester City.\n\nIt was great to see Pep Guardiola encourage his players to head off and have a cocktail following last weekend’s win over Newcastle.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt sends a message down the M6 to Arsenal that Pep’s boys know what they are doing.\n\nThey have been here before and know what it takes.\n\nSo, why not have a beer and a couple of days to rest or travel?\n\n\n\nHalf of that City squad will have had private jets waiting on the tarmac straight after the Newcastle win or first thing the next morning — just like some of those Chelsea players did following their FA Cup victory over Hull earlier this month.\n\nIt looks extravagant, but can make the world of difference when the games are coming thick and fast.\n\nOf course, there is a touch of mind games to all of this from Guardiola — he’s not going to be happy if his squad go out on the lash to the extreme.\n\nBut both things can be true at once.\n\n\n\nWhile Mikel Arteta is talking up their relentless pursuit of a title — having his players continue to push and grind each day — their biggest Premier League rivals are making out like they don’t have a care in the world.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL – BEST CASINO BONUSES FROM £10 DEPOSITS\n\nBut it can still also be a huge benefit for City over the run-in.\n\nThey know just how gruelling it can be over the final furlong in a title race and Guardiola is taking the chance to allow his players time to switch off.\n\nPlayers drinking is something that has faded away, year by year, as the game modernises.\n\nBut unless they are going full-pelt in the bar, it is harmless and could actually do the players some good.\n\n\n\nWhen I was at that level and as fit as they come, I could get lashed on a Monday and be training on a Tuesday morning, no problem.\n\nNow, I’m not saying that this is conducive to being the best player you can be. But, once in a while, it allows you to disconnect your body and mind from football.\n\nIf you go out as a group, no one will speak about football and you see a different side to people you train with every single day.\n\nIt also takes your mind off the pain at times, too, because a lot of these boys will be playing with constant niggles and complaints at this stage of the season.\n\n\n\nBack when I was at Watford — and especially under Italian managers — I played with some guys who would have a glass of wine with dinner the night before games.\n\nIt just allowed them to switch off a bit and get a better night’s sleep, feeling much more relaxed about what was to come the next day.\n\nManagers allowing this sort of thing to happen also shows a level of trust, which is invaluable.\n\nSee the Spanish Grand Prix for just £569 WE’VE got an amazing price on a trip to the Spanish GP in June – but you’ll have to be quick.

Don’t miss Spanish GP trip for just £569\n\nIn a world of modern football where players are constantly told to watch what they say, where they go or what they post on social media, being told to go and enjoy yourself is a precious luxury.\n\nBack in 2017-18, when we were in the relegation zone, I had to speak to Gino Pozzo about giving the squad some time off.\n\n\n\nWe all went away and I flew to Paris for a couple of days — just like Erling Haaland has this week — and came back revived and ready to go again.\n\nWe finished 14th that season.\n\nThe same can be true at the other end of the table.\n\nOf course, City want to be the ones in the lead but, oddly, they are in a very good position in second.\n\n\n\nAll the focus and talk is about Arsenal, who everyone thinks have the better squad and are almost nailed-on for the title.\n\nSo there is precious little pressure on those over at the Etihad — and Guardiola wants Arteta and Arsenal to know that they are enjoying the place they are in.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nSo, cheers to City and Pep for allowing his players the time and space to enjoy themselves a bit.\n\nAnd it could end up making the world of difference come the end of this season . . ."

            "content": "THE Man Utd Files are back – bigger and better than ever! SunSport’s United reporters Samuel Luckhurst and Katherine Walsh lift the lid on all the gossip inside Old Trafford.\n\nThis week we reveal in the Fact Files how CEO Omar Berrarda was denied the chance to meet Julia Roberts and Senne Lammens’ school trip; we have the weird and wonderful in our X-Files as well as the latest from the Academy in the Youth Files. PLUS we have a new weekly quiz, a tactical breakdown and a full stat attack for the Crystal Palace game.\n\n\n\n\n\nFACT FILES\n\nJulia’s Snub\n\nPretty woman, the kind I’d like to meet, so the song goes.\n\nBut United chief executive Omar Berrada was denied the chance to meet Julia Roberts at Old Trafford last year.\n\nRoberts was a special guest at United’s stadium for the annual Soccer Aid charity match in June and Berrada was also in attendance.\n\nBerrada, like many 40-somethings, is a fan of the Oscar-winning actress and brought his family in the hope of meeting Roberts.\n\nRoberts, 58, had previously visited for United’s 1-1 draw with West Ham in November 2016 and met the players and their families after the game.\n\nBerrada was not as lucky, though.\n\nAs the Soccer Aid event was not run by United and Berrada was only present in a personal capacity, he was denied entry to the hospitality suite that housed Roberts for the match between England and the Rest of the World.\n\n\n\nSo the man who is effectively front-of-house at Old Trafford was turned away from one of his own doors.\n\nBerrada not the only football man to have been left broken-hearted by the A-List actress. Pep Guardiola was also devastated that Julia chose Old Trafford over the Etihad years ago.\n\nGuardiola said in a 2016 press conference: “And she went to visit Man United. She didn’t come to see us.\n\n“That’s why even if I win the Champions League it will not compare for the fact that Julia came to Manchester and didn’t come to see us. Even if I win the Champions League it will not compare to this disappointment I had.”\n\nHeaven Senne\n\nSenne Lammens conducted himself as impressively at Partington Central Academy on Wednesday as he did at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\n\n\nThere were screams of delight from pupils when Lammens entered the classroom and he spent time doing activities with the children ahead of World Book Day next week.\n\nThe goalkeeper then sat down for his first interview with the Manchester pack and his maturity, for a 23-year-old playing in one of the most pressurised positions in football, is remarkable.\n\nLammens said how much Tom Heaton has helped him and United sources say the two goalies have “hit it off”.\n\nThe goalkeeping contingent at the club believe Lammens can be a top-level goalkeeper for a long time.\n\nThey are particularly impressed by his handling of the ball and believe the next area for him to improve on is pulling off ‘unsaveable’ stops.\n\n\n\nGood as Nou\n\nNoussair Mazraoui sat down with fans for a Q&A at Old Trafford this week during United’s biggest Ramadan Iftar event.\n\nAround 200 people gathered for United’s second fan Iftar meal, in collaboration with its Muslim Supporters’ Club.\n\nMorocco full back Mazraoui mingled with guests and helped guide several academy players through the event, before breaking fast with dates, sweet cones and a Halal buffet.\n\nCarrick said he was “proud” of the culture and diversity at United in the wake of Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s immigration remarks, which the club distanced themselves from in a statement.\n\n\n\nUnited’s stadium CEO Colette Roche attended on behalf of the club.\n\nX-FILES\n\nKnow Way\n\nAmid the plethora of supposed ‘in-the-know’ United accounts on X, one has the same name as the nickname of a freelancer at the club.\n\nThe well-known Carrington attendant seriously approached someone at the club off his own back to assure them that the account does not belong to him.\n\nSesko Help\n\nBenjamin Sesko has invited people from Slovenia and other territories to become bone marrow donors.\n\n\n\nSesko is not an ambassador of the organisation but a family member of his was diagnosed with leukaemia, which prompted this message.\n\nRuff Break\n\nWork followed one of SunSport’s United correspondents during their week off as they came across Thomas Tuchel in London.\n\nTuchel had signed a new England contract only a week earlier to rule him out of the running to potentially take charge of United after the World Cup finals.\n\nThe German was walking his dog on a stroll down Portobello Road, where he was admiring a stall near the shopfront that appeared in the Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts (her again) film Notting Hill.\n\nWith its soft-pastel coloured houses, a George Orwell plaque and the delightful Electric Cinema, it is difficult to think of a similar street in Manchester that Tuchel could leisurely wander down.\n\n\n\nYOUTH FILES\n\nCome and Fletch Me\n\nDarren Fletcher is one of the most outgoing staff members at United but he remains off-limits amid the club’s Youth Cup progression.\n\nLike Travis Binnion earlier in the season, Fletcher has been asked not to do any press after United’s Youth Cup ties.\n\nThe United U18s beat Oxford United to qualify for the quarter-finals last week and they will take on Sunderland next month.\n\nShould they advance to the final, the chances are Fletcher will be ‘ungagged’. United did a media day when they reached the 2022 final and eight players spoke.\n\n\n\nKobbie Mainoo, who had just turned 17 at the time, was off-limits as he was too young. United usually wait until an academy talent has turned 18 before they do any external media duties.\n\nNoah’s Arc\n\nIt’s time for another academy prospect to get some well-deserved praise alongside JJ Gabriel.\n\nLeft winger Noah Ajayi is climbing out of Gabriel’s shadow after a brilliant month for the Under 18s.\n\nThe German teenager’s skilful solo run was the standout goal of the 6-1 victory over Derby on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nIt capped off a stunning display after he scored in the first-half, won the penalty dispatched by Gabriel and created the most chances in the match where striker Louie Bradbury also scored two.\n\nAjayi’s lethal partnership with Gabriel showed he was knocking on the door, but his performances in early 2026 have kicked it wide open.\n\nUnited feel Ajayi, who stands at 6 ‘2’’ and is among the best dribblers in the youth set up, has taken massive strides since Darren Fletcher‘s arrival last summer.\n\nAjayi is a strong ball carrier with a larger physical frame than most wingers, also having the end product to score or assist.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the player of the match award could have gone to either Ajayi, Gabriel or Chido Obi in the 3-1 win over City on Valentine’s Day.\n\nAjayi was the only one of the trio not to get on the scoresheet in the derby, but his ball carrying runs and link-up play with left back Godwill Kukonki caused chaos at the City Football Academy.\n\nA City supporter sitting in front of a few reporters could be heard praising Ajayi at half-time.\n\nFletcher initially rested him for the Youth Cup trip to Oxford, but he came off the bench to score a slick fourth goal in a 4-1 victory.\n\nAjayi is just as important to the U18s quest for the treble this season – in the league, Youth Cup and Premier League Cup.\n\n\n\nTEAM FILES\n\nPredicted XI\n\nThe question on everybody’s lips is whether Benjamin Sesko will start his first game under Carrick scoring four goals in six games from the bench in 2026.\n\nThe £74m striker has earned a start against Palace this Sunday and it coincides with a severe drop off in form from Amad Diallo in a false No9 system fronted by Bryan Mbeumo.\n\nCarrick has played down the severity of Lisandro Martinez’s injury which caused him to miss the win over Everton, but will be without the centre-back against Palace.\n\nThat means Leny Yoro will start again as a right-sided centre-back. Carrick has only made changes to his best XI in the wake of injuries, the first being when Patrick Dorgu was ruled out for 10 weeks.\n\n\n\nDEANO’S TACTICS – MAN UTD EXPOSED\n\nSunSport’s tactics guru Dean Scoggins has broken out the Tic Tacs to run through Man Utd’s big clash against Crystal Palace.\n\nWatch the video breakdown above.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nQUIZ TIME!\n\nTest your Man Utd knowledge with our new weekly club quiz below:\n\nSTAT ATTACK"

Commercial income rose by £300k to £42.2m.\n\nWest Ham’s wage bill rose by nine per cent to £176m following significant arrivals such as Nicklas Fullkrug and Aaron Wan-Bissaka.\n\nWith the Hammers now in the relegation zone, the accounts also warn that dropping to the Championship would be a “severe scenario” that would come with serious financial problems.\n\n\n\nHowever, the accounts confirm that the club are in line with financial fair play rules and are confident they will continue to comply.\n\nThe group accounts state: “The Group’s principal business risk remains that of the men’s football club being relegated from the Premier League with the serious financial consequences which follow.\n\n“The Club continues to comply with Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules and expects to do so in the future as the new Squad Cost Ratio (SCR) rules are introduced in the forthcoming years.”\n\nThe accounts state that the club would have to address any financial concerns from relegation by selling star names and potential further investment from owners and directors.\n\n\n\nWest Ham are currently 18th in the Premier League, two points from safety.\n\nThe accounts cover the period in which former manager Julen Lopetegui was sacked and replaced by Graham Potter, while director of football Tim Steidten also left his post following clashes with successive managers.\n\nCompensation paid to either Lopetegui or Steidten is not noted in the accounts."

I am not here to give advice to Mikel.”\n\nThe clip caught the eye of Arsenal superfan Morgan who shared the video to his 8.7million followers on X and wrote: “He’s so rattled.”\n\nIt was an opinion shared by a number of fans as they reacted to the clip.\n\nOne said: “He is feeling the pressure.”\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nAnother commented: “He’s rattled.”\n\nA third person added: “This is the first time I am seeing him this rattled.”\n\nThe title race takes its latest twists and turns this weekend with City in action first.\n\nThey are on the road at Leeds United on Saturday evening.\n\nAttentions then turn to the Emirates on Sunday as Arsenal welcome Chelsea."

The Gunners remain firmly positioned at the top of the table, holding a four-point advantage over rivals Manchester City.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, Pep Guardiola's outfit have a game in hand and could narrow the deficit to merely one point with victory away to Leeds United on Saturday evening.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThroughout recent campaigns, Arsenal supporters have become familiar with topping the league only to surrender the title during the final stretch.

            "content": "Fernando Mendoza - the potential No 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft - says the opportunity to be mentored by Tom Brady if he is selected by the Las Vegas Raiders would be \"fantastic\".\n\nThe former Indiana Hoosiers quarterback was attending the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis on Friday after a National Championship-winning season in college that has made him the hot favourite to be taken by the Raiders with the top selection.\n\nLas Vegas have one of the more intriguing quarterback situations in the NFL, as seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Brady became a minority owner in 2024.\n\nAlthough Brady is not directly involved in coaching, the Raiders haven't had a young, potential face of the franchise in the past two years for Brady to mentor. That is expected to change if the franchise invest a high NFL Draft pick in a quarterback.\n\nWhile Brady was not present in Indianapolis, 22-year-old Mendoza said they had spoken on the phone briefly, and was asked what he would think of working with the NFL legend.\n\nImage: Tom Brady is a minority owner for the Las Vegas Raiders and would be expected to help develop a young quarterback\n\nHe said: \"Yeah, I mean, who hasn't admired Tom Brady? I mean, more Super Bowl rings than anybody ... anybody!\n\n\"So, that opportunity would be fantastic.\n\n\"Brady, I believe, is the greatest quarterback of all time - by a wide margin - and to be able to have the opportunity to be mentored by him would mean so much.\n\n\"Especially to learn, and I'm all about learning. So from day one, I've got to learn a lot.\n\n\"It's going to be a long journey, and to potentially have a mentor like that, it would be pretty impressive and pretty meaningful.\"\n\nImage: Mendoza was a winner in college but will likely begin his NFL career on one of the worst teams in the league\n\nMendoza revealed that he had a \"great\" meeting with the Raiders, who appointed Super Bowl-winning Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak as their head coach earlier this month as they look to rebuild after a fourth straight losing season.\n\nAlthough he admitted there's no guarantee he will end up in Las Vegas after April's event in Pittsburgh, Mendoza was enthused about his meeting with the team.\n\n\"It was a fantastic interview,\" he said.\n\n\"The coaching staff were in there. We went over some of my previous plays and drew some plays on the board.\n\n\"I thought it was a great meeting, and I know they have the prospective No 1 pick, but anything can happen in the draft. I'm just excited for the opportunity.\n\n\"Whatever team drafts me, I'm just going to give everything I have to them.\""

There's a combination of horses that have been walloped for wins last time out and horses who are not well-handicapped. I kept going further and further down and ended up with Josh The Boss for two reasons.\n\n\"Firstly, he's a novice and is unexposed to a degree over fences. He's had more runs than I've had hot dinners this year. This will be his seventh start of the season. He is backing up after running at Newcastle last week but he clearly takes his racing well. He jumps well for a novice and I thought last time out he had the run of the race and jumped well aside from nodding on the back of four out.\n\n\"His old nemesis Prairie Wolf will not be in to beat him this day and although it's a worry that he won't be able to dominate this field, I do believe he wants a good, even gallop over this trip because he'll probably stay a little further. If he's bounced out of the race alright, with Jamie Neild taking 7lbs off he has got a handicapping chance.\"\n\nKate Tracey\n\n\"Vincenzo is a standout for me, he looks as if he's got so much more to come. Last time out at Ascot he won by two lengths from Bad. It was a messy race overall but it was really good form in terms of talented horses and a testament to him that he can still produce this kind of effort, sticking to his task really well after hitting the front at the last.\n\n\"He's only been given a 2lb rise for that and I thought that was very fair and he could be even better going back left-handed, which suits him really well. I hope he's got plenty more mileage in his mark.\"\n\nSam Boswell\n\n\"The good news about Heltenham, if you like him like I do, is he loves it around Newbury. He's had one bad run from about six efforts, with three wins and a second to his name. His second was on seasonal reappearance this year against Twinjets. He got beaten by 10 lengths but there's a stone in favour today in favour of Heltenham, which is a massive plus point.\n\n\"I know we don't get the services of Harry Skelton but these are the types of races they're winning en route to a championship and Heltenham is going to be a massive plus point through the spring. He obviously went up against Jonbon last time, which was effectively a run to get round - he managed that.\n\n\"I do hope going back to his favoured Newbury will bring out the best in him. Charlie Todd has ridden the horse before to reasonably good effect when finishing third. We're a double digit price and he's an each-way play, I don't know why he won't be all out to take a really valuable prize.\"\n\nWatch Weekend Winners in full on the At The Races YouTube channel..."

Two years on from a dramatic penalty shoot-out win against Lille in the Conference League, the two sides meet again.\n\nPantomime villain Emiliano Martinez starred on that day, saving the decisive penalty after avoiding a red card midway through the shoot-out, despite receiving his second booking of the game.\n\nTrademark celebrations soon followed as he soaked up the animosity from the French crowd. That, coupled with his antics from the World Cup triumph with Argentina over France, could create quite the cauldron at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy when he returns.\n\nImage: Emi Martinez celebrates Aston Villa's ECL victory over Lille in 2024\n\nVilla will be tasked with replicating the same success over two legs to continue their quest to end their 30-year wait for a trophy and if they do achieve that, the drama won't stop there.\n\nA meeting with Roma and on-loan striker Donyell Malen could then await, should they be successful in the tie against Bologna. UEFA rules state no team can influence what line-up their opponent selects and that would allow Malen to face off against his parent club in a bid to dump them out of the competition.\n\nPorto, Nottingham Forest, Midtjylland and Stuttgart make up the rest of that side of the bracket. Villa were undoubtedly handed a harder route to glory; the storylines running alongside it just add to the drama.\n\nHome advantage in second legs for seeded teams\n\nThe top eight teams from the league phase in both competitions are seeded and will have home advantage in the second leg of their round of 16 games.\n\nThis will extend to the quarter-finals for the teams that finished in the top four of the league phase if they progress.\n\nThe top two will also have home advantage in the second leg of their semi-final if successful.\n\nAny team that eliminates a seeded team will take their privileges.\n\nWhen are the 2025/26 knockout stages?\n\nRound of 16: March 12 and 19\n\nQuarter-finals: April 9 and 16\n\nSemi-finals: April 30 and May 7\n\nFinal: May 20\n\nWhere are the finals?\n\nThe Europa League final will be held at Besiktas Park in Istanbul on May 20.\n\nThe Conference League final will be one week later at the Leipzig Stadium on May 27."

We are aware of how we must compete today. We need to be focussed tactically too, they [Wolves] have a very tactical coach in Rob Edwards. We are definitely expecting a competitive match. Wolves are playing fresh at the moment, despite being at the bottom of the table. They are playing tactically offensive and individually in defence also. They are a demanding team for their opponent. We are ready but we expect a difficult match. Emery also says the reason Mings is not in the starting XI is because he has “a niggle”. Share\n\n11m ago 14.38 EST I love it when you get a very detailed response to a simple question. Simon Rigby has emailed in: double quotation mark A lot of thought has to go into a takeaway order for the football. You don’t want something that is going to be a distraction to your viewing experience. So noodle dishes or similar are out as they require concentration. In fact you can rule out anything Asian as far as I’m concerned, it’s too fussy for this situation. I want to be able to shovel in while keeping my eyes up, which means I also swerve the chippy. Curry has a good short-distance range, but for me it’s pizza. Make sure it’s pre-cut and then it only requires a but of hand-eye to get it from box to mouth. This is truly top stuff. Thank you, Simon. Share\n\n19m ago 14.30 EST We have a Wolves prediction! Paul Haynes has emailed in: double quotation mark I’m an optimistic Wolves fan. I think we will lose by less than a three goal margin. You love to see it. View image in fullscreen Photograph: David Klein/Reuters Share Updated at 14.35 EST\n\n23m ago 14.26 EST Here’s a real hard-hitting question for you on a Friday night, what is your takeaway order for a night of hot Premier League action? Are you going traditional with fish and chips, succumbing to whichever pizza ad you see first or going in a different direction? Now I can’t stop thinking about chippy chips… Takeaway god, Cole Palmer. Share\n\n28m ago 14.22 EST Another Villa fan has got a prediction, James Moriarty (not the fictional professor, one assumes): double quotation mark I’m a Villa fan still recovering from the Sherwood-Remi Garde years, I am optimistic this could be the game to get the season back in course after this year’s wobble. I predict a nervy game with a late goal to win from Rogers/Abraham/Mings the Merciless. I like the hedge to go with three names for potential late goalscorers! Any Wolves fans out there feeling optimistic? Share Updated at 14.22 EST\n\n34m ago 14.15 EST Antony T has emailed in: double quotation mark Great call on us being nervous. I’m hoping, like usual, I am completely wrong and to keep my mouth shut, so I’ll say Buendia is in the team based purely on that good goal v Spurs and the last min winner against Arsenal that were months ago - I’ve seen nothing since - and Ollie (he’s a Villa legend I won’t hear him being slagged off) but there are Labour MPs more confident than him right now. So yep prove me wrong lads. Buendia three assists for Ollie’s hat trick. Share\n\n44m ago 14.06 EST How do you lot see this one? There are clearly some jitters around Villa players and fans at the moment, perhaps because they know Wolves have a decent record against them at Molineux. That’s one of thise innate things you know as a fan, logically it shouldn’t have any bearing but it just does. Wolves have earned draws against Arsenal, Newcastle and Everton since the turn of the year, I wouldn’t bet against this one finishing all square either. Send me in your predictions via the email link at the top of the page. Share\n\n53m ago 13.56 EST So Unai Emery reacts to the draw with Leeds by making three changes to his Villa starting XI. Pau Torres, Lucas Digne and Jadon Sancho come in for Tyrone Mings, Ian Maatsen and Leon Bailey. On the Wolves front, it’s Toti Gomes in for suspended Krejci and João Gomes in for Tolu Arokodare. Rodrigo Gomes and Angel Gomes are on the bench for Wolves so we could see four men named Gomes on the pitch at the same time tonight, what a prospect. Share\n\n1h ago 13.49 EST Team news Wolves XI: Sá; Mosquera, Santi Bueno, Toti; Tchatchoua, Joao Gomes, Andre, Hugo Bueno; Bellegarde, Armstrong, Mané.\n\nSubs: Johnstone, Doherty, Wolfe, Lima, Gomes, Olagunju, Gomes, Arokodare, Edozie. Aston Villa XI: Martinez; Cash, Konsa, Torres, Digne; Onana, Luiz; Sancho, Rogers, Buendia; Watkins.\n\nSubs: Bizot, Lindelof, Maatsen, Mings, Bogarde, Barkley, Bailey, Abraham, Alysson. Share"

            "content": "The draw for the Champions League last 16 has produced some intriguing, heavyweight clashes featuring the renewal of old rivalries. If Manchester City’s meeting with Real Madrid arguably ranks foremost among them, Chelsea’s engagement with the holders, Paris Saint-Germain, and Newcastle’s duel with Barcelona are certainly not lacking in glamour.\n\nOr, in the case of Chelsea and PSG in particular, edge. The tie is a repeat of last summer’s Club World Cup final in New Jersey, which Chelsea won 3-0 thanks to two goals from Cole Palmer and with a team under the management of Enzo Maresca.\n\n“I’m so excited,” said Liam Rosenior, Maresca’s successor. “PSG are fantastic. I’ve experience of playing them in France [as Strasbourg manager] and I’ve always admired them. Luis Enrique has done a fantastic job there.\n\n“These are the games you live for, games that you come into football for. It’s going to be a great tie.”\n\nIn Rosenior’s three fixtures against PSG at Strasbourg he won one, drew one and lost one.\n\nLiverpool, meanwhile, will return to Istanbul as part of a tricky rematch with Galatasaray. Arne Slot’s side lost 1-0 in Turkey in a September league-phase meeting.\n\nArsenal have been handed a somewhat kinder draw in Bayer Leverkusen as they continue to compete on four fronts “We’re really excited,” said Mikel Arteta. “Let’s try to be there until the last stage of every competition. And then we’ll see what happens.”\n\nA Tottenham team likely to be prioritising Premier League survival will meet Atlético Madrid, meaning a swift reunion for Conor Gallagher, who joined Spurs from the Spanish club in January. With all 16 teams provided with a route map to the semi-finals, Atlético’s Diego Simeone and Tottenham’s Igor Tudor also know their sides are playing for a quarter-final date against either Barcelona or Newcastle. Should Spurs keep progressing, a north London semi-final against Arsenal is a possibility.\n\nIf Arsenal overcome Leverkusen, they will meet the winner of Bodø/Glimt versus Sporting in the last eight while Liverpool could face Chelsea, which would no doubt reignite memories of their Champions League battles from previous decades.\n\nShould Manchester City make it past Madrid in what will be a fifth Champions League knockout meeting in five years, Pep Guardiola could be set for a potential reunion with Bayern Munich on the basis that they overcome Atalanta, Italy’s remain representative in the competition, in the last 16.\n\nNewcastle’s meeting with Barcelona will reprise evocative memories of Sir Bobby Robson, who managed both clubs, as well as Faustino Asprilla’s treble at St James’ Park during a 3-2 Champions League win over the Spanish giants in 1997. The two sides also met at St James’ Park in September, with Hansi Flick’s side winning the league-phase encounter 2-1 thanks to two goals from Marcus Rashford.\n\nIn the Europa League, Nottingham Forest have been drawn against Midtjylland with the Danes doubtless bolstered by memories of their 3-2 win at the City Ground in the league phase in October. With Aston Villa, who face Lille, in the same side of the draw as Forest, there is no prospect of an all-English final, although they could clash in the semis.\n\nVilla and Lille crossed swords in a Conference League quarter-final two years ago, with Villa prevailing follow a rather chaotic penalty shootout featuring some theatrics from Argentinian goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez.\n\nCrystal Palace will face AEK Larnaca of Cyprus in the last 16 of the Conference League."

            "content": "Being teetotal, always asking questions and taking up yoga in his early 30s after a recommendation from Gareth Barry have played their part. But if one thing inspired James Milner to break the Premier League’s appearance mark then it is a trait honed during his formative years in Yorkshire: sheer bloody-mindedness.\n\n“Some things don’t change,” Milner says with a chuckle when asked whether his desire to prove people wrong was as strong as ever after his 40th birthday last month. “There’s people who are always going to doubt you but that’s always something that’s been at my forefront: to prove them wrong.”\n\nMilner credits his father for instilling the fighting spirit that has carried him through a remarkable 24 seasons in English football’s top flight. He started as a 16-year-old with Leeds under the watchful eye of Terry Venables, and has had spells at Newcastle, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Liverpool and now Brighton.\n\n“He knew what I was like and he used to say: ‘You don’t work hard enough, you’re not going to make it,’” he says of his father. “He’d never say it in a horrible way or anything like that. But he’d be like: ‘You got no chance of scoring the goal from there.’ And then [I would] take free-kicks and two shots later it’s in the top corner. He knew how to get the best of me.”\n\nThe same desire provided motivation after it seemed Milner’s career was finished in 2024 when he was unable to walk following knee surgery. He spent nine months on the sidelines before returning at the end of last season.\n\n“I think most people – the surgeon, the physio, people who knew what I had, probably every single person – thought I was finished; at my age being a footballer and what I had,” he says. “So it was probably that same thing that meant I’m still playing now: not to finish your career in a way that wasn’t really in your control. That was the drive really. I wanted to try to prove that I could get back from that because I don’t think many people could.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner salutes the fans after the final whistle in Leeds’ victory over Chelsea in December 2002, a month after his Premier League debut as a 16-year-old. Photograph: Gareth Copley/PA\n\nIt has been particularly satisfying for Milner that, having come off the bench more than 200 times in the Premier League, he started on his 654th appearance to break his former Villa teammate Barry’s record when Brighton overcame Brentford last week. “My body doesn’t agree to sitting still, so that’s why I don’t like being on the bench so much,” he says.\n\nHe relishes his role as the elder statesman of the Brighton squad and reveals that the teenage striker Charalampos Kostoulas has been joining him for yoga sessions. “I probably started maybe eight or nine years ago now, which I think Gareth put me on to actually,” he says. “We’re passing it down, so I’ve passed it on to Babis [Kostoulas] at this moment. He’s only 18, so he’s starting young.”\n\nMilner, whose rippling muscles bulge as he holds court at Brighton’s training ground in Lancing, recognises he has been fortunate that his career coincided with the rapid growth of sports science. He uses strengthening techniques created by the celebrated German athletics coach Frans Bosch to counteract injuries that have included a fractured ankle at Newcastle and 12 hamstring problems, meticulously tracks his sleep patterns and takes magnesium to boost a natural shortfall in his body. Milner believes the decision to never drink alcohol, made during his schooldays in Horsforth, outside Leeds, is another of the secrets to his longevity.\n\n“I’ve never had a problem with people drinking at all – I think it’s healthy,” he says. “Like if that’s the right time to do it and if that’s your thing to get away from football and go have a blast, then I’ve no problems with it all. But it’s just a decision I made that if it would help me, I wouldn’t do it.\n\n“When I first started playing you had maybe one or two physios, maybe a part-time masseur, one fitness coach. Now you’ve got five or six fitness coaches, you’ve got seven or eight in the medical team. So that’s been to my advantage that I’ve managed to learn from that to ask questions early.\n\n“I always ask questions: ‘Why are we doing this?’ Or: ‘Explain it to me so I understand and then I decide if it is the right thing to do. I’m not just going to do it because you say. Give me the information why. Give me the science behind it.’ It was interesting, a few of the messages I had over the weekend were: ‘You were a nightmare to work with,’ or ‘challenging to work with’. But I take that as a compliment that I push them to be better and ask questions and challenge them. The best people always come out and give you the exact reason why you’re doing it.”\n\nThings have changed from his youth, when Milner recalls “teacups flying and walls being punched” at half-time by irate managers. “You don’t see much of that now,” he says. “I just feel fortunate. I played through two eras; one when I was emerging and now another.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner, with then teammate Jordan Henderson, holds the FA Cup after Liverpool’s win in 2022. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nMilner was presented this week with three Guinness world records: one for the appearances, another for most consecutive Premier League seasons (23) and the third for the longest gap between his first and last Premier League goals (22 years and 248 days). The next milestone on the horizon is surpassing Teddy Sheringham’s record as the Premier League’s oldest outfield player at 40 years 272 days, though Milner has never been inspired by chasing records.\n\nHe is yet to open discussions with Brighton about extending his stay beyond this season – a prospect recently welcomed by his 33-year‑old head coach, Fabian Hürzeler – but is keen to stay and he denies fearing what retirement may bring.\n\n“When we have some days off I look forward to that: go and play golf, spend time with the family. So I feel whenever I finish, I’ll probably have a break and a rest because I’ve been so 100% for so long.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner with his three Guinness World Records certificates. Photograph: Paul Hazlewood\n\nHaving worked under Venables, Sir Bobby Robson, Roberto Mancini, Jürgen Klopp and many other of the game’s finest managers, Milner is well placed to judge what makes a good one. He rates his two seasons as a central midfielder at Martin O’Neill’s Villa as his best from an individual perspective, and has especially fond memories of winning City’s and Liverpool’s first league titles for a generation. There are doubts about his prospects of making the transition to the dugout when he hangs up his boots.\n\n“It’s such a hard gig, innit? You see managers getting a new contract and getting sacked in two months. People don’t get the time they deserve now. But the competitive guy in you thinks: ‘Yeah, I wouldn’t mind giving that a go.’\n\n“I’ve got a great array of different managers from different countries and different personalities to lean back on, so in one way I think it’d be a big shame to lose all that knowledge and experience I’ve built up, to not be able to use that.”"

            "content": "Liverpool had the highest wage bill in the Premier League when winning their 20th league title last season, the club’s latest set of accounts show.\n\nLiverpool’s wage bill increased by £42m to £428m in the year ending 31 May 2025, when a Premier League title triumph in Arne Slot’s debut season as head coach and a return to the Champions League increased revenue to a record £703m. The club’s wages-to-revenue ratio stood at a healthy 61%. It was the biggest wage bill in the division, ahead of Manchester City on £408m, and included bonuses for the record-equalling title triumph.\n\nCommercial revenue increased by £15m to £323m and matchday revenue by £14m to £116m. The figures contributed to an increase of £89m in revenue for the highest-ranked Premier League club in the Deloitte Football Money League. But the rise in wages, which pushed administrative costs up by £57m to £657m, resulted in a relatively modest post-tax profit of £8m. Liverpool had a £57m loss in 2023-24 after failing to qualify for the Champions League.\n\n“We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it,” said Liverpool’s chief financial officer, Jenny Beacham. “The 2024-25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men’s team winning our 20th league title.\n\n“The club does face significant cost challenges, including rises in administrative, staffing and operational costs, alongside the need for us to compete at the highest level of the game, across our men and women’s teams.”\n\nLiverpool’s latest set of published accounts do not include last summer’s record spend of almost £450m on new players, including the British record signing of Alexander Isak for £125m from Newcastle. Slot said recently that failure to qualify for the Champions League would be unacceptable for Liverpool this season and the competition “does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run”.\n\nOn Friday Slot said it was not difficult to resist the clamour to start Rio Ngumoha because the level-headed teenager had not been carried away by the hype. The 17-year-old made a huge contribution to Liverpool’s late win at Nottingham Forest last weekend after his 77th-minute introduction, especially after switching wings to replace Mohamed Salah on the right. That has prompted calls for Ngumoha to start against West Ham on Saturday, when Florian Wirtz will again be absent through injury, but Slot will continue to develop the youngster carefully.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rio Ngumoha made a big impact for Liverpool from the bench against Nottingham Forest. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\n“It’s totally not difficult because of how he is,” Slot said of putting Ngumoha on the bench. “And that is something special for a 17-year-old who has been hyped like he is throughout his whole career.\n\n“There has been a lot of talk about him because we can all see how special he is and his talent. He is handling that situation really well, which is a big compliment to him but also to his parents, who raised him that he is down to earth, works really hard, keeps going and doesn’t lose his head because a few pundits have given positive feedback about his game. If you start believing how special you are after a few comments from pundits, that is probably not the way to become the player he wants to become.\n\n“We have to keep his special quality and that is beating players in one v one. That is not 10 out of 10 times working, and it doesn’t have to be, but he has to keep trying. There are not many players in modern football that can take on one-v-ones on a regular basis and beat their opponents a lot of times. That is a special quality and that is why we want to take such good care of him because we have a lot of belief in how special he is.”"

            "content": "THE CLASS(IC) SYSTEM\n\nLa Liga has El Clásico, France has Le Classique, and Argentina goes full gun with its Superclásico. English football has no true equivalent, with Liverpool and Manchester United fans unable to agree on a name for their grand-slam meetings. Up in the land of fitba, there’s this weekend’s 450th Old Firm/Glasgow derby (delete as applicable according to your stringency on Scottish company law). And Germany has Der Klassiker, between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. The Bundesliga marketing suits have been out in force this week for the one game, played on Saturday evening, that brings extra eyeballs. Though questions are often raised over whether this is a true, classic rivalry; Dortmund have not won a league title since Jürgen Klopp was making his rounds in 2012.\n\nSince then, Bayern have celebrated a league title with lashings of weissbier outside the Rathaus every year save for 2024, when Xabi Alonso’s Bayer Leverkusen went unbeaten to wear the crown. Dortmund v Bayern, is it a historic rivalry? Well, not really, since Bayern’s dominance of the Bundesliga goes back to 1968-69, when they succeeded Eintracht Braunschweig and Nürnberg as champions. The 1970s took in Borussia Mönchengladbach as their chief rivals, what with Günter Netzer, Allan Simonsen and all that.\n\nIt was not until the mid-90s that Dortmund, with two domestic titles and a Big Cup in 1997 (run Lars Ricken VT) realised the dreams of their vast fanbase. Here is where the needle began, with a spat between all-round nice guys Lothar Matthäus and Andy Möller in 1996 and then Oliver Kahn’s flying kick on Stéphane Chapuisat before biting Heiko Herrlich’s ear in 1999. All good stuff if you want to build up a deep-seated rivalry. After near-bankruptcy followed their 2002 Bundesliga triumph, it took Klopp’s heavy-metal thunder for Dortmund to upend Bayern. Since then, while FC Hollywood strut to repeated titles, Dortmund have become football’s leading kindergarten, a finishing school rather than a credible challenger.\n\nThis season, Bayern are eight points clear of Dortmund at the top, and only a win at the Westfalenstadion will prevent another procession. “For me, it’s always a title in its own right, even if people say we can’t win anything more now,” roared Vincent Kompany, ever the hype man. “These games are also important to the masses.” Kompany’s Bayern face a Dortmund team probably unable to believe what happened against Atalanta in Bigger Cup, Ramy Bensebaini’s swinging heel into Nikola Krstovic’s head a moment to have them waking up screaming in the night for decades. What might also keep Dortmund coach Niko Kovac awake is the prospect of facing Harry Kane, living up to the standards set by Robert Lewandowski in modern times and Gerd Müller in Bayern’s first golden era, scoring 45 goals in 37 matches for club and country this season. Truly best in class.\n\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\n\nJoin Tom Bassam at 8pm GMT for red-hot Premier League minute-by-minute updates on Wolves 0-0 Aston Villa.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n“It’s not looking to the style now at this moment. The style needs to be in the second moment, because now it’s a question of life and death if I can say that in that way sportingly” – Igor Tudor, there, channelling Bill Shankly as he explains why Tottenham might not be wowing the league with whizzy play as they fight for top-flight survival.\n\nView image in fullscreen Igor Tudor: maybe he’ll talk about socialism next week. Photograph: John Walton/PA\n\ndouble quotation mark I just hope the hapless Dortmund defender Ramy Bensebaini (yesterday’s Football Daily) does not follow my path. I too was directly responsible for four opposition goals in one game: one came from my taking a corner that curved behind every one of my teammates, allowing five of the other lot to advance on our puffing centre-back; another was me slicing a clearance so badly that instead of arcing down the touchline, it went at 90 degrees, landing at the feet of an opponent with enough time and space at the edge of our box for his own Grand Designs project. I never again played any form of competitive sport” – Michael Hann.\n\ndouble quotation mark I feel compelled to point out that Ramy Bensebaini played left-sided centre-back of a back three against Atalanta rather than left-back (yesterday’s Football Daily). I noticed this because of the body language of his teammate Daniel Svensson each time Bensebaini recklessly served a goal up on Wednesday. Svensson was the recovering left wing-back at the Algerian’s side, head bowed and shoulders increasingly drooping” – Matthew Parham.\n\ndouble quotation mark I’ve come to the conclusion that the collection of words at the bottom of Football Daily’s full email edition (that rarely makes any sense to me) are a form of the popular location app what3words and give the venue of that evening’s secret ‘drinks’ for the hard-working hacks. It hasn’t escaped me that, when there are more than three words, my theory sheds more water than something that sheds water” – Shaun.\n\ndouble quotation mark Regarding yesterday’s last line ‘Hot Parents’ Chat Ahoy’ (full email edition), am I the only one wondering if it is the chat or the parents that are hot? Pray tell” – Martyn Shapter [neither – Football Daily Ed].​​​​\n\nIf you have any, please send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s prizeless letter o’ the day winner is … Michael Hann.

            "content": "Nottingham Forest have appointed a new director of performance, Tottenham’s former head of medicine and sports science Geoff Scott, amid concerns that injury problems have exacerbated their struggle to avoid relegation.\n\nScott spent 20 years at Tottenham until leaving two years ago after a clash with the then manager, Ange Postecoglou, who was in charge of Forest for eight matches this season.\n\nVítor Pereira was this month appointed Forest’s fourth manager of a turbulent campaign, and his side are two points above the bottom three before Sunday’s trip to Brighton.\n\nForest’s struggles have not been helped by injuries, with 19 players ruled out at some stage, one of the worst records in the Premier League. Only Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal have had more injuries, and those clubs have deeper squads.\n\nScott will take charge of an overhauled medical department, with the existing head of medical, Dr Prithish Narayan, understood to be leaving to return to work for the NHS.\n\nScott left Tottenham at the start of last season as part of a major restructure of Postecoglou’s backroom team, which led to the appointment of Adam Brett from Brighton as Spurs’ director of performance services. It was widely reported at the time that Scott had clashed with Postecoglou over the players’ workload and management of their recovery, with Tottenham declining to comment.\n\nTottenham’s squad has been devastated by injuries for the last two seasons under Postecoglou and Thomas Frank, with the club experiencing 41 injuries last season leading to 1,553 days out, the second-highest total in the Premier League after Brighton.\n\nForest have been drawn to face Midtjylland in the Europa League last 16. The Danish club won 3-2 at Forest in the league stage in October, when Postecoglou was in charge."

            "content": "1 Emery seeks to end Wolves duck\n\nUnai Emery has seen most things in this game but he has never won at Wolves. In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on direct rivals. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season. Will Unwin\n\nBournemouth v Sunderland, Saturday 12.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Back in business: Granit Xhaka looks set to give Sunderland a timely boost. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea, where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in matchday chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) as they sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL interpreters will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here. Andy Hunter\n\nLiverpool v West Ham, Saturday 3pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Liverpool fans sing You’ll Never Walk Alone before kick-off at Anfield. Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images\n\n5 Centre stage for Gordon against old club\n\nNewcastle may be in the last 16 of the Champions League but they are also 11th in the Premier League, two places and one point behind Saturday’s visitors to St James’ Park, Everton. “We’ve raised our game at times in the Champions League, there’s no denying that,” says Eddie Howe. “But we want to get into Europe every season and we’re desperate to get our Premier League form back on track. We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left-winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German, who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire on Saturday. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland.

Photograph: Bruce Rollinson/PA\n\n7 Hürzeler seeks home approval from fans\n\nGiven supporters were calling for his head after their insipid defeat by Crystal Palace the last time Brighton played at home, Fabian Hürzeler will be relieved that last week’s victory at Brentford has eased some concerns over relegation. Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track after a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croat’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and, considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance. WU\n\nFulham v Tottenham, Sunday 2pm\n\nView image in fullscreen João Palhinha (left) battles with Leandro Trossard during an uncomfortable afternoon in the north London derby. Photograph: Ian Walton/AP\n\n9 Amad to make way for Sesko?\n\nFor Michael Carrick to find a fall guy for Benjamin Sesko, who is seeking a first start under him, the interim manager need look no further than Amad Diallo. The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third goal in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes after the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "A European occasion that appeared ominous for Celtic instead provided evidence that it is never wise to write off Martin O’Neill. His side exited the Europa League in Stuttgart but the scale of spirit and togetherness visible during their 1-0, playoff second-leg victory emphasised that tales of their demise may be overstated.\n\nCeltic’s key attribute during a critical week, which begins at Ibrox on Sunday, is course and distance specialism. The shortcomings within, and patched-up nature of, O’Neill’s squad are blindingly obvious. This is, however, a club that has become accustomed to dominating Scottish football over more than a decade. Much earlier, O’Neill had demonstrated he could emerge successful from title scraps. Contrary to giddy analysis, there is nothing miraculous or remarkable about O’Neill’s work during his second short-term stint of the season. It is, though, immediately striking how a 73-year-old can achieve such buy-in from players. Faith in O’Neill within Celtic is absolute.\n\nThis Celtic season, typified by managerial upheaval and protesting supporters, retains a pulse. Stuttgart felt significant because Celtic, in makeshift form, displayed character. The easier option would have been to limp out of the Europa League. Instead, there was an unwillingness to concede an equaliser that reflects positively on O’Neill and his squad.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill (left) is in his second interim stint of the season at Celtic and has galvanised the players after a rocky period. Photograph: DPA/PA\n\nOn Sunday they face a Rangers team who are under considerable pressure to prove they will not deliver another campaign typified by false dawns. Rangers’ home form is strong but Danny Röhl’s team are yet to remove the sense of a soft underbelly, demonstrated by draws at Hibernian, Motherwell and Livingston. The most recent of those, last Sunday, was a horrendous result; Livingston had not won in 25 league matches. The stakes are huge for Rangers, who should be embarrassed if a net spend of about £30m is not sufficient to prise the title from Celtic – at one point managed by Wilfried Nancy – and a Hearts side assembled for buttons in comparison. Celtic’s seven Premiership losses to date match their combined tally from the previous two seasons.\n\nA Rangers win would place Celtic in tricky territory, five points behind their oldest foes. Celtic’s game in hand will be played in Aberdeen on Wednesday, before a return to Ibrox on Scottish Cup business. Hearts hope to extend their lead at the top to seven points on Saturday when Aberdeen visit Edinburgh. An Old Firm draw would suit Hearts perfectly.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rangers’ Danny Röhl speaks to the media on Friday – his side are four points behind Hearts and two above Celtic. Photograph: Luke Nickerson/Rangers FC/Shutterstock\n\nStuttgart gave O’Neill plenty food for thought. Luke McCowan’s terrific performance in midfield should afford him a start at Ibrox. O’Neill’s public backing of Kasper Schmeichel suggests he will restore the veteran goalkeeper despite almost weekly errors. Schmeichel’s deputy, Viljami Sinisalo, repelled Stuttgart. Auston Trusty’s suspension leaves Celtic weak in central defence. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was not in Celtic’s European squad, was surely signed to play in fixtures such as the derby.\n\nO’Neill is aware of a bigger picture, despite that hardly being his concern given he is due to leave in the summer. “European football is what big clubs in Scotland should be aiming for,” he said. “Not for the coefficient points to be dropping out of sight. It’s ridiculous. This is what it’s all about.”\n\nHis regular reference to the country’s coefficient, which is indeed dipping to a worrying level, is intriguing. There is a theory Celtic’s reluctance to spend heavily on players is linked at least in part to knowledge that their potential lack of access to European revenue in upcoming years could swallow up cash reserves. In a worst-case but feasible situation, Celtic could be staring at Conference League football. This does not, however, explain the horrendous lack of preparation for this season’s Champions League playoff tie. Sensible investment would have been sufficient to topple Kairat Almaty, who instead left Celtic with red faces.\n\nThe shadow boxing has started. McCowan has asserted no team in the league can touch Celtic when at their best. In truth, it would be more of a story had McCowan stipulated Celtic are also-rans. Röhl cast aspersions on Celtic’s approach in Stuttgart; this was amusing, given Rangers finished 32nd out of 36 in the Europa League table.\n\nAll Old Firm jousts are fascinating. This one carries more meaning than most. Events in Germany suggested Celtic are formed of the kind of substance that Rangers must be wary of."

            "content": "Nick Woltemade is the worst signing in Premier League history, according to Adrian Durham.\n\nOn the latest edition of Fiery Fridays, the talkSPORT anchor and stalwart labeled Newcastle United's record signing the worst ever.\n\n3 Woltemade made a brilliant start to life at Newcastle, but the goals have dried up Credit: Getty\n\nThe German international arrived on Tyneside in the closing stages of the transfer window from Stuttgart for £69million.\n\nHe came in to replace Alexander Isak, who was on strike in an effort to force a move to Liverpool.\n\nWoltemade then scored on his Premier League debut in a 1-0 win over Wolves with a towering header.\n\nBut lately, Eddie Howe has moved him into midfield to fill in for Bruno Guimaraes' injury.\n\nAnd in response to comments made by yours truly (me) on talkSPORT's Inside The Toon show, Durham hit back.\n\nSpeaking on the talkSPORT Daily Podcast, our chief live football anchor said: \"Nick Woltemade, I am going to say this - is the worst signing in Premier League history.\n\n\"This isn't anything against him, it isn't personal - I hear he's a very good teammate.\n\n\"But £65-70million for one of those, and we've got to delve deeper.\n\n\"I was in Newcastle the other night for the Qarabag game, the tie was done, so it was a chance for players to shine, and it was a night Newcastle had a free hit. Their expensive striker needs goals, and he starts in central midfield.\n\n\"Now, this is possibly because he doesn't trust him up front. He didn't play well in central midfield. Eddie Howe said he didn't play well in central midfield, saying it is the least he's affected the game since he arrived at the club.\n\n3 Woltemade recently ended his goal drought against Aston Villa Credit: Getty\n\n\"Now, on the talkSPORT YouTube channel, there is a programme called Inside The Toon, and it's all things Newcastle United, and Jack Cunningham is one of the contributors.\n\n\"He said, 'Newcastle should build the team around Woltemade'. Well, if Newcastle want to go down to the Championship that might be a brilliant idea. I do wonder what planet this guy is on.\n\n\"Is he a nine? No. One goal in 18 games is not a nine. Is he a midfielder? No, definitely not.\n\n\"Is he a ten? Have a look at the number tens around the Premier League. Morgan Rogers, Cole Palmer, Bruno Fernandes. Morgan Gibbs-White etc.\n\n\"There are better number tens in the Championship than Woltemade. Two Premier League assists all season, and when did Newcastle play with a ten? They aren't going to rip up that three-man midfield to put Woltemade at ten.\n\n\"Let's get this right. He is a footballer, he's got talent. But he has not got a place in the Newcastle United team, and I think that is the fundamental flaw here.\n\nInside The Toon on talkSPORT talkSPORT does Newcastle like nowhere else.

But it's the way Newcastle play, the fact they needed to replace Isak, Howe is putting him all over the park trying to find a place for him.\n\n\"£70m and he hasn't even got a place in the team? That's your big signing. That's a joke signing. So pound-for-pound, for what a team needed and what he brings, I make Woltemade the worst-ever Premier League signing.\"\n\nWell that's me told. But let's put it into context...\n\nDurham's comments came in response to the following point: \"He is someone you should build the team around,\" I said on Inside The Toon.\n\n\"It probably would be as a number ten, eventually because with Stuttgart players were always close to him. If you get players close to him, we can see what he can do.\n\n\"There were a few times against Qarabag, even in the second half when he was getting frustrated and losing the ball, there were times where he is picking up brilliant little pockets of space, and we don't find him.\n\n\"People are watching him and making him a scapegoat for things not working this season.\n\n\"You've got to accept that this is a £69million brilliant footballer, and you've got to find a way to get him in the team and work around it.\n\n\"There is this perception that because he's 6ft 6, he should score a load of headers. If you watch him, you'll realise that is not his game.\"\n\n3 Even if you discount his actual ability, the statistics for a forward in his first Premier League season aren't even that bad\n\nCase for the defence\n\nNewcastle at some point have to evolve if they are to be consistently a top side.\n\nWe see Arsenal and Manchester City play in different ways from game-to-game.\n\nBoth of those sides have a good mixture of technical and physical players, while the Toon have too many of the latter.\n\nWoltemade is very much a technical footballer, you only have to look at his goal against Brighton, the penalty against Nottingham Forest and his second in the 2-2 draw with Chelsea to know that this guy has incredible technique.\n\nThere are other moments of pure genius as well that show, with the right structure, Newcastle would get the best out of Woltemade.\n\ntalkSPORT understands that the Magpies are willing to sell Woltemade in the summer, which would be a mistake.\n\nEven if you don't rate him, Anthony Elanga and Yoane Wissa have so far contributed a lot less than the 6ft 6ins German.\n\nThe likes of Antony, Nicolas Pepe, and Ali Dia are somewhere breathing an almighty sigh of relief if Woltemade is the worst-ever top-flight signing.\n\nAnd forget about Premier League history, even just in Newcastle history, I can think of one signing who was far worse - Michael Owen.\n\nOwen was the Toon's record signing at the time, he spent the majority of it injured and never even wanted to be there.\n\nWoltemade has embraced life on Tyneside in every way, and for that alone, he's better than Owen.\n\nRegarding finding a place for him in the team, that is on Howe because he is at St James' Park now, and if you have to change the system to accommodate him, so be it because it would be a step in the team's evolution.\n\nHe has the ability and vision to unlock defences because we've seen it, and ultimately, Newcastle will win more games with him in the side than without.\n\nWoltemade probably won't turn out to be the Isak replacement, but for a club-record fee, the club have a supremely talented player who will prove everyone wrong.\n\nStarting with our very own Adrian Durham."

            "content": "THE mother of a 17-year-old killed in a drug-driving horror crash says no jail term is long enough for the man who killed her “best friend.”\n\nKeilan Roberts, then 21, had taken ketamine, cocaine, ecstasy and had been drinking when he killed passenger Chloe Hayman in Fochriw, South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the car hit a cattle grid, a railing pierced the windscreen and tragically killed Chloe instantly.\n\nChloe’s bereaved mother has called for young people to learn from the tragedy, and even hugged the man who killed her, according to the BBC.\n\nDevastated Danielle O’Halloran, 37, from Mountain Ash, said Chloe was her best friend and someone who “always saw the good in everyone.”\n\nRoberts had met Chloe in a nightclub just hours before and offered her a lift home with his friends.\n\nHe had intended to drop Chloe off the following morning but changed his mind and asked his pals to leave him and Chloe where his Skoda Octavia was parked.\n\nHours after the crash, Danielle was told the news — a moment she described as “too painful to relive.”\n\nShe said: “Your body can’t cope with the fact that they’re not there.\n\n“Like at that moment, I was just in shock.”\n\n\n\nRoberts, from Rhymney, Caerphilly county, admitted four charges linked to Chloe’s death.\n\nFootage captured on the bodycam of a police officer after the crash shows the immediate aftermath of the horror smash.\n\nRoberts can be seen standing on the side of the road, looking dazed and confused while holding a Peroni bottle.\n\n\n\nIn June 2023, he was sentenced, and following a family appeal, his prison term was increased to five years and three months with a 12-year driving ban.\n\nChloe’s mum had slammed Robert’s jail term as an “insult” after losing her “kind, loving, beautiful” daughter.\n\nDanielle said she was consumed by anger and hate: “I wished so many bad things upon him, I wanted him to stay there forever.\n\n“But I felt ill inside with the amount of anger I had. I just couldn’t let it eat me up any more.”\n\nThrough the restorative justice process, Danielle met Roberts, who was then 22, in prison — hugging him and confronting the man who took her daughter’s life.\n\n\n\nShe said: “We were both emotional when he walked in.”\n\nMeeting him face to face, Danielle says she realised that he had not meant to kill her daughter, but was “just a 21-year-old” who had made the “wrong choice.”\n\nNow, heartbroken Danielle hopes they can one day speak together in schools to warn young people about the devastating consequences of drink and drug driving.\n\nShe said: “I want young people to understand the lives that are shattered by one wrong choice.\n\n\n\nNo jail term is ever going to be long enough for what he did.”\n\nShe added: “I hugged him and said, I’m sorry you’re the one who has to live with this.”\n\nDanielle believes no jail sentence can outweigh the lifelong regret and guilt Roberts now carries.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“Coming back into the community is actually harder because you have to face people,” she said.\n\n\n\nShe added that society must do more to prevent risky behaviour, provide community support, and protect young people from the “glamorisation” of drinking and dangerous choices."

            "content": "SPOTTING Saul Murray’s flashy designer watch on Instagram, scheming Surpreet Dhillon quickly devised a deadly plot to steal it, luring in her victim with the promise of sex before he was drugged and killed.\n\nNow behind bars, she is seemingly just one of a growing number of women prepared to act as bait for gangs, as one expert exclusively reveals to The Sun why “honey-trapping” is becoming such a popular tactic used among criminals to target unsuspecting prey.\n\n\n\nFor victim Saul, 33, it was flashing his seemingly expensive timepiece online which made him a target to Dhillon, 36, who flirted with him on social media before arranging to meet him for sex with accomplice Temidayo Awe, 21.\n\nThe women headed to Saul’s flat in Luton, Beds, where they drank brandy before “sexual activity” occurred, and Dhillon secretly laced Saul’s glass with a date rape sedative to “knock him out”.\n\n\n\nWhen that didn’t work, male accomplices Ikem Affia, 31, and Cleon Brown, 29, were seen entering the property on CCTV brandishing a knife.\n\nTragically, his body was found in his block of flats the following day, after dying as a result of heavy bleeding from a stab wound to his thigh, which had pierced an artery.\n\nAnd it was all for nothing as the “Rolex” watch the dad-of-six was targeted for was later revealed to be fake.\n\nCriminology professor David Wilson says he has increasingly heard more and more cases like this, where honey-trapping is utilised as a method to hoodwink unwitting victims.\n\nHe explains: “Honey trapping is essentially a form of fraud. You’re presenting yourself as something that you’re not, in the hope that you’ll encourage a relationship to develop.\n\n\n\n“You’re going to present yourself in the most ‘ideal’ form you possibly can – having attributes and personal qualities or a personality that you know will culturally be attractive to the person that you’re trying to trap.\n\n“There is a stereotypical view that women will be less dangerous than men.\n\n“By and large, people would trust a woman rather than a man, so using a young woman as bait would be seen as easier than using a young man by a criminal gang.\n\n“There is always a hare and tortoise race going on when we talk about a crime and the police – the hare is the offender, and the tortoise is the criminal justice system.\n\n“Basically, the justice system hasn’t fully caught up to that technique yet. When they do, the [criminals] will move on [to another technique].”\n\n\n\nFor her role in the botched plot, Dhillon, from East London, was sentenced to ten years for manslaughter and conspiracy to commit robbery at Luton Crown Court, but this is far from an isolated case.\n\n\n\n£30k ‘orgy’ robbery plot\n\nIn another horrifying example, Vishal Gohel, 44, from Bushey, Herts, was expecting to have sex with three women in January 2022 before he was murdered.\n\nGeorgia Bruce-Annan, a 22-year-old Coutts Bank apprentice, first made contact with Vishal on classifieds site Craigslist before arranging the bogus liaison.\n\nDad-of-two Vishal was seen on a shop’s CCTV buying drinks, cigarettes and condoms ahead of the meet, borrowing £100 in cash from his mother and withdrawing £100 from a cash machine.\n\nBruce-Annan, who joked Vishal was her “sugar daddy” and Faith Hoppie, 22, headed to the victim’s property in a plot to rob him of possessions totalling £30,000.\n\nThey later let Tevin Leslie, 23, Sakeen Gordon, 22, and Brandon Browne, 23, into the home and when Vishal could or would not transfer them any cash, he was fatally beaten and throttled.\n\n\n\nIt’s a method that criminals use because it elicits quick compliance — the victim doesn’t see the threat coming until it’s too late. Dr Daniel Glazer ,\n\nThe next morning, Vishal’s neighbour found him lifeless on his bedroom floor, with gaffer tape around the lower part of his face.\n\nHis watch, the £200 cash and his iPhone had been stolen and a post-mortem found he had suffered a significant blow or blows to the head.\n\nBruce-Annan, from East London, received a life sentence for murder at St Albans Crown Court and Hoppie, from East London, was sentenced to eight years for manslaughter and conspiracy to rob.\n\nThe promise of a “sexual transaction”, David says, is “instrumental” in many cases like this.\n\nHe adds: “It’s a means to an end, to get access to more resources – the victim’s home for example, and the victim’s life. It’s very invasive. The victim has exposed themselves as who they are to somebody they believe was being honest.\n\n\n\n“That has a huge psychological impact in terms of their willingness to trust somebody again – and relationships are about trust at the end of the day. The stakes are actually incredibly high emotionally and psychologically.”\n\nClinical psychologist Dr. Daniel Glazer adds: “Most often, the victim is being promised a desired personal reward or fantasy.\n\n“It’s a method that criminals use because it elicits quick compliance — the victim doesn’t see the threat coming until it’s too late.”\n\nIt’s a horrifying scenario playing out in incidents across the country.\n\nIn Birmingham, gleeful Shannon Wolleter acted as bait so she could join her boyfriend and his two pals in launching a vile assault on their supposed friend, charity worker Anthony Cooper.\n\n\n\nThis honey trap plot wasn’t for money in this case, it was for revenge – the gang believed Anthony owed them £150 and disapproved of his partner.\n\n\n\nAfter pretending she was romantically interested in Anthony, Woolleter, 30, arranged to meet him for sex before texting her boyfriend Daniel Aston, 33, saying “got him”.\n\nIn a terrifying ordeal lasting four hours, Anthony was beaten by Steven Baker, 61, with his son Matthew Baker, 29, threatening to cut off his legs.\n\nThe gang also threatened to chop off their victim’s tongue, stamped on his genitals and struck him with an iron bar in the October 2021 attack.\n\nHoney trapper Wolleter, from Wilts, was sentenced to two years and ten months behind bars for kidnap and unlawful wounding.\n\nIn another revenge plot, Mundill Mahil was convicted in 2012 of grievous bodily harm with intent for her part in the killing of a TV executive and given six years inside, of which she served three.\n\n\n\nShe was found to have lured Gagandip Singh, 21, to her student flat in Brighton pretending she wanted to talk to him.\n\nInstead, two men waited for him in her bedroom, viciously beating him before leaving him to die in the boot of his burning car in 2011.\n\nWhile Mahil argued she had no idea he was in danger, prosecutors argued the motivation in this case was revenge after Mahil claimed he had previously attempted to rape her.\n\n\n\nHarinder Shoker, 20, was given a life sentence for murder and Darren Peters, also 20, was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter.\n\nMahil, then just 19, was jailed for six years.\n\nAfter her release she married a leading Labour councillor Varinder Singh Bola who was forced to quit as a mayor-elect of Redbridge, London when her previous convictions emerged.\n\nWhether they’re successful plots or not, using women as bait to lure in victims is a typically a carefully orchestrated crime.\n\nDavid says: “This isn’t random. It’s very constructed and carefully thought through. Fraudsters like this are very ‘good’ because they do their homework.\n\n\n\n“They are looking at the sorts of things that [victims] post on their social media, on their facebook page.\n\n“They are listening very carefully or reading very carefully and interpreting how you write about yourself and the kind of person that you might be seeking.”\n\nTeen honey-trapper\n\nTake Roani da Silva Sampaio, for example, who knew exactly how to portray herself to lure in exactly who she was looking for.\n\nPosing in a bikini on social media, she looked like she was living the influencer dream – but her lifestyle was simply bait for a high-stakes honey-trapping plot.\n\nAccording to reports, Sampaio was just 19 years old when she arranged to meet businessman Abel Landim for sex at his luxury apartment in Teresina, Brazil, in February 2021.\n\n\n\nWhile the temptress kept him busy in the shower, her boyfriend Francisco Moises Sousa Batista Jr and two accomplices broke into his property.\n\nTerrifying CCTV footage showed the three gang members kick down the door of the apartment before bursting into the home armed with a .38 revolver and an automatic pistol.\n\nBatista handcuffed victim Abel with plastic zip ties before beating him and holding a gun to his head for a terrifying game of Russian roulette, using a revolver with two bullets to terrify him into revealing where his valuables were stashed.\n\nThe gang stole cash, cameras, valuables and plundered the businessman’s bank accounts after forcing him to hand over his passwords and PINs.\n\n\n\nIncredibly, stricken Abel managed to call the cops as they ransacked his home, with the honey trapper and her boyfriend arrested on the spot.\n\nSampaio was jailed for 23 years and four months, while the three men – Batista, Jean Carlos and Thiago Ruan Martins de Sousa – were caged for 20 years.\n\nFrom the promise of a romantic relationship to a thrilling threesome, there’s no denying female honey trappers are currently seen as an easy way to gain the trust of innocent targets.\n\nBut, as David adds, nothing lasts forever – and as we become more aware of the techniques used by perpetrators, the less likely we are to fall victim.\n\n\n\nFinally he adds: “Honeytrapping will eventually fall out of fashion.\n\n“It will fall out of fashion because of articles like this – by drawing attention to it the public become more aware they have to be careful.\n\n“I always say if something looks too good to be true, it is too good to be true – you need to know the red flags.”"

            "content": "VLADIMIR Putin’s gymnast lover allegedly pocketed a staggering £63million in “leftover funds” from the construction of the tyrant’s £1billion Black Sea mega-palace.\n\nA bombshell probe claims cash that should have been accounted for after the despot’s lavish lair was built instead flowed straight into charities run by Alina Kabaeva – widely believed to be Putin’s secret partner.\n\n\n\n\n\nKabaeva, 42, is a former Olympic gold medallist long rumoured to share two sons with Putin, born in 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe explosive findings come from the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), set up by late opposition hero Alexei Navalny.\n\nThe vast estate near the resort town of Gelendzhik was first exposed by FBK in 2021.\n\nPutin and the Kremlin deny the clifftop compound belongs to him.\n\nOn paper, it is owned by a firm called Investment Solutions, allegedly buried in a web of shell companies.\n\nBut bank records reportedly showed Investment Solutions received loans from offshore entities in the British Virgin Islands, with the money filtered down the chain to fund construction.\n\n\n\nWhen work wrapped in 2023, investigators claim 6.5 billion rubles – around £63million – was left sitting in excess.\n\nAccording to the new FBK investigation, that eye-watering “surplus” was then donated to two non-profits controlled by Kabaeva.\n\nSome £29million allegedly went to the Alina Kabaeva Charitable Foundation, which publicly supports female athletes, runs a gymnastics festival and helped restore a church in occupied Crimea.\n\nBut Navalny’s team claims the charity‘s actual spending amounted to only tens of millions of rubles – with the rest reportedly parked in a deposit account.\n\nThe remaining £34million was funnelled to another Kabaeva outfit, Heavenly Grace.\n\n\n\nThat organisation reportedly splashed £288,000 at the Imperial Peterhof luxury watch factory, according to independent outlet Meduza.\n\nCash also went on gymnastics camps in the Novgorod region – which FBK claims were a cover so Putin and Kabaeva’s children could “play with others their own age”.\n\n\n\nThe bulk of the money, however, was allegedly stashed away, earning a reported 435 million rubles – roughly £4million – in interest in 2024 alone.\n\nNavalny’s group concluded the charities were nothing more than “slush funds” used to finance Putin and his secret family’s lifestyle “under the guise of philanthropy.”\n\nThe Gelendzhik mega-mansion has long been compared to a James Bond villain’s hideout.\n\nOne construction worker claimed it featured “a balcony hanging over the sea” where the owner could sip wine from palace stocks.\n\nBefore a revamp, it allegedly boasted a striptease stage and pole-dancing hookah hall.\n\n\n\nA May 2024 FBK probe found the palace had since been remodelled to include a church, complete with a wooden throne reportedly made for Putin, plus sacred icons and images.\n\nThree of Putin’s close associates – former classmate Viktor Khmarin, lawyer Nikolai Egorov and businessman Ilham Rahimov – are said to be shareholders in the official owner.\n\nThe palace cash storm erupts just weeks after Putin made a rare admission about his private life.\n\nIn a cringeworthy end-of-year Q&A, the divorced dictator was asked if he was in love.\n\n\n\n“Yes,” he replied.\n\n“That answers the final part of your question.”\n\nHe refused to name the mystery woman, but speculation instantly swirled around Kabaeva.\n\nIt comes as the Kremlin tyrant was accused in December of secretly grabbing an ultra-luxury £100million palace at Cape Aya in occupied Crimea – originally built for ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.\n\n\n\nThe sprawling compound reportedly includes a private hospital, operating theatre, cryochamber and gold-plated bathroom fittings.\n\nThe main house measures almost 97,000 square feet, with a second cliffside building hidden beneath landscaped gardens.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThere is also a private promenade, pier, artificial white-sand beach and helipad.\n\nFinancial records examined by Navalny’s team reportedly show the same funding network used for the Gelendzhik estate was also behind the Crimea complex."

Now, Heathrow Airport has issued a reminder about some essential new requirements now in effect.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUnder the changes, an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) has become a legal necessity for certain people from this month. This £16 charge permits travellers to enter the UK for tourism, family visits and other purposes for up to six months.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, the major airport announced this week: \"Starting tomorrow, 25 February, whether your final destination is the UK or are connecting via Heathrow, eligible visitors will need an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation).\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Find out more on http://GOV.UK.\" It then also stressed: \"From 25 February, you can't legally travel without an Electronic Travel Authorisation. Exemptions apply.\"\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nWhilst most UK visitors will require an ETA or visa to enter the UK, this depends on your nationality and purpose of travel. For example, an ETA is usually necessary if you're arriving from Europe, the USA, Australia, Canada and selected other countries.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEvery person travelling must obtain an ETA, including babies and children. Therefore, for a family of four, you'll probably need to pay £64 altogether, whilst a family of six will generally pay £96. Visitors may apply for an ETA on behalf of others.\n\nAnyone holding a British or Irish passport, or who has permission to work, live, or study in the UK, won't need an ETA. According to official Government advice, other exemptions include:\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Visitors can apply for the £16 ETA online or via the UK ETA app (stock image) (Image: d3sign via Getty Images)\n\nIt's important to remember that having an ETA does not guarantee entry to the UK. Those with a criminal record or who have previously been denied entry should consider applying for a Standard Visitor visa instead.\n\nBeyond this, the UK Government highlights exactly what can and can't be done with an ETA. For instance, the ETA allows:\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, these five things are not permitted with an ETA:\n\nStaying in the UK for longer than six months\n\nDoing paid or unpaid work for a UK company or as a self-employed person, unless you're doing a permitted paid engagement or event or work on the Creative Worker visa concession\n\nClaiming public funds (benefits)\n\nLiving in the UK through frequent or successive visits\n\nMarrying or registering a civil partnership, or giving notice of marriage or civil partnership - a Marriage Visitor visa is needed\n\nArticle continues below\n\nTravellers can apply for the £16 ETA online or via the UK ETA app. To complete this, they'll need a passport, an email address, and a payment option, including Apple Pay and Google Pay.\n\nThe fee is non-refundable after an application has been submitted.

Her killing prompted one of the most sweeping reforms of child safeguarding legislation in Britain.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nVictoria Adjo Climbié was born on November 2, 1991, in Abobo, Ivory Coast. She was the fifth of seven youngsters in an affectionate and nurturing household. As with countless parents across West Africa, her mum and dad were determined to secure the brightest future possible for her.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Marie Therese Kouao was handed a life sentence (Image: Press Association)\n\nIn 1999, when Victoria was merely seven, her great-aunt, Marie-Thérèse Kouao, proposed taking her to Europe, pledging she would gain a quality education.\n\nConvinced they were acting in their daughter's best interests, Victoria's parents consented. She initially landed in France, residing with Kouao for several months.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nYet Kouao's situation proved precarious, and following accommodation troubles, she opted to relocate to Britain. In April 1999, Kouao and Victoria touched down in London, where they settled with Carl Manning, Kouao's latest partner.\n\nShortly afterwards, Victoria's existence took a nightmarish twist. Rather than receiving the support her parents had envisaged, she endured appalling brutality.\n\nKouao and Manning routinely assaulted her with bicycle chains, belts, and even a hammer.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Carl Manning also received a life sentence (Image: Press Association)\n\nThey starved her and denied her warmth, compelling her to sleep in a freezing bathtub, restrained in bin bags. She was refused basic cleanliness, frequently left in her own waste, and experienced repeated violent attacks.\n\nKouao fabricated lies to disguise the maltreatment, claiming to others that Victoria was badly behaved or inhabited by evil spirits. Manning, a bus driver, subsequently confessed that he viewed Victoria as a \"soft target\" and would frequently strike her without provocation.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMissed opportunities\n\nVictoria had numerous interactions with social workers, medics, police, and even church personnel whilst suffering abuse. In July 1999, Victoria was brought to the Central Middlesex Hospital presenting severe scalding and contusions.\n\nA consultant suspected maltreatment and passed her case to social services. Nevertheless, Kouao persuaded officials that Victoria had inflicted the injuries upon herself. No additional measures were implemented.\n\nHaringey Social Services became involved on multiple occasions but neglected to conduct proper follow-up. A social worker called on Victoria but failed to examine the household circumstances comprehensively.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images There were multiple missed opportunities to save Victoria (Image: Met Police)\n\nDocumentation was mismanaged, and vital intelligence was disregarded. At one stage, a worried churchgoer escorted Victoria to a police station, but the officers neglected to probe deeper and simply handed her back to Kouao.\n\nA medic at North Middlesex Hospital voiced concerns about Victoria's state towards the end of 1999. Regrettably, his worries were dismissed, and Victoria was discharged.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFinal days\n\nBy the start of 2000, Victoria's health had taken a severe turn for the worse. She weighed a mere three stone and was riddled with wounds and scars.\n\nShe was critically undernourished and had sustained at least 128 distinct injuries.\n\nOn 24 February 2000, an unconscious Victoria, suffering from hypothermia and organ failure, was finally rushed to hospital. Despite the best efforts of medical staff, she passed away the following day, on 25 February, aged just eight.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA post-mortem examination laid bare the shocking extent of her injuries, with the pathologist characterising her condition as one of the most severe instances of child abuse ever documented in the UK.\n\nMarie-Thérèse Kouao and Carl Manning were apprehended and charged with murder. During the trial, Manning confessed to his part in the abuse, whilst Kouao maintained her innocence.\n\nIn January 2001, both were convicted and handed life sentences.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nReform\n\nIn the wake of Victoria's death, a public inquiry headed by Lord Laming revealed extensive failings throughout child protection services. The inquiry discovered that no fewer than 12 separate agencies had been engaged with Victoria's case yet had failed to respond adequately.\n\nThe report, released in 2003, triggered significant reforms, including:\n\nThe Every Child Matters initiative, which improved safeguarding policies for children.\n\nThe creation of Local Safeguarding Children Boards, ensuring better coordination between agencies.\n\nStronger accountability for social workers and professionals in child protection."

Two of the group were convicted of attempted murder and the other two of wounding with intent, under joint enterprise.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as your Preferred Source in your Google search settings.\n\nOn Friday, Bradley and Boyd appeared at Teesside Crown Court to be sentenced for attempted murder. Keenan and Azhar arrived from prison to be sentenced for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.\n\nA fifth defendant, 18-year-old Ebony Watt, joined the boys in the dock as she was found guilty of perverting the course of justice.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Tyler Bradley (Image: Cleveland Police)\n\nThe exact nature of the victim's injuries - as well as the impact the attack had on him - are unknown, as he refused to cooperate with the police investigation.\n\nBut Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Boulton, who carried out a report on the injuries, told the trial that the victim was struck so hard with the machete, it damaged his bones. He suffered a fractured skull in the attack and underwent further surgery on his arm, reports Teesside Live.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe 17-year-old had been out shopping with a friend at the Viewley Centre that afternoon before meeting up with Watt and two other women, the court heard. The teenage boys went back to Watt's home, where a disagreement broke out between the victim and one of the girls later that night.\n\nJolyon Perks, prosecuting, said the victim and his friend then left Watt's home. Watt messaged her friend Wayne Boyd saying: \"They're walking and coming back. Hurry up. Fast time.\"\n\nBoyd then contacted Bradley. The two teens, along with Keenan, turned up at Watt's home - but the victim and his pal had not returned, as Watt feared. They did return shortly after midnight and Watt then messaged Boyd and Azhar: \"They're here. Come now fast\".\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Kaya Azhar (Image: Cleveland Police)\n\nAzhar arrived on a scooter and the other three travelled on an e-bike, the court was told. The victim then fled, but was chased by the group, who first began attacking him on a balcony on Elmhurst Gardens. In CCTV footage, Azhar was seen \"encircling\" the boy on an electric scooter. The victim leapt over the balcony before the men chased him down Cramlington Close.\n\nCCTV captured Azhar carrying a \"zombie knife\" and Bradley and Keenan were also armed with large knives. The victim's friend ran another way, and the pack pursued their victim across the Viewley centre car park. When the victim fell on the pedestrian crossing on Hemlington Hall Lane, Mr Perks said the attackers pounced.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNearby residents \"heard the victim's screams\" and shouted at the attackers to stop. The victim managed to drag himself over a fence into the Phoenix Park estate where people came to his aid before emergency services arrived.\n\nMr Perks said Azhar did not take part in the attack, but stayed close to the men before messaging Watt that he wanted to come back to her house. In a message to Azhar, Watt told him to hide his knife in a hole in her garden fence \"cos if bobbies come, I'll get the blame\".\n\nIn one text message, Bradley said the police \"drones were up\" and that he was \"going to jail\" - prompting him to turn off his mobile phone. Boyd messaged friends asking if anyone could supply him with some trainers to swap into, before checking into a hotel on Acklam Road, with Bradley. Each of the four were found and arrested over the course of the next few weeks.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Leon Keenan (Image: Cleveland Police)\n\nMitigating for Bradley, Paul Newcombe asked the court to consider a suspended prison sentence, saying: \"He has behaved completely out of character.\" Judge Francis Laird disagreed, adding: \"He has 17 convictions for 47 offences, how can this be out of character?\"\n\nMr Newcombe told the court that his client's previous convictions were for \"minor violence\", with him once throwing a creme egg at a McDonald's worker and hitting a female shop worker.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJonathan Gittins, representing Boyd, said: \"He has not found life inside easy. He regrets his actions everyday. He wishes he had walked away. He knows he's let his family down, particularly his mother who is in court\". Boyd suffered \"a difficult childhood and has ADHD\" the court heard.\n\nBrian Russell said that his client, Azhar, made \"very poor decisions\" that night when he took a zombie knife to Watt's home and \"joined in with events\". But Mr Russell said that Azhar did later show the police where he hid his weapon, and forensic tests then proved he didn't use it in the attack. The barrister said: \"He's learnt a tough lesson\" having made \"stupid and disastrous decisions\".\n\nKeenan's barrister said he \"wasn't carrying a knife but accepts he was convicted as part of a group attack\", adding: \"Most 17-year-olds receive guidance from parents who tell them not to go out with knives - he didn't have that guidance.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEbony Watt \"was pregnant at the time\" and the father of the child \"had taken his ex-girlfriend on holiday to Turkey,\" barrister Lee Goodchild said. \"She is attracted to the wrong people - she is without strong figures in her life\". The court heard that Watt is homeless and \"sofa-surfing\".\n\nJudge Francis Laird said: \"This was a truly horrific and brutal attack. He was fortunate to have escaped with his life\".\n\nFor the attempted murder of the boy, Bradley was handed a 17-year extended sentence, made up of 14-years in prison and three-years on extended licence in the community. He will serve two-thirds of the prison component before the parole board can consider if it is safe to release him.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFor the same offence, Boyd was handed a 16-year extended sentence, comprising of 13 years in custody and three years on extended licence. He will also serve two-thirds of the prison component before the parole board can consider if it is safe to release him.\n\nKeenan was handed a 50-month sentence for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Kaya Azhar was sentenced to 48-months jail, for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. For perverting the course of justice, Ebony Watt was handed a two-year community order.\n\n\"Giving you a very short custodial sentence would do immeasurable harm to you and your daughter\" the judge said to Watt, who must attend 25-rehabilitation days and undertake a six-month mental health treatment requirement."

Britain as a junior partner to the United States has long been a primary target of groups like al-Qaeda and Islamic State who have thrived before in Afghanistan.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA western security source told the Mirror: “Clearly Afghanistan and areas in Pakistan returning to chaos and anarchy will act as a magnet for terror groups. They are there already and this situation will further risk of groups being free and able to plot against the west - and the UK could well suffer as a result.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSeveral Afghan cities including the capital Kabul and the second city of Kandahar were bombed in Pakistani air-strikes following an Afghan frontier attack on Thursday. At least 274 Taliban officials and militant fighters were killed in the bombing sorties as warplanes hit at least 22 Afghan military targets, with a dozen Pakistan soldiers dying in fighting.\n\nPutin blasts Ukraine with 500-bomb attack in defiance of US calls for war to end READ MORE :\n\nView 5 Images Taliban fighters check skies for fighter jets (Image: AP)\n\nHours after Pakistani warplanes rocked Kabul Defence Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif said: \"Our patience has now run out.

We have targeted important military targets in Pakistan, sending a message that our hands can reach their throats and that we will respond to every evil act of Pakistan.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt is believed to be the first time Pakistan has deliberately targeted Afghan Taliban officials and not focused on fighting groups. Pakistan blames the Afghan Taliban regime for terror attacks planned and launched from within Afghanistan.\n\nIt has even tried to blame Afghanistan for teaming up with India, blaming its other neighbour for terror attacks as it has done before. Asif said Pakistan had hoped for peace in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of NATO forces in 2021 and expected the Taliban to focus on the welfare of the Afghan people.\n\nView 5 Images Smoke billows after Pakistani strikes on border (Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut he claimed the Taliban had turned Afghanistan \"into a colony of India,\" with which Pakistan has periodically engaged in wars since independence from British rule in 1947. India's ties with Afghanistan have improved recently, with offers of enhanced bilateral trade, to the annoyance of Islamabad.\n\nTensions have been high for months, with border clashes in October killing dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants. Pakistan accuses Afghanistan's Taliban government of harbouring militant groups that then stage attacks across the border and also of allying with its arch-rival India.\n\nA Qatari-mediated ceasefire ended the fighting, although the two sides still occasionally trade fire. Several rounds of peace talks in Istanbul in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAfghan authorities in the eastern Nangarhar province said fighting was ongoing in the Torkham border area Friday morning. The province's information directorate said Pakistani mortar fire hit civilian areas in Torkham, including a refugee camp which had been evacuated overnight.\n\nView 5 Images Pakistan soldier guards border bunker (Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn response, Afghanistan was targeting Pakistani army posts across the border, it said. Asif accused Afghanistan of \"exporting terrorism.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMilitant violence has surged in Pakistan, with Afghanistan accused of supporting the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, and outlawed Baloch separatist groups. Tension has existed on the Durand line frontier between Pakistan and Afghanistan since 1893 when British diplomat Walter Durand created it as a buffer between the then British Indian empire and Russia.\n\nIt split the Pashtu tribe who live on both sides and make up most of the Taliban, whilst it did the same to the Balochs, who are also behind attacks in Pakistan. Pakistan accuses the TTP - which is separate from but closely allied with Afghanistan's Taliban - of operating from inside Afghanistan. Both the group and Kabul deny that charge.\n\nPakistan has also frequently accused neighbouring India of backing the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army and the Pakistani Taliban, allegations New Delhi denies. Afghanistan said Thursday's cross-border attack was in retaliation for deadly Pakistani airstrikes on Afghan border areas Sunday.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Police checks in Peshawar Pakistan (Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nThe governments have issued sharply differing casualty claims. Pakistan's army spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said Pakistani air and ground operations killed at least 274 members of Afghan forces and wounded more than 400.\n\nIt is believed 12 Pakistani soldiers were killed and 27 others were wounded. One Pakistani soldier was missing in action. Mujahid rejected the high number of Afghan casualties as \"false\".\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHe said 55 Pakistani soldiers were killed and also \"many\" Pakistani soldiers were captured. Thirteen Afghan soldiers had been killed, he said, and another 22 wounded, while 13 civilians were also wounded.\n\nPakistan's Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan's anti-drone systems shot down several small drones over the northwestern cities of Abbottabad, Swabi, and Nowshera Friday. He said the drones appeared to be part of a failed attack by the Pakistani Taliban, and there were no casualties."

Thompson has not re-offended, but Venables, both 42, was sent back to jail in 2010 and 2017 after being caught with child sex abuse pictures - he is facing a parole hearing in the coming weeks.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images James was abducted from a shopping centre in Bootle, in 1993 (Image: Press Association)\n\nVile thieves also attacked the grave twice in 2022, and Denise added: \"It has been targeted before and I'm certain that it's the same person doing it over and over again. This person has to be caught; they are causing great upset to our life. What individual does this to a baby's grave?\n\n\"We have now had to take everything off the grave because we're so worried that it will be targeted again. No mother should have to do that. All I'm doing is fighting for justice, running a foundation that gives hope to others who have had terrible times like us, and someone does this. It is absolutely disgusting.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nDenise added that a teddy bear was also missing from her son's grave, and said: \"Another thing that went missing was a yellow transformer bear called Bill the Bear that was in a bag. If anyone in that area so someone walking away with either the bear or a bag, then we urge them to come forward. This has to stop.\"\n\nMerseyside Police said it is appealing for information on the vandalised grave and has asked anyone with information to contact the police. Local Policing Inspector Chris Taylor said: \"We are taking this matter extremely seriously and remain determined to find the person or people responsible.\"\n\nIf you have information about the vandal please contact Merseyside police, on 101 or DM @MerpolCC on social media, quoting reference number 26000159300, or anonymously through Crimestoppers.

The trolley is on a pavement outside the supermarket and there are also boxes and litter on the floor.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

To think we eat and drink stuff that rats could of ran over. It is well below standards.\" Many people have also taken to social media to complain with one person saying: \"They're everywhere sadly.\"\n\nView 2 Images A customer said the scene made him feel \"sick\" (Image: GlasgowLive)\n\nMatalan store closures announced as more shops shut with 50% off sale READ MORE :\n\nMorrisons has since launched an investigation after becoming aware of the incident earlier this week. The supermarket chain said it took \"immediate action\" and are urgently looking into what happened.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the supermarket said: \"We treat food safety and hygiene very seriously. As soon as we became aware of an isolated issue outside Morrisons Daily Nitshill on Wednesday we took immediate action. We are urgently investigating this and are taking appropriate measures to manage the situation.\"\n\nThis week, Glasgow Live reported that rats continue to plague streets across the city, with the rodent population having soared for nearly the seventh year in a row. A Freedom of Information Request (FOI) has revealed that in 2025, there were 12,155 reports of rats both inside homes and on streets, up from 10,341 in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, a pest controller said that rats are becoming more of a problem on UK streets due to food waste. Mick Muldoon of Pestforce, who operates in north London said it's not uncommon to see 40 rats in one bin in broad daylight these days.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHe emphasised it wasn't too long ago bin collections were once a week - now it's once a fortnight. He said this results in local residents essentially “fly tipping.” This creates a lot of food waste which attracts rodents.\n\nHe said that a good warning sign of rats in your property is birds of prey circling your garden - this means there are rats below it. Mick told The Mirror : “We are in a perpetual cycle - the conditions are just so. Rats in particular are a very clever and adaptable animal. There are a lot of construction works that disturb rat nests - we are disrupting them and providing them with more food and harbourage.”"

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980. The bout was competitive, but Arguello scored the 11th-round knockout to retain his WBC super featherweight title.\n\nCastillo would lose his next bout, too, dropping a unanimous decision to Mexican legend Salvador Sanchez after leading the first six rounds.\n\nCastillo later lost to Julio Cesar Chavez in 1985 as the iconic boxer scored a sixth-round knockout at the Forum in Los Angeles.\n\nRuben Castillo (L) throws a punch against Julio Cesar Chavez during the fight at the LA Forum\n\nBoxer Ruben 'the Conquistador' Castillo has passed away at 68, according to the World Boxing Council.

'Definitely world championship material in a different era. R.I.P.'\n\nCastillo ultimately served as an announcer alongside legendary play-by-play man, Chick Hearn.\n\n'Ruben and Chick Hearn were gold on Fights From The Fabulous Forum broadcasts,' one fan wrote online. 'Great stuff.'\n\nHe also had a reputation as a positive influence on many young fighters and fans.\n\n'A great man,' his nephew wrote on Facebook. 'Both him and his family were a great part of my childhood. He always gave great advice, would be there when ya needed him. Going to parties at his place, doing golf charity events. He def was the neighborhood Uncle for alot of us.\n\nCastillo later served as an announcer on many WBC fights from the Forum in Los Angeles\n\n'A Family man, Boxer, Charity planner, we lost. Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God. May his wife Cindy, family and friends find comfort with the support of the so many who loved Ruben. Rest in eternal peace.'"

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure.

Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\n\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "The previously unseen reaction from Geri Halliwell to her husband Christian Horner being booed by fans in the wake of his sex texting scandal has been revealed.\n\nHalliwell, 53, was a semi-regular fixture on race weekends alongside her husband, often appearing in the paddock at prominent races such as the British Grand Prix, before he was sacked as Red Bull chief during the last season.\n\nIn February 2024, the paddock was stunned by a leaked cache of suggestive messages purporting to be from Horner. Horner was later accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour by a female member of staff, with an internal investigation led by KCs twice clearing him of wrongdoing. Halliwell supported him throughout.\n\nRed Bull GmbH in Salzburg - the world champion team's parent company - said in a statement: 'The independent investigation into the allegations made against Mr Horner is complete, and Red Bull can confirm that the grievance has been dismissed.\n\n'The complainant has a right of appeal. Red Bull is confident that the investigation has been fair, rigorous and impartial.\n\n'The investigation report is confidential and contains the private information of the parties and third parties who assisted in the investigation, and, therefore, we will not be commenting further out of respect for all concerned. Red Bull will continue striving to meet the highest workplace standards.'\n\nGeri Halliwell's previously unseen reaction to Christian Horner being booed after his sex text scandal engulfed Formula One\n\nSpice Girl Halliwell stood by her husband (right) as he was subject to an internal investigation\n\nThe exact nature of the complaints remain unknown, but Horner was questioned by a KC for a full day at a secret location last year as the barrister gathered evidence that he wrote up in 150 pages for the Red Bull board's determination. Horner always denied the accusations.\n\nStill, at the F1 72 launch event at the O2 in February last year, fans opted to boo him vigorously as he took to the stage to carry out his speech.\n\nHe wore a grin, and said: 'It's a pleasure to be at the O2, anyway. I hope everyone is having a good night.'\n\nNetflix cameras, meanwhile, captured the reaction of Halliwell. The Spice Girl could be seen watching on, also smiling, but seemingly concerned for her husband.\n\nHorner told the documentary: 'When you become a serial winner the crowd and the audience, they don't wanna see that. In Formula One, there's this element of pantomime, we're now like the Kardashians on wheels.\n\n'But I'm way past even caring what other people think.\n\nHe later added: 'You have to be the pantomime villain. We are different, and that's what makes us who we are. This isn't a popularity contest it's Formula One and you're judged on the result sheets at the end of the day.\n\n'It's easier to be the hunter than the hunted and of course, for us, anything outside of total domination, is not good enough.' He would later repeat the villain line when sat in the audience.\n\nHorner was sacked from his role at Red Bull amid a suspected power struggle at the Thai-Austrian constructor\n\nAfter his speech, Horner was seen awkwardly looking for directions to his seat in the crowd.\n\nAs Horner was booed, Ferrari duo Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc watched on, as did Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Liam Lawson.\n\nHamilton, stunned, could be seen backstage saying 's***.' Lawson, meanwhile, said: 'I think we are going to get a lot of boos,' to which Verstappen replied: 'I don't give a f***.'\n\nHorner was also present at Red Bull's new car launch on February 15 - three days before the event at the O2 - and spoke for the first time since allegations came to light, claiming Geri had been 'very supportive' before insisting he would be present at the Bahrain curtain-raiser.\n\n'I have a very supportive family and a very supportive wife,' he said. 'My focus has been on the job and the season ahead.\n\n'There's been a day job to be getting on with. I feel the support within the business and our partners, and within the industry. It is overwhelming.\n\n'There's a process that's ongoing at the moment. Some allegations have been made, which I fully deny and I have fully complied with that process and will continue to do so until it's dealt with.\n\n'Everybody's focused on one thing, which is the performance of that car to go out and defend both the world titles that we've worked so hard to achieve over the last couple of years.\n\nA shocked Lewis Hamilton said 's***' as he heard the reaction to Horner's entrance at the O2\n\n'So the car is what everybody is invested in and I look forward to seeing it in action in Bahrain next week.'\n\n\n\nHorner won 13 world championships in charge of the team since taking over as a 31-year-old in 2005. Mid-way through the 2025 season, however, amid a suspected power struggle at the Thai-Austrian constructor - and one year on from his sex texting scandal - he was sacked, and eventually left the team in July after receiving an £80million package."

Being blunt about everything that everyone thought wasn't right,' he added.\n\n'If you're five or six weeks in and you think he's not delivering, okay, then you have a point. But to throw out such strong opinions based on his first half hour, I thought, was inappropriate.'\n\nAfter Sterling's cameo appearance last Sunday, one Instagram account called FootballPark, boasting almost 100k followers, wrote that the ex-England international looked like 'Bambi on Ice' and even suggested he should consider retiring.\n\nThe author, who was by no means the only social media account ripping into the footballer, posted: 'Raheem Sterling's debut for Feyenoord was not exactly a success story – in fact, it looked like a veritable disaster from the Dutch club's point of view.\n\n'The English winger looked like Bambi on ice. On a downward spiral since 2022, lacking motivation, and seemingly unable to play under anyone who isn't named Pep Guardiola, Sterling is well and truly into his twilight years. Is it time to hang the boots up once and for all?'\n\nSterling's former Manchester City team-mate Jack Grealish jumped in to defend the 31-year-old star online, taking issue with the post.\n\n\n\n'What a f*****g stupid Instagram post man what's wrong with you guys. Guy hasn't played or trained for so long. Ppl like u guys is what wrong with the world. Have some respect,' he wrote."

            "content": "As James Milner reflected on becoming the Premier League's record appearance holder last weekend, his mind may have wondered back to last season - when a milestone that has long seemed inevitable felt like a distant dream.\n\nMilner was expected to be sidelined for only a few weeks after limping out of a draw with Arsenal in August 2024. However, complications with a routine knee operation meant that six months later he was still unable to lift his foot or toes.\n\n'Things change quickly in football, especially when you get to my age,' Milner recalled at Brighton's training ground this week, speaking to a group of reporters at a briefing to mark his incredible achievement.\n\n'When I look at where I was last year, not being able to lift my foot for six months...\n\n'I think most people, including the surgeon, the physio and those who understood the injury thought I was finished at my age.'\n\nAfter an arduous, near nine-month recovery, the 40-year-old - who celebrated his record with characteristic humility - returned from the bench for the final minutes of Brighton's game at Tottenham on the last day of the season.\n\nJames Milner became the Premier League's record appearance holder (654) last weekend\n\nMilner is now in his 24th consecutive Premier League season and is a legend of the league (pictured as a 16-year-old during his debut campaign for Leeds back in 2002-03)\n\nThe determination, professionalism and resilience required to battle back from a career-threatening injury are hallmarks of a man who made the first of his 654 Premier League appearances as a 16-year-old for Leeds United on November 10, 2002. That was nearly three years before his current midfield colleague, Jack Hinshelwood, was born.\n\n'It was that desire to prove people wrong that probably means I'm still playing now,' added Milner, who managed only four appearances in 2024-25.\n\n'I wanted to prove that I could recover from the injury and not let my career end in a way that wasn't in my control.\n\n'It might still might happen, but that was the drive. I don't think many people believed I could return.'\n\nMilner, who surpassed his former England, Man City and Aston Villa team-mate Gareth Barry to claim the record, boasts a resume that includes 61 England caps and impressive spells at Leeds, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Man City, Liverpool and Brighton - plus a brief loan stint at Swindon as a 17-year-old.\n\nHis enduring popularity and respect within the game was evident in the tributes that poured in last Saturday, and you'd be hard pressed to find fans of any of his former clubs with a negative word to say about him.\n\nMilner admitted his phone 'blew up' with messages, including one exchange with Barry, who he credits for encouraging him to take up yoga during the latter part of his career.\n\nDespite his age, Milner remains in exceptional condition, with no grey hairs in sight. His triceps strain against his training top, though he jokes his ankles crack when he tries to sneak quietly into his children's rooms to kiss them goodnight.\n\nHe is engaging company too, frequently drawing laughter with his self-deprecating humour.\n\nMilner pictured with previous record holder Gareth Barry in 2005 during their Aston Villa days\n\nHe suffered a career-threatening injury last season but battled back to take the record\n\nMilner's desire to prove doubters wrong has been a recurring theme throughout his career.\n\nPerhaps most notably, when Graeme Souness - then Newcastle manager - loaned him to Aston Villa for the 2005-06 campaign, he said: 'You won't win the league with James Milners'.\n\nSouness was dismissed the following February and Milner has gone on to win three Premier League titles - twice with Man City and once with Liverpool, where he also lifted the Champions League.\n\nIn spite of his achievements, the motivation burns as strongly as ever in a player who has worked under 21 managers.\n\n'You always have your doubters no matter what you achieve,' added Milner, who credits his father Peter for instilling that mentality. 'You want to be the best, and proving people wrong has always been at the forefront of my mind.'\n\nThis week, Milner was presented with three Guinness World Records; the most Premier League appearances (654), most consecutive Premier League seasons played (24), and the longest period between a player's first and last Premier League goals (22 years and 248 days).\n\nMilner has won three Premier League titles despite previously facing doubts over his ability\n\nMilner said he is 'very open' to signing a new contract at Brighton and playing another season\n\nHe may now have his sights on surpassing Teddy Sheringham's record as the oldest outfield player in Premier League history (40 years and 272 days). Milner is currently 40 years and 54 days old.\n\nThe midfielder is out of contract this summer, although Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has expressed a desire to keep him for another season. So what does the future hold?\n\n'I'm very open to playing another year,' Milner explained. 'Whether I will or not, I'm not sure. I haven't had any conversations with the club yet and they have to want me as well.\n\n'Earlier in the season, I said let's get to February and see where we're at. We're there now, so we'll see what happens. I'm just doing my work every day, and hopefully the last few games showed I can still contribute on the pitch.'\n\nMilner is undecided about moving into coaching when he eventually hangs up his boots, saying he plans to rest and take a break first. He insists he doesn't fear retirement, though he may miss the structure of professional football and could turn to marathons to give himself a new challenge.\n\nAs the conversation draws to a close, Milner believes the best individual season of his career came at Aston Villa. He ranks being part of the beginning of Man City's era of dominance and helping restore Liverpool to glory as his proudest achievements.\n\nAbove all, however, Milner is grateful.\n\n'When I was younger, if there was a bad first half, there could be teacups flying and walls punched in the dressing room,' he said.\n\n'Things have changed, but there's so much good in the game now as well. I just feel fortunate and lucky that I've played through, and been a part of, two eras.'\n\nYou would be foolish to write Milner off just yet."

            "content": "AARON WAN-BISSAKA INTERVIEW: I was at my lowest point at Manchester United - I was lonely, homesick and went back to London almost every day. Then Erik ten Hag's mixed messages left me totally confused\n\nUnlock more of the best of our journalism with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight and the writers you love every day\n\nInside a private cinema room on the ground floor of a modern apartment block in Canary Wharf, Aaron Wan-Bissaka is enjoying something rarely afforded to professional footballers: a moment of peace and quiet.\n\nIt is his day off. Dressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, he sinks into a plush seat with the same composed demeanour that has defined his game. Afterwards, he says with a smile, the plan is simple: take a nap.\n\nThat understated presence has long shaped Wan-Bissaka’s identity, a player more comfortable letting performances speak for themselves than seeking attention. Now with West Ham after a formative spell at Manchester United, he is in reflective mood, revisiting a journey that has carried him from London estates to Old Trafford and back again.\n\nAs the conversation unfolds, the story is as much about family and sacrifice as it is about football. Long before the bright lights of the Premier League, Wan-Bissaka’s football education began on the patch of grass outside his childhood home.\n\n'I was probably age five when I first fell in love with football,' he says. 'It was just me and my brother in the estate playing around with a ball. We would go out to the green opposite our house to play. We'd call it our Wembley.\n\n'It didn’t really click until around 16, when I realised there was a genuine chance of becoming a professional. That’s when I saw the opportunity to put my foot down and properly chase the dream.'\n\nDressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, Aaron Wan-Bissaka is in reflective mood when he meets Daily Mail Sport\n\nThough Wan-Bissaka grew up idolising Thierry Henry, he has grown into a highly dependable, no-nonsense full back\n\nLike many London kids of his generation, his first football idol was Thierry Henry. 'I always wanted to be him,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'Honestly, I used to have this vision of me being him, and growing up to be that sort of player. He was my idol. I think it was because of his composure. He scored lots of goals but he also carried the team. He was a leader. My whole family were Arsenal fans when I was growing up, too.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s boyhood dream contrasts with his reputation as a no-nonsense defender, and the 28-year-old’s career was ultimately forged through family resilience and a demanding relationship with his father.\n\n'I didn't realise how much my parents were sacrificing for my dream to begin with,' he says. 'When I got into secondary school, which is the age when you start to want things like trainers and boots, I was quite demanding. But they would brush it aside and be like, \"You have to wait a couple of months\". That's when I realised that it wasn't easy for my parents to give me the things I was asking for.\n\n'They worked cleaning jobs to afford my boots and my dad would get in trouble for leaving work early to bring me to training.'\n\nHis father Ambrose’s influence came through discipline rather than praise. 'It was difficult because there was a language barrier between us. His English wasn't great and my French wasn't great so there were only a few words exchanged at times,' recalls Wan-Bissaka, who has now played nine times for the country of his father's birth, DR Congo. They will face either New Caledonia or Jamaica next month in FIFA's inter-confederation play-offs in Zapopan, Mexico, for a place at this summer's World Cup.\n\n'We mainly spoke about football. But he was always critiquing me or telling me what I could do better. It was never praise. I have to say, I found it confusing at the time. I always wondered why he wouldn't praise me. I used to question myself: \"Am I not doing enough?\"'\n\n'Even after I scored, I would come off the pitch and he wouldn't be pleased. I used to just think to myself, \"Is one goal not enough?\" But then as I got older I started to understand it. He just wanted me to test myself and become the best version of myself.'\n\nAfter taking to Premier League life with ease at Crystal Palace, where he won player of the year in his first full season in senior football, a £50million move to United soon followed. It was the biggest step of Wan-Bissaka's career - and one of the most challenging periods of his life.\n\nWan-Bissaka felt extremely homesick after making a big-money move to Manchester United. 'Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep,' he admits\n\nThe defender's positive relationship with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a source of reassurance. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well,' says Wan-Bissaka of his former boss\n\n'When I moved to United, I really missed home, my family and friends especially,' he reveals. 'After training, I used to take the train back to London almost every day. It’s only about two hours, but it’s still a big commitment, and eventually it became exhausting, so I knew I had to stop.\n\n'It was something I wasn’t used to at all. I’d always been comfortable at home in London, surrounded by familiar people and places, so for everything to change overnight was difficult to adapt to. Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep. I struggled. It was probably the lowest I’d felt.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s big-money arrival from Palace in 2019 - which coincided with a first England call-up, though he was never capped due to injury - came with a mountain of expectation. But he quickly became a fixture in the United XI, starting more matches than any player across Europe’s top-five leagues in 2020-21.\n\nHis early relationship with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer offered reassurance amid his struggles off the pitch.\n\n'My relationship with Ole was good from the start,' he recalls. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well, and I think the rest of the players felt the same about him. He’s the kind of manager who backs you straight away. Once he gives you a job to do, it’s up to you to trust yourself and go out and deliver it.'\n\nManagerial turnover would later test that security, particularly under Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag.\n\n'Obviously, it’s football, every manager has their preferences,' he says. 'They might like you or they might not, and that’s just part of the game. When he (Rangnick) came in, it wasn’t the best period for me and there was a lot of criticism around…\n\n'It was difficult when Erik ten Hag arrived - as soon as he did, he told me I wasn’t in his plans. But when I tried to leave, he said he didn’t want me to go. I couldn't understand it. That was tough mentally, because it left me wondering what I was supposed to do next.\n\nWan-Bissaka initially struggled to gel as effectively with Solskjaer's successors, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag\n\nHis relationship with Ten Hag ultimately improved, and the pair lifted the Carabao Cup with United in 2023\n\n'I just kept my head down and told myself to keep training, keep improving, and play my game. Staying motivated was hard though, especially when you’re training without the clear goal of playing.\n\n'But the people around me guided me in the right way and encouraged me to keep going. Eventually things turned around and started to improve. You could say I changed or developed tactically under him, because that was something he wanted.'\n\nClarity, he says, is invaluable. And something the right back received from Michael Carrick. He speaks highly of United's recently-appointed interim boss, praising the simplicity of his messaging during his previous caretaker spell in 2021.\n\nNo wonder, then, that he backs Carrick to be given the permanent job after such an impressive start second time around.\n\n'He's someone you can trust,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'He will also trust you back if you buy into him and what he's looking to do. If you trust him, he will trust you.\n\n'He was quite simple in what he wanted from you. The boys were happy with him and the games he had when he was the manager. With him back at the club now, they are in a good place as a team. I think he should be given the full-time role. I think he deserves it.'\n\nIf Manchester represented pressure and growth, West Ham has provided renewal. The move back to London offered proximity to family and a fresh football environment.\n\nHis impressive form in his debut season saw him named 'Hammer of the Year' in May, beating out fan favourite Jarrod Bowen to the award.\n\nWan-Bissaka opens up to Daily Mail Sport's Charlotte Daly about his career - both the highs and the lows\n\n'At West Ham, I’ve been really happy with how things have been going,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'You can probably tell from the smile on my face'\n\nThough the club have struggled this season - sitting in the relegation zone with 11 games to go, despite an upturn in form under Nuno Espirito Santo - he has no regrets about making the move.\n\n'I was in two minds (about moving initially), to be honest,' he says. 'I had a year left on my contract, but I felt I needed to get back on my feet and start playing regularly - not just every couple of games.\n\n'Looking back on my time at Manchester United, I’m grateful for it. Those experiences made me who I am today and helped me both on and off the pitch, especially mentally.\n\n\n\n'With all the noise and scrutiny at a club like United, a change of environment can make a big difference. At West Ham, it’s not as intense… I’ve been really happy with how things have been going. You can probably tell from the smile on my face every day. I am playing with a smile too.'"

            "content": "Former Barcelona defender Jeremy Mathieu has explained the painful reasons behind him working in a French sport shop just six years after retiring.\n\nThe 42-year-old was once one of his country's finest centre-backs and helped the Catalan club to two LaLiga titles, two Spanish Cups and European glory during a successful career.\n\nBut Mathieu's life is drastically different now to the one he lived as a top footballer.\n\nLast year, fans were shocked to see him working at Intersport, a major chain of sport shops in his homeland, as a manager in their football department in a branch between Aix-en-Provence and Marseille.\n\nA photograph of the ex-Barcelona defender wearing company uniform and pictured with customers was shared online, prompting hordes of fans to visit the shop to see him.\n\nMathieu reportedly earned £100,000-a-week at Barcelona, so it was a surprise to see him working a normal job after hanging up his boots.\n\nFormer Barcelona defender Jeremy Mathieu (centre) now works as a shop assistant in France\n\nBut he has now spoken to beIN Sports about how he has struggled in his life after football, alluding to financial difficulties and admitting his mental health deteriorated.\n\nMathieu said: 'If I'm working at Intersport, it's because something's going on that's causing me a lot of problems.\n\n'I can only say that I'm in the middle of a lawsuit. I will not do it forever. It was to have a social life.'\n\nThe Frenchman has also been battling depression and said it is something he has not 'fully' recovered from.\n\nA former team-mate of Mathieu, Loïc Loval-Landré, was able to help him find the job to get him out of the house and in a social environment.\n\nMathieu revealed: 'He knew I wanted to leave the house for a bit, I had been doing nothing for a while. We were chatting, and he told me there was a vacant position.'\n\nHe called time on his career after a nasty knee injury while playing for Sporting Lisbon at the age of 36 in 2020.\n\nMathieu came off the bench during Barcelona's Champions League final triumph against Juventus in 2015, helping his side to a 3-1 victory which confirmed an iconic Treble under former manager Luis Enrique.\n\nMathieu, pictured with Luis Suarez, also won two LaLiga titles during his three years at Barca\n\nAlthough he was primarily used as back-up for first team centre-halves Javier Mascherano and Gerard Pique, the Frenchman's versatility and experience was valued hugely by Enrique, who often used him as cover for Jordi Alba at left-back too.\n\nWhen asked about his time at the club, he reflected that his abiding memory was of Lionel Messi's genius.\n\n'Messi was incredible. In training, you couldn’t do anything. I think I was a better free-kick taker,' he added with a smile.\n\nDespite winning the majority of his honours at Barcelona, Mathieu played much of his career at fellow LaLiga outfit Valencia — where he made 177 appearances in all competitions."

It is understood that he moved forwards into the shaft without realising the car wasn't there.\n\nPavan is said to have sustained multiple injuries, revealing on Friday that he has had shoulder and back surgery, and a former coach has said he feels 'lucky to be alive.'\n\n'I would like to say a big thank you for all the kind words and wishes I have received over the last 48 hours,' Pavan said in a statement released by the DP World Tour. 'I had surgery on my shoulder and my back on Wednesday evening and I am currently recovering in hospital.\n\n'I now have a lot of rehab and hard work ahead of me, but the care I have received so far from the Mediclinic hospital staff has been incredible, as has the support from the DP World Tour, the Sunshine Tour and all their staff here in Stellenbosch. I am also very grateful for all the help Johann Rupert and his wife Gaynor have given me.\n\nHarrowing details have emerged of the freak incident that saw Italian golfer Andrea Pavan fall down a lift shaft\n\nPavan, pictured with his family, is said to have tumbled down two to three floors in the terrifying fall\n\n'The last two days have been difficult, but I am in very good hands and to have so many players, caddies and staff visit and contact me has meant a lot to me.\n\n'Grazie mille everyone, from me, my wife Audra, and my entire family.'\n\nJT Higgins, who is a former college coach of Pavan's, meanwhile, told Golf Channel: 'By all accounts, he's in good spirits, thankful to be alive and FaceTiming with his kids.'\n\nBoth players and friends are said to have visited the star in hospital, with his wife, Audra, travelling from Texas to be by his side.\n\nPavan's Texas A&M team-mate Matt Van Zandt has set up a GoFundMe page to help the expenses facing the Italian and his family, and said that he expects the golfer 'to remain in South Africa for many weeks before he can be safely evaluated for travel back to the U.S.'"

            "content": "Oleksandr Usyk will defend his heavyweight world title against kickboxer Rico Verhoeven in the shadow of the pyramids.\n\nUsyk has been out of action since he knocked out Daniel Dubois at Wembley last summer and gave up his WBO belt instead of taking on Fabio Wardley. Dutch kickboxing legend Verhoeven had been a potential opponent for Anthony Joshua before the Brit's return to the ring was delayed when he was involved in a fatal car crash last December.\n\nUsyk will take on Verhoeven in Egypt on May 23 with his WBC heavyweight title on the line. The Ukrainian said: “I truly respect people who reach the very top in their sport. Rico is one of them — a powerful athlete and a great champion. Being a champion isn’t just about belts. It’s about years of hard work, discipline, and belief.\n\nFOLLOW OUR FIGHTING FB PAGE! Latest boxing and MMA news, analysis and much more via our dedicated Facebook page\n\n\"I respect his journey — he’s truly the King of Kickboxing. But this is boxing — a different game, with its own rules and its own kings. I’m ready and really looking forward to meeting him in the ring. It’s going to be a unique experience for both of us, and I know the fans are excited too. A big night is coming!”\n\nVerhoeven, who has had just one professional boxing fight 12 years ago, added: “I spent 12 years as the undisputed heavyweight kickboxing champion and accomplished everything I set out to accomplish. But staying at the top for that long didn't take away the hunger, it strengthened it.\n\n\"I wasn’t looking for comfort, so I started looking for the highest challenge available in another world. Usyk is undisputed in boxing. That’s the kind of challenge that motivates me. Undisputed versus undisputed. The best facing the best.”\n\nVerhoeven defended his heavyweight title in June last year, defeating former two-time light heavyweight champion Artem Vakhitov by unanimous decision before announcing his departure from the sport in November after 76 fights and 66 wins."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe 2025-26 men's college basketball season has been defined by the stars who have turned it into one of the most exciting for the sport in recent memory. The freshman class has an abundance of talent, and there are transfers who have transformed programs, with multiple from either category emerging as household names.\n\nWho else should be on your radar, though?\n\nWe've identified 25 breakout stars to know -- players who have bounced back from injuries, returnees who have made significant strides with the same program, and prospects who weren't projected to have the immediate impacts they have had in their first seasons of Division I basketball.\n\nLast season, Haugh was a key reserve for the Florida team that cut down the nets in San Antonio. This season, he is a bona fide All-America candidate and first-round NBA draft prospect who could lead the Gators to their second back-to-back national title reign in program history. His scoring average has increased from 9.8 to 16.9 points while maintaining a similar impact on the glass with 6.0 rebounds per game.\n\nLast season, Anderson was a star in the Sweet 16. This season, he has taken advantage of a bigger workload -- jumping from 30.5 to 38.7 minutes per game -- to emerge as an All-America candidate with 19.6 PPG, 7.7 APG and a 43.9% 3-point shooting rate. With teammate JT Toppin out for the season, Anderson will have to be both Batman and Robin for the Red Raiders come March.\n\nNate Oats coached Alabama to top-five finishes in offensive efficiency with former All-America guard Mark Sears running the show the previous two seasons. Now Philon is the catalyst who has helped the Crimson Tide sustain that production. He's averaging 21.3 points as a sophomore, effectively doubling his 10.6 PPG mark as a freshman.\n\nThough MaxPreps named Wagler its Kansas High School Player of the Year for 2024-25, the 6-foot-6 guard didn't receive many scholarship offers -- Illinois was only one of two high-major programs to extend him one. But the Fighting Illini found an unheralded freshman who could lead them to their first Final Four since 2005, win Big Ten Player of the Year and secure an NBA draft lottery spot.\n\nAfter not starting a single game as a freshman, Tanner is in contention for SEC Player of the Year, averaging 18.5 points while leading Vanderbilt to what will be only its second NCAA tournament appearance since 2017. He's the reason Mark Byington is a national Coach of the Year candidate.\n\nMomcilovich was a contributor (11.5 PPG) on the 2024-25 Iowa State team that earned a 3-seed before losing in the second round of the NCAA tournament. Now he's averaging a career-high 17.4 points and is one of the greatest 3-point shooters (50.7%, No. 1 in the nation) in recent college basketball history. The 6-foot-8 forward is the catalyst for a top-20 offense.\n\nAmid the ups and downs of Darryn Peterson's availability, Kansas has relied on the consistency of Bidunga. The Jayhawks are plus-28.7 points per 100 possessions better when he's on the court, per advanced analytics site EvanMiya, and have benefitted from his defensive presence (9.2 RPG).\n\nMen's Tournament Challenge Sign up now to play the #1 Men's bracket game for FREE! $125,000 in prizes.\n\nPlay Men's Tournament Challenge\n\nThe 6-foot-10 big man is arguably UConn's most important player. After making only one start last season, Reed has started every game he has been healthy for this season (24). The Huskies are at their best when he plays -- they're plus-11.5 points per 100 possessions better with him on the court, according to EvanMiya.\n\nThe defending national champion Gators have lost only two games since Dec. 9, featuring the No. 3 defense in America over that stretch. Chinyelu's contribution to that rise? Opposing players have made just 37% of their shots around the rim against him.\n\nMark Few has said Huff could return from a left knee injury in time for the NCAA tournament, which makes the 6-foot-10 star eligible for this list. Since he last played on Jan. 8, Gonzaga's offense has dropped to 62nd in adjusted efficiency -- a sign of the impact that he and his 17.8 PPG have had in a breakout season that has been affected by injury.\n\nMast sat out the 2023-24 season because of a knee injury before returning this season to lead Nebraska's historic 20-0 start. The 6-foot-10 center has demonstrated that few big men in America can match his well-rounded game: He is top-three in points (13.8), rebounds (6.1) and assists (3.1) for the Cornhuskers.\n\nCameron Boozer is the leader of a strong Duke team -- that much is clear -- but Evans is a critical catalyst for the Blue Devils. He has connected on 44.4% of his 3-point attempts during their five-game winning streak, a sign of a significant turn for a player who has gone from 6.8 points to 14.7 season over season.\n\n13. Aden Holloway, G, Alabama\n\nAs the backup for All-America point guard Mark Sears last season, Holloway looked the part of a future leader for an Alabama team that reached the Elite Eight a year ago. He has become much more than that, as evidenced by the 16.4 points and 4.9 assists he has averaged over the Tide's current seven-game winning streak.\n\nA lower leg injury cost Krivas the bulk of last season; he played in only eight games. He has since returned as one of the anchors of an Arizona team that won its first 23 games. Averaging 10.6 points, 8.5 rebounds and 1.9 blocks, Krivas is rated as an excellent offensive and defensive player by Synergy Sports in his comeback season.\n\nIn high school, the 6-foot-2 guard wasn't even ranked as a top-three prospect in the state of New Hampshire. Now, Okorie is fifth in the country in scoring (22.8) in one of the season's most surprising rises for a freshman who wasn't even on the national radar before this season. He has scored 30 or more points five times in 2025-26.\n\nNgongba has become one of Duke's top contributors, seemingly betting better with each passing game. The 6-foot-11 center helped the Blue Devils conquer one of the most dominant frontcourts in America when they beat then-No. 1 Michigan on Saturday. And he has made 60.2% of shots while holding opponents to a 52% mark around the rim.\n\nChandler has been a consistent starter for Kentucky a season after averaging 10.4 minutes. The 6-foot-5 guard has made one of the nation's most impressive leaps as a shooter over the last year, jumping from a 34.7% clip from 3-point range a season ago to 43.1% this season (including 46.1% in SEC play).\n\nThe leap by Miller over the past year -- from 13.2 PPG and 34.1% from 3 to 18.6 and 41.9% -- is the reason SMU could earn an at-large NCAA tournament bid for the first time in nearly a decade. In his team's biggest wins of the season, against North Carolina and Louisville, the 6-foot guard scored 50 total points.\n\nWhen first-year head coach Ryan Odom announced the signing of the 6-foot-9 forward from Belgium, he said the freshman would \"have an immediate impact in our frontcourt.\" Ridder has lived up to that expectation with his production (15.9 PPG, 6.4 RPG). With the first-year standout on the court, Virginia has registered 121.3 points per 100 possessions.\n\nIt's not easy to project the impact young European prospects can have in college, but New Mexico could win the Mountain West in Eric Olen's first season at the helm as a result of his recruitment of Buljan. The Croatian standout is nearly averaging a double-double (11.9 points, 9.8 rebounds).\n\nHill averaged just 6.2 minutes a season ago and is now the leading scorer -- 14.3 on 36.5% shooting from 3 -- for a VCU team that's chasing Saint Louis for the Atlantic 10 title and its third NCAA tournament appearance in four years.\n\nAt 5-foot-11, Johnson is one of the top players in America. He is also one of the most improved, going from 6.6 PPG last season to 17.4 this season -- and that's in addition to 3.5 APG and 2.6 SPG while shooting 40.9% from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Spartans' standout has made significant strides in scoring (12.3 PPG), on the glass (9.3 RPG) and at the free throw line (86%). But the 6-foot-9 forward's transformation as a deep-ball, high-volume threat (40% on 4.1 3-point attempts per game) has given Tom Izzo's squad a significant boost in its pursuit of another deep tournament run.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 sophomore forward, who has made 59% of his shots inside the arc, is a two-way threat for Josh Schertz's squad. McCottry is listed as a \"very good\" defensive player for a Billikens squad that has played top-25 defense this season. Robbie Avila is the face of the program, but McCottry is an essential component in this team's success in 2025-26.\n\nThe 6-foot-2 freshman wasn't bombarded with scholarship offers after winning Pennsylvania Player of the Year. Averaging 18.3 points for a Merrimack school seeking the first Division I NCAA tournament appearance in school history, the five-time MAAC Rookie of the Week has made a lot of the schools who passed on him look foolish."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Quarterback Diego Pavia wasn't fazed by criticism at Vanderbilt, and it doesn't appear that's going to change now that he's on the NFL's doorstep.\n\nThe NFL draft prospect hasn't toned things down during the NFL combine, where he said he'll throw for scouts on Saturday.\n\n\"One thing about me is I don't care what people think about me,\" said Pavia, who led the Commodores to a 10-3 record, the first 10-win season in school history.\n\nCriticism of him, he said, is the product of the media generating what he described as \"clickbait.\"\n\nBut Pavia certainly became a polarizing figure in 2025, in part because of his exuberance and in part because of his reaction to the Heisman Trophy balloting. The Heisman runner-up had to issue an apology after posting a message that included \"F-All THE VOTERS\" on social media.\n\nBut Pavia said his demeanor and approach are what made him a good leader at Vanderbilt. And his confidence, he said, comes from being constantly counted out in life, including when he started his career in junior college.\n\nThat has turned out to be a credit to him in his quest to make it in the NFL, he said.\n\n\"I feel like a lot of teams love the tenacity, the fight,\" he said. \"The life of an underdog, that's for sure. And, so, they ask questions. But you go back, you look at my record, ain't nothing on my record.\"\n\nHe added, \"I just want everyone to know what's true about me is I'm humble and I get my confidence from my process. And if you saw how much I put into this, you would see where I get my confidence.\"\n\nAnother thing NFL teams will need to weigh is Pavia's lack of size. He measures under 5-foot-10, a big detriment at the position in the NFL. But playing at that size against elite competition is nothing new, he said.\n\n\"I would just say turn on the tape,\" Pavia said. \"It's not like we're not playing these guys that are going first-round, second-round [picks] on Saturdays in the SEC. So, the SEC and the Big Ten probably have the most guys getting drafted in the first, second round. So, we're playing those guys and ain't nothing going to change.\""

            "content": "Louis Riddick raves about why he thinks Ty Simpson has earned a spot as a top-15 pick in the 2026 NFL draft. (0:57)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Former Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson said Friday at the NFL combine that he is prepared to show NFL talent evaluators that he is a \"franchise quarterback.''\n\nSimpson is the No. 25 player overall on ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr.'s Big Board and the No. 2 quarterback behind Indiana's Fernando Mendoza (the No. 1 player overall). Simpson was asked at the combine Friday about his readiness to be an NFL starter. He said he has conveyed his confidence in his abilities to team personnel during the sit-down interviews in Indianapolis.\n\n\"First off, I think I'm ready, I'm a franchise quarterback,'' Simpson said. \"Alabama prepares you the most for the NFL ... The Alabama locker room is as close to an NFL locker room as you can get.''\n\nSimpson said he is healthy after battling some nagging injuries down the stretch this past season, including to his lower back and elbow as well as a fractured rib. He plans to throw Saturday during the on-field workout for quarterbacks. Mendoza is not expected to throw Saturday, so Simpson will be Kiper's highest-ranked quarterback to participate in the combine workout.\n\n\"It's why I decided to throw and why I'm excited about it,'' Simpson said of his health.\n\nHe also addressed his significant weight loss toward the end of the season -- he went from about 210 pounds to just over 190 pounds due to what some in the league have said was a case of gastritis -- and outlined his pre-combine regimen to be prepared for the combine and the draft.\n\n\"Lot of eating, lot of three meals, four meals a day,'' Simpson said of his combine prep. \"Lot of shakes, just getting in a routine of getting up in the morning, eating, drinking chocolate milk, eating lunch, eating the right meal, adding a shake to that, dinner, eating, adding a salad, just sticking to that.''\n\nHe was a one-year starter for the Crimson Tide (11-4) and finished with 3,567 yards passing with 28 touchdowns and five interceptions. But Simpson had 21 of his touchdown passes without an interception over his first eight games of the season and struggled some, including with the injuries. over the second half of the season as well as in the postseason with seven touchdowns to go with the five interceptions over the last six games.\n\nSome scouts have pointed to some struggles in the SEC championship game, a 28-7 loss to Georgia when Simpson was 19-of-39 passing as well as a 38-3 loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff when Simpson was 12-of-16 for 67 yards.\n\nBut Simpson said Friday he has met with most teams who have needs at quarterback, including the Steelers, Arizona Cardinals and New York Jets. And when asked about the second half of last season, he has been direct in his responses with scouts and coaches.\n\nOn his meeting with the Steelers, Simpson said \"I love Coach [Mike] McCarthy, I love the Steelers.'' He added he hasn't paid much attention to player rankings or quarterback rankings as the draft approaches.\n\n\"It matters what happens April 24th and 25th,'' Simpson said. \"Knowing no matter where I'm projected, where I go, they're going to get the best Ty Simpson.''"

I wish I had it sooner. This is a special moment.\"\n\nPhiladelphia Union midfielder Cavan Sullivan celebrates scoring his first senior goal. Terence Lewis/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nAt 14 years, 293 days, Sullivan is believed to have been the youngest player to appear in a game for any major North American professional sports league when he made his July 2024 debut for the Union.\n\nThe hype surrounding Sullivan has mushroomed by the day in MLS and could go global by the time he is expected to transfer to Premier League powerhouse Manchester City at the end of 2027 when he is 18.\n\nSullivan's first goal Thursday was a left-footed blast into the net that made him the third-youngest goal scorer in Concacaf Champions Cup history. He added an 88th-minute tap-in after starting the attack.\n\n\"Happy to score my first goal,\" Sullivan said. \"Two of them, actually. It was pretty special. More important is the clean sheet in the win and we advance.\"\n\nThe Union advanced 12-0 on aggregate -- Philadelphia won 5-0 on Feb. 18 in Trinidad and Tobago -- over the two legs and will next play Mexican team Club América.\n\nThe 5-foot-7, 150-pound Sullivan led the United States to victory in the 2023 Concacaf Under-15 Championship, which marked the first time the U.S. ever won the tournament. The youngest player on the team, Sullivan's four goals scored earned him the Golden Ball as the best player in the tournament.\n\nSullivan and the Union will play their MLS home opener Sunday against New York City FC.\n\n\"I think I've sort of made some good impact when I came in,\" Sullivan said. \"At this level, things get faster, things get harder.\""

(0:41)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nOleksandr Usyk's return to the ring will be a unique one as the three-time undisputed champion will defend the WBC heavyweight title against kickboxer Rico Verhoeven on May 23 at the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, The Ring announced on Friday.\n\nThe fight will headline an event dubbed \"Glory of Giza: Undefeated Icons\" and stream live and exclusively on DAZN.\n\nUsyk (24-0, 15 KOs) is coming off a fifth-round knockout of Daniel Dubois in July and had limited options for his next fight as he has beaten Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury and Daniel Dubois two times each since 2021. There was discussion surrounding a possible fight with former WBC champion Deontay Wilder, but Usyk opted to go in a different direction.\n\nUsyk, 39, had teased an announcement was coming earlier in the week on his social media and a bout with GLORY kickboxing's longest-reigning heavyweight champion had been discussed. Not only will Usyk step into the ring with a man widely regarded as one of the greatest kickboxers of all-time with a record of 66-10, but he will also do it at the Pyramids of Giza in North Africa.\n\n\"I truly respect people who reach the very top in their sport,\" Usyk said in a statement. \"Rico is one of them -- a powerful athlete and a great champion. Being a champion isn't just about belts. It's about years of hard work, discipline and belief. I respect his journey; he's truly the King of Kickboxing. But this is boxing -- a different game, with its own rules and its own kings.\n\n\"I'm ready and really looking forward to meeting him in the ring. It's going to be a unique experience for both of us, and I know the fans are excited too.\"\n\nRico Verhoeven, left, successfully defended his Glory kickboxing heavyweight title 13 times and calls his upcoming shot at boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk \"the highest challenge available.\" Getty\n\nFighting out of the Netherlands, Verhoeven held the Glory heavyweight title for 4,220 days, with 13 successful title defenses from 2013 to 2025. The Dutch kickboxer has tried his hand at boxing once and defeated Janos Finfera by knockout in 2014. Verhoeven, 36, also has one MMA fight, a TKO win over Viktor Bogutzki in 2015.\n\n\"I spent twelve years as the undisputed heavyweight kickboxing champion and accomplished everything I set out to accomplish,\" Verhoeven said. \"But staying at the top didn't take away the hunger, it strengthened it. I wasn't looking for comfort, so started looking of the highest challenge available in another world.\n\n\"Usyk is undisputed in boxing. That's the kind of challenge that motivates me. Undisputed versus undisputed. The best facing the best.\""

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

Of those, 12 places are reserved for UEFA qualifying group winners, with the other four coming via the play-offs.\n\nThe 12 group runners-up will be joined by four teams who finished outside the top two of their respective qualifying groups, who were the 'best performers' in the 2024/25 Nations League.\n\nImage: Troy Parrott's stunning hat-trick against Hungary saw the Republic of Ireland secure a shock play-off spot\n\nHere are the final standings from each of the 12 groups:\n\nGroup A: Germany qualified, Slovakia and Northern Ireland into play-offs\n\nGermany qualified, and into play-offs Group B: Switzerland qualified, Kosovo and Sweden into play-offs\n\nSwitzerland qualified, and into play-offs Group C: Scotland qualified, Denmark into play-offs\n\nScotland qualified, into play-offs Group D: France qualified, Ukraine into play-offs\n\nFrance qualified, into play-offs Group E: Spain qualified, Turkey into play-offs\n\nSpain qualified, into play-offs Group F: Portugal qualified, Republic of Ireland into play-offs\n\nPortugal qualified, into play-offs Group G: Netherlands qualified, Poland into play-offs\n\nNetherlands qualified, into play-offs Group H: Austria qualified, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Romania into play-offs\n\nAustria qualified, and into play-offs Group I: Norway qualified, Italy into play-offs\n\nNorway qualified, into play-offs Group J: Belgium qualified, Wales and North Macedonia into play-offs\n\nBelgium qualified, and into play-offs Group K: England qualified, Albania into play-offs\n\nEngland qualified, into play-offs Group L: Croatia qualified, Czech Republic into play-offs\n\nCould every home nation be at the World Cup?\n\nNo!

More often than not, this means the four additional play-off spots are filled by four of the 14 Nations League group winners.\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:"

Both institutions acknowledged culture as one of Ghana’s most potent soft power tools and a strategic pillar for inclusive growth.\n\nSpeaking during the engagement, the CEO of the GTA, Maame Efua Houadjeto, underscored the importance of synergy:\n\n“Tourism and culture are inseparable.\n\nGhana’s heritage is not just a memory of the past; it is a powerful economic engine for the future.\n\nStrengthening our collaboration with UNESCO allows us to harness culture, education, and innovation—particularly AI—to drive sustainable tourism growth.”\n\nShe said integrating AI into destination marketing, visitor experience management, data analytics and digital storytelling would position Ghana strongly in an increasingly competitive global tourism landscape.\n\nIn his remarks, Edmond Moukala highlighted UNESCO’s commitment to supporting member states in advancing education, science, culture and communication for sustainable development.\n\nEstablished in 1945, UNESCO works globally to safeguard cultural and natural heritage, promote quality education, foster scientific cooperation and encourage intercultural dialogue. Through initiatives such as the World Heritage Programme and Education for Sustainable Development frameworks, the organisation supports countries in translating heritage preservation into socio-economic gains.\n\nMr Moukala noted:\n\n“Ghana has immense cultural capital. The opportunity lies in connecting heritage, education, and emerging technologies to create sustainable value. UNESCO stands ready to support Ghana in protecting its heritage while embracing innovation to enhance tourism management and knowledge sharing.”\n\nThe discussions also covered youth engagement, digital documentation of heritage assets, curriculum integration to build tourism awareness and sustainable site management approaches aligned with global standards.\n\nAt the close of the engagement, Mr Moukala presented a copy of the book titled World Heritage for Sustainable Development in Africa to the GTA CEO as a symbolic gesture reflecting a shared commitment to ensuring Africa’s heritage becomes a foundation for sustainable economic transformation.\n\nThe CEO was accompanied by the Deputy CEO in charge of General Services, Ben Anane Nsiah; the Deputy CEO in charge of Operations, Ekow Sampson; and the Director of Corporate Affairs, Bright Asempa Tsadidey.\n\nTheir presence underscored the strategic importance the Authority attaches to partnerships that elevate Ghana’s cultural and tourism agenda on the global stage.\n\nThe engagement reaffirmed the Ghana Tourism Authority’s commitment to building strong international collaborations that leverage culture, education and innovation as drivers of national development. As Ghana strengthens its position as a leading tourism destination in Africa, partnerships with institutions such as UNESCO remain crucial in converting heritage into measurable economic and social impact.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) in the Ashanti Region has announced the restoration of full power capacity and improved voltage levels following the resolution of a major technical setback caused by infrastructure theft.\n\nAt least eight high-tension towers collapsed after being tampered with by unidentified criminals who removed bolts, nuts, and bases from the galvanised steel structures, forcing the pylons, vital lines connecting the Anwomaso Bulk Supply Point (BSP) to the Akyawkrom Substation, to topple.\n\nECG had to channel multiple feeders through a single source, characterised by chronic low voltage for thousands of customers, frequent power outages due to system overloads, and reduced operational flexibility for the technical team.\n\nSeveral communities in the Ashanti region on March 18, 2024, experienced several hours of power outages.\n\nThe development forced the Electricity Company of Ghana to launch immediate investigations.\n\nAt least eight towers, stretching several kilometres, had fallen onto the ground after some miscreants removed bolts, nuts, and the base.\n\nThe high-tension towers were transmitting power from Anwomaso Bulk Supply Point to the Akyawkrom Substation near Ejisu.\n\nBekwai, Anwiankwanta, Kumawu, Antoakrom, Manso Nkwanta, Jacobu, and Samfo-Aduam were some of the affected areas.\n\nOthers included Kumawu, Ejisu, Nsuta, Effiduase, and their environs.\n\nEngineers of ECG busily working to complete the construction of the 8 high-tension towers\n\nThe completion of the construction works on Wednesday, February 25, 2026 also coincided with a planned maintenance by ECG, which saw all customers on the broken towers restored to their normal positions.\n\nThis means residents and businesses in several districts within the Ashanti Region can now heave a sigh of relief.\n\nDaniel Mensah-Asare is the General Manager of the Ashanti East Region of Electricity Company of Ghana. He is elated ECG has restored the towers.\n\n“We have worked very tirelessly to resolve the problem. The problem occurred around the 18th of March 2024, exactly. So, as a result of the problem, it has created a situation where we have to manage to feed a lot of feeders through one source.\n\nAnd today as I speak, I am happy and on behalf of the entire ECG Ashanti Region, we want to say that we have resolved that problem and we have restored the stolen pylons and has restored power supply.”\n\nAccording to him, the construction of the eight-high tension towers mean a lot to ECG.\n\n“What has happened today is going to enable us to improve the voltage that we supply to our customers. It's going to minimise outage and as well give us what we call the flexibility in our operations.”\n\nIng. Mensah-Asare has been explaining to JoyNews what the restoration means to ECG and its customers.\n\n“From today, we can see that customers around this area and its environs and all those places who were experiencing some form of low voltage as a result of the incident that occurred on the 18th of March 2024. Today we have solved their problem and their voltages are going to improve.\n\n\"When we say low voltage, that's when you are not getting enough of power; the voltage that you require for a fridge or light or anything to work effectively. Comparing it to water, voltage is like the pressure that makes the water to flow. So the voltage was low.\n\n\"So most of our customers often say it is low current. So most of our customers who do not often see it low current, so the fridges are going to work better the air conditions are going to work better, the fans are going to turn better and every electrical gadget they are going to use in those areas is going to function or perform better.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ing. Mensah-Asare has commended residents in the Ashanti region for their patience as ECG worked on this capital-intensive project.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Assurances in Parliament that reforms and digital coordination will end emergency care refusals stand in sharp contrast to persistent reports of patients dying in corridors or being redirected across facilities.\n\nIs this a resource crisis, a coordination breakdown, or a question of professional conduct? And beyond promises, what measurable change is underway to guarantee that emergency care is truly non-negotiable?\n\nIn the power sector, public trust is under pressure as households report rapid depletion of prepaid electricity credits.\n\nThe regulator has ordered urgent explanations from the Electricity Company of Ghana, while investigations seek to determine whether the problem stems from tariff adjustments, technical faults, or deeper systemic lapses.\n\nConsumers want clarity, and potentially compensation. Will the probe deliver answers within days, and could the outcome reshape billing transparency and regulatory enforcement?\n\nAt the heart of the rural economy, tensions deepen over cocoa sector governance and pricing stress. As financial pressures mount and farmers raise alarms about hardship, calls are growing for accountability reviews involving the Office of the Special Prosecutor and the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice.\n\nAre these petitions grounded in evidence of conflict of interest, or are they political theatre in a moment of sector vulnerability? And what does this dispute mean for confidence in agricultural leadership during crisis?\n\nSecurity and social order also come under scrutiny amid rising concerns about school-related indiscipline and broader enforcement gaps affecting communities and local commerce. As incidents fuel anxiety about safety and governance capacity, the question becomes unavoidable: how does the state restore deterrence, discipline and public confidence without undermining rights and trust?\n\nAnd overarching all these concerns lies one defining question: Does the State of the Nation Address meaningfully confront these lived realities, or are citizens still waiting for policy to meet practice?\n\nJoin Samson Lardy Anyenini this Saturday at 9 a.m. on the JoyNews channels, on digital satellite channels 421 on DSTV and 144 on GoTV, and streams on JoyNews’ Facebook or YouTube channels on Saturdays from 8 am to noon and MyJoyOnline for a rigorous, solutions-focused national conversation.\n\nViewers can also follow the discussion by tuning in to Joy 99.7 FM or Luv 99.5 FM on the radio or stream the discussion live on either Google or Apple Podcasts.\n\nNewsfile is your most authoritative news analysis programme.\n\nIf it’s Saturday… it’s Newsfile.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Prof Hamidatu Saaka Darimani, revealed that for the first time in the institution's history, the university has admitted 17 differently-abled students into various academic programs.\n\nIn a major step toward inclusive higher education, the educational expenses for all 17 students will be fully absorbed under the free tertiary and persons with disabilities policy.\n\nThe university experienced a massive influx of interest this academic year, receiving a total of 2,575 applications. Out of that applicant pool, 1,967 candidates were offered admission.\n\nBreakdown the admissions data, the university admitted:\n\n768 students into Higher National Diploma (HND) programs.\n\n665 students into BTech/MSc programs.\n\n487 students into BTech/BSc programs.\n\n35 students into postgraduate programs.\n\nAddressing the economic hurdles of tertiary education, the Vice-Chancellor noted that 906 of the newly admitted Level 100 students have already successfully enrolled under the government's \"no fees stress policy,\" with others still undergoing documentation scrutiny.\n\nTo accommodate this 17% surge in the student population and ease the burden of off-campus housing, the university has commenced the construction of a 400-bed hostel facility aimed at providing a safe, conducive on-campus residential environment.\n\nOther major campus upgrades are currently underway to support the growing student body.\n\nThe vice chancellor highlighted the ongoing construction of the main entrance and access roads, the installation of solar street lights to boost campus security, and the outfitting of state-of-the-art laboratories to strengthen practical, industry-relevant training.\n\nIn a major demonstration of this commitment to practical skills, the matriculation ceremony was followed by the official commissioning of a state-of-the-art Cosmetology Laboratory.\n\nThe facility stands as the first of its kind in the entire region, specifically established to create direct employment pathways and equip students with high-level cosmetic science and practical skills.\n\nThe cosmetology department, currently operating with three staff members, is designed to offer specialised BTech and certificate courses. University management indicated that intensive recruitment efforts are underway to secure additional cosmetology faculty, allowing for the full enrollment of students into the program by the start of the next academic year.\n\nBeyond student training, the laboratory has been outfitted to offer premium, first-class cosmetology services to the general public, serving as both an educational hub and a revenue-generating enterprise for the university.\n\nClosing the ceremony, university management issued a stern warning regarding campus discipline and the student code of conduct.\n\nStressing that \"ignorance of these regulations would not be accepted as an excuse,” Prof Hamidatu urged matriculants to familiarise themselves with the rules and prioritise moral character alongside their studies.\n\n\"Remember that character and competence must go hand in hand,\" the Vice-Chancellor stated, reminding the students that \"academic excellence without integrity is incomplete\"\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Under the theme 20 Years of Connecting Africa to the World, the event reflected both how far the platform has come and where it is headed next.\n\nFrom foundations to lasting value\n\nReflecting on the show’s early years, Miller Matola, CEO of Millvest Advisory, said the real legacy of Meetings Africa has always been the relationships it nurtured.\n\n“Twenty years ago, when Meetings Africa was starting out, one of the greatest things was the networks and relationships that were built, which in years to come translated into big business for South Africa,” he said. “Today, we are reaping the benefits of those early efforts. What I always remember are the connections - the people and the relationships - which have endured even up to now. That is what this industry is all about.”\n\nMatola added that the growth of the MICE sector across South Africa and the continent has been both visible and gratifying, underscoring Meetings Africa’s role as a catalyst rather than just a marketplace.\n\nA platform refined by structure and scale\n\nFor Nomasonto Ndlovu, CEO of Beacon Africa Tourism and former Acting CEO of South African Tourism, Meetings Africa has been a constant presence throughout her professional journey in business events.\n\n“I was involved in the early conceptualisation stages of Meetings Africa, and it has remained a constant in my career,” she noted. “The development of the buyer selection model and the match-making diary system was a standout moment. That structured approach to curated appointments fundamentally strengthened the value proposition of the show.”\n\nEconomic impact and confidence from leadership\n\nOpening the trade floor on Tuesday, South Africa’s Minister of Tourism, Patricia de Lille, placed strong emphasis on the measurable economic impact of Meetings Africa.\n\n“Over the past three years alone, the economic impact of Meetings Africa on our GDP has nearly doubled - from R371 million in 2023 to R690 million in 2025,” she said. “During this period, the show has created and sustained more than 2,600 jobs.”\n\nShe also highlighted the scale of participation at the 2026 edition, noting that buyers from 53 countries were in attendance, alongside 375 hosted buyers, 325 exhibitors and more than 6,400 confirmed business meetings.\n\nGhana and the West African Vision\n\nThe event also provided a platform for West African leaders to share their strategic roadmaps. Gilbert Abeiku Aggrey, Deputy CEO (Marketing and Special Duties) of the Ghana Tourism Authority, underscored the importance of industry intelligence as a precursor to physical development.\n\n“We need to study the model of this business of meeting conversations and understand how it works so that when our government builds the infrastructure, we will be able to run it,\" Aggrey stated. \"In West Africa, we have already built huge structures that we've not been able to sustain; so, the knowledge of the industry or the market is crucial before you develop. We are selling the beauty of West Africa here; we must build capacity so that when the investors come, we can solve our own employment issues.”\n\nAggrey noted that while Ghana often feels a sense of \"lone\" leadership in the sub-regional MICE sector, the focus at Meetings Africa 2026 was on a harmonised West African effort to tackle issues like high air connectivity costs and capacity building.\n\nAfrica’s growing voice in global business events\n\nThe continent’s growing influence was further reinforced by Senthil Gopinath, CEO of ICCA, who praised the momentum he continues to see across African destinations.\n\n“Africa is not just growing in numbers; it is growing in confidence, capability and purpose,” he said. “Platforms like Meetings Africa are critical in nurturing new destinations, developing skills and taking Africa’s business events message to the rest of the world.”\n\nBeyond the exhibition floor\n\nAs Meetings Africa 2026 concludes, the 20th anniversary edition stands as a testament to what deliberate planning, collaboration and consistency can achieve. More importantly, it signals a future in which Africa is not merely participating in global business events, but confidently shaping them.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Petrol price and oil crisis concept.\n\nPrices of petroleum products are set to increase marginally from March 1, 2026.\n\nThat is according to the latest outlook report by the Chamber of Oil Marketing Companies (COMAC), which guides pricing decisions for oil marketing companies and was seen by Joy Business.\n\nThis marks the third time since January this year that fuel prices are projected to rise.\n\nHowever, this time, the spike has been influenced and driven largely by rising crude oil prices on the international market, as well as increases in finished petroleum product prices.\n\nOur checks show that the rate of increase could have been higher if the cedi had not posted some marginal appreciation against major trading currencies over the past two weeks.\n\nAccording to the Chamber of Oil Marketing Companies, the Ghana cedi appreciated marginally against major trading currencies.\n\nFor instance, during the March 1, 2026, Databank pricing window, the currency moved from GHS 11.09 to 11.04 per US dollar, representing a 0.45 percent surge.\n\nDatabank, in its market research report, noted that the cedi’s recent appreciation aligns with gains in other major sub-Saharan African currencies, reflecting broad external support driven by sustained dollar weakness.\n\nExpected Price Hikes\n\nCOMAC's data shows that petrol prices are expected to increase by 2.89 percent and could result in a price of GHC 12.04 per litre.\n\nDiesel prices are projected to rise by 0.86 percent, with a litre likely to sell for around GHS13.22.\n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), for the first time this year, is expected to go down marginally and, from March 1, should sell at the pumps at GHS 13.87 per kilogram.\n\nHowever, based on current market conditions, not all major oil marketing companies may move quickly to increase prices from this weekend or from March 1, 2026.\n\nReasons\n\nCOMAC's data indicate that the projected price increases are largely driven by rising prices of finished petroleum products as well as crude oil prices.\n\nOil prices are trading near a seven-month high amid speculation of potential US military action against Iran. Brent crude closed at about 71 dollars a barrel.\n\nSome energy analysts have projected that crude prices could hit 100 dollars a barrel.\n\nOn the other hand, finished petroleum products recorded mixed movements. Petrol increased by 4.58 percent, and gas by 1.66 percent, while LPG fell by 1.05 percent.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Accra came alive this weekend as Aduberks, one of Ghana’s most acclaimed drum artists, made history by headlining his own concert, Aduberks Live In Concert, marking five years of percussive artistry, his birthday, and a celebration of the growing role of drummers in contemporary live music entertainment.\n\nThe event, staged at the prestigious Alliance Française d’Accra, brought together a star-studded lineup of musicians and performers.\n\nFor the past five years, Aduberks has quietly built an enviable résumé, lending his precision and musical intuition to some of Africa’s most celebrated names, including Reggie Rockstone, R2Bees, Wizkid, King Promise, FRA!, Samini, Efya, Gyakie, Team Eternity Ghana, Gyedu-Blay Ambolley, and Pat Thomas.\n\n“This show isn’t just about me, it’s about how far drummers have come in Ghana’s entertainment landscape,” Aduberks said in an interview before the show. “To stand here as a headliner, especially as a drummer, is rare, and it speaks to how much the culture of rhythm and live instrumentation has evolved.”\n\nMore than just a concert, the night was positioned as a milestone for independent musicians, particularly percussionists who have historically played support roles in live shows. By placing drums and rhythm at the center of the concert experience, the event challenged traditional norms of Ghana’s live music scene. It highlighted Aduberks’ role as a pioneer in drum-led live performance in the country.\n\nBacked by the Apogee Band, Aduberks electrified fans at Alliance Française Accra, where music lovers gathered from 6 PM to 11 PM for an evening that blended musicianship with showmanship.\n\nThe set unfolded like a journey through Ghana’s contemporary soundscape, with the drummer leading every transition with flair and authority. Furthermore, he introduced the audience to a new sound he is pioneering, which he calls HausLife - a purée of Highlife and House traditions.\n\nThe energy only grew as guest performers joined the celebration.\n\nActs including Ayisi, Wanlov the Kubolor, Josh Blakk, Reynolds the Gentleman, FRA!, and the dynamic dance collective DWP Academy added layers of excitement, turning the concert into a full-bodied artistic experience rather than just a performance.\n\nMusic industry observers noted that bringing a drummer to headline an event of this scale was both bold and inspiring. “For too long, drummers have been in the background,” one fan said. “Tonight proves they can be the story too.”\n\nBeyond entertainment, the concert also showcased Ghana’s rich musical diversity, from highlife to contemporary fusion, and highlighted the potential of percussion-centered performances to create more employment and opportunities for instrumentalists and live music creators in Ghana.\n\nOrganizers confirmed that the show was fully attended, with fans and music lovers packing the venue to celebrate Aduberks’ career and contributions to the creative arts.\n\nAduberks also hinted at new music and upcoming shows, promising that fresh sounds from his camp will continue to push boundaries and expand the footprint of Ghanaian live performance.\n\nAduberks staging his own concert is more than a personal victory. It signals a shift, proof that so-called background musicians can headline, build their own audiences, and shape their own narratives.\n\nIn a music culture often dominated by vocalists, Friday night was a reminder that sometimes, it is the heartbeat behind the music that deserves the loudest applause.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

The University recognised her appointment as Chancellor of the Women's University in Africa in Zimbabwe, a role she held from 2018 to 2024. In that capacity, she demonstrated sustained commitment to advancing women’s access to higher education and promoting academic excellence across Africa.\n\nProfessor Opoku-Agyemang’s association with the University of Cape Coast is both longstanding and historic. As an alumna, she later returned to serve as Vice-Chancellor from 2008 to 2012, becoming the first female Vice-Chancellor of a public university in Ghana — another landmark achievement in her career.\n\nThe University described her journey from student to Vice-Chancellor and now Vice President as emblematic of visionary leadership, academic excellence and dedicated public service.\n\nThe Distinguished Fellow Award ceremony is scheduled to take place on Friday, March 13, 2026, at 2:00 p.m. at the New Examination Centre (NEC) of the University of Cape Coast.\n\nThe University congratulated Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang on the honour, describing it as a fitting recognition of her exceptional contributions to education, governance and national development.\n\n\"The University of Cape Coast congratulates Her Excellency Prof. Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang on this distinguished award,\" the statement concluded.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

He therefore advised fans to comport themselves and adhere to guidelines in order to safeguard this status.\n\n\n\n'We need our best players to stay fit ahead of 2026 World Cup' - John Paintsil\n\n\n\n“Mr Speaker, supporters and others interested in going to support their team will have to submit visa requests to the American Embassy. We are being told that we must ensure that supporters who travel return on their visas. It has taken a lot of work to restore Ghana's 5-year non-immigrant visas and remove us from the ban list. It is my hope that this event will not send thousands of Ghanaians to America and put us back on the ban list,” he said.\n\n\n\nPresident Mahama also urged the Black Queens to improve their performance at the 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) after placing third in the previous edition.\n\n“Mr Speaker, the Black Queens will compete at the 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, building on their bronze medal finish in Morocco,” he noted.\n\n\n\nHe also expressed optimism about Ghana’s participation in upcoming competitions, including the Youth Olympic Games and the 2026 Commonwealth Games, hoping for success from the athletes.\n\n\n\n“At the youth level, Ghana will participate in the 2026 Youth Olympic Games in Dakar with a multidisciplinary team aimed at strengthening long-term elite pathways.

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "Clinton is deposed by the House Oversight Committee over Epstein ties, a day after Hillary testified.\n\nBill Clinton has told lawmakers that he “saw nothing that gave me pause” when he spent time with Jeffrey Epstein, as the former president gave closed-door testimony about his relationship with the late sex offender.\n\nIn a prepared statement on Friday, Clinton told the House of Representatives Oversight Committee that he would not have flown on the late financier’s plane if he had known about his alleged sex trafficking of underage girls, and would have reported him to the police if he did.\n\nRecommended Stories list of 2 items list 1 of 2 Hillary Clinton comments after Epstein hearing\n\nHillary Clinton comments after Epstein hearing list 2 of 2 Bill and Hillary Clinton set for Epstein deposition: What to know end of list\n\n“We are only here because he hid it from everyone so well for so long,” Clinton said.\n\nClinton flew on Epstein‘s plane several times in the early 2000s after he left office and before Epstein’s 2008 conviction of soliciting prostitution from a minor. A tranche of documents released by the Department of Justice includes photos of Clinton with women whose faces are redacted.\n\n“I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong,” Clinton said.\n\nThe former president is in a deposition before the House Oversight Committee, one day after his wife, Hillary Clinton, testified before the same panel. It is being held near the Clintons’ home in Westchester County, New York.\n\nThe panel’s Republican chairman, Representative James Comer of Kentucky, said he would ask the former president about the photos released by the Justice Department. The committee is also expected to quiz Clinton about Epstein’s involvement with the couple’s charitable foundation.\n\nComer said video of Hillary Clinton’s testimony could be released as soon as Friday. He repeatedly has said the Clintons are not accused of wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nDemocrats call for Trump to testify\n\nThe Clintons agreed to testify after the House threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate, which could have led to criminal charges.\n\nBoth Clintons accuse Republicans of conducting a partisan exercise designed to protect President Donald Trump from scrutiny, noting that others in the inquiry were allowed to submit written statements rather than testify in person.\n\nDemocrats have called on the committee to also subpoena Trump, whose name appears in Epstein-related documents, as well as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has acknowledged visiting Epstein’s private island.\n\nTrump socialised extensively with Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s and says he broke off ties before Epstein’s 2008 conviction.\n\nDemocrats have further accused the Justice Department under Trump of withholding records related to a woman who alleged that Trump sexually abused her when she was a minor. The department has said it is reviewing the material and will release it if deemed appropriate.\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Trump said he was not pleased about former President Bill Clinton’s deposition in the House’s Epstein inquiry.\n\n“I like Bill Clinton, and I don’t like seeing him deposed,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House for Corpus Christi, Texas."

            "content": "The Supreme Court ruling comes after Israel said it would ban 37 aid groups from Gaza for failing to follow new rules.\n\nIsrael’s Supreme Court has ruled that dozens of international aid agencies can continue to operate in the Gaza Strip and other Palestinian territories, freezing an earlier government decision that barred aid groups that failed to comply with new rules.\n\nIn a ruling on Friday, Israel’s top court issued a temporary injunction to allow the NGOs to continue most of their activities while it considers a petition from 17 aid agencies against the government ban.\n\nIsrael had announced it will ban 37 aid groups from war-torn Gaza, the occupied West Bank, and occupied East Jerusalem on March 1, a move that experts warned could have potentially devastating consequences for Palestinians.\n\nAid agencies – including Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE – were notified by Israeli authorities in December that their Israeli work registrations had expired and that they had 60 days to renew them and provide lists containing personal details on their Palestinian staff.\n\nThe organisations say compliance with the Israeli orders would expose their Palestinian staff to potential retaliation, undermine the principle of humanitarian neutrality and violate European data protection law.\n\nIn a statement after Friday’s ruling, Shaina Low, communication adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said the decision was welcome, but pointed to the difficulties that aid agencies continue to face in Gaza.\n\n“The injunction pauses immediate closure. It does not restore visas, reopen access or resolve the wider restrictions that continue to affect aid delivery.\n\n\n\n“Despite a ceasefire agreement, conditions in Gaza remain catastrophic, and humanitarian needs in the West Bank continue to grow,” said Low.\n\nAthena Rayburn, executive director for the Association of International Development Agencies, said they were “still waiting to see how the injunction will be interpreted by the state and whether or not this will mean an increase in our ability to operate,” adding that the situation inside Gaza remained “catastrophic”.\n\nIsraeli attacks continue in Gaza\n\nIn Gaza, at least six Palestinians were killed in Israeli drone attacks targeting two police posts in the Bureij refugee camp in the central Strip and the al-Mawasi area in Khan Younis in the south on Friday.\n\nMedical sources at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis reported the arrival of four bodies and several wounded individuals following an Israeli military strike on a police checkpoint at the al-Maslakh intersection in al-Mawasi.\n\nThe sources said that the strike occurred in an area outside the Israeli military’s control, and described the condition of some of the wounded as critical.\n\nIn the central Gaza Strip, two Palestinians were killed, and others were injured, in a similar Israeli drone strike that targeted a police post at the entrance to the Bureij refugee camp.\n\nThe attacks overnight into Friday were condemned by Hamas as undermining mediator efforts during a “ceasefire” phase that Israel has violated almost daily since October 10.\n\nReporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said it was a “bloody night. Israeli forces carried out a series of deadly air strikes, this time primarily focusing on police checkpoints that have been deployed too close to areas where armed militias are operating in the eastern communities of the Gaza Strip, in particular in … Khan Younis and Bureij refugee camp.\n\n“Six police members have been killed as a result … But also here, the timing and location are critically reshaping the whole equation between both sides. Israel has made clear that Israel will not be responsible for reorganising the remnants of life in Gaza. That’s why we can see that any kind of restoration of previous services, including police … will be thwarted,” he added."

            "content": "Netflix declined to raise its proposal to match a higher one from Paramount for Warner Bros, saying the deal was no longer attractive.\n\nNetflix’s stock is surging as investors applauded its decision to exit the race for Warner Bros Discovery, a months-long bidding war with Paramount Skydance for some of Hollywood’s most prized assets.\n\nThe stock jumped more than 10 percent on Friday. That came on the heels of Netflix’s decision on Thursday evening that it would not match Paramount’s latest $31 per share bid or raise its offer of $27.75 a share for Warner Bros’s studio and streaming assets, stating that the deal was “no longer financially attractive”.\n\nWarner had given Netflix four business days to come up with a counteroffer for Paramount’s latest bid — but Netflix, instead, responded less than two hours later, declining to raise its proposal. It said the new price it would have to pay made the deal “no longer financially attractive”.\n\n“We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros′ iconic brands,” Netflix’s co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a joint statement. “But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”\n\nThe decision was welcomed by investors. Shares of the streaming giant had shed more than 18 percent since Netflix announced its deal with Warner Bros on December 5.\n\nThe latest move is a “tick in the box” for discipline, said Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot.\n\n“What you want from a management team is an ability to look at acquisitions, value them, pay what they think is a fair price, but to not overpay.”\n\nAnalysts and investors had questioned whether Netflix’s bid was a defensive attempt to block a future competitor or an offensive shift away from its historically disciplined build-versus-buy approach.\n\n\n\n“A positive turn of events in our view, as we believe NFLX’s withdrawal from the race will leave it free to refocus on its business, while its closest competitors grapple with long and distracting regulatory approval and merger integration processes, and with PSKY saddled with sizable deal debts,” HSBC analysts said.\n\n‘Hollywood and ego’\n\nShares of the David Ellison-led Paramount, meanwhile, were up 17 percent.\n\nParamount’s deal, valued at $110bn, including debt, represents nearly 13 times Warner Bros’ EBITDA – earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation or core profits – this year, according to estimates from LSEG. That is well above what Paramount is worth on the same basis, which is 7 times its estimated earnings.\n\nA tie-up with Warner Bros would allow Paramount’s storied Hollywood studio to tap into Warner’s deep trove of intellectual property – including franchises such as Fantastic Beasts and The Matrix – across film, television and streaming.\n\n“WBD’s largest asset is declining, and the company is still under debt from its last failed merger. But this deal is more about Ellison taking over Hollywood and ego than it is about good business sense,” said Ross Benes, senior analyst at Emarketer.\n\nFor Paramount’s streaming unit, a combination with HBO Max and Discovery+ would reshape its position in a streaming era long dominated by Netflix.\n\n“Paramount was the streaming market laggard, and it needs Warner Bros’ content and capabilities to play catch-up. It will need more than Harry Potter for the deal to work its magic and enable Paramount to fight off Netflix, Disney and Amazon in the streaming wars,” said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell.\n\nIn the fight for Warner Bros, the Paramount consortium – backed by Larry Ellison, billionaire and ally of United States President Donald Trump, and led by his son, Paramount CEO David Ellison – also boosted its termination fee to $7bn and expanded its financing commitments, including $45.7bn in equity.\n\n“There is a right price and wrong price for any acquisition, and the pressure is now on Paramount to prove the big financial outlay is worth it,” said Coatsworth.\n\nConcerns of editorial shifts\n\nThe proposed combination, which will still need the green light from both Warner shareholders and regulators, poses both antitrust concerns and questions of political influence.\n\nA merger between the two companies would put CNN under the same roof as CBS, which has already seen significant editorial shifts under new Skydance ownership. Paramount took steps to appeal to more conservative viewers in its news operations, notably with the installation of Free Press founder Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief of CBS News. And if the company’s takeover bid of Warner is successful, critics warn similar shifts could happen to CNN, a network that has long attracted ire from Trump.\n\n\n\n“Politics are playing an outsized role in this deal, and they’ve been on Paramount’s side from the get‑go,” said Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at Forrester, a market research company.\n\nTop Democratic lawmakers have also sounded the alarm about the Republican president’s ties to companies, such as Paramount, and potential consequences of growing corporate power.\n\n“A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a longtime antitrust hawk, said in a statement on Thursday night. She also called a potential Paramount-Warner combo an “antitrust disaster”.\n\nHow regulators will respond to a Warner-Paramount deal remains to be seen. The US Department of Justice has already initiated reviews, and other countries are expected to do so, too.\n\nWarner shareholders will have to be convinced, too. But Paramount is taking on billions of dollars in debt to finance its offer — something critics have warned could only increase the likelihood of potential job losses and other restructuring down the road. Foreign sovereign wealth funds have also provided equity for the offer, drawing added scrutiny."

Had I taken two wickets, we would have won that match, but it was not to be.”\n\nWhat happened the last time Pakistan played Sri Lanka?\n\nThe last time the nations were paired in T20 International was during a three-game bilateral series in January.\n\nSri Lanka claimed a rain-affected final game by 14 runs to tie the series 1-1.\n\nHaving lost the toss, the Sri Lankans posted 160-6 off the reduced 12-overs per side. Pakistan looked good when reaching 101 after four overs, but were eventually eight down when falling short of their target.\n\n\n\nHead-to-head\n\nThis will be the 31st meeting between the sides, with Pakistan winning 17 of the encounters and Sri Lanka emerging victorious on 12 occasions, along with one no result.\n\nThe sides have faced each other four times at T20 World Cups, with both sides claiming two wins.\n\nPredicted Pakistan team\n\nSahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha (captain), Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Shadab Khan, Usman Khan (wicketkeeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Salman Mirza, Usman Tariq\n\nPredicted Sri Lanka team\n\nPathum Nissanka, Kusal Perera, Kamil Mishara (wk), Charith Asalanka, Pavan Rathnayake, Kamindu Mendis, Dasun Shanaka (c), Dunith Wellalage, Dushan Hemantha, Maheesh Theekshana, Dushmantha Chameera\n\nPakistan and Sri Lanka form guides"

            "content": "Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts, and have stopped getting a response. This week, thanks to a reader tip, we think we’ve found the original phone the T1 is based on.\n\nA long time ago, back when the Trump phone was but a single, inaccurate render and a contradictory spec sheet, we tried to figure out what other phone it might be based on. Now, eight months, two spec overhauls, and one redesign later, I have a good guess: the HTC U24 Pro.\n\nI didn’t spot this by myself. A reader first tipped me off to the similarities between the U24 Pro and the Trump phone I revealed a few weeks ago, which are numerous: a similar angled body and curved display, a unique front sensor array, and broadly similar specs, including oddities like a headphone jack and microSD card support.\n\nLet’s get one thing out the way at the top: I’m pretty sure HTC isn’t secretly building the Trump phone. Sohaib Ahmed, the company’s global director of PR, told me as much: “HTC does not design or manufacture phones for third parties.” But that doesn’t rule out another company playing a part in designing or building both phones, and given just how similar they look, I suspect that’s exactly what happened.\n\nIt’s a little hard to make out in this screenshot, but the Trump phone shares the sharply angled edges of the HTC U24 Pro. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nThe U24 Pro is an odd phone in its own right. It launched in 2024 for €549 (around $600 at the time), and was heralded in some corners as a return from the dead for HTC, despite the fact that it followed the U23 Pro a year earlier, and a string of smaller releases that targeted the Asian market. HTC, once one of the major players in the Android phone industry, had been greatly diminished ever since selling a large part of its smartphone business to Google for $1.1 billion in 2017.\n\nBoth the T1 Phone and the U24 Pro share a slightly asymmetric angular frame, jutting out into a point along every edge, with a heavily curved screen on the front. I cannot think of, nor find, another phone that is quite the same shape — even small details like the positions of the antenna lines around the power and volume buttons line up. Even more telling is the set of sensors along each phone’s top. The U24 Pro splits up its speaker grill, notification LED, and proximity sensor into three, resulting in an unusual design with a long bar, a small dot for the LED, and then a second shorter bar, at the point where the display meets the phone’s top. What looks like the same sensor design can be clearly seen on the Trump phone I was shown, though I can’t confirm that the sensors themselves are the same, or that the T1 Phone will also have a notification LED.\n\nBoth phones have near-identical sets of speakers and sensors about the front selfie camera, with headphone jack and microphone visible behind them on the top edges. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nOther details are subtler. It’s hard to tell exactly from the glimpses I got of the Trump phone, but along the top frame it certainly looks to have both a headphone jack and a microphone in the exact same positions as on the HTC device. Even having a headphone jack in the first place is evidence of the phones’ connection, given how rare the feature is in modern devices. The same can be said for the fact that both phones include a microSD card slot, sharing support for up to 1TB cards on top of a base 512GB of storage.\n\nWhile the rear cameras look completely different, which seems to scupper my theory, look again: The U24 Pro’s cameras are split into a pair close together, with a third lens lower down. The new Trump phone sets all its cameras in one mount, but they’re unevenly spaced, with a larger gap between the second and third lenses. These cameras may look totally different on the surface, but I suspect that underneath you’ll find they’re similar. And what we know of the specs matches too: Trump Mobile told me that its phone will have 50-megapixel sensors for both the main and selfie cameras, and my glimpse of its camera UI showed an ultrawide and a 2x zoom option — all of which you’ll find on the U24 Pro.\n\nThe two phones’ cameras look different at first, but the unusual lens placement might just line up. Screenshot: Dominic Preston / The Verge and Image: HTC\n\nAssuming that the two phones are essentially the same, does the U24 Pro tell us any more about what to expect from the T1? It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, matching what I’d been told about a Snapdragon 7-series chip in the Trump phone. The U24 Pro has a 6.8-inch OLED display, 60W wired charging and even wireless charging support, and an IP67 rating for dust and water protection. There’s reason to be cautious reading too much into the spec sheet, though: The U24 Pro released with a 4,600mAh battery, smaller than the 5,000mAh capacity I’ve been told will be in the Trump phone. If that spec differs, then other elements of the internals could well too — the bigger battery in particular might replace the wireless charging coils of the HTC phone.\n\nThe U24 Pro launched to middling reviews, which may not inspire much confidence in Trump Mobile’s offering. Tech Advisor gave the phone two and a half stars out of five, calling it “hard to recommend over rivals,” while Notebookcheck declared it “modern and yet out of date.” Still, it fared surprisingly well in a JerryRigEverything teardown and durability test.\n\nHe noticed, however, that this didn’t appear to be the HTC of old, lacking the sapphire crystal HTC previously used on its displays and optical image stabilization on the front camera it once pioneered. The U24 Pro and other HTC phones released in the last few years share little consistent design language, and ship with near-stock Android software. Speculation has been rife that HTC isn’t in fact manufacturing the phones internally, but had commissioned an ODM — original design manufacturer — to produce the hardware. ODMs design and manufacture phones for other companies, usually to a set of specifications provided by the consumer-facing brands, and often retain ownership of the designs, allowing them to reuse and repurpose them for other clients. I asked HTC for clarification, but the company wouldn’t confirm whether the U24 Pro was made in-house or contracted out.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that Trump Mobile, or its manufacturing partner, is simply ripping off the design of a little-known HTC device. But I think the most likely answer here is a more mundane one: HTC probably worked with some unnamed ODM to design and manufacture the U24 Pro, and Trump Mobile just happened to work with the same company. That manufacturer may have either dug out its old designs for HTC when developing the T1 Phone, or perhaps gave new life to old, unused components from HTC’s production run. Without knowing the hypothetical ODM involved, it’s hard to say for sure. Trump Mobile has previously confirmed that it’s working with a partner or partners to manufacture its phones outside the US, before their “final assembly” in Miami, but executive Don Hendrickson wouldn’t tell me the name of its manufacturer or where it’s based. I reached out to the company again for comment on this story, and received no reply.\n\nSo no, I don’t think that HTC made the Trump phone. But it does look likely that it is based, more or less, on one of that company’s phones. It remains to be seen how the T1 Phone will differ in its details, but the fact that its origins seem so closely tied to an unpopular midranger from two years ago doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the T1 Phone’s flagship credentials.\n\nGot inside information on Trump Mobile or the Trump phone?

The leadership change comes just a month after reports that Gottumkkala uploaded sensitive documents to ChatGPT. Gottumkkala had requested special permission to use ChatGPT, despite the AI being off-limits for other DHS employees.\n\nGottumkkala’s departure follows a downturn at CISA over the past year as the agency has been “gutted and politicized” by the Trump administration, resulting in budget cuts, layoffs, and wavering trust from local leaders. CISA is also still without a Senate-confirmed director. Trump nominated Sean Plankey for the role last year, then renominated him in January. Plankey previously served in the first Trump administration."

            "content": "is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nOn Thursday morning, I attended a Q&A panel with four top Samsung smartphone executives. Until 2025, Samsung was the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer, and by association, the world’s largest maker of cameras. It’s still the second largest after Apple.\n\nSamsung handed me the microphone first. I asked:\n\nWe see a divide in society between people who want AI to do impressive things with their photos and videos, and those who don’t want AI to do anything with photos and videos because it’s eroding our ability to believe that what we have seen is real, destroying the concept of photographic evidence. Metadata tools like C2PA have utterly failed to stem the tide. Does Samsung have any new and different ideas on how to prevent AI images from taking over the world?\n\nSamsung’s four executives did not have any new and different ideas to share.\n\nI will credit Won-Joon Choi, the mobile division’s COO and R&D chief, for not dodging the question. He told the room that the erosion of reality is a problem and he wants to fix it.\n\nBut he, and other Samsung executives, suggested that the company needs to balance the desire for photographic reality with letting smartphone buyers be “more creative.” They passed the buck by suggesting it’s an industry-wide problem, one that requires a broader conversation, and suggested that Samsung has already partially solved it simply by adding a watermark to AI-generated images. A watermark that can easily be removed.\n\nGiven an opening later, an exec suggested our feelings toward AI-generated content might become more favorable in the future.\n\nHere are some of those answers.\n\n“We recognize the issue, because a lot of content is generated by AI,” Choi began. “On the one hand, people want to be more creative, so we believe we have to provide a solution so people can be more creative,” he said. “On the other hand, it’s really hard nowadays to distinguish the real photos and videos from the fake ones. I think this is a problem, we recognize that, and I think it’s a problem we have to solve at an industry level.”\n\n“The C2PA, you may view it as a failure, but it’s still enough to provide a mechanism if people want to validate that those pictures and videos are made by AI. I think we have to provide a mechanism so people can use it. I think it’s an ongoing effort throughout the industry to solve this problem,” he added.\n\n“I think if we make joint efforts to solve this problem, I believe that we should be able to do it,” he concluded.\n\nAs my colleague Jess Weatherbed wrote earlier this week, we’re starting to worry that this sort of “the industry will solve this together” rhetoric, and the C2PA itself, are substitutes for actual meaningful action.\n\nPerhaps responding to our Samsung AI slop watch reporting, Samsung America exec Dave Das also chimed in to say that the company’s still learning about how much AI is acceptable when creating its own ads. He admitted that the company has “just started utilizing some AI content in our creative, and the feedback has been pretty clear.”\n\n“We’re trying to discern what is the right place to use it, and absolutely how to be very clear about when we are using AI generated content vs naturally generated content,” Das said.\n\nBut Das still frames it as a balancing act between business priorities, not a social responsibility. “It really boils down to giving the creator choice,” he said, suggesting that Samsung’s job is to find “the right balance.”\n\nLater in the morning, KTLA-TV tech reporter Rich DeMuro felt out Samsung’s stance with a very different question. He asked whether Samsung might want to make it easier for customers to remove its AI watermark from AI-generated photos.\n\nThree screenshots taken from AI-generated Samsung ads on YouTube. More on Samsung slop watch here. Image: Samsung / The Verge\n\n“If I’m making a Christmas card with all your fun tools, do I really want that to say ‘AI-generated content?’” asked DeMuro.\n\nDrew Blackard, Samsung America’s SVP of mobile product management, took that one. He concluded by saying that “If we feel like consumers really want that ability to remove watermarks, and there are other ways to address the first point around authenticity at the same time, we’ll do both things and deliver the best of what people are wanting out of the experiences.”\n\n“At least right now, there’s enough concern from consumers around authenticity that that’s the primary thing we’ve solved for, in terms of the watermarking both in the metadata and on the photo itself. Not all services do that,” he said.\n\nBlackard also suggested we might look back one day and realize that AI-generated content isn’t such a big deal, that our perceptions might change over time, the same way perceptions changed toward user-generated content to begin with. People were concerned then with “the amount of content now flowing into the system” and how it wasn’t the professional video product they were used to, he said.\n\nI wonder if Samsung and fellow smartphone makers have considered the opposite: that perceptions of AI-generated imagery might become even less favorable after people lose their jobs in favor of cheap-to-produce AI slop, and after it becomes far easier to lie and cheat and steal in the absence of reliable recorded evidence.\n\nI wonder if they’ve considered solving this problem ”at an industry level” before they break the dam, and whether perception might turn against Samsung for helping create the flood that comes after."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nFedEx plans to pass along any refunds resulting from the Supreme Court’s ruling that some of President Donald Trump’s tariffs are “illegal.” In a statement on its website, FedEx notes that while “no refund process has been established by the courts,” the company will reimburse shippers and consumers impacted by tariffs if it gets its money back.\n\nThe delivery giant issued the statement after filing a lawsuit in the US Court of International Trade, asking the Trump administration for a “full refund” of tariff payments. Though FedEx covers the cost of duties and tariffs on a customer’s behalf when packages arrive in the US, it bills customers for the fees later on.\n\n“Our intent is straightforward: if refunds are issued to FedEx, we will issue refunds to the shippers and consumers who originally bore those charges,” FedEx says. “When that will happen and the exact process for requesting and issuing refunds will depend in part on future guidance from the government and the court.”\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court determined that the levies implemented by Trump under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) exceeded the president’s powers. Trump used this law to impose sweeping fees on imported products from China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as put “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of other countries. Days after the ruling, Trump imposed a new 10 percent tariff under the Trade Act of 1974.\n\nAlong with FedEx, over 1,000 companies, including Costco, Revlon, Bausch + Lomb, Dyson, and L’Oréal, have filed lawsuits in the US Court of International Trade in an attempt to recoup the funds that went toward Trump’s tariffs, according to NBC News and CBS."

            "content": "When Amazon first showed off its redesigned Fire TV OS at CES, we were impressed. It’s faster, better organized, and feels similar to Google’s top-notch TV interface. The update is now finally rolling out to the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, making it an even better buy now that it’s on sale for $29.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target — $5 shy of its best price to date. If you want something cheaper and don’t mind waiting for the update to arrive, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Select is also on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, for $19.99 ($20 off), which is $2 more than its all-time low price.\n\nThe new Fire TV OS update makes navigating content even easier, adding tabs across the top for search, home, movies, TV shows, sports, news, and live content that pull recommendations from all of your subscriptions. Your apps now live on their own row, and you can pin up to 20 favorites instead of just six. You also get support for Alexa Plus, letting you search for specific types of content with your voice, jump to particular scenes, control compatible smart home devices, check sports scores, and more. The update also improves the remote, with a long press of the Home button opening a panel so you can quickly adjust audio or check on devices like Ring cameras.\n\nRelated Alexa Plus on the TV is made to save you from your phone\n\nThe Fire TV Stick 4K Plus is also a good streaming device on the hardware front. The middle child in the Fire TV stick lineup, it offers half the storage of the $40 Fire TV Stick 4K, but otherwise shares support for HDR10 Plus, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos. You also get an Alexa Voice Remote included, for quick access to apps and voice controls. For most people, it offers a good balance between features and price.\n\nWe’d recommend the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus overall, but if you just want a cheap and basic 4K streaming stick — maybe one for a second or third TV — the standard Fire TV Stick 4K is hard to ignore at $20. The redesigned Fire TV OS has yet to roll out to the stick, and it has half the RAM so it’s slower. It also lacks Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support, but it still supports HDR10, HDR10 Plus, and Alexa Plus while including an Alexa Voice Remote. You also get access to all the major streaming services, while Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can stream select games from the cloud as they can on Amazon’s other sticks."

Anthropic is in heated negotiations with the Pentagon after refusing to comply with new military contract terms that would require it to loosen the guardrails on its AI models, allowing for “any lawful use,” even mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous lethal weapons.\n\nPentagon CTO Emil Michael is pushing for Anthropic to be designated a “supply chain risk” if it doesn’t comply, a label usually only given to national security threats. Anthropic’s rivals OpenAI and xAI have reportedly agreed to the new terms, but even after a White House meeting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei is still refusing to cross his company’s red line, stating that “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.”"

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined The Verge in May 2025.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThere’s a sale happening at Woot that’s delivering Black Friday-esque deals on video games through March 5th. The “Video Games for All” sale includes discounts on physical games for most modern consoles, making it a great time to treat yourself (or a pal) to some titles that you’ve been waiting to see big price drops for. There are also deals on gaming accessories like totes, controllers, and more. Through February 27th at 11:58PM CT, you can score an additional 20 percent off products looped into this sale by entering the code LEVEL20 at checkout (it caps at $30 total off your order).\n\nEveryone’s tastes are different, but some picks in this sale that especially vibe with me include Silent Hill F, which is fun and very different beast from Bloober Team’s Silent Hill 2 remake (less item hunting, more countering enemy attacks). Of course, who can argue against the pure fun contained within the Super Mario Galaxy double-pack for Switch that includes the original title and its sequel? It’s always cliché to say that there’s something for everyone here, but I think it’s actually true this time.\n\nMore deals and discounts\n\nGovee’s Pendant Light might just be the ticket.

            "content": "is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nIt’s the day of the Pentagon’s looming ultimatum for Anthropic: allow the US military unchecked access to its technology, including for mass surveillance and fully autonomous lethal weapons, or potentially be designated a “supply chain risk” and potentially lose hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts. Amid the intensifying public statements and threats, tech workers across the industry are looking at their own companies’ government and military contracts wondering what kind of future they’re helping to build.\n\nWhile the Department of Defense has spent weeks negotiating with Anthropic over removing its guardrails, including allowing the US military to use Anthropic’s AI kill targets with no human oversight, OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to such terms, although OpenAI is reportedly attempting to adopt the same red lines in the agreements as Anthropic. The overall situation has left employees at some companies with defense contracts feeling betrayed. “When I joined the tech industry, I thought tech was about making people’s lives easier,” an Amazon Web Services employee told The Verge, “but now it seems like it’s all about making it easier to surveil and deport and kill people.”\n\nIn conversations with The Verge, current and former employees from OpenAI, xAI, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google expressed similar feelings about the changing moral landscape of their companies. Organized groups representing 700,000 tech workers at Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and more have signed a letter demanding that the companies reject the Pentagon’s demands. But many saw little chance of their employers — whether they’re directly embroiled in this conflict or not — questioning the government or pushing back.\n\n“From their perspective, they’d love to keep making money and not have to talk about it,” said a software engineer from Microsoft.\n\nSo far, Anthropic has stood its ground. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei put out a statement on Thursday that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” But he has stated that he is not at all opposed to lethal autonomous weapons sometime in the future, just that the technology was not reliable enough “today.” Amodei even offered to partner with the DoD on “R&D to improve the reliability of these systems, but they have not accepted this offer,” he wrote in the statement.\n\nIn the past few years, however, major tech companies have loosened their rules or changed their mission statements to expand into lucrative government or military contracts. In 2024, OpenAI removed a ban on “military and warfare” use cases from its terms of service; after that, it signed a deal with autonomous weapons maker Anduril and then its DoD contract, and just this week, Anthropic changed its oft-touted responsible scaling policy, dropping its longtime safety pledge in order to ensure it stayed competitive in the AI race. Big Tech players like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have also allowed defense and intelligence agencies to use their AI products, including some agreeing to work with ICE despite growing outcry from the public and employees alike.\n\nIn past years, tech workers’ resistance to partnerships and deals they deem harmful to society at large sometimes led to big change. In 2018, for instance, thousands of Google employees successfully pressured the company to end its “Project Maven” partnership with the Pentagon, and Microsoft workers presented leadership with an anti-ICE petition signed by about 500 Microsoft employees, though Microsoft still works with the agency. In 2020, after the murder of George Floyd, tech companies made public statements about and financial commitments supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. But in recent months, the industry has seen a very different reality: a culture of fear and silence, especially amid cooperation with the Trump administration and ICE, tech workers recently told The Verge.\n\nCompanies have followed in the footsteps of longtime surveillance and military tech partnerships, who have only become more hawkish. That includes the Peter Thiel-cofounded Palantir, whose CEO Alex Karp recently stated to shareholders that “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world, and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them. And we hope you’re in favor of that.” (Protect Democracy, a nonprofit, recently put out an open letter calling for Congressional oversight of the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted use of AI. )\n\nOpenAI, Google, Microsoft, xAI, and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA former xAI employee told The Verge, “Everyone is actually working on killer robots at this point,” adding that he believes everyone will follow in the footsteps of Palantir, Anduril, and xAI, since the government sentiment is that if a company doesn’t acquiesce, it’s “against the benefits of the country, in a sense.” He said there’s a “big push for working with the military, and the trend is it’s cool to do it… You’re a patriot if you do it.”\n\nA Google employee called the situation a “dominance display from Hegseth that is disgusting.” He added, “Over and over AI is presenting us with choices about who we want to be and what kind of society and future we want to have. And they’re coming at us fast and with, really, the least thoughtful and least principled leaders in power that we could imagine. I can only thank Anthropic for insisting on the decent path and using their leverage — that they are indispensable — to chart a course toward a humane world and a humane future.”\n\nThe AWS employee told The Verge that “boundaries have definitely eroded in terms of the customers big tech is willing to court” and that there’s “a deliberate whitewashing of the implications of new lucrative deals.” She recalled recently receiving an email from an AWS executive touting a more than $580 million contract with the US Air Force, among other partnerships, as a sign of Amazon’s AI successes, with no acknowledgment of the broader scope or harms involved.\n\n“If the government is hell-bent on pursuing technologies like this, they should have to build them themselves, and be answerable for those decisions,” she said.\n\nThe erosion may have extended to internal culture as well — normalizing the idea that companies should always be watching. The AWS employee said that she and her colleagues are tracked on how much they’re using AI for their jobs, how often they’re working from the office, and more. “I can see myself and my coworkers getting more desensitized to surveillance on ourselves at work, and I’m worried that means we’re obeying, complying, and giving up too much in advance,” she said.\n\nAn OpenAI employee said the general feeling within the AI industry over the last few weeks “has reopened the door to more discussion… about the values and the future of the technology.” The employee said that the Pentagon-Anthropic situation, the recent ICE headlines, and the fast advancement of AI have been some of the main factors opening up those discussions internally.\n\nEven so, people who are immigrants or in more vulnerable positions are more afraid to speak, the OpenAI employee said.\n\nAnthropic, the former xAI employee said, seems like it’s in a position where it can say no and still stay afloat. Its focus on enterprise rather than consumer AI business may make it more sustainable even without government contracts, offering it some leverage. A software engineer at Microsoft said of Anthropic, speaking generally, “I was surprised to see them stand on some form of principle. I don’t know how long it’ll last.”\n\n“Will it last?” seems to be the question on everyone’s lips. The Pentagon has already reportedly asked two major defense contractors, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to provide information about their reliance on Anthropic’s Claude, as it moves to potentially designate Anthropic a “supply chain risk,” a classification usually reserved for threats to national security and rarely, if ever, assigned to a US company. It also reportedly may be considering invoking the Defense Production Act to attempt to force Anthropic to comply with its request.\n\nJust like with any other AI company, if Anthropic folds, the Microsoft employee said, there’s little chance of it or others pulling back on killer robots and surveillance. “Once you’re in the door with the Department of Defense or whatever we’re calling it now… I think it’s probably hard for them to actually have the oversight they claim. It’s just going to be lucrative to basically give themselves permission to do the thing that makes the most money.”\n\nIn Microsoft’s own case, he said he doesn’t expect the company to adhere to any sort of ethical principles. The company has worked extensively with the Israeli Defense Forces, including for mass surveillance of Palestinians and dissidents, despite employee protest. (It said it ended some parts of the partnership last year.)\n\nAnother Microsoft employee told The Verge that although “Microsoft holds a Responsible AI ‘commitment,’… they are currently attempting to play both sides for the sake of profit rather than meaningfully commitment to Responsible AI.”\n\nBut this is nothing new, one AI startup employee said. In her eyes, the boundaries have often been “fuzzy, especially within AI,” about what kinds of things companies are willing to let their technology power. “A lot of it has been going on beneath the surface for as long as AI has been around.”\n\nThe AWS employee emphasized that “we need cross-tech solidarity and a coherent, worker-led vision for AI now more than ever.”\n\n“The safeguards that Anthropic is trying to keep in place are no mass surveillance of Americans and no fully autonomous weapons, which just means that they want a human in the loop if the machine is going to kill somebody,” she added. “Even if this technology were perfect — which it isn’t — I think most Americans don’t want machines that kill people without human oversight running around in an America that’s become an AI-powered mass surveillance state.”"

            "content": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nSince that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own, however. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with non-consensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted to — AI safety to be prioritized.” …\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

OpenAI also shared that it now has 50 million paying subscribers.\n\n“Subscriber momentum accelerated meaningfully to start the year, with January and February on track to be the largest months for new subscribers in our history,” the company wrote in a blog post. “People use ChatGPT to learn, write, plan, and build. As usage scales, the product improves in ways people feel immediately: faster responses, higher reliability, stronger safety, and more consistent performance.”\n\nThe new weekly active user figure marks a jump of 100 million users from the 800 million that OpenAI reported in October 2025.\n\nOpenAI shared the new numbers as part of its announcement that it has raised $110 billion in private funding, marking one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The new funding includes a $50 billion investment from Amazon, along with $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, at a $730 billion pre-money valuation. The round remains open, and the company expects more investors to join."

The deal is reportedly valued at around $150 million per season, a significant jump from the roughly $85 million ESPN reportedly paid. All races are available to Apple TV subscribers at no extra charge. The previous partnership with ESPN achieved an average viewership of 1.3 million in its final year.\n\nNotably, Netflix was previously reported to be eyeing U.S. media rights for Formula 1 back in 2022."

            "content": "Starting this week, Perplexity subscribers will have a new agentic tool at their disposal.\n\nPerplexity Computer, in the company’s words, “unifies every current AI capability into a single system.” More specifically, Perplexity says it is a computer user agent that can execute complex workflows independently using 19 different AI models, even creating subagents to handle specific problems.\n\nThe tool is available now, only on the company’s highest subscription tier, the $200/month Perplexity Max. It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.\n\nTechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in example workflows on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial, or legal data; creating analysis; and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations.\n\nPerplexity invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company canceled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.\n\nThis tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.\n\nThe company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base — in the tens of millions of users — pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nNow, Perplexity executives say they are aiming for a more boutique set of users, with products that serve people making “GDP-moving decisions.” Executives in the briefing, who asked not to be identified by name, described prioritizing enterprise subscriptions, particularly for deep research.\n\n“You don’t hear us talk about MAUs ever, because we’re not actually on a mission to get as many users as possible,” one executive said.\n\nPerplexity recently released a new benchmark for complex research tasks, called Draco, where (no surprise) its own deep research offering beats out competitors like Gemini.\n\nPerplexity says it is no longer reliant on other companies’ APIs for its web index and now has its own AI-optimized search API. But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.\n\n“Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done in Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.\n\nA visualization of model usage by Perplexity users over time. Image Credits:Perplexity\n\nIf one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.\n\nThe company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear.\n\nStill, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on user fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.\n\nAnd there is more on the horizon: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.\n\nOne executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.\n\nHowever, the execs at the briefing dismiss such complaints: “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” one said."

Fans have also honed in on a suspicious-looking cloud in the trailer, which looks like a Gyarados-slash-Lapras flying through the sky — perhaps it’s a nod to a new legendary Pokémon?\n\nPokémon already explored a tropical island vibe in the Hawaii-inspired “Sun and Moon” games, which came out nearly 10 years ago, but there’s still a ton to explore in that sort of setting, especially now that the franchise is embracing open-world maps. Not all tropical archipelagos are alike!\n\nMain series Pokémon games usually get released in November, which would mean that we have almost two years to wait before we can explore this new region … but hopefully we’ll be surprised. It already seems like forever ago since Pokémon Scarlet and Violet came out in 2022. But when that game came out, fans criticized it for feeling rushed and being rife with glitches. So if a later release date means we’ll get something incredible, I’m happy to wait.\n\nIn the meantime, Pokémon fans can buy reissues of the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen games today for the Switch … but they cost $20. It’s too bad that there isn’t an extremely easy and legally dubious way to get those games on your phone for free."

But as the Pentagon’s Friday afternoon deadline for Anthropic’s compliance approaches, more than 300 Google employees and over 60 OpenAI employees have signed an open letter urging the leaders of their companies to support Anthropic and refuse this unilateral use.\n\nSpecifically, Anthropic stood in opposition to the use of AI for domestic mass surveillance and autonomous weaponry. The open letter’s signatories seek to encourage their employers to “put aside their differences and stand together” to uphold the boundaries Anthropic has asserted.\n\n“They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,” the letter says. “That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.”\n\nThe letter specifically calls on executives at Google and OpenAI to maintain Anthropic’s red lines against mass surveillance and fully automated weaponry. “We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War’s current demands.”\n\nLeaders at the companies have not yet formally reponded to the letter. TechCrunch has reached out to Google and OpenAI for comment.\n\nHowever, informal statements suggest both companies are sympathetic to Anthropic’s side of the case. In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he doesn’t “personally think the Pentagon should be threatening DPA against these companies.” According to a CNN reporter, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that the company shares Anthropic’s red lines against autonomous weapons and mass surveillance.\n\nAgreed.

            "content": "A few months ago, a family came into Pasadena Cyclery in Pasadena, California, for a repair on what they thought was their teenager’s e-bike. “I can’t fix that here,’ Daniel Purnell, a store manager and technician, remembers telling them. “That’s a motorcycle.” The mother got upset. She didn’t realize that what she thought was an e-bike could go much faster, perhaps up to 55 miles per hour.\n\n“There’s definitely an education problem,” Purnell says. In California, bike advocates are pushing a new bill designed to clear up that confusion around what counts as an electric bicycle—and what doesn’t.\n\nIt’s a tricky balance. On one hand, backers want to allow riders access to new, faster, and more affordable non-car transportation options, ones that don’t require licenses and are emission-free. On the other hand, people, and especially kids, seem to be getting hurt. E-bike-related injuries jumped more than 1,020 percent nationwide between 2020 and 2024, according to hospital data, though it’s not clear if the stats-keepers can routinely distinguish between e-bikes and their faster, “e-moto” cousins. (Moped and powered-assisted cycle injuries jumped 67 percent in that same period.)\n\n“We’re overdue to have better e-bike regulation,” says California state senator Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat who sponsored the bill and represents parts of North County in San Diego. “This has been an ongoing and growing issue for years.”\n\nSenate Bill 1167 would make it illegal for retailers to label higher-powered, electric-powered vehicles as e-bikes. It would clarify that e-bikes have fully operative pedals and electric motors that don’t exceed 750 watts, enough to hit top speeds between 20 and 28 mph."

The employee, she said, “used confidential OpenAI information in connection with external prediction markets (e.g. Polymarket).”\n\n“Our policies prohibit employees from using confidential OpenAI information for personal gain, including in prediction markets,” says spokesperson Kayla Wood. OpenAI has not revealed the name of the employee or the specifics of their trades.\n\nEvidence suggests that this was not an isolated event. Polymarket runs on the Polygon blockchain network, so its trading ledger is pseudonymous but traceable. According to an analysis by the financial data platform Unusual Whales, there have been clusters of activities, which the service flagged as suspicious, around OpenAI-themed events since March 2023.\n\nUnusual Whales flagged 77 positions in 60 wallet addresses as suspected insider trades, looking at the age of the account, trading history, and significance of investment, among other factors. Suspicious trades hinged on the release dates of products like Sora, GPT-5, and the ChatGPT Browser, as well as CEO Sam Altman’s employment status. In November 2023, two days after Altman was dramatically ousted from the company, a new wallet placed a significant bet that he would return, netting over $16,000 in profits. The account never placed another bet.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former tech worker who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at kateknibbs.09.\n\nThe behavior fits into patterns typical of insider trades. “The tell is the clustering. In the 40 hours before OpenAI launched its browser, 13 brand-new wallets with zero trading history appeared on the site for the first time to collectively bet $309,486 on the right outcome,” says Unusual Whales CEO Matt Saincome. “When you see that many fresh wallets making the same bet at the same time, it raises a real question about whether the secret is getting out.”\n\nPrediction markets have exploded in popularity in recent years. These platforms allow customers to buy “event contracts” on the outcomes of future events ranging from the winner of the Super Bowl to the daily price of Bitcoin to whether the United States will go to war with Iran. There are a wide array of markets tied to events in the technology sector; you can trade on what Nvidia’s quarterly earnings will be, or when Tesla will launch a new car, or which AI companies will IPO in 2026.\n\nAs the platforms have grown, so have concerns that they allow traders to profit from insider knowledge. “This prediction market world makes the Wild West look tame in comparison,” says Jeff Edelstein, a senior analyst at the betting news site InGame. “If there's a market that exists where the answer is known, somebody's going to trade on it.”\n\nEarlier this week, Kalshi announced that it had reported several suspicious insider trading cases to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the government agency overseeing these markets. In one instance, an employee of the popular YouTuber Mr. Beast was suspended for two years and fined $20,000 for making trades related to the streamer’s activities; in another, the far-right political candidate Kyle Langford was banned from the platform for making a trade on his own campaign. The company also announced a number of initiatives to prevent insider trading and market manipulation.\n\nWhile Kalshi has heavily promoted its crackdown on insider trading, Polymarket has stayed silent on the matter. The company did not return requests for comments.\n\nIn the past, major trades on technology-themed markets have sparked speculation that there are Big Tech employees profiting by using their insider knowledge to gain an edge. One notorious example is the so-called “Google whale,” a pseudonymous account on Polymarket that made over $1 million trading on Google-related events, including a market on who the most-searched person of the year would be in 2025. (It was the singer D4vd, who is best known for his connection to an ongoing murder investigation after a young fan’s remains were found in a vehicle registered to him.)"

            "content": "Less than a year ago, Skydance Media closed its $8 billion merger with Paramount, making the Trump-friendly Ellison family—billionaire Oracle founder Larry and his son David, CEO of Paramount Skydance—among the most powerful media moguls in the country. A looming Paramount Skydance merger with Warner Bros. Discovery would expand their empire even further.\n\nNow that Netflix has backed out of its bid to acquire WBD, the Ellisons stand to gain an entirely new trove of significant intellectual property, from DC Comics to Harry Potter. According to Reuters, Warner Bros. agreed to be acquired by Paramount Skydance in a $110 billion deal signed Friday, with Paramount Skydance agreeing to pay a $7 billion termination fee if federal regulators don’t approve the merger.\n\nParamount’s merger with Skydance has already brought about mass layoffs, including at CBS News, where Free Press founder Bari Weiss is leading a cultural overhaul as editor in chief. In January, Oracle became a partial owner of TikTok, giving the Ellisons even more cultural currency.\n\nHere’s everything the family would control if the WBD deal goes through.\n\nCBS and CBS News\n\nBesides its news division, which includes 60 Minutes, CBS is also home to hits like Tracker and Matlock, along with reality stalwarts Survivor and Big Brother.\n\nHBO and HBO Max\n\nAmong the most Emmy-winningest networks to exist, HBO’s library includes classics like Game of Thrones, The Wire, and Veep, as well as newer hits like The Pitt, The Gilded Age, and Thrones spin-off A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. (Outside of Canada, HBO Max is also a key distributor of the hockey smut drama Heated Rivalry.)\n\nCNN\n\nWhile CNN’s ratings dipped last year, it remains a news juggernaut and a top 5 cable network, featuring household names like John King, Kaitlan Collins, and Anderson Cooper (who recently announced he will be leaving 60 Minutes at the end of the current season).\n\nDC Comics\n\nThe merger would put Paramount Skydance in control of storied comic book franchises like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nThe wizarding world of Harry Potter, including all eight fantasy films and the upcoming HBO television series slated to premiere in 2027 would also be under the Ellisons’ purview.\n\nTikTok\n\nAs of a deal finalized in January, Oracle now holds a 15 percent stake in TikTok’s US operations.\n\nStar Trek\n\nAll 13 Star Trek movies and television shows are owned by Paramount Skydance. At a press event last year, Dana Goldberg, cochair of Paramount Pictures and chair of Paramount Television, said the franchise would be a “priority across the company.”\n\nWarner Bros. Studios\n\nHome to blockbusters like Barbie, The Dark Knight, and more recently, One Battle After Another and Sinners.\n\nComedy Central\n\nSouth Park announced a five-year, $1.5 billion deal with Paramount last July, just prior to the merger with Skydance. The show has since skewered Donald Trump and those in his administration regularly.\n\nAvatar Studios\n\nIn December, Paramount+ announced it would be the exclusive streamer of Avatar Studios content, including animated film The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender and series Avatar: Seven Havens.\n\nA Bunch of Cable Channels and Networks\n\nThe Food Network, HGTV, Discovery, TLC, OWN, Adult Swim, Showtime, TNT, and TBS are all part of WBD.\n\nOther Key Franchises\n\nOther notable titles that are or would be controlled by the Ellisons, pending the WBD takeover, include: The Lord of the Rings franchise, the Mission Impossible franchise, and the distribution rights to Dune: Part Three.\n\n2/27/26, 2:34 PM EDT: WIRED updated details about Paramount Skydance's deal with Warner Bros. Discovery."

            "content": "Before last week the name Alap Shah didn’t ring a bell for many people. The 45-year-old financial analyst and tech entrepreneur had spent the past two decades working in relative obscurity. Then last weekend he coauthored a blog with the research firm Citrini titled “The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis.” It was a “thought exercise” about the impacts of artificial intelligence, and it predicted that in June of that year, AI would jack up unemployment past 10 percent and force the Dow down, down, down. Writing in a confident, Nostradamic tone—as if auditioning for starring roles in the next Michael Lewis book—the authors painted a picture of a flywheel in reverse: AI agents take jobs from workers, people spend less, and struggling corporations conduct layoffs on top of layoffs.\n\nThere wasn’t much in it that hadn’t been previously heard, or speculated about. Tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have already estimated that half the entry level white collar jobs will soon be gone, and earlier this year, Anthropic’s release of new agentic tools spurred a Wall Street selloff. Nonetheless the report hit with the force of the blizzard blowing through lower Manhattan. When the closing chimes sounded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow was down 800 points. The name Alap Shah was now ringing bells.\n\nThe achievement is less impressive than it seems. Wall Street, like the rest of us, is in a persistent state of anxiety about AI, and it doesn’t take much to trigger a mini-panic. Financial markets don’t necessarily map to reality, but the jitters reflect a wider disquiet. The AI future is in a William Gibson zone—it’s here, but unevenly distributed—and the news from those already living in the agent-packed, AI code-writing universe is both exciting and unsettling. Emphasis on unsettling.\n\nNo one—no one!—knows exactly how AI will impact the economy, but clearly it will be significant. Right now stocks are soaring, so it seems to make sense to keep the party going. But then along comes the latest doom manifesto, or a paper indicating that a traditional business sector might be threatened by AI, and suddenly money managers are reminded that the biggest issue of our time is totally unresolved. Case in point: earlier this month, a tiny company (valuation under $6 million) that had previously sold karaoke machines pivoted to AI-powered shipping logistics and put out a report saying that it had discovered some efficiencies in loading semi-trucks. That was enough to erase billions of dollars from the share prices of several major logistics companies, none of which had karaoke experience.\n\nAfter it did its job on Wall Street, the Citrini report came under considerable fire. Critics climbed over each other to proclaim its flimsiness. For one thing, they pointed out, AI has had very little discernable impact on the economy so far. Others cited the long history of resilience after technological upheavals. A mocking response by the respected trading firm Citadel Securities read, “For AI to produce a sustained negative demand shock, the economy must see a material acceleration in adoption, experience near-total labor substitution, no fiscal response, negligible investment absorption, and unconstrained scaling of compute.”\n\nThe most withering critiques disputed the report’s contention that much of the economy involves non-productive “rent-seeking” by middlemen and market makers, taking advantage of the laziness of the general population. When everyone has a few dozen AI agents working on their behalf, writes Shah, consumers will be able to effortlessly find the best goods for the best prices. Apps will be rendered unnecessary—just type what you want into the LLM and an army of agents will do everything for you. The “poster child” for this phenomenon, Shah says, is DoorDash. Instead of being limited to the restaurants on the app, consumers will send out AI agents to find their ideal meal options, contracting directly with restaurants and delivery people—no apps needed. Zero friction! The DoorDashes of the world are avocado toast!"

In my opinion, Aventon has made the least ebikey bike on the ebike market, which provides the most fun I’ve yet had riding an electrically powered bicycle. (Sorry, I couldn’t in good conscience write “ebike” in that sentence a third time.)\n\nThe Soltera 3 is a class 1 electric bike, meaning it has a top speed of 20 miles per hour. (Motor-assisted, of course. Your legs combined with a downhill can get this thing going a whole lot faster.) It also lacks any sort of throttle control. However, the bike's pedal assist is super responsive and offers immediate aid with the slightest bit of rider input.\n\nIt has a claimed range of up to 70 miles—though, given how hilly my area is and how much assistance I typically use on an ebike, I got closer to 50 on a full charge—and takes less than two hours to charge its integrated battery from flat to full.\n\nCarbon Belt\n\nPhotograph: Michael Venutolo-Mantovani\n\nOK, now that all of the spec sheet info is out of the way, we can talk about the coolest part of the Soltera 3: It has a carbon belt in place of a chain."

            "content": "The new wave of AI-powered technologies have almost entirely taken over the apps and digital services we use every day, from photo editors to fitness trackers. There's even a notable AI app available for podcasts too. It’s called Huxe.\n\nAt the core of Huxe is a daily brief, a sort of personal productivity podcast tailored to your tastes and requirements, generated from the sources you pick. Connect up your calendar and email account, and every morning you get a quick audio summary to get you set for the day. The idea is that a 15-minute audio podcast can replace the much longer amount of time you'd otherwise spend trying to figure out what's happening with your inbox and your schedule.\n\nThe audio emphasis of Huxe is no surprise, as the team behind the app previously worked on Google NotebookLM, a research tool that has its own podcast-style Audio Overviews feature. Huxe is similar, but it draws information from your emails and calendar entries.\n\nThere's more to Huxe as well, including audio deep dives on any topic of your choice, as well as news summaries. The app is completely free to use right now, and you can sign up through the apps for Android or iOS.\n\nGetting Started\n\nRegistering interests with Huxe. Photograph: David Nield\n\nTo start taking advantage of Huxe’s personalized audio production powers, you need to tell it a little bit about yourself. As you work through the setup process, which includes supplying an email address and your name, you'll be prompted to connect your email and calendar accounts. (Google and Outlook accounts are both supported.)\n\nYou'll also be asked to choose a few topics that you're interested in from a list, generated by what's in your inbox and on your schedule—click Edit to make changes, and Add to add interests that Huxe hasn't picked up on yet. You can specify pretty much any topic you like, and Huxe will understand what you mean.\n\nWhen you get into the app proper, you are introduced to what are called livecasts, which are like radio stations for AI-generated speech content: For me, these livecasts have titles such as Big Tech Roundup, Today in AI, and Product Drops, which gives you some idea of what to expect. You can also get audio summaries about specific companies, such as Apple and Meta in my case."

            "content": "Blood pressure is simultaneously the least exciting yet one of the most important vital signs that a fitness tracker can measure. Unlike a pedometer or sports watch, it’s not going to incentivize you to get active. Unlike a continuous glucose monitor, it’s not going to help you lose weight. A gigantic blood pressure cuff isn’t exactly a gorgeous or enticing accessory to wear. In fact, getting your arm squeezed so tight can be downright claustrophobic.\n\nBut there’s a reason why blood pressure is one of the first tests you get at the doctor’s office. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is one of the top killers in the United States. It can result in conditions like heart attacks or strokes. There are usually no symptoms; hypertension is called “the silent killer” for a reason. Nearly one in three people worldwide has it. And unlike diseases like cancer, we already have simple, readily available tools to treat it, like exercise and reducing the amount of salt that you eat.\n\nLast year, a few fitness trackers debuted hypertension notifications in their suite of features—most notably, the Apple Watch. Unlike the Apple Watch, the Aktiia Hilo band does not merely notify you when you have signs of hypertension. It monitors your blood pressure up to 25 times a day, 24 hours a day. Aktiia reached out to me for testing when it launched; WIRED is the first in the United States to test it. This device could change many lives for the better when it goes on sale in the US later this year. (It's available now in some countries.)\n\nLight and Sound\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nThe Aktiia Hilo comes in two parts—the slim, cuffless band you wear every day and a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuff you use to calibrate the device every month or so. Both have to be connected to the Hilo app (iOS, Android). Once both are connected, the app will remind you to abstain from alcohol, caffeine, and exercise for at least 30 minutes beforehand and to sit and relax with your back supported for at least five minutes."

            "content": "When Netflix dropped the first season of Love Is Blind in February 2020, it offered a reprieve from the washboard abs that normally seem like a casting requirement for reality TV shows.\n\nThe premise—that couples get engaged “sight unseen” after talking to each other through pods, then, following a big reveal, decide if they want to get married—featured just the right amount of mess. Who can forget Jessica allowing her dog to sip wine or an insulted Carlton throwing his fiancee's engagement ring into a pool? Meanwhile Lauren and Cameron's unvarnished conversations highlighted the awkwardness that sometimes accompanies interracial dating.\n\nIt was a reality show, but it seemed like a format that could actually allow people to fall in love without getting bogged down in superficial distractions and expectations. Maybe.\n\nNow in its 10th season, Love Is Blind is a cornerstone of Netflix’s reality TV cinematic universe. But while each cycle brings us standout women who earnestly buy into the show’s original conceit, it’s getting tougher to find any men to root for.\n\nWith the latest US season featuring Chris Fusco, who voluntarily compares himself to Andrew Tate and derides a fellow male cast member for being “submissive,” and Alex Henderson, a Trump-loving crypto bro with an ever-shifting backstory, increasingly the men of Love Is Blind seem to have been plucked straight from the manosphere.\n\nSeason after season, the women on the show (and viewers at home) are subjected to men who make shallow, body-shaming comments, struggle with anger and emotional regulation, and sometimes appear uncomfortable with their partner’s success.\n\nWhile race still comes up, it’s often in a superficial and offensive way. Contestants either find themselves struggling with the fact that their match is a person of color, or dealing with unaddressed internalized racism that downplays their own worth while prioritizing whiteness in a partner—a worthwhile topic that deserves far more nuance or a therapist’s involvement.\n\nBroadly, Love Is Blind seems to be pushing conservative ideals—trad wives, divorce shaming, and big families even when contestants clearly aren’t enthusiastic about the idea of having kids.\n\nKinetic Content, which produces Love Is Blind, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen 28-year-old Emma Betsinger of the current Ohio season discusses the scars on her arms—a result of surgeries due to her birthmarks—with podmate Steven Sunday, a 32-year-old who works in finance, he grills her about how she lost her virginity instead of asking thoughtful questions. Betsinger’s health issues have made her hesitant to have children, but instead of taking her at her word, the men she dates stress that she would make a great mother.\n\nThen there’s fast-talking Henderson, 31, who, despite not having a job besides the day trading he claims to do, expects his fiancée Ashley Carpenter, a 34-year-old claims manager, to pack up and move to either Arizona or Florida, her possible promotion be damned. Carpenter’s dad, a MAGA “patriarch,” barely lets his wife speak during the family’s meeting with Henderson and later touts his own daughter’s attractiveness as being “dyn-o-mite.”\n\nAt a time when women are outpacing men in obtaining college degrees and are narrowing the pay gap in some cities, some of the guys in Love Is Blind’s recent seasons also seem to react poorly to having high-achieving partners.\n\nLast year in Denver, Jordan Keltner couldn’t seem to move past his insecurities around fiancée Megan Walerius’ wealth, ultimately leading to their breakup after he said he was too “tired” to have conversations with her after work or keep up with her rich-person hobbies. This season, Fusco, a 33-year-old account executive, gets a tour of his doctor fiancée Jessica Barrett's multi-bedroom Ohio home and later demeans her for not going to pilates every day. “I don't care if she’s a neurosurgeon or if she’s a goddamn $100-million trust fund,\" he says, while complaining about their lack of sexual chemistry before spending a chunk of time trying to convince already-engaged contestant Bri McNess that she needs a “dominant” man like him."

Astound is offering its gigabit plan for just $35 a month for three years. That cost includes the equipment fees and, if you're quick enough, you may be able to tack on free installation as well. Astound's gigabit plan is typically $60 a month, which means you can save $25 on your monthly bill. Astound is primarily a cable internet provider, but select cities will have access to Astound's fiber plans -- with speeds up to 5,000Mbps.

For example, that 500Mbps plan has a cost per Mbps of 6 cents. Compare that to a similarly priced plan or one even cheaper from another provider -- such as the Ziply Fiber 100 plan, which has a lower starting price at $20 per month but significantly lower maximum download speeds (100Mbps) and thus a higher cost per Mbps -- and Frontier Fiber's 500Mbps plan stands out as the much better internet deal.

Speeds of 100Mbps for $50 per month equate to a cost per Mbps of 50 cents, which is high compared to most internet plans. On the other hand, the convenience of a prepaid service, free equipment rental and a three-year price guarantee go a long way to make up for the high cost per Mbps.

While a slew of perks and promos might be enticing to customers, a low-cost-per-Mbps plan will often be the best internet deal. For example, Frontier Fiber 500 includes maximum download and upload speeds of 500Mbps starting at $45 monthly for a cost per Mbps of 9 cents. Compare that to a similarly priced plan or one even cheaper from another provider -- such as the Xfinity Connect plan, which has a lower starting price at $20 to $30 per month but significantly lower maximum download (150Mbps) and upload (10Mbps) speeds and thus a higher cost per Mbps -- and Frontier Fiber 500 stands out as the much better internet deal. If you have similar pricing and speed options from multiple providers, look for special promotions, equipment costs, contract requirements and other service factors to determine which provider has the best deal. Show more\n\nCan I get a deal on internet without a contract? Yes. Many providers, including AT&T, Frontier, Google Fiber, Spectrum and Verizon Fios offer their best internet deals and incentives without requiring you to sign a contract. Other providers, such as Cox and Xfinity, may require you to sign a contract to get the lowest introductory rate in select areas.

Most major providers have a discount internet program available to qualifying low-income households, including those with students and seniors.

Between sparse population density and limited infrastructure, cable and fiber often give these areas a skip. As a result, many households are left relying on slower and older options like DSL, satellite or even fixed wireless service. That frustration is compounded by rising costs. A recent CNET survey revealed that 63% of Americans are paying more for internet that still feels unreliable. Even with the FCC now defining broadband as a minimum of 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload, many rural communities fall far below that standard.\n\nFor most rural households, T-Mobile Home Internet stands out as the top option. Its wide availability makes it accessible where wired service is unavailable and plans start at just $50 a month. Unlimited data and free equipment add to its appeal, making it a practical solution for areas underserved by traditional providers. Depending on your location, other providers worth considering include Ziply Fiber, Mediacom, CenturyLink, Kinetic and Rise Broadband. If none of those options are available, Starlink remains the strongest satellite choice. Here are CNET's top choices for rural internet providers based on availability, performance, pricing, data policies and customer satisfaction.\n\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.

While service isn’t the cheapest or the fastest of any rural internet provider, the unlimited data, free equipment and mobile bundle discounts help boost the provider’s overall value.

Those speeds are a boost from what T-Mobile Home Internet previously offered (72 to 245Mbps), thanks to equipment upgrades. Now, T-Mobile Home Internet offers two speed ranges and a slew of new perks to promote its plans. While those speeds may not be guaranteed, they're still an impressive boost to such a broadly available fixed wireless internet provider. Plus, all plans come without the hassle of added fees, data caps or contracts.

If you can get only 10Mbps or lower at your address and there are other options available, I'd recommend shopping elsewhere. There's a $17 monthly fee if you rent your Wi-Fi equipment, but this fee is skippable if you use your own equipment. You can also purchase your equipment for $200 up front, which might be a better option for long-term service.

However, select areas might be serviceable for its faster fiber speed tiers, offering gigabit speeds.

Where available, Rise Broadband would be my choice over satellite internet, since the provider offers speeds up to 250Mbps and latency low enough to support online gaming and truly unlimited data options -- all for a relatively low price compared to satellite. Rise offers a $5 equipment rental for a TP-Link DecoX21 Wi-Fi 6 mesh router. You can add extra mesh routers for $5 more a month, which may be useful for boosting whole-home Wi-Fi speeds.

For a satellite internet service, speeds aren't bad (100 to 350Mbps), and the unlimited data and low latency are a nice bonus, but initial and ongoing costs are high. The entry-level plan is priced at $80 a month with another plan available at $120 monthly, plus equipment will cost upwards of $349.

Ziply's entry-level plan, for example, starts at just $60 per month for symmetrical upload and download speeds of up to 300Mbps. The 300Mbps speed tier starts at $30 per month. All plans come with unlimited data and no contract requirements. Ziply has an impressive fiber network, but only about half of Ziply service areas are eligible for fiber service, according to the FCC. All others will rely on a DSL network which, like most DSL services, presents one plan option for the fastest speeds available.

Viasat: Pricing is a bit higher than rival satellite provider Hughesnet, but Viasat may offer a higher data allowance and faster max speeds, depending on where you live. If satellite internet is your only option, be sure to compare Hughesnet and Viasat closely before deciding on which is best for your home.\n\nFixed wireless and satellite internet are most common in rural and suburban areas, because providers can cover a large area with a single antenna tower, or with a constellation of satellites, and without needing to run cable to each home address. Wireless Internet Service Providers Association\n\nHow to improve your rural internet speeds\n\nInternet speeds tend to be slower in rural America. Here are some ways to help boost your home internet speeds in rural areas.\n\nSwitch providers or plans . A surefire way to improve your speeds is to switch to a provider with faster speeds or upgrade your plan with your current provider if you can. Faster providers or plans aren’t always available, but the search tool further up the page will give you an idea of what’s available in your area.\n\nA surefire way to improve your speeds is to switch to a provider with faster speeds or upgrade your plan with your current provider if you can. Faster providers or plans aren’t always available, but the search tool further up the page will give you an idea of what’s available in your area. Used a wired Ethernet connection . It’s common to experience slower speeds when using a Wi-Fi connection. If you have a stationary device with an Ethernet port, such as a desktop computer, gaming console or smart TV, plug it directly into your modem or router via an Ethernet cable for a faster, more reliable connection.\n\nIt’s common to experience slower speeds when using a Wi-Fi connection. If you have a stationary device with an Ethernet port, such as a desktop computer, gaming console or smart TV, plug it directly into your modem or router via an Ethernet cable for a faster, more reliable connection. Upgrade your equipment, or move closer to it. When only Wi-Fi will do, a high-quality router will help to keep your speeds as fast as possible throughout your home. If your connection is spotty, try moving closer to the router or adding Wi-Fi extenders to your network.\n\nWhen only Wi-Fi will do, a high-quality router will help to keep your speeds as fast as possible throughout your home. If your connection is spotty, try moving closer to the router or adding Wi-Fi extenders to your network. Limit the number of connected devices. The more active devices you have on your Wi-Fi network, the slower your speeds can be on each device. When running a particularly demanding task, such as streaming in HD or downloading a video game file, try disconnecting other, less-used devices from your network.\n\nThe more active devices you have on your Wi-Fi network, the slower your speeds can be on each device. When running a particularly demanding task, such as streaming in HD or downloading a video game file, try disconnecting other, less-used devices from your network. Watch your data usage. Some rural internet providers do enforce data caps. Going over your limit could result in significantly slower speeds for the remainder of your billing cycle, so keep an eye on your data usage if you have a cap.\n\nHow we chose the best rural internet providers\n\nAvailability is an important consideration for CNET when evaluating home internet providers, but it plays an even larger role when it comes to rural areas where there are fewer practical broadband options.\n\nUsing the most recent FCC data, I determined which wired and wireless providers had the largest coverage areas, particularly in regions with low population densities. I then compared advertised speeds, pricing and service details of each to determine which providers may be the best option for rural households.\n\nRural ISPs tend to be slower for roughly the same monthly costs as ISPs in urban areas, which means they tend to have a higher cost per Mbps. If you can qualify for a low-income plan, you can shave some money off your internet bill, and you can also save by buying your own internet equipment instead of renting. Ultimately, the best plan for your household comes down to your budget and how much internet speed you actually need.\n\nFor more information about our review process, see our guide to how CNET reviews internet providers.\n\nRural internet FAQs\n\nWhat are my options for internet in a rural area? Satellite internet from Hughesnet, Starlink or Viasat is almost always going to be an option because of the wireless delivery, but satellite comes with a few downsides, not least of which is the high pricing. Other wireless internet options for rural areas include fixed wireless service from providers such as Rise Broadband and AT&T and 5G home internet. T-Mobile offers the greatest 5G coverage in rural areas with max speeds of 133 to 415Mbps starting at $50 a month. DSL is another popular internet option in rural areas, but speeds can vary significantly by location and provider. For the fastest rural DSL speeds, look to ISPs CenturyLink and Kinetic. Cable internet is will likely be your best option for speed variety and connection reliability, but availability is limited in rural areas. Show more\n\nWhy aren't there more rural internet options? Installation and operation costs are the main factors preventing ISPs from expanding their networks into rural or suburban markets with low population density. Satellite and fixed wireless services are common in rural areas because providers can broadcast internet signals over a large area without having to run physical cables to each address. DSL service is also common since the technology largely makes use of existing phone lines, which are readily available in many rural areas. Coaxial (traditional \"cable\") and fiber-optic lines are less accessible in rural areas as the cost of installing lines is often much more than the provider will get in return. This means major cable internet providers like Cox, Spectrum and Xfinity, as well as fiber providers such as AT&T, Google Fiber and Verizon, are less inclined to expand service into rural areas. Show more\n\nWhat internet connection type is best for rural areas? Wired connection types, such as DSL (copper), cable and fiber-optic internet, typically offer faster speeds and better reliability than wireless, although 5G wireless home internet could prove to be a better option than DSL. Although fiber-optic internet is difficult to come by, especially in rural areas, cable internet is available to 82% of US households, according to the FCC, and is capable of download speeds of 250Mbps or higher in nearly all service areas. In rural areas where wired connections are unavailable, fixed wireless or 5G home internet are the top choices. You'll likely get faster speeds, more data (possibly unlimited) and lower latency with fixed wireless or 5G compared with satellite internet. As a last resort, satellite internet is available virtually everywhere. Prices are high for the speeds you get, and data restrictions can make it difficult to use your internet for streaming, but it's an option for rural internet if no others are available. Show more\n\nWho has the fastest rural internet? Ziply Fiber is the fastest rural internet provider with maximum download speeds of up to 50,000Mbps (50Gbps) available in rural parts of Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Ziply Fiber also offers a 5Gbps and 1Gbps plan. Aside from Ziply Fiber, the fastest rural internet providers include Kinetic, Rise Broadband and Mediacom, all of which offer maximum download speeds of around 1Gbps. Show more\n\nIs rural internet fast enough for streaming? Speeds of up to 10Mbps, which are available to nearly all US households, will support light streaming activity such as streaming in standard definition on a single device. Faster speeds, such as CenturyLink's 100Mbps plan or Mediacom's 100Mbps plan, will support streaming in higher resolution and on more devices. The primary issue with streaming in rural areas isn't speed but data. Streaming typically consumes more data than anything else we use the internet for, so you'll want to look for a rural internet option with a high data cap or unlimited data if you typically do a lot of streaming. Try to avoid satellite internet and its strict data limits that, once exceeded, may result in restricted or reduced speeds that cannot support streaming. Show more\n\nIs Viasat or Hughesnet better for rural areas? Viasat has faster maximum speeds -- over 150Mbps in select areas compared with Hughesnet's maximum of 100Mbps -- and possibly higher data allowances, but Hughesnet is cheaper and likely to be the better value. The choice between Hughesnet and Viasat comes down to whether Viasat's higher price is worth the potentially faster speeds and higher data allowance. For more details, check out our Hughesnet versus Viasat comparison. Show more\n\nWill internet service in rural areas get any better? It's doubtful that cable or fiber providers will significantly expand into rural areas unless a driving force like population growth or development occurs, but emerging 5G and satellite technologies could help close the digital divide in the coming years. While AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon are actively deploying 5G service across the US, Elon Musk and his satellite service Starlink are ramping up to completely disrupt the satellite internet market. Stay tuned for updates regarding these technologies and others that could impact your home internet service, rural or otherwise. Show more"

            "content": "Nintendo sure does love teasing us with Game Boy things.\n\nFirst, a collectible Lego Game Boy model last year that almost looked like a real Game Boy (but wasn't). Now, for the 30th anniversary of Pokemon, Nintendo and the Pokemon Group are selling a collectible music player that looks like a tiny Game Boy and plays authentic original Pokemon Red/Blue songs on swappable cartridges, one per song.\n\nThe Game Boy Jukebox is being sold on the Pokemon Center site for a whopping $70. It's so small, it uses button batteries.\n\nThis level of absurdity is standard issue for Nintendo: Just in the last 18 months, we've had Alarmo, a talking Super Mario flower and a Virtual Boy recreation. This new collectible is so tempting precisely because it looks like a little, even more pocketable Game Boy. Except it isn't a Game Boy at all. It's just a music player. Even the dot-matrix \"screen\" is fake -- it's just an overlay that the cartridges display when they're slotted in.\n\nThe music this thing plays is Game Boy-accurate, down to the little boot-up ping. It just makes my skin itch for a new Game Boy (one that isn't already made by several other companies).\n\nBut come on. Make a real Game Boy collectible with preloaded games. One that plays Pokemon Classic games and Tetris and more. You know you want to, Nintendo. It's only a matter of time.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're desperate for all 45 Pokemon Red and Blue songs on a little Game Boy music player, now's your chance."

Below, you'll find a batch of can't-miss films and a look at new releases for the month. If you're still trying to figure out if HBO Max is right for you, skim our review of the Warner Bros. Discovery streamer.\n\nNew releases for February\n\nNote: These descriptions are taken from HBO Max statements and official websites for the films. They've been lightly edited for style.\n\nFeb. 6\n\nBoys Go to Jupiter (2024): Adult animated film. A teenager in suburban Florida desperately hustles to make $5,000 in this dreamy and surreal coming-of-age story.\n\nFeb. 20\n\nDead of Winter (2025): Psychological thriller. A grief-stricken loner (Emma Thompson) caught in a blizzard discovers a young woman imprisoned, forcing this unlikely hero into a dangerous fight for her and the victim's survival.\n\nFeb. 27\n\nChris Fleming: Live at the Palace (2026): Comedy special. Fleming bursts onto the screen with a fun and lighthearted blend of skillful storytelling and wild physicality in his first HBO stand-up special.\n\nThe best movies to watch\n\n\n\nThe films below include notable new releases and blockbusters, HBO and HBO Max originals, and Warner Bros. films made exclusively for HBO Max.\n\nDrama\n\nWarner Bros. One Battle After Another (2025) One Battle After Another won best musical or comedy film at the Golden Globes and is up for best picture at the Oscars, so it's worth noting that HBO Max is showing this collab between Paul Thomas Anderson and Leonardo DiCaprio. The political thriller introduces DiCaprio's character as part of a revolutionary group, the French 75. When the film finds him 16 years later, living off the grid with his teenage daughter and facing a threat from his past, the action doesn't let up.\n\nA24 Sing Sing (2024) Sing Sing is a subtle and impactful prison drama starring Colman Domingo -- who earned a 2025 best actor Oscar nomination for his role -- and formerly incarcerated actors. Domingo plays Divine G, who acts in a theater group while imprisoned at Sing Sing Correctional Facility. The film will surprise and uplift you.\n\nWarner Bros. Juror #2 (2024) Nicholas Hoult, J.K. Simmons and Toni Collette are in the cast of this absorbing, haunting Clint Eastwood courtroom drama. Hoult stars as Justin Kemp, who faces a moral dilemma after getting called for jury duty. He must decide whether to disclose information that would change the outcome of the high-profile trial and impact his own life. A well-acted, well-paced flick that will get you thinking.\n\nHBO Max Turtles All the Way Down (2024) Don't usually dabble in the young adult genre? You shouldn't let that keep you from taking in Turtles All the Way Down, based on a 2017 novel of the same name by John Green. The film stars Isabela Merced (The Last of Us, Alien: Romulus) as a teen who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety. With elements of romance and a captivating performance from Merced, this straight-to-streaming movie deserves more attention.\n\nWarnerMedia The Fallout (2022) After a shooting occurs at her high school, 16-year-old Vada Cavell must navigate friendships, school and her relationship with her family. The Fallout skillfully approaches serious subject matter with realistic dialogue and compassion for its characters. With strong performances from stars Jenna Ortega as Vada and Maddie Ziegler as her new friend Mia Reed, the feature will keep you glued to the screen for the entirety of its 90-minute runtime.\n\nWarner Bros. Dune (2021) and Dune: Part Two (2024) Remember 2021, when Warner Bros. movies hit HBO Max on the same day they premiered in theaters? That exciting period may be over but at least we'll always have the memory of watching Denis Villeneuve's spectacular sci-fi epic at home and still being part of the conversation. Both parts of Dune are now streaming on HBO Max.\n\nHBO Bad Education (2019) Based on a magazine article by journalist Robert Kolker, this tale about a public school embezzlement scandal and the student journalists who broke the news is captivating from start to finish. Allison Janney and Hugh Jackman are great in their roles as the school officials who took part in the scheme. The drama also won the 2020 Emmy award for Outstanding Television Movie.\n\nThriller\n\nWarner Bros. Kimi (2022) Steven Soderbergh directs this engaging tech thriller set during the COVID-19 pandemic. Angela, a Seattle tech worker played by a neon blue-haired Zoë Kravitz, has agoraphobia, a fear that prevents her from making it past the front door of her apartment. But when she uncovers an unsettling recording while doing her job, she's pushed to make the leap. Kimi is a stylish thriller complete with eye-catching cinematography, a solid score and a protagonist you'll be rooting for.\n\nHBO Max No Sudden Move (2021) A movie from Steven Soderbergh, the great director behind Erin Brockovich, Ocean's Eleven and, more recently, Logan Lucky? Twists, thrills and desperate characters populate this crime thriller set in 1950s Detroit. When a seemingly simple job gets out of hand, a group of criminals must work together to uncover what's really going on. Take in the incredible cast: Don Cheadle, Benicio del Toro, David Harbour, Jon Hamm and Amy Seimetz. While the plot can be a little convoluted and some won't be able to get past the fish-eye lens cinematography, Soderbergh's sense of humor and immersive direction make this crime caper an entertaining night in.\n\nComedy\n\nHBO Max Am I OK? (2022) This comedy-drama follows Dakota Johnson's character, 32-year-old Lucy, who tells her longtime best friend Jane that she likes women. But there's more for Lucy to navigate as that friend, played by House of the Dragon's Sonoya Mizuno, is moving far away to London. If you enjoy stories about late blooming and female friendships, it's no question -- you should check out the funny, touching Am I OK?\n\nWarner Bros. Father of the Bride (2022) HBO Max's Father of the Bride introduces a Cuban American family that includes patriarch Billy, a traditional guy who struggles to digest surprising news from his eldest daughter: She's met a guy, and she wants to marry and move away with him. The third film adaptation of a 1949 novel of the same name by Edward Streeter, the movie is an enjoyable iteration that includes stars like Andy Garcia and singer Gloria Estefan.\n\nHBO Max Let Them All Talk (2020) Meryl Streep playing an eccentric author in a Steven Soderbergh comedy. What more do you need to know? If you do want to know more: Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Alice Hughes (Streep) is struggling to finish her next book, chased by her literary agent (Gemma Chan). She boards a cruise ship with old friends, who inspired her best-known work. Tensions are strong. It looks great -- Soderbergh uses crisp, natural light -- and most of the dialogue is improvised. See how Dianne Wiest, Candice Bergen, Lucas Hedges and the rest of the impeccable cast have fun with that.\n\nSuperhero\n\nJessica Miglio/Warner Bros. Superman (2025) James Gunn's superhero epic doesn't go the origin story route, instead introducing audiences to David Corenswet's Man of Steel when Earth is already familiar with the caped hero. More specifically, the movie opens with a battered Superman having lost a battle for the first time. Nicholas Hoult plays the ever-plotting villain Lex Luthor, Rachel Brosnahan stars as reporter Lois Lane and Krypto the unruly Superdog is a chaotic addition to this charming and compelling action outing.\n\nWarner Bros. The Batman (2022) Robert Pattinson steps out as Batman in this moody superhero flick directed by Matt Reeves. The movie takes place in a perpetually gray and rain-soaked Gotham City, where Bruce Wayne starts to seek out a murderer with an affinity for riddles. Along the way, he meets Catwoman, played by a swaggering Zoë Kravitz. Catch up on the dark and satisfying mystery before you watch the HBO spinoff series, The Penguin.\n\nWarner Bros. The Suicide Squad (2021) Over-the-top violence abounds in this DC film about supervillains who agree to help the US government in exchange for some time off their prison sentences. Their mission is to destroy something alluded to as Project Starfish, harbored in the fictional island country of Corto Maltese. With a notable cast that includes Margot Robbie, Idris Elba and John Cena, 2021's The Suicide Squad is a wickedly entertaining, darkly funny bloodbath that differs from what you usually see in superhero movies. (Peacemaker, a spin-off TV series, is also available on HBO Max.)\n\nMusical\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Wonka (2023) Dune's Timothée Chalamet stars in this prequel to Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and it's a total treat. With new and familiar tunes, a committed cast and oodles and oodles of whimsy, the film allows audiences to get to know a young Willy Wonka with giraffe-sized ambition and undeniable chocolate-making skill. It's a quirky, comforting flick from Paddington director Paul King that you'll absolutely want on your plate.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures The Color Purple (2023) This movie musical version of The Color Purple is adapted from Alice Walker's 1982 novel and the Broadway play. Set in the early 1900s, the film tells the story of Celie, a Black woman living in the South who faces multiple hardships but is able to find strength in the bonds in her life. The cast includes Fantasia Barrino, Taraji P. Henson, Colman Domingo, Halle Bailey and Danielle Brooks, who received a 2023 Oscar nomination for her role as Celie's daughter-in-law, Sofia.\n\nAction and adventure\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Mickey 17 (2025) Mickey 17 comes from acclaimed director Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer, Parasite) and stars Robert Pattinson as Mickey Barnes. Barnes escapes Earth for another planet by applying to be an \"expendable.\" The role subjects him to deadly missions and experiments, with his body reprinted each time he doesn't make it. Black humor, heart, eccentricity and great performances are all on display. Even if the film doesn't surpass any of Bong's earlier works, it deservedly makes it on this list.\n\nJanus Films Flow (2024) Winner of Best Animated Feature at the 2025 Oscars, this wordless Latvian film follows a black cat after a great flood devastates his home. The brave feline bands together with a capybara, a lemur, a bird and a dog in a stunning and thought-provoking film that will appeal to adults and kids alike.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024) This thrilling prequel to the 2015 movie Mad Max: Fury Road stars Anya Taylor-Joy (The Queen's Gambit, The Menu) as a younger version of Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa. Life takes a turn for the protagonist when she finds herself in the Wasteland rather than the Green Place of Many Mothers. The resourceful heroine fights for survival, facing off with villains such as the warlord Dementus, played by Chris Hemsworth. Visually striking and intense, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is chock-full of postapocalyptic action, and you won't want to miss a minute.\n\nStudio Ghibli The Boy and the Heron (2023) Who can pass up a Studio Ghibli film? Hayao Miyazaki came out of retirement to make The Boy and the Heron, which won the award for best animated feature at the 2024 Oscars. The starry English voice cast includes Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Robert Pattinson and Florence Pugh.\n\nJaap Buitendijk/Warner Bros. Barbie (2023) Unless you've been living in Barbie Land (or another place that isn't the real world), chances are you're very familiar with this pink-coated comedy already. The flick -- Warner Bros.' highest-grossing global release of all time -- brings a long list of stars together for a hilarious and heartfelt adventure. Greta Gerwig directs, Margot Robbie plays the titular role and Ryan Gosling belts out an incredible power ballad as Ken.\n\nDocumentary\n\nHBO All That Breathes (2022) This captivating documentary is filled with images that will stick with you. It centers on two brothers in New Delhi who run a bird hospital dedicated to black kites -- birds of prey that are a staple of the sky. It was a contender for best documentary feature at the 2023 Oscars.\n\nHBO Max Tony Hawk: Until the Wheels Fall Off (2022) Tune into this HBO doc for the gravity-defying skateboard stunts, a time capsule of the '80s skateboarding scene, and a version of Hawk you've probably never seen. We get to know the renowned athlete as a lanky, stubborn but determined kid who adopted his own skateboarding style. Hawk's persistence is something to marvel at, along with all the stunning skateboard moves this film packs in. Hang on for a memorable ride.\n\nCNN/Focus Features Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain (2021) This film about beloved author, chef and globe-traveling TV host Anthony Bourdain comes from documentary filmmaker Morgan Neville, who also directed 2018's Won't You Be My Neighbor? and the Oscar-winning film Twenty Feet from Stardom. In interviews with people who knew Bourdain, like his friends, former partners and longtime colleagues, the doc tracks his career path, relationships and personal struggles. Fans and those less acquainted with the late star will likely appreciate this two-hour look at his life."

            "content": "The Clicks Communicator created a buzz after its CES reveal, with its focus on offering a communications-forward Android phone that looks like a BlackBerry, complete with a physical keyboard, prioritizing messaging and typing over everything else. It turns out the keyboard phone may have made a bigger splash than anyone realized. Clicks will offer multiple versions of the Communicator, each with a keyboard that supports a different language, in response to the overwhelming demand for the unreleased phone.\n\nThe company is expanding the Communicator to include models with keyboard layouts for Arabic, French (AZERTY), German (QWERTZ) and Korean. Clicks said interest in the Communicator was higher than the company expected, especially globally.\n\nIt's clear there are still plenty of people who yearn for compelling, straightforward devices with smartly designed hardware that aim to make texting and writing easier. The timing of Click's news strikes a stark juxtaposition, coming just days after Samsung launched its Galaxy S26 series, which features updates heavily steeped in AI.\n\nHere is the Clicks Communicator in Smoke with a keyboard for Korean. Clicks/CNET\n\n\"The response from customers around the world sends a strong signal that Communicator fills a gap for a phone purpose-built for communicating and taking action,\" Clicks CEO Adrian Li Mow Ching said in a press release.\n\nBut there's more good news ahead of MWC if you're interested in getting a Clicks Communicator. The early-bird window to reserve one now runs through March 15. The phone costs $499, but an early reservation gets you a $100 discount and, when paid in full, a bundle of the phone and two additional back covers.\n\nClicks also shared that the phone will have a Dimensity 8300 chip (MT8883), which is in phones like the Xiaomi Poco X6 Pro. The MT8883 lets the company offer OS updates to the Communicator through Android 20 and five years of security updates.\n\nI'm definitely excited to see where Clicks is headed with the Communicator, but should note that we've yet to see a working version of the phone. The Clicks Communicator will be available in Smoke, Clover and Onyx. Reservations are open, and people can select their preferred keyboard layout closer to when the phone ships later this year."

            "content": "Smart locks are a highly visible part of your home that you'll use just about every day, so it's important to find a reliable pick that meshes well with your smart home. Here are the factors you should be thinking about as you shop.\n\nA retrofit smart lock like the August lock will replace the interior of your current lock but not the exterior keyhole or the deadbolt. CNET\n\nFull deadbolt or retrofit\n\nMost smart locks will replace your existing lock, including the interior thumbturn, the exterior keyhole and the deadbolt in the middle. Locks like those will also come with their keys, replacing the ones you use now.\n\nOthers, like the August Smart Lock, and the Lockly fingerprint model, are designed instead to work with at least some of your existing lock hardware. With a retrofit lock like that, you probably won't need new keys and might not even need to swap out the deadbolt. Locks like those can sometimes be a better fit for apartments, where the building owners might not allow you to replace the entire lock.\n\nYale's smart lock can work with the Nest video doorbell. Yale\n\nModes of access\n\nDifferent smart locks will take different approaches to letting you in. On a basic level, most smart locks will let you lock and unlock the door wirelessly from your phone, using an app. Others add in keypads for coded entry, which can help you rely on your keys a little less while also making it easier to share access with others. Some lock add fingerprint or palm scanning to let you inside with biometrics. There are also keypad and NFC options, even face scanning in some cases.\n\nApple has also added a Home Key feature in iOS15 that lets you store a digital house key in your Apple Wallet, which lets you open compatible smart locks using the NFC radio in your iPhone or Apple Watch. Many other brands have followed suit with digital passes that guests can download on their phones with the right apps.\n\nSo, what's right for you? Going into an app for door access isn't ideal unless you are controlling it remotely. That's why we like Bluetooth and NFC passes that can work with a wave of your phone, as well as fingerprint sensors and similar options that are keyed to individuals and work at a touch at any time. But a keypad has its advantages as well, since it allows for temporary code handouts or limited-time access without someone needing their phone or a specific app to use.\n\nThe Schlage Encode Plus is the first smart lock to support Apple Home Key. It lets you unlock your door using an iPhone or Apple Watch. Schlage\n\nPlatform compatibility and Matter\n\nIf your household includes multiple types of smart home devices, then your best bet is to control them all from a single smart home platform. That way, you won't need to juggle multiple apps to keep everything automated. The most popular picks are Amazon Alexa, the Google Home app and the Google Assistant voice controls that come with it, and Apple HomeKit, which brings Siri into play. Samsung SmartThings is another option for a hub-centric smart home.\n\nThat brings us to Matter. Matter (and its tagalong communication protocol Thread) is an important smart home protocol designed in coordination with major brands, including Google, Amazon, Apple, and many others. It helps guarantee compatibility across different platforms and adds extra security and data transfer benefits, which buyers should definitely be watching for.\n\nCurrently, smart lock companies are still adopting the Matter standard. Our top pick uses it and is one of the best options we've found. Schlage has begun to adopt the standard for locks like its upcoming Schlage Sense Pro, but it hasn't made its way to our Schlage Smart Lever pick quite yet, and the same goes for Yale Assure. Brands like Aqara are now including built-in Matter support with their latest locks. August has also announced it's working to bring Matter to its smart locks, so in some cases, it just be a \"matter\" of waiting for the right firmware update.\n\nAqara's lock comes with many unlocking options and gets even more features if you plug in a hub. Aqara\n\nSecurity and privacy\n\nSmart locks aren't quite as data-sensitive as devices with built-in cameras and microphones, but you'll still want to make sure that you're keeping things secure. Most, if not all of your options will use some form of encryption to keep the wireless transmissions between your lock and your phone or home network secure. You should also look for locks that use two-factor authentication to keep your account safe from malicious logins. As with any connected device in your home, you'll want to be sure to keep your lock updated to the latest firmware and to set a strong password in the app.\n\nAs for lockpicking and other physical concerns, you can look for the lock's ANSI grade to get a sense of its durability, and how well it might stand up against a brute-force entry attack. ANSI grade 3 is the most basic rating, but a growing number of smart locks offer ANSI grade 2 or grade 1 ratings, which tell you that they're built with commercial-grade durability. If you're concerned about forced entries, a lock like that might be a good investment.\n\nLockin's Veno Pro 7 components John Carlsen/CNET\n\nDesign considerations\n\nYour smart lock is going to sit right on the front of your home's exterior, so it's worth aiming for something you won't hate looking at. Some smart locks go out of their way to show off their gadgety features with light-up touchscreens, color-coded LED indicator lights and tech-minded designs. Others take the opposite approach, doing their best to blend in and look just like a standard lock, from the outside at least. Picking a preference between the two approaches will help you narrow your options.\n\nYou'll also want to consider how the lock stays powered. Most smart locks will run off four AA batteries, but some take a different approach. The minimalistic Level Lock +, for instance, runs off two AA batteries that sits inside of the deadbolt itself to keep things extra compact. Meanwhile, Eufy's touchscreen smart lock runs off of a rechargeable battery pack.\n\nWi-Fi\n\nWi-Fi support has now become common for smart locks, but it's important to look at the details. Some locks don't have built-in Wi-Fi, but only support it if you buy an additional hub."

            "content": "Pokemon Winds and Waves, the first mainline games in the series to come to the Nintendo Switch 2, were announced on Friday, the franchise's 30th anniversary, on a special Pokemon Presents livestream. They will be released in 2027 exclusively on the Switch 2.\n\nFollowing the precedent set by Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, the new games seem to be set in a fully explorable open world. The new playable region is scattered across multiple islands, with wide swaths of ocean between them.\n\nThe distinct split between water and land harkens back to cherished gameplay mechanics from third-generation Pokemon games Ruby and Sapphire, which were first released in Japan in 2002.\n\nAs tradition dictates, we got our first look at the three new starter Pokemon, which are powerful pals that serve as the player's first partner in an unfamiliar new place.\n\nThe grass-type starter, Browt, is a chickadee with a head that's bulbous enough to invoke the Brain. The water-type, Gecqua, is a quadrupedal gecko with a cool attitude. And the fire-type starter, Pombon, is a super cute orange pup with a mane that eclipses its body. (I suspect Pombon will quickly become a fan favorite.)\n\nFan-favorite Pokemon from previous games were also shown off. Pikachu, Tympole, Wailord, Tropius and Frillish are in the cast of monsters to be caught in the next mainline Pokemon games, among other older creatures. Many of the returning Pokemon seem to fit into the island theme, residing in volcanic caves (where we saw Slugma), marshy swamps (Carnivine) and underwater coves (Lumineon).\n\nIt's been four years since the last mainline Pokemon games -- Pokemon Scarlet and Violet -- were released for the Nintendo Switch.\n\nWhile those games were lauded by some fans for their open world and more freeform approach to telling a Pokemon story, they were held back by poor performance and game-breaking bugs on Nintendo's first hybrid console. Pokemon Winds and Waves -- games built for, and exclusive to, the more powerful Switch 2 hardware -- need to fare better when it comes to in-game performance.\n\nPokemon Winds and Waves may be the first traditional Pokemon games for the Switch 2, but they aren't the first ventures into the world of pocket monsters for the new console. The recently released Pokemon Legends: Z-A introduced a whole new battling system, moving away from the turn-based mechanics the franchise has been known for since 1996. Pokemon Pokopia, an Animal Crossing-style game that will be released next month, is also primed to bring pocket monsters to cozy gaming spaces.\n\nNintendo also announced that the upcoming, competition-focused Pokemon Champions will be released on the Switch in April and is coming to mobile devices later this year.\n\nThese games will have to tide fans over until they can dive into the watery world of Pokemon Winds and Waves next year."
