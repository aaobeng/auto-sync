            "content": "MANCHESTER UNITED are growing “concerned” about the future of Harry Maguire as he approaches the end of his contract.\n\nThe defender, 32, has a new lease of life under interim boss Michael Carrick, but there are worries that he could follow Casemiro out of the club this summer when their deals expire.\n\n\n\nHis return to the side in the heart of Carrick’s preferred back four has helped the side take five wins from six games since the boss’ arrival, with their only blemish being an away draw against West Ham.\n\n\n\nBut according to reports from the Mail, the club hierarchy are growing concerned about the prospect of his exit.\n\nHe is available to negotiate over a pre-contract agreement, and has already turned down approaches from the Saudi Pro League and AC Milan this year.\n\nIt is understood Maguire is keen on remaining at the club, but would likely have to take a pay cut in order to make a deal work.\n\nIt is clear that Carrick is aware of the positive impact the former Leicester City man has on the team, opening up on his future earlier this week.\n\n\n\nHe said: “Within the squad there is that balance, you want that younger potential and excitement, but you need the sweet spot in the middle with players at the peak, and experience is massive.\n\n“It’s hard to put a price on how valuable that can be. Harry has gained an awful lot of experience with this club. Casemiro leaving is another one and we have to understand what that means.”\n\nMaguire is only at the club after a 12-month extension to his contract was triggered last year.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL – BEST CASINO BONUSES FROM £10 DEPOSITS\n\n\n\nBut a week away from his 33rd birthday, it is unclear where the man himself stands on a potential renewal.\n\nOne boost to both him and the club’s prospects is his form.\n\nIf there were any lingering doubts about his ability to keep up at this level, they have been quelled after clean sheets against Everton, Spurs and even rivals Manchester City.\n\nWhen asked if Maguire might even be in the form of his life, Carrick said: “There is a case (for that), as your career goes when you’re a young player and everything is fresh, you’re fearless and there’s not many scars there.\n\n“You get to your peak years and you feel good and everything is there, but you’ve had a few ups and downs.\n\n\n\n“You get towards the later times and the experience should make you a better player, we’ve seen that with Harry’s performances of late.\n\n“That’s why experience is important, I felt it when I was playing, 31 or 32 were my best years of being in that sweet spot to do it physically still but use the experiences to know what is coming.”\n\nMaguire came very close to an exit after hitting a rough patch of form in the 2022/23 season.\n\nBut the star rejected a £30million move to West Ham, choosing to continue slugging it out for a starting spot at Old Trafford.\n\n\n\nAnd now he has finally come good, after struggling to find minutes in Ruben Amorim‘s 3421 formation last season.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nCarrick hinted that he has hopes for an extension with the England international, adding: “Harry’s an impressive character. He’s had a great career so far. Hopefully, there’s a lot more to come.\n\n“I think, even while he’s been here, in the journey and the experiences that he’s had, certainly since he’s been here and with England as well, I think he’s shown exactly what he is.”"

It feels good.”\n\n\n\nHe added that a connection was easy to forge, saying: “Me being me, I like to have fun and I like to entertain. Off the pitch it kind of showed.\n\n“To dare is to do is what Tottenham is about and I showed a lot of that in my personality and that is the way I am as a person.\n\n“It was quite easy to relate.”\n\nDele won the PFA Young Player of the Year in back-to-back seasons in 2015/16 and 2016/17, and was named to the Premier League Team of the Year in 2015/16 and 2016/17 seasons.\n\nHowever, his form began to fade before he ultimately left the north London side for Everton in January 2022.\n\n\n\nStruggles with injury eventually saw him loaned to Besiktas and later released before he was picked up by Como as a free agent.\n\nHe only made one appearance in Italy in which he was sent off after just minutes for a challenge on Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIn a candid 2023 interview, the former England international revealed he had been sexually abused as a child and had been forced into dealing drugs at the age of eight.\n\nHe also spoke about his six-week spell in rehab after the end of his Besiktas loan because of addiction to sleeping pills and mental health issues."

Nuno’s side rank seventh for expected goals conceded and have allowed more than one goal just once in their last eight matches.\n\nLiverpool, meanwhile, aren’t exactly firing on all cylinders in attack, having managed just three goals across their last three Premier League games, with low-scoring encounters against Leeds and Burnley at Anfield still fresh in the memory this year.\n\nUnder 2.5 goals at 9/5 with Betfair – CLAIM HERE\n\nFirst goalscorer and correct score predictions Liverpool vs West Ham First goalscorer: Mohamed Salah at 7/2 with Midnite – CLAIM HERE Correct score: 1-0 at 9/1 with Betfred – CLAIM HERE\n\nMo time\n\nI’m also tipping Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah to get back on the scoresheet against one of his favourite opponents, available at 10/11 to score anytime with Betfair.\n\n\n\nSalah, 33, has struck twice in six matches in all competitions, but the metrics suggest he should have netted more.

The presenter, based in Qatar for 13 years, could not broadcast as the region descended into chaos, and beIN's coverage instead came from London.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe former Sky Sports anchor announced that he would not be hosting a show on Saturday. He said on X: \"Thank you all for your messages.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It was a bit lively earlier. I don’t have space to express my feelings about that idiot Trump. No show today.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"You’ll be in the capable hands of our colleagues in London. Thoughts & prayers for everyone in our region. Ramadan Kareem.\"\n\nKeys' comments followed a warning from the UK government's Foreign Office, to those based in a variety of countries in the Middle East. Since the joint attack on Iran from Israel and the United States, Iran has carried out strikes on Israel and Qatar as well as other targets in the Middle East.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Due to reported missile attacks, British nationals in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates should immediately shelter in place,\" they said. \"Remain indoors in a secure location, avoid all travel and follow instructions from the local authorities.\"\n\nExplosions have been heard in the UAE, Bahrain and Kuwait. Israeli officials also reported that Iran had fired missiles toward the country following the strikes.\n\nIran's security council vowed a \"crushing\" response to the military operation. It said the \"enemy\" wrongly assumed Iran would \"surrender to their petty demands through such cowardly actions.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nUS president Donald Trump determined to bomb Iran, despite talks ongoing over the nation's nuclear programme.\n\nTrump said: \"We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally, again, obliterated. We're going to annihilate their Navy. We're going to ensure that the region's terrorist proxies can no longer destabilise the region or the world, and attack our forces and no longer use their IEDs or roadside bombs, as they are sometimes called to so gravely wound and kill thousands and thousands of people, including many Americans. And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It is a very simple message. They will never have a nuclear weapon.\""

(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMichael Carrick's decision to install experienced coaches is paying dividends as the interim Manchester United head coach enjoys the fruits of Ruben Amorim's mistakes. According to reports, the introduction of Steve Holland, formerly an assistant to Sir Gareth Southgate, Jonathan Woodgate, Travis Binnion and Craig Mawson, has played a role in righting the wrongs of the Portuguese's tenure.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Red Devils are on five wins in six matches with Carrick guiding United into the driving seat for Champions League qualification.

It now seems viewers may be longing for the former England forward's relaxed charisma and effortless banter, as the BBC's premier football programme has actually shed viewers since the 65-year-old's departure.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLineker left the show in May 2025 following a dispute over a social media post he published about the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGabby Logan, Kelly Cates and Mark Chapman now rotate presenting duties on Saturday and Sunday evenings. However, the most recent figures revealed the weekly audience for the two programmes stood at 6.88million viewers, representing a drop of 770,000 compared to the average for August to December 2024.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\nLineker was quite simply amongst the finest in the industry at delivering football to mainstream audiences, something numerous colleagues throughout his career have acknowledged.\n\nFormer Liverpool legend Alan Hansen shared a studio with Lineker for nearly three decades. The European Cup-winning icon has previously commended the former striker for his broadcasting talents.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBBC reveals Match of the Day viewing figures after Gary Lineker exit READ MORE :\n\n\"You don't do something for 26 years and have the great times he had, without thinking, 'This has been a huge, huge part of my life.' He was really, really quick. Sharp, intelligent, clinical, prolific goalscorer as well,\" Hansen said.\n\n\"As soon as he left football, he intimated that he wanted to be a presenter, he didn't want to be a pundit. It was a seamless journey. We had so many good laughs and we worked with so many great people - we weren't bad on that programme at all.\"\n\nWith Lineker's departure, his colleague and friend, Newcastle United legend Alan Shearer, delivered an emotionally charged tribute, highlighting just how sorely the Leicester City icon would be missed.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Match of the Day means everything to him. He loves it, it means the world to him,\" Shearer said. \"When you look at who he had to come in and replace, the brilliant Des Lynam, it might not have been easy at first for Gary.\n\nView 4 Images Gary Lineker and Alan Hansen worked together for almost 30 years (Image: Getty)\n\n\"But he seems to have taken to it with ease. Gary you've been a great friend, you've been amazing to me and you've been unbelievable to Match of the Day. Whatever you choose to do on Saturdays, good luck and we'll miss you.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nControversy erupted in March 2023 when Lineker was suspended from his presenting duties at the BBC following his criticism of the British government's asylum policy on social media.\n\nIn a remarkable display of solidarity, numerous BBC stars, including Shearer, commentator Steve Wilson, presenter Jason Mohammad, former Arsenal women's star Alex Scott, and others, withdrew from their roles with the BBC. Match of the Day proceeded without Lineker or any pundits whatsoever.\n\nMerely three days afterwards, his suspension concluded, and Lineker resumed his position in the presenter's chair. The incident was an obvious demonstration of Lineker's influence at the broadcaster, but it chiefly confirmed just how highly regarded he was in the role.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAdding to the wave of acclaim, former Manchester City star turned BBC and Sky Sports pundit Micah Richards said: \"His greatest strength, when all the stuff that's going on in our ears, he's the calmest person in the room.\"\n\nSimilarly, Arsenal legend Ian Wright added: \"What Gary Lineker means to me. Someone I admire so much, someone who has helped me so much in the punditry game. I was fortunate enough to do it alongside him and now I am lucky enough to call him my friend.\"\n\nView 4 Images Gary Lineker received kind words from his BBC colleagues (Image: Getty)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLineker's deal with the BBC rendered him the broadcaster's highest-earning talent at an eye-watering £1.3million annually. However, former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy maintained Lineker's compassion equalled his professionalism - potentially making him worth every penny to the Beeb.\n\n\"Gary's a friend of mine and he's been phenomenal to me since the day I walked in the building,\" Murphy told talkSPORT in November 2024. \"A warm, charismatic, intelligent man who knows his football and has become part of everybody's furniture, if you like, on a Saturday evening.\n\n\"I'd done a few shows and he was always great. And in my first tournament, I was thrust into the World Cup in Brazil really quickly. And it was quite daunting as Alan Hansen was there, Alan Shearer, you know, a lot of these people who I'd looked up to.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Between Gary and Alan, and Gary especially was the first one to always, even if I wasn't working on the same show as him, leave me a message saying, 'We're going to be eating here, we're going to be in this bar, we're going to be in this hotel. Come and meet us, get a cab to there, we'll be there.'\n\nView 4 Images Gabby Logan has taken over duties alongside Mark Chapman and Kelly Cates (Image: Getty)\n\n\"You know, all those types of little things that brought me in. And I'll never forget how he treated me and how welcome he made me, how good he made me feel.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBBC presenter Dan Walker posted a heartfelt tribute on social media to the man he'd occasionally stood in for. He wrote: \"Match of the Day won't be the same. It was always a pleasure to present the show but it was always Gary's chair. Brilliant career on the pitch matched by a brilliant stint on the biggest football show on telly.\"\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

This translates to the BBC shedding just over 750,000 viewers from its BBC One and BBC Two Match of the Day broadcasts, whilst simultaneously attracting twice that number through digital platforms.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe BBC's director of sport, Alex Kay-Jelski, said: \"Yeah, it's been going great because the numbers overall of the brand - because we added this year the clips on top of all the other great work we've done with the traditional programme - we're hitting 20 or 21 per cent more people overall.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

            "content": "\"Watch yourself now. Enjoy it but you're going to get a lot of media attention; everyone's going to know you. You've gone from no one knowing who you are to a potential superstar...\"\n\nThose were the words Michael Carrick gave Marcus Rashford 10 years ago after his dream start to life at Manchester United.\n\nIn two matches three days apart, a slight, fresh-faced 18-year-old from Wythenshawe saw his life change forever, with four goals that propelled a career into the blinding glare of hopeful superstardom.\n\nThere are fairytales and then there's the story of Rashford's debut. Everything fell into place, the sliding doors moved seamlessly to allow for a career worth over 400 senior United appearances, 68 England caps, along with more than 150 goals for both club and country.\n\nStarting with that Europa League night against Midtjylland before a Premier League classic against Arsenal, Rashford not only lived the dream but became the dream.\n\nRooney out, Martial injured... What next?\n\nThe lore is well-worn. United were in the midst of an injury crisis in forward areas ahead of a crunch round of 32 tie against Midtjylland.\n\nHaving been embarrassed in Denmark, United had to save face at Old Trafford but captain Wayne Rooney was out with an injury. Anthony Martial was next to fall injured, this time minutes before kick off. Then-boss Louis van Gaal had a decision to make with little time to think - but for the Dutch manager it wasn't a difficult one.\n\nImage: Frans Hoek alongside Rashford after his debut against Midtjylland\n\n\"We came back into the locker room, and the assistants were coming up with all kinds of solutions, except for Marcus,\" Frans Hoek, a key part of Van Gaal's coaching staff at the time, reveals to Sky Sports.\n\n\"They were saying, 'Okay, if we do this, then this player can be there and blah blah blah.' The normal discussions that you have when something happens like that.\n\n\"And then, when everybody had said what they had to say, Louis said, 'We don't change anything. Marcus goes in. Marcus deserves it. Marcus is doing a good job. He is improving. He is young and I believe in that.' That was the moment.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Louis van Gaal says Marcus Rashford produced 'a great performance' after scoring twice on his Manchester United debut against FC Midtjylland\n\nVan Gaal was resting his hopes on someone whose only experience in the first team up to that point was a bench appearance at Watford a few months prior.\n\n\"All credit to Louis because he was never afraid to put young players in,\" Hoek adds.\n\n\"He did the same at Ajax, at Barcelona, at Bayern Munich and with the national team. For him, if they are good enough, then they are old enough. It is simple.\n\n\"And he definitely was not afraid to replace people who had certain reputations if he felt it was the best for the team.\n\n\"A coach like Louis does not get influenced. He just has his eyes and his way of thinking. He put in Andres Iniesta, he put in Xavi. He put in so many of them.\n\n\"If you are objective as a coach and not influenced by everything that happens around football, I think you make these kinds of decisions faster.\"\n\n'In the academy, Rashford could do anything he wanted with a football'\n\nFrom the outside, it was a surprise. 'Who on earth is this kid?' Those in the stands uttered amid the late change. But for those closer to Rashford, through his time in the academy, could tell he had been marked early on to impact the first team.\n\nImage: James Weir made his Manchester United debut against Arsenal after Rashford's Premier League debut double\n\n\"He was the guy!\" James Weir, who played with Rashford in the United Academy.\n\n\"He was two years younger and I knew his name, whereas I couldn't name any other person in his age group.\n\n\"I think they can tell technically, and they know when they're going to fill out. He had two older brothers who were quite big as well and tall. So, they probably expected him to grow and fill into his body.\n\n\"But technically, he was pretty superior. The first time I played with him was probably in one of the reserve games, like under-21s or 23s and he was, jumping ahead of people a couple of years above him, just because he was that good.\n\n\"He was always. I remember, even in digs, we'd be playing football with a balloon, and he'd be doing, around the worlds. It's actually harder to do it with a balloon than it is with a normal football.\n\n\"He could do anything he wanted with a football, even doing keepy-ups with a tennis ball. Most people are lucky to do four or five; he's consistently doing it.\"\n\nRecollections of Rashford's first training session with the first team have lived with former team-mate and current Melbourne Victory midfielder, Juan Mata for the past decade.\n\nImage: Rashford in training alongside Juan Mata\n\n\"I have a vivid memory of that day, he was playing on the right wing,\" Mata says.\n\n\"He was quite thin and quick. He was quite shy off the pitch but he was brave on the pitch, and that was nice to see. You could see he was already taking people one against one, going behind. Very quick, very speedy.\n\n\"At the end of the session, I was talking with Ander Herrera and he was telling me, 'did you see this kid? I think he's going to be a great player'.\n\n\"Ander really saw it since the beginning and I remember he told me that day, he's going to bring us a lot and I said, 'Well, wait, it's too early, he only trained with us once'... Ander was not wrong.\"\n\nImage: Man Utd's starting lineup on Rashford's debut\n\nMata set up Rashford's first-ever professional goal, opening the floodgates.\n\n\"You could see how happy he was, his family in the stands, it meant a lot for him,\" Mata recalls.\n\n\"So it was the start of something really nice for him and a very nice start to a good week. I still remember celebrating with him and seeing how this kid from Manchester was fulfilling his dream and it was very nice to see how happy he was and how much he deserved it.\"\n\nThe Arsenal game that followed United's 5-1 win over Midtjylland and it was a special day for the United Academy.\n\nAlongside Rashford's Premier League debut, Timothy Fosu-Mensah earned his first stripes and so did Weir as United beat the Gunners 3-2 at Old Trafford.\n\nWeir recalls LVG dive - 'I thought Wenger had hit him!' Man Utd's win over Arsenal at Old Trafford is also remembered for a bizarre moment from Louis van Gaal on the touchline. The Dutch coach mimicked what he thought was a dive from Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez after a challenge from Herrera. Weir watched on while warming up: \"I just saw all the fans do something, like all this commotion, and then I saw LVG on the floor, so I honestly thought Wenger had hit him. I thought Wenger had dropped him.\"\n\nImage: Louis van Gaal mimics Alexis Sanchez from the touchline\n\nReplacing Herrera in injury time meant that Weir watched from the dugout as Rashford continued to do the remarkable, playing a part in all three goals.\n\n\"I remember when he banged that first goal in, like, you're not surprised, because he has that, you've seen it in training, you've seen it in the academy, you've seen it in the reserves, he's got the quality. I've seen it in the back garden!\n\n\"I remember him being buzzing and obviously, everyone around the club was buzzing for him, because that's what it's about, getting youth team players into the first team.\"\n\n'He was a kid and a man who gave everything to Man Utd' - Mata\n\nRashford didn't slow down from then on. He went on to play an instrumental role as United won the FA Cup that season.\n\nEngland and Roy Hodgson couldn't ignore the prodigy either, as his first call-up and debut goal came three months later. Rashford then earned a spot in the Three Lions squad for the 2016 Euros, where he would make two appearances.\n\nImage: Rashford made his England debut in May 2016\n\nNow, after a difficult spell, before back-to-back loans at Aston Villa and now at Barcelona, Rashford's time at Old Trafford looks to be moving towards a permanent end, with a divorce seemingly the best option for both parties. But there's a consensus that he wrote a beautiful story at United.\n\n\"It's not easy to handle with all the expectations and the pressure at the club like Man Utd but I think people will realise that he was a kid and he was a man who gave everything for the club he supported since he was a kid,\" Mata says.\n\n\"You can see photos of him when he was almost a baby with a Man Utd shirt on. So it meant a lot for him to play for Man Utd. You could see that. I think he gave great moments and great memories for many fans. Of course, there were also some challenging times but I think they made him more mature and a stronger man.\n\n\"Nobody has an easy career. It doesn't matter how successful you have been. There are always challenges and he had that at the club. But he's now in a new chapter. He went to Barcelona, which is one of the best teams in the world and he's performing there. He's showing his level. I'm very happy for him that he's able to try and prove his level in different countries.\"\n\nImage: Rashford smiles during a Barcelona training session at the Nou Camp\n\nHoek, who also has a storied coaching history with Barcelona, shares Mata's sentiment. Rashford has scored 10 goals and assisted 13 in 34 games at Barcelona.\n\n\"Rashford was an easy guy to work with,\" Hoek says.\n\n\"Hardworking and not complaining. Of course, when they start their career, it is different but I have followed his career from United to Barcelona and he is doing some great things there.\n\n\"I think that he has lived up to the expectations that were there at Barcelona. I think it is a fantastic experience for him in that league, away from United, away from the Premier League. I think it has only been very positive for him.\"\n\nImage: Rashford has scored 10 goals and assisted 13 in 34 games at Barcelona\n\nWeir, though, still has hopes that the Rashford story at United has not yet seen its conclusion.\n\n\"I'd love him to win LaLiga this year, the Champions League,\" Weir says\n\n\"Go and do that, and then he's done it. But I'd love him to come back to United.\n\n\"I think he'd look back in when he's 40 and think, I left the chapter of my career there. He is some player. Hopefully, he gets to the World Cup and does well there. Then if United do get Champions League, it's made for him.\n\n\"I think it depends a lot on the manager who comes in at United, but obviously, the club is growing now, for sure, and he's a fantastic player, so he'd definitely add something to that Man United squad.\"\n\nThe beginning was picture-book, a true video-game-like storyline to becoming a superstar. The future of Rashford's career may be uncertain but there will be no forgetting the fresh-faced 18-year-old from Wythenshawe who lived and became the dream."

            "content": "The FIA has confirmed a mid-season rule change will be made following Formula 1's engine dispute, with a new test being introduced from June.\n\nThe build-up to the new 2026 season, which begins in Melbourne next weekend, has led to potential loopholes being exploited, with Mercedes in the spotlight after rival teams claimed they have found a way around engine compression ratio limits.\n\nAs part of F1's biggest regulation changes ever, the compression ratio limit has been lowered from 18.0 under the previous ruleset to 16.0, but measurements are currently only taken when the engine is not running at full temperature, with Mercedes being believed by teams to be exploiting this which could give them a competitive advantage.\n\nHowever, the FIA has announced a new test will take place from June 1 when the engine ambient temperature is at 130 degrees.\n\nSeven races are scheduled before the new test is introduced, with 17 rounds on the calendar from June onwards.\n\nThe FIA said \"some aspects of the amendments were concurrently approved unanimously by the Formula 1 power unit manufacturers\". F1's engine manufacturers are Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull-Ford, Audi and Honda.\n\n\"The modifications to the technical regulations follow the pre-season tests in Barcelona and Bahrain and extensive feedback received from drivers and teams,\" said the FIA.\n\n\"A significant effort has been invested in finding a solution to the topic of the compression ratio. This parameter, which was one of the key fundamental targets of these regulations in order to attract newcomers to the sport, is limited in the regulations to 16:1, measured in cold conditions.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports F1's David Croft takes a closer look at how F1 in 2026 will evolve as the sport begins a new era of recharge, featuring more electric power, new teams, and engine suppliers\n\n\"The FIA has worked to find a compromise solution which determines that the compression ratio will be controlled in both hot and cold conditions from June 1 2026, and subsequently only in the operating conditions (130deg C) from 2027 onwards.\n\n\"The regulations introduced for 2026 represent one of the biggest changes in recent memory. All parties acknowledge that with the introduction of such significant regulatory changes, there are collective learnings to be taken from pre-season testing and the initial rounds of the 2026 championship.\n\n\"Further evaluation and technical checks on energy management matters are ongoing.\"\n\nF1's governing body confirmed that from the new test \"any component, assembly, mechanism, or integrate arrangement of components that is designed or functions to in ratio in operating conditions beyond 16.0 is prohibited\".\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Hear from George Russell, Oscar Piastri and many more following the third and final day of the second testing in Bahrain\n\nWill this impact the pecking order?\n\nMercedes team principal Toto Wolff stated before F1's two pre-season tests in Bahrain that a change to the power-unit regulations could be \"quite damaging for the performance\".\n\nBut, during the final Bahrain test, Wolff softened his stance and said Mercedes would be \"pretty comfortable\" if a team protested their engine at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix - a scenario that now seems highly unlikely given a resolution appears to have been found.\n\nHe added: \"We said it all along that this looks like a storm in a teacup, the whole thing, and numbers were coming up that were… if these numbers would have been true, I absolutely understand why somebody would fight it, but eventually, it's not worth the fight.\n\n\"It doesn't change anything for us, whether we stay like this or whether we change to the new regulations, and that's been a process.\n\n\"But we also want to be good citizens in the sport because it doesn't make a big difference we then changed opinion.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff spoke out against Formula 1 bosses moving to close a loophole in the new engine rules\n\nIn January, when the engine saga was first reported, Red Bull engine chief Ben Hodgkinson said it was \"a lot of noise about nothing\" and had sided with Mercedes against the other three engine manufacturers - Ferrari, Audi and Honda.\n\nHowever, Aston Martin team principal Adrian Newey told Sky Sports News in February that \"everybody is aligned bar one manufacturer\". Newey did not name Mercedes, but the stance Wolff has taken suggests Red Bull had changed their stance.\n\nRed Bull team principal Laurent Mekies said: \"Sometimes it was felt that we were not so sure where Red Bull was standing. At least that's what I was reading, listening to you guys.\n\n\"The simple truth is that we don't really mind if the regs goes left or if the regs goes right.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Jenson Button unpacks life in Formula 1 by answering the 11 questions you have always wanted to ask an F1 world champion\n\nFIA single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis said \"I don't think this topic ever needed to get to the level of attention\" that it has over the off-season.\n\nHe said: \"I don't think that we are anywhere near the levels of performance that was stated, and certainly there was no cheat or anything like that, or no allegation of anybody being illegal.\n\n\"It is just a matter whether that was an intent of the regulation, and, as new regulations currently enforce, there will be this, but there will be other little topics that we will need to resolve going forward, and the approach will try to be even-handed.\n\n\"Each time that we follow something, I'm sure there will be people that are unhappy that we're not acting soon enough, and there will be people who are unhappy that we are not letting things by, and part of our job is to try to keep that on a on a sort of balanced way.\"\n\nBernie Collins on new engine test Sky Sports F1's Bernie Collins during Bahrain pre-season testing\n\n\n\n“It’s not the first time we have had this sort of thing in F1.\n\n\n\n“The suggestion is Mercedes have a different compression ratio in the engine, which compresses the gas more at a higher temperature, which gives them more power out of the engine.\n\n\n\n“We had this last year with front and rear wings where midway through the season we brought in an extra test to try and slow the leaders, at that stage McLaren, but they passed all the tests and nothing changes in the pecking order.\n\n\n\n“We don’t know the details of the test exactly, how thorough it will be, and whether it will make a change to the pecking order because we don’t even know what it is.\n\n\n\n“It’s a move to quieten the rumours that Mercedes have got an advantage over others in this area. Any change to regulations, particularly engine regulations, are a hard thing to change quickly because these engines are changed over years and years, so hopefully Mercedes, or other teams, don’t have any changes to make to comply with this regulation.”\n\nQualifying rule tweak announced and no mandatory Monaco pit stops\n\nAlso on Saturday, the FIA revealed Q3 will increase from 12 minutes to 13 minutes from this season.\n\nQualifying will still be scheduled for one hour as to compensate the minor change, the interval between Q2 and Q3 will be reduced from eight to seven minutes.\n\nNewcomers Cadillac join the F1 grid this year, so there will be 11 teams in the field, and it means the bottom six cars in Q1 and Q2 will be eliminated, rather than five.\n\nLast year's mandatory two pit stops at the Monaco Grand Prix has been shelved, so the race will have the same regulations as the other grand prix when it takes place at the later-than-usual date of June 7.\n\nThursday March 5\n\n3am: Drivers' Press Conference\n\n6am: Paddock Uncut\n\n9.45pm: F3 Practice\n\n10.55pm: F2 Practice\n\nFriday March 6\n\n1am: Australian GP Practice One (session starts at 1.30am)*\n\n2.55am: F3 Qualifying*\n\n3.30am: Team Bosses Press Conference\n\n3.50am: F2 Qualifying*\n\n4.35am: Australian GP Practice Two (session starts at 5am)*\n\n6.15am: The F1 Show*\n\nSaturday March 7\n\n0.10am: F3 Sprint*\n\n1.10am: Australian GP Practice Three (session starts at 1.30am)*\n\n3.05am: F2 Sprint*\n\n4.10am: Australian GP Qualifying build-up*\n\n5am: AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX QUALIFYING*\n\n7am: Ted's Qualifying Notebook*\n\n9.45pm: F3 Feature Race*\n\nSunday March 8\n\n12.20am: F2 Feature Race*\n\n2.30am: Australian GP build-up: Grand Prix Sunday*\n\n4am: THE AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX*\n\n6am: Australian GP reaction: Chequered Flag*\n\n7am: Ted's Notebook*\n\n7.55am: Australian GP race replay*\n\n10am: Australian GP highlights (also on Sky Showcase)*\n\n*Also on Sky Sports Main Event\n\nWatch every race of the 2026 Formula 1 season live on Sky Sports, starting with the Australian Grand Prix from March 6-8.

Ben Gannon-Doak is also hoping to be back at around the same time. Justin Kluivert and Julio Soler are also unavailable. Following his captain’s return from injury as a substitute against Fulham last weekend, Regis Le Bris said Granit Xhaka “might” start this afternoon. Romaine Mundle and Jocelin Ta Bi will be sidelined for “a few weeks or months” on the back of injuries they sustained against Fulham, while Nordi Mukiele and Brian Brobbey will be assessed. This game has come too soon for Dennis Cirkin, who is expected to be back in 10 days, while Bertrand Traore is back in full training.

Sunderland’s form has deserted them somewhat – not that it’s ever been too clever away from home – with their only wins since Christmas coming at home to Burnley and Crystal Palace, and away to Oxford in the FA Cup. Bournemouth, unbeaten since 3 January, are eyeing the European places once more. They’ve coped admirably without Antoine Semenyo, with recruits like Rayan, Junior Kroupi and Amine Adli stepping into the breach.

They mean certain games can get some time in the sun they may not otherwise enjoy. Derby boss John Eustace facing his former club Blackburn is an intriguing game, particularly given the contrasting fortunes of the two teams. Eustace definitely has something about him: Blackburn have (pretty much) tanked since his exit while Derby are on the rise, still in with a shot of the playoffs.

Let's hear it for Rob Edwards, he's turned around Wolves amazingly, I thought he was two pence short of a ten pence for going there and leaving Middlesbrough, but maybe I was wrong, and Wolves look a strong outfit now, so I'd suggest the bounce back to the Premier League will be immediately next season. lester48 28 February 2026 8:40am View image in fullscreen A happy Rob Edwards.

Imagine if all six English sides made it? It’s not unfeasible. PSG have not hit the levels they scaled last season so Chelsea have a chance.

A home win at Signal Iduna Park, however, could spice things up, though whether Dortmund will be weather-beaten by their Champions League collapse against Atalanta remains to be seen.

It means Ed Still has won two, drawn one and lost one of his four games in charge of the Hornets, who leapfrogged the Robins in the table, both teams sitting just outside the playoff spots.

Dual Gomes goals ensure Wolves beat Aston Villa and unwanted points record Read more Share Updated at 03.26 EST\n\n4h ago 03.15 EST About last night: It was a tale of two Gomes’s in Wolverhampton last night as Aston Villa’s blip in form became a dip in form, suffering the ignominy of becoming just the second Premier League team to lose to Wolves this season. João Gomes and Rodrigo Gomes were on target in the second half to breeze Wolves past that infamous Derby County points total of 2008. Villa have now firmly been dragged into the battle for Champions League qualification with Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea. Unai Emery was in phlegmatic mood after the defeat, though. He said: “In September I was worried and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. In December I was so happy and excited to get the top-five position and achieve the Champions League. “One month ago I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League. Now we are in the average to be in the top five. “Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, they are trying to get to us, for them it is a priority to get into the Champions League.” Share Updated at 03.42 EST"

            "content": "Arsenal had to expect the jibes from Tottenham and they were not disappointed. Just before kick-off in last Sunday’s north London derby, the Spurs support in the South Stand of their stadium spelled out a giant message in mosaic form. “North Ldn since 1882,” it read.\n\nA clear dig, then, at Arsenal’s south of the river history from the Woolwich days and, as mentioned, very much a part of a rivalry where goading and baiting go hand in hand with the loathing. Arsenal had been similarly provocative before the derby against Spurs at the Emirates Stadium last November, lighting the pre-match scene with a tifo featuring images of various club greats. The most prominent at the top of it? Sol Campbell, of course.\n\nWhat was more surprising – and certainly led to raised eyebrows at Arsenal – was Wolves’ now infamous TikTok post on the Thursday before last. The 80-second clip, uploaded after the 2-2 draw between the clubs the previous night, was a savage take on Arsenal’s “game management”. Or, to put it another way, and as Wolves surely intended, their dark arts and shithousery.\n\nThe social media team at Wolves showed how Gabriel Martinelli taunted the home crowd by flashing up the scoreline on his fingers as Arsenal led 2-1. They highlighted the delay in Arsenal taking a corner as they continued to lead. They mocked Gabriel Magalhães for going down after an apparent head clash before he got back up and carried on.\n\nThere was indignation from the in-house commentators when Leandro Trossard also went to ground after an aerial clash in the 90th minute. In the background, it was easy to make out the chant from the Wolves fans: “Same old Arsenal, always cheating.” There was laughter and the corresponding emojis on the clip when Wolves equalised at the bitter end.\n\nThere was more from elsewhere later in the day. At tea time, Manchester City’s X account piped up with a three-year-old clip of their team playing keep-ball by the corner flag in the dying minutes of a 2-0 home victory over Newcastle. “Seeing out the win,” read the text with a tick emoji above footage of Erling Haaland and Jack Grealish, well, managing the game to a successful conclusion. It was a mickey-take with an obvious target.\n\nThis is where Arsenal find themselves as they prepare for Sunday’s home game against Chelsea – the latest staging post in their draining push for the Premier League title. Their rivals, big and small, are lining up the pot shots, eager to have fun at their expense, to prey on their sensitivities. To drive a particular narrative and make Arsenal prisoners of it.\n\nThe Wolves TikTok clip overlooked a major detail when it came to Trossard. On as a 73rd-minute substitute, the winger was cleaned out by a shoulder barge from Santiago Bueno, who was on a yellow card. Trossard had eyes only for the high ball; the Wolves defender looked directly at him and left a calling card on his opponent’s jaw. A dazed Trossard was forced off after treatment, Arsenal relieved that he avoided injury, and how do you think the club’s doctors felt about essentially being accused of complicity in a plot to run down the clock?\n\nNobody thought about that. They were too busy enjoying the clip, which went viral for the reason that these things always do. It struck a chord. It fed a perception with which opposing fans are seemingly on board. Arsenal as the roughhouse guys – and not only when they are loading men into the six-yard box on corners. The ones that will do whatever it takes to win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Leandro Trossard’s injury at Wolves seemed to invoke opprobrium from the home side. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nArsenal were much better than Spurs. They deserved to beat them, which they did; to clear their heads after the trauma of Wolves. As an aside, it was only this Spurs team. Chelsea ought to be a tougher prospect. Yet Arsenal did get away with one in the 53rd minute as they led 2-1. Would it have been different if Randal Kolo Muani had not been penalised for the slightest of pushes into Gabriel’s back before he shot past David Raya? At the very least, Arsenal would have felt their anxiety levels rise.\n\nGabriel drew the contact to the referee’s attention in theatrical fashion, as he had done at Newcastle last September in a similar situation against Nick Woltemade. That day, the referee said no foul and Woltemade scored. This time, Gabriel got the decision.\n\nWhat did Gabriel do after the game? Did he a) keep his head down and quietly count his blessings? Or b) post a picture to social media of him holding a hand of cards with the four of hearts visible, signifying his team’s four goals? He went for the latter, even tagging the Spurs forward Richarlison. Cue a host of diving memes in the responses. Was goading really the right option given the climate around the club? On the other hand, you have to admire Gabriel’s chutzpah.\n\nMikel Arteta’s response to what we are obliged to call the “outside noise” has been to narrow the focus; to dial up the intensity while also talking up his players and their mindset. The manager has his eyes on the prize and there are a number of points that need to be made, beginning with the feeling towards him and his side in coaching circles.\n\nTowards the end of January, Pep Guardiola described Arsenal as the “best team in the world” and it did not sound like just mind games from the City manager. The Wolves head coach, Rob Edwards, messaged Arteta after last week’s game to say that Arsenal were the best side in the league and there have been others in their positions who have privately expressed the highest admiration for what Arteta is doing. Namely, how Arsenal press, massing men around the ball, cutting off the passing lanes, forcing turnovers. How they dominate in possession, playing on the front foot, creating overloads, moving it quickly. The watchwords are remorselessness and control.\n\nAccording to Opta, Arsenal have had seven yellow cards for time-wasting in the league this season – the same number as Chelsea and behind only Bournemouth and Fulham, who each have eight. They are the seventh-worst offenders for the average time of delays for restarts, taking in set pieces and goal-kicks. They sit behind Sunderland, Brentford, Crystal Palace, Newcastle, Leeds and Burnley on the list in that order.\n\nArteta and his players remain at the centre of a storm, buffeted by ill winds, Chelsea ready to bring the latest of them. If Arsenal hold their nerve, they will have done it the hard way."

            "content": "“I just want to have my name out there to the point where when someone hears it they know instantly who is being talked about,” says the Chelsea full-back Chloe Sarwie. “I want to be that player who can amaze people constantly and that is up there as one of the best.”\n\nYou could be forgiven for viewing this level of confidence as arrogant, but you would be wrong. The talented 17-year-old defender comes across as grounded, intelligent, hard-working and humble, but her edge is a steely belief in her football.\n\nSarwie is speaking to the Guardian shortly before signing her first professional contract, four months after her debut in the 1-1 draw with Twente in the Champions League and three months after her first call-up to the England Under-23s.\n\nSarwie is back with the under‑23s for next month’s games against France and the Netherlands, one of two 17-year-olds considered good enough to compete alongside those vying for a chance in the senior side (the other is Erica Meg Parkinson, who plays her club football in Portugal). Last summer, at 16, she was in the squad that competed at the Under-19 Euros in Poland. “I was taken aback and I didn’t really have any expectations so it was incredible,” she says.\n\n“It’s honestly a really intense environment and every training session everyone just wants to one-up each other. It gets really competitive and just being around that wanting-to-win group was incredible.”\n\nHer Chelsea debut in October, when still 16, came as a surprise. “As soon as I got the nod from Sonia [Bompastor] that I’d be coming on for Sandy [Baltimore] and making my debut, I was just down on the sideline, shocked but pumped and ready to get on the pitch,” says Sarwie, who entered the fray against Twente in the 73rd minute.\n\nShe impressed instantly, playing with an admirable fearlessness. “Honestly, when I stepped on that pitch, I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know how to play, but I was just trying to play my part for the team, fit in and see what I could do. Towards the end of the game, I was being myself a bit more and the more playing time I’m getting, the more I’m able to express myself, but my full self hasn’t come out yet.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Chloe Sarwie (right) made her Chelsea debut in the Champions League draw with Twente last October. Photograph: Chris Lee/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\nChelsea are well equipped at right-back, with two of the world’s best in Lucy Bronze and Ellie Carpenter at their disposal, but at left-back there is a hole. With Baltimore performing well in the position but naturally a more attacking player and Niamh Charles out with an ankle injury, there have been some opportunities for Sarwie, against Crystal Palace in the FA Cup and West Ham and Tottenham in the Women’s Super League.\n\nShould her development continue at its accelerated pace there is also the chance to stake a claim in the senior England squad that has had question marks at left‑back under Sarina Wiegman. London City Lionesses’ Poppy Pattinson is the latest to receive a call-up with an eye on finding a solution to the conundrum.\n\nSarwie was introduced to the Chelsea senior side in pre-season. It was “quite exciting but also quite nerve-racking”, though training and playing with the first team has been hugely beneficial. “It’s a great challenge and I love being challenged and going up against these players, seeing how their level compares to mine and how I can get to that level,” says Sarwie.\n\n“Obviously, Lucy’s at England as well and being able to have that connection is great, even though I’m in one of the lower age groups because, ultimately, I’m learning how I can then progress to that next step and be part of the senior squad. That’s where she can give me tips and show what it takes.”\n\nSarwie began playing football in the park on her own, light on her feet thanks to ballet from the ages of two until eight. “I used to turn up to ballet with muddy tights after playing football and rolling around in the mud for a good hour or two. But ballet had a big impact on my journey as a football player as my dribbling playing style kind of links back to it. Ballet made me light on my feet. I also had to adapt from a ballet mindset, from a solo stage, to a football mindset and a team performance stage.”\n\nIt was in the park where coaches would approach her and tell her she should be playing for a club and eventually she thought: “Why not?” After a season at Millwall, she had trials at Arsenal and Chelsea and had offers from both. “I had to pick Chelsea because it was closer,” she says. “I let my family down on that one because they’re all Arsenal supporters, but oh well.”\n\nShe juggles playing and training with studying for her BTec in engineering and her mum, Jean, who is a teacher at her school, is the force that has enabled her to pursue football. She takes her laptop everywhere, to catch up with coursework, with one day a week spent in the classroom.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie takes a selfie with fans after featuring in the FA Cup against Crystal Palace. Photograph: Sport Press Photo/Alamy\n\nSarwie is having to contend with an influx of information. “It’s mad trying to switch the brain from studying engineering to football and back,” she says. “I’m still taking in everything in relation to the first team. I have all that information coming at me and then I have to go home, switch off and then do my work and it’s all a bit chaotic.”\n\nOn the pitch, there is also a balance to be struck between what is being asked of her and instinct. “Sometimes on the pitch I can be quite hesitant because I’m trying to think about what I should do at that moment instead of what I want to do, because that’s sometimes two different things. The coach wants me to do something but I want to do something else in the moment and it’s about quickly processing which one I should do.\n\n“Every day I’m getting new information coming in and I’m just trying to soak that up but trying to show myself on the pitch and putting those words into actions on the pitch can be quite difficult and it’s going to be like that for a while because of my age.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie practised ballet until the age of eight. ‘It made me light on my feet,’ she says. Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\n“Once I’m on the pitch I just want to be my most relaxed self. Breathing techniques on the pitch really help me stay calm and I’ve been told I look arrogant doing this, but chewing gum on the pitch makes me relax as well.\n\n“I want to be that person that looks in place and calm with the rest of the team, that calms that team down. I don’t want to be nervous when I get the ball, or for them to be nervous when I get the ball, I want to get the ball and to express myself as much as possible with it.”"

            "content": "There’s a good advert right now on the rolling TV sports news channels. It starts with a rush of beeps and plinks and flashing symbols, generating instantly the flat, glazed, hungry quality of the online casino. A well-groomed middle-aged woman is shown sitting in an armchair in a suburban living room. It’s a jarring tonal shift, but we’re still in that same space, betting graphics dancing around her head.\n\nThe middle-aged woman turns to the camera and says: “The games are all different … It never gets boring,” eyes gleaming strangely, hands gripping the struts of her chair. Here is a person who is not just pleased, but uncontrollably energised by the prospect of WowBet.com’s 10bn mildly divergent AI-generated gambling patterns. At this point the words “Sandra Frottwangle, funeral director” appear on the screen.\n\nBy now it’s just an overload of feelings. The first thought is about transgression. Sandra Frottwangle’s job is to curate death. She spends her days managing the nobility of human flesh. She stands at the far edge of existence creating ritual and comfort, a timeless figure, the eternal footman, the director of last things. But she also gets bored easily and prefers stuff with flashing lights.\n\nIs this OK? Would you want Sandra Frottwangle to direct your funeral? Death is repetitive. Mortality is tedious. What if she decides this is all really dull and needs more beeping noises, less weeping and organ music? The ferryman is at the door. He’s unsheathing his scythe. He’s also got 400 free online spins at GambleDick.com.\n\nThe second thought is a rush of tenderness. Yes, Sandra Frottwangle’s life is spent in that liminal space. She stares into the void. She sees the weakness of the flesh, fish-grey monkey-brown. But even here she is still hungry for life, still craving that wild human energy. Eyes gleaming like opals, casino chips circling her head, she looks like one of those renaissance friezes expressing the glory and brevity of human life, the globe, the skull, the bowl of rotting fruit.\n\nOnly now we’re strapped into a velour armchair, drooling down our necks, being force-fed endless brain-shredding content and just wanting to feel something. I … love her. I love Sandra Frottwangle (funeral director). And she’s right. All the games are the same. But we still want the games.\n\nEither all of that stuff, or the people who make daytime TV adverts are bored twentysomething creatives who just thought it would be funny to put the words “funeral director” over shots of an actor pretending to be really into gambling websites. Probably it’s one or the other.\n\nAnd yes, this is supposed to be about the Scottish Premiership title race, which enters its spring ignition phase this weekend, and which is now arguably the most interesting title race in Europe.\n\nEither way Sunday’s Old Firm derby at Ibrox is a genuinely rare thing. For once this is not a title decider. It could be a title eliminator. It could be a step towards neither of Celtic or Rangers winning the league for the first time in 41 years. A draw in Glasgow could leave Hearts six points clear at the top. But by now it is a startling transformation whatever the outcome.\n\nHearts finished 40 points behind Celtic last year. The great clanking hand of Tony Bloom and his big data hive-brain robots has been on site for only eight months. The word “disruption” is usually shorthand for tech bro types in $4,000 Japanese trainers working out new ways to fire people. This is actual, good disruption. A three-way title race isn’t just deeply un-Scotland, it’s deeply un-anywhere these days.\n\nIn the major European leagues only Greece, Denmark and Poland have something this close. The trend is towards stratification, dead air after Christmas, a single basking giant or a two-way chase energetically spun by the broadcasters. Money has made this happen. The Premier League in particular has harvested talent, turning previously robust leagues into clearing houses, exit lounges to the life-altering four-year deal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Hearts have sustained a title challenge and it has provided a welcome alternative to the traditional dominance of Celtic and Rangers. Photograph: Steve Welsh/PA\n\nThis is perhaps partly the case in Scotland. But there is also a sense of useful incompetence in play, accidental competitiveness. The Glasgow clubs have spent decades trying to sustain a place in the roided-up Euro elite, taking it in turns to fall over their feet. Now we have this, a perfect storm of super-smart newcomer and a pair of sleepwalking giants.\n\nThere are other places for proper chapter and verse on whether Hearts can sustain this. The key aspect at this stage is that this title race has taken on a sense of outside life. My own kids follow every Hearts game with a rare sense of urgency, despite being fully TikTok-brained, zombified by reel culture.\n\nIt is, of course, only one season. It could all fall away quite rapidly. But there is also a lesson here, perhaps even a control experiment. Because big football is often boring now. The direction of travel is fewer meaningful matches, a cartel of mega-clubs resting on the ropes, a Champions League group stage that feels like an autumn exhibition tour.\n\nThe idea is out there that younger people will be happy with this, will feast instead on clips, screengrabs, parasocial celebrity worship; that young people are essentially industrialised idiots who have for the first time in all human existence lost the craving for actual narrative.\n\nThe reality is this culture creates a yearning for something else. Marketing people will assume hate clicks, or boredom clicks, or any kind of clicks represent actual value and desire. But young people also like real things.\n\nFinding interest in a competitive football league is a bit like getting into vinyl, or books made from paper, or the revelation, usually via an American man on YouTube who looks as if he keeps a collection of children’s dolls in a shed, that food can actually be made from ingredients.\n\nPerhaps Scottish football has fallen into a less globalist version of how to thrive. Tend to the soil. Build it and they will come. The league has plenty that can be weaponised: deep history, heritage value, the same authenticity that made it so moreish back in the days when Old Firm games were basically catharsis, insanity, people at the edge of their own emotions colliding for 90 minutes.\n\nWhy do sporting leagues roll over so willingly? Why do they turn themselves inside out, shred the basis of their own value – English cricket: we see you – in order to chase those precarious streams of macro-money? What if you just stopped trying to expand outward in every direction? What if the guiding principle is: what will make the thing we have right here in front of us better? Why not go hyper-local?\n\nThere is an argument that Hearts winning would be better for Rangers and Celtic. It energises the league, supercharges the brand, speaks to the desire for sporting tension among those bored by the drift of big football.\n\nWe have replaced a great deal that was valuable with generalised digital noise. In a sense we are all strapped into our armchairs now, craving a place where the games are different, anything with heart and life to distract us from the grey, out there staring into the void with Sandra Frottwangle eyes."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says his Tottenham players are not fit enough and has questioned their desire to put in the hard yards without the ball.\n\nThe interim head coach has a clearer idea of the problems he faces after two weeks – and there are many of them, including low levels of confidence and the capacity of the younger players to handle the pressure of a relegation battle.\n\nTudor knows there are reasons for the physical issues with the squad stretched by an injury crisis amid a punishing schedule. Although Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso are in contention to return for Sunday’s trip to Fulham, Tottenham will be without eight injured players plus the suspended Cristian Romero.\n\nTudor believes there is only one way out of the situation – an on-the-hoof fitness reboot in training, particularly as the club had no midweek fixture last week or this. The Croat surprised the players by working them extremely hard throughout last week and not tapering off before last Sunday’s home game against Arsenal, which they lost 4-1. As Tudor made plain, it is not a time to pander to player sensibilities.\n\n“Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,” Tudor said. “They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and it made the physical condition of the team drop down. So we need to use this period where we don’t play the games to put some petrol in the engine so the engine starts to work better.\n\n“They are fatigued. To do the pressing high you need to be fit. But [it is] all of them because if someone is not in the right shape there is a problem because someone is coming late [to the press].\n\n“The second thing is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back. If you run up and don’t run back it’s a problem. For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it’s a big question what we can do and what we cannot do.”\n\nTudor was asked about his full-throttle approach from the first training session. “Yes, that’s the only way – running,” he said. “The pitch is 100 yards, it’s long. So you need to run.\n\n“Maybe you have habits to, I don’t know … work a bit less. I put some runs without the ball [into the sessions]. Never players like runs without the ball so we put some runs without balls. But it’s a moment when there is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn’t like. And the best thing is that they understand this. They gave me their availability to do these things.”\n\nTudor is under no illusions about the size of the challenge. It was put to him that the striker, Randal Kolo Muani, had played well against Arsenal. “That’s good, one good thing,” he replied.\n\nWhat Tudor wants to see at Fulham and beyond is players such as Kolo Muani stepping up, accepting the responsibility. “Some players are still young,” he said. “They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to resolve the problems.\n\nView image in fullscreen Randal Kolo Muani scores against Arsenal – Igor Tudor wants him to keep raising his game for Spurs. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\n“If you have too many of these players because of the amount of injuries, who are playing together in the squad, it does create some problems. But it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man. To say: ‘Come on, I’m the guy, give me the ball, I will score.’ Instead of just: ‘What can I do? I’m just here, you know.’\n\n“It’s always how you see the situation. It’s not: ‘I’m just here. We had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play.’ How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy and positive, there is opportunity.”\n\nTudor has not dwelt for long on the derby with Arsenal. “No, no, forget that,” he said. It was never likely to be a game that would define the club’s survival hopes. The same is not true of Fulham – or the home fixture against Crystal Palace next Thursday.\n\n“After the first game, I said if you play against the best team in the world at this moment, it’s not a realistic game to show [whether] we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,” Tudor said. “That’s the truth. They show they can be in some parts of the game. But for long periods we had problems, in defence especially. It’s not easy against them. Let’s see in the next games.”"

The club are not planning to publish their 2024-25 accounts until the end of March.\n\nChelsea, while not contesting the £355m loss, which is based on information they provided to Uefa, insist the headline figure does not reflect the economic reality.\n\nClub sources have disclosed that the record loss reflects non-cash accounting adjustments required by Uefa’s financial sustainability regulations, specifically one-off transactions related to player contract and asset write-offs, and that they are profitable on an operational basis.\n\nChelsea were fined £27m by Uefa last summer for breaching its spending restrictions and ordered to submit to a business plan, but are confident of avoiding another sanction. As part of that settlement agreement Chelsea were permitted to continue running at a substantial loss, as long as it remained in line with “the projected deficit submitted in the business plan”."

It was a moment of catharsis for Edwards, who beat his chest and wellied an advertising hoarding, but for Unai Emery it was a different kind of cue.\n\nAs those in old gold savoured a win over near neighbours that takes them to 13 points, ending any fears that they may not eclipse Derby’s record-low tally of 11 in 2007-08, Emery marched straight down the tunnel before the post-match handshakes.\n\nWolves’s other Premier League win came against West Ham at the start of last month and no wonder the supporters savoured every second. “The two games we’ve won in the league this year, both managers have disappeared from the touchline,” Edwards said with a smile. “I think everyone expects just to turn up and win, which is understandable given how this season has gone.”\n\nAt the end of the season, how costly might this untimely slip prove for Villa? Judging by the way Emery fumed, this defeat will hurt for a while yet and, significantly, it could have major implications for their hopes of returning to the Champions League. They are on a poor run of form having taken only one win in their past six matches in all competitions and 12 points from their past nine league games. Emery called for perspective.\n\n“Maybe you can say: ‘We are losing the chance to the win the Premier League,’” Emery said animatedly. “Some supporters maybe were dreaming. Now we are not with the possibility to fight for the Premier League, some can feel frustrated, even myself because I have my dreams. In September I was worried and the objective was to stay in the Premier League. One month ago I was dreaming about maybe winning the Premier League.”\n\nView image in fullscreen A sodden Unai Emery tries to spur on his Aston Villa team as they struggled against Wolves. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters\n\nVilla were unpicked by a team almost certainly heading for the Championship but, as they did when rousing to a draw against the leaders, Arsenal, Wolves showed they will go down fighting.\n\nJoão Gomes fired in his first goal in a year just after the hour, starting the move himself after nutmegging the Villa substitute Ross Barkley, and then Rodrigo Gomes put the game beyond doubt on the counterattack, after Yerson Mosquera and José Sá combined to deny Amadou Onana. Morgan Rogers’s attempt to recycle a corner ended with Wolves attacking three v two. Rogers had his face in the turf as Rodrigo Gomes swivelled near the penalty spot and buried the ball past Emiliano Martínez.\n\nIt was never going to be an evening for the purists and driving rain did little to enhance this soggy Midlands derby as a spectacle. It was a contest bogged down by misplaced passes, clunky touches and the ball slowing unpredictably on a saturated surface. Ezri Konsa can vouch for that, the Villa centre-back nudging the ball back to Martínez with his big toe, just as Adam Armstrong sought to prey on Douglas Luiz’s loose pass. It was a night for the poncho-clad Wolves supporters in the uncovered Graham Hughes stand in a corner of this stadium. Hugo Bueno looked battle-hardened, the reverse of the Wolves full-back’s old gold shirt caked in mud.\n\nEmery grew increasingly agitated as the game went on. He exploded as Jadon Sancho declined to take a shot first time at the back post and there was a restlessness within the home support too. Edwards gestured for calm as the locals aired their frustration at Jackson Tchatchoua looking inside for the perceived easy pass. Wolves struggled to hold on to the ball and when they did have it surrendered possession cheaply, João Gomes among those guilty. Sá, wearing the captain’s armband, shanked a goal-kick straight out of play to the disbelief of those in the stands.\n\nWolves, certainly not lacking in spirit, defended admirably. Tchatchoua did well to halt Ian Maatsen, one of those thrown on by Emery as Villa chased the game. Toti Gomes halted an advancing Leon Bailey, another second-half substitute. Bueno blocked off all avenues for Cash and turned to celebrate with the home fans. Then, at the final whistle, having doubled their lead, Wolves let loose."

            "content": "CYCLONE ravaged resorts abandoned by their billionaire owners are plaguing Australia’s paradise coast as the tropical rainforrest reclaims the wreckage.\n\nMany holiday retreats built on the pristine islands off Australia’s north east coast are now just eerie piles of destroyed glass and steel.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome have been abandoned for a decade with once beautiful hotels left to rot after being hit by cyclones.\n\nSouth Molle Island, situated in the Whitsunday Passage, once boasted a 188 room resort with multiple swimming pools and a golf course.\n\nThe tiny isle was hit by Cyclone Debbie in 2017, severely damaging the multimillion dollar tourist hot-spot.\n\nNow, its creepy rain-filled swimming pool is littered in detritus and dead frogs, with weeds growing through the surrounding brick deck.\n\nThe pool-side cabanas have all but fallen over, while skeletal remains of long-forgotten umbrellas and jungle vines have started to creep up the walls.\n\nThe hotel was smashed by the storm with broken rafters and glass pile ups in the middle of an old ballroom.\n\n\n\nSouth Molle’s fate remained unknown for years until owner China Capital Investment Group (CCIG) finally decided it was “not in a position” to fix the wreckage.\n\nRichard Vanhoff, Private Islands Online Australia’s island and resort specialist, took on the marketing of South Molle Island last week.\n\nHe told The Sun the original “ancient” South Molle resort was never built to withstand powerful “nasty” weather events.\n\n“South Molle was one of the earliest resorts built here in Queensland on an island so it was never built for the current specs for cyclone ratings,” he said.\n\n\n\nRichard is hoping someone with deep pockets and a love of the Australian sunshine will give the crumbling island getaway a chance at a new beginning.\n\nAnd on the market for £15.7million, it’s a bargain for an island hunter.\n\n“A lot of Queensland’s islands have sat in limbo and will continue to do so until things change and investment starts to head towards tourism again,” Richard said.\n\n\n\n“The rest comes naturally – we have the sunshine, we have the beaches, we have the palm trees, we’ve got the suntan oil, we have the bars, we’re known for our drinking culture.\n\n“Paradise is waiting.”\n\nDouble Island was once a celebrity hideaway for the likes of actors Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt, Keanu Reeves, Matt Damon and Drew Barrymore.\n\n\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the state government reclaimed the derelict island through the courts, stripping a Hong Kong-based developer of their lease following years of decay and public access disputes.\n\nThe current government is now preparing to sell the 19-hectare island to someone who will revive the neglected slice of paradise.\n\nThe Queensland Government is also supporting lessees redeveloping the Hook Island Resort in the Whitsundays.\n\nHook Island Lodge fell into disrepair in 2013 after Cyclone Anthony significantly destroyed its buildings.\n\n\n\nIt sat dormant and decaying until a consortium led by Epochal Hotels and its chief executive officer Glenn Piper purchased a 25-year lease in 2022 for more than £5.2million.\n\nOnly about 18 miles south, Lindeman Island also sat dormant for years – dilapidated and dusty.\n\nBut work is underway to bring the cyclone-damaged resort back to its former glory, a government spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nA world-class eco-lodge will host guests back to the once-popular isle by 2027.\n\nLindeman Island first opened to visitors in the roaring 1920s before Club Med took over in the 80s and became a go-to spot for luxury international travellers.\n\nCyclone Yasi ravaged the island in 2011 and the island sat in sordid dilapidation for the following 12 years.\n\nMore abandoned islands Brampton Island before the cyclone Brampton Island Off the coast of Mackay, Brampton Island heyday came and went decades ago. It was first built by former WW2 army engineer Tom McLean, who purchased the island to develop under his family business in 1962. It was then sold in 1985 to Trans-Australia Airlines, which ceased trading in 2009 before United Petroleum snatched it up for $5.9 million in 2010. The island was hit by a cyclone in 2011, destroying a lot of the original 1960s resort. In July last year, developers asked for a five-year extension to develop a “boutique-style” resort featuring villas, a rock pool and yoga studio. Today, its oceanfront pool lies unused, filled with sand. Dunk Island Australian billionaire Annie Cannon-Brookes has been snapping up property on Dunk Island, which was trashed since cyclones swept through years ago. She has just bought her fourth development to add to her island portfolio. Cannon-Brookes has splashed at least £17.3million so far and even signed a 30-year lease with the Cassowary Coast Regional Council for the public access area at Dunk Island Spit. Her vision is to bring the island back to life, telling realestate.com: “Our goal is to be good custodians of the island, and we are pleased to be making progress”. Keswick Island Keswick Island, just off Mackay, has faced stalled development and restricted public access for years. Developer Oasis Forest Ltd purchased the head lease in 2019 but residents were left fuming after the island was put back on the market. The 517 hectare island features 117 hectares of land lease and 25 hectares of marine lease, along with ownership of the island’s ferry and barge. It’s on the market as a pre-approved development site. Great Keppel Island The 1980s party paradise, Great Keppel (Woppa) Island, off the central Queensland coast, is currently battling a feral goat problem. The resort closed in 2008 – 15 years later the state government rescinded the leases from former Great Keppel Island Resort owners, Tower Holdings for non-payment of fees. In 2025, a tender was awarded to a demolition company to clean up abandoned buildings on Great Keppel Island.\n\nStone Island, a 227-acre private isle, will be the “latest and greatest” of Queensland’s paradises, recently hitting the market for £12million along with pre-approval for a brand new resort.\n\nFor more than 30 years, Stone Island was a private and exclusive sanctuary without any tourist facilities, but it’s now positioned to become the Whitsundays’ first new resort since Hamilton Island in the mid-1980s.\n\n\n\nRichard predicts Stone Island will be the beginning of a new generation of island resorts in Queensland.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIt comes with approved plans to build a new resort in the Whitsundays. This would be the first new resort built there since the 1980s.\n\nIt even has a proposal to host Australia’s first gondola from Bowen mainland onto the island paradise."

Gary Hart: Er, no, I wasn’t far from the M1, it’s just where the A1, just where the, the railway line. Operator: Right, okay, it’s just that I’m going to need a better location than that, you’re through to North Yorkshire Police here. Gary Hart: But there’s a train coming. Operator: Oh my God. [Sound of train going past] Gary Hart: F***ing hell, f***ing hell. Operator: Hello? Gary Hart: The train’s just gone straight through the front of me Land Rover. Operator: Right. Gary Hart: It’s … off. Operator: Is, is the train still on the track? Gary Hart: Yes. Operator: It’s carried on going? Gary Hart: Still going. For God’s sake. Operator: Is the car now, is it off the line now? Gary Hart: No, it’s, the Land Rover’s off the line, but there’s a car, the car’s on the line as well. Operator: The car’s still on the line?\n\nChillingly, mid-way through his call to police, the passenger train, which had been travelling at speeds of up to 125mph, hit his Land Rover.\n\n\n\nIn a recording of the call, the screeching of brakes can be heard as Hart tells the operator the train has “gone straight through my Land Rover”.\n\n06:13am – First Smash\n\nThe 04:45 Great North Eastern Railway InterCity 225 service from Newcastle to London had just left York travelling at high speed, smashing into the Land Rover.\n\nThe collision derails the leading undercarriage of the passenger train.\n\nAround 99 people are on board.\n\nThough damaged, the train remains upright and continues down the track — fatally destabilised.\n\n\n\nSeconds Later – Disaster doubles\n\nThe derailed passenger train is deflected into the path of a northbound Freightliner coal train.\n\nInevitably, in a horrific second smash, the two trains collide head-on.\n\n06:14am – Catastrophe\n\nThe force of the collision leaves locomotives and carriages mangled and scattered across both lines and into surrounding fields.\n\nOne coach comes to rest upright in a field. The driving part of the carriage at the front is flattened.\n\nBy the end of the morning, 10 people — including both train drivers — are dead.\n\n\n\nA further 82 are seriously injured.\n\nThree helicopters and a fleet of ambulances ferried the injured to seven different hospitals across Yorkshire, with snow, sleet and freezing weather creating difficult conditions for the rescue efforts.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nIt was later found the Land Rover driver had little sleep the night before and was found guilty of 10 counts of causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nHe was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nShockingly his trial heard he fell asleep at the wheel after staying up all night chatting on the phone to a woman he met on the internet.\n\n\n\nAfter a sleepless night of online flirting, he then embarked on a 145-mile (230km) journey to work at 4.40am.\n\nThe 10 who died\n\nRaymond Robson, 43, GNER senior conductor\n\nPaul Taylor, 42, GNER buffet chef\n\nJohn Weddle, 47, GNER train driver\n\nSteve Dunn, 39, freight train driver\n\nSteve Baldwin, 39, passenger\n\nChris Terry, 30, passenger\n\nAlan Ensor, 44, passenger\n\nBarry Needham, 40, passenger\n\nClive Vigden, 39, passenger\n\nRobert Shakespeare, 43, passenger\n\nOn the morning of Feb 28, 2001, Tony Thompson, a superintendent for the British Transport Police, was on a train into central London to take his post at the Tavistock Place office when he learned of the news of the disaster.\n\nHe reported straight at the HQ for a briefing on the smash before hopping in his boss’s unmarked police car and driving more than 200 miles north to the scene.\n\nHaving worked on other notable train crashes – including 1999’s Ladbroke Grove crash and the Paddington crash in the same year – in his 32 years at BTP, he said this was the “most devastating”.\n\n\n\nHe estimated there were at least 1278 emergency responders at that scene.\n\nThis included 472 police officers, 167 firefighters and 128 ambulance personnel—a testament to the extraordinary multi-agency effort.\n\n‘IT WAS LIKE A WAR SCENE’\n\n“I have been to so many crashes during my career, but this one was different,” Tony, who is now 77, told The Sun.\n\n“There were carriages on either side of the bridge and even one of the Freightliner carriages had passed under the bridge.\n\n“It was like a war scene, you would only really see stuff like this in movies and on TV, but of course this was real, the scale of it was just unbelievable.\n\n\n\n“But from an emergency services point of view, we had a job to do. The physical aspect of the crash was one thing, but the emotional aspect was another.\n\n“First thing first, and what everybody was most desperate to find out was the exact extent of the devastation to human life.\n\n“And amid the chaotic scenes, it was going to be a big task to work that out. This was the most devastating crash I had ever seen; it was totally unprecedented.\n\n“I will never forget standing on the little bridge over the railway line with sort of wreckage scattered around on both sides.\n\n“You certainly appreciate how large and complicated trains are when they are derailed.\n\n\n\nHe continued: “This was described in one of the national papers as a billion to one horror, and that was right.\n\n“The death toll would have been so much worse if the incident hadn’t occurred moments after sunrise.”\n\n\n\nTony was tasked with hosting the press conferences for the disaster.\n\nWhen it was safe to do so he opened a vantage point at the top of the bridge which is where he held them.\n\nBut in addition to that, he had the responsibility of dealing with the victims’ families.\n\nHe said one of the most poignant moments was when he showed one the families around the crash scene.\n\nA boy, 7, left a drawing he had done for his father – intending to give it to him when he next saw him – at the wreckage.\n\n\n\n“I gave them a private moment there, and days later when I inspected [the wreckage], the boy had left his drawing there,” he said.\n\n“Eventually when the site was being cleared I took the picture he had drawn with me and later gave it to their mother.”\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIn total, Tony showed seven of the 10 families that lost their loved ones in the tragedy around the site.\n\nToday (Feb 28) is speaking at a memorial service held at Selby Abbey."

My family has now left the neighbourhood.\n\n“People across Bahrain – because of how small the country is – heard the blast and the fighter jets. People living as far as 20-30 miles away from the base. I hope it is over for now.”\n\n\n\nIn Iraq, rockets have attacked US forces near Erbil Airport, according to security officials.\n\nJordan’s army said it had downed two ballistic missiles targeting the country – Qatar also reportedly intercepted two Iranian missiles and two further waves of attacks.\n\nIn the UAE, one person was killed after Emiratis intercepted Iranian missiles, state media reported.\n\nIt comes as...\n\nAnd witnesses heard a loud bang in Abu Dhabi as the UAE confirmed it has closed its airspace.\n\n\n\nExplosions have been reported in Dubai – including one near the popular marina, which is popular with tourists. Sirens have also sounded in Kuwait.\n\nExplosions were heard in northern Israel after it attacked Iran with strikes that hit near to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s office.\n\nTehran vowed to revenge the attack, before a barrage of missiles fired by Iran at Israel were identified, the Israel Defence Forces said.\n\nIran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard confirmed the strikes, saying that it had launched a “first wave” of drones and missiles targeting Israel.\n\nIt said: “We know the United States as the main factor in today’s aggression, and the Zionist regime is the sponsor of this aggression.\n\n\n\n“We consider all American bases, resources, and interests in the region, space, and land as the legitimate target of the armed forces.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Iran an “existential threat” to his country.\n\n\n\nHe thanked Trump in a statement: “My brothers and sisters, citizens of Israel, a short time ago, Israel and the United States embarked on an operation to remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran.\n\n“I thank our great friend, President Donald Trump, for his historic leadership.”\n\nAir raid sirens rang out in Tel Aviv and the Israeli public have been told to seek shelter.\n\nAn IDF spokesperson said: “A short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel. Defensive systems are operating to intercept the threat.\n\n“In the past few minutes, the Home Front Command has sent a precautionary directive directly to mobile phones in the relevant areas.\n\n\n\n“The public is asked to act responsibly and follow the instructions – they save lives.”\n\nThe strikes come after Donald Trump confirmed he had pulled the trigger on “major combat operations” against Iran – warning Tehran’s “menacing activities directly endanger the US and our allies”.\n\n\n\nIn an eight-minute speech on Truth Social, the US president urged Iranian officials to “lay down your arms” – or “face certain death”.\n\nHe described the attacks as “a noble mission”, saying they were necessary because of Iran’s pursuit of its nuclear programme and long-range missiles that could reach the US.\n\nThe US Department of Defense revealed the strikes on Iran have been named “Operation Epic Fury”.\n\nThe strikes in Iran are expected to last several days, two US officials told NBC News.\n\nTrump told the Washington Post that his main concern is “freedom” for the Iranian people.\n\n\n\nHe added: “I want a safe nation, and that’s what we’re going to have.”\n\nIranian MP Ebrahim Azizi struck a defiant tone in the wake of the incident this morning.\n\n“We warned you!” Azizi wrote in a post on X.\n\nSeparately, hardline Iranian parliamentarian Alaeddin Boroujerdi said there would be no “red lines” in responding to the attack.\n\n“We had previously announced that we would have no red lines. We hope this action marks the beginning of the end of the Zionist regime,” he said in an interview with state TV.\n\n\n\n“Our response will be regret-inducing. We will use all of our capacities. Our rightful and necessary response, especially to the Zionist regime, will be delivered.”\n\nThe UK did not take part in “Operation Epic Fury”, it is understood, and PM Sir Keir Starmer is expected to chair an emergency Cobra meeting today.\n\nA government spokesperson said the UK does “not want to see further escalation into a wider regional conflict”.\n\n\n\nThe statement said: “Our immediate priority is the safety of UK nationals in the region and we will provide them with consular assistance, available 24/7.”\n\n“As part of our longstanding commitments to the security of our allies in the Middle East, we have a range of defensive capabilities in the region, which we have recently bolstered. We stand ready to protect our interests.”\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) Death toll in US-Israeli strike on girls’ school in southern Iran rises to 40 killed, state-run IRNA news agency reports.\n\nThe US-Israeli blitz on Iran killed students, Iranian state Fars News Agency said.\n\nAn Iranian official said earlier: “In today’s attacks by the Zionist regime on Minab city, a girls’ elementary school was targeted and so far 5 students have been martyred.”\n\n\n\nUp to 40 people are now feared to have been killed in the attack on a girls school.\n\nIn the wake of the chaos, all major airlines have axed flights to the region, including to Dubai.\n\nBritish Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, and Wizz Air are among operators who have scrapped flights until further notice.\n\nWizz Air has cancelled all flights to and from Israel, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Amman until March 7.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe airline said: “The airline is closely monitoring developments and remains in ongoing contact with local and international authorities, aviation safety agencies, security authorities, and relevant governmental bodies.”\n\n\n\nBritish Airways cancelled all flights to Tel Aviv and Bahrain until Wednesday, also grounding a service due to fly to Amman today."

            "content": "DONALD Trump has urged Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei to “lay down your arms” – or “face certain death” – after unleashing Operation “Epic Fury” on Iran.\n\nReports indicate that the military action in Iran could last for several days as the US president warned 93 million people that this will be their “only chance” to take over their government for generations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an eight-minute speech on Truth Social, he said: “To the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the armed forces and all of the police, I say tonight that you must lay down your weapons and have complete immunity.\n\n“Or in the alternative, face certain death. So, lay down your arms. You will be treated fairly with total immunity, or you will face certain death.\n\n“Finally, to the great proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Don’t leave your home. Its very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere.\n\n“When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.”\n\nHe described the attacks as “a noble mission”, saying they were necessary because of Iran’s pursuit of its nuclear programme and long-range missiles that could reach the US.\n\nWarning that Iran‘s “menacing activities directly endanger the US, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world,” he said the objective is to defend the US by “eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.”\n\n“For 47 years, Iran’s regime has chanted ‘Death to America’ and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder,” Trump said.\n\n\n\nHe then referenced the US embassy crisis from 1979 and 1981, where 66 hostages were held for 444 days, as well as other incidents involving Iran.\n\n“From Lebanon to Yemen, and Syria to Iraq, the regime has armed, trained and funded terrorist militias that have soaked the earth with blood and guts,” he added, calling Iran “the number one sponsor of terrorism“.\n\n“They can never have nuclear weapons… They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions and we can’t take it anymore.\n\n“Instead, they attempted to rebuild their nuclear programme and to continue developing long-range missiles…\n\n“For this reason the US military is undertaking a massive and ongoing operation to prevent this wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests.\n\n\n\n“We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally obliterated.”\n\nHe later told the Washington Post that he want “a safe nation, and that’s what we’re going to have.”\n\nHis speech was published an hour after the first Israeli missiles hit Tehran, sending civilians running for shelter.\n\nThe US Department of Defence later said the attacks on Iran are running under the name “Epic Fury”.\n\nSo far, attacks on the capital have targeted the ministries of intelligence and defence, the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran and the Parchin military complex.\n\n\n\nMultiple explosions have also been recorded in Karaj, Kom, Tabriz, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Ilam and Lorestan province.\n\nFollow The Sun’s live blog for the latest updates on the US-Israeli attacks on Iran\n\nThe Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said its air force is conducting “a broad strike on a number of military targets” in western Iran.\n\nSeveral reports have warned that the joint US-Israeli operation could last several days.\n\nIn response, Iran launched multiple attacks on US military bases in Bahrain, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar.\n\n\n\nSmoke was seen rising from a Bahrainis US base near its Juffair housing area as the island kingdom said a missile attack targeted the US Navy‘s 5th Fleet headquarters.\n\nAs a result, a number of airlines have cancelled all flights to and from Israel, Bahrain, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Syria, Qatar, and the UAE.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office issued an immediate “shelter in place” warning to all British nationals in the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain.\n\nKey quotes from Trump's speech Trump released an eight-minute speech on Truth Social an hour after the first blasts rocked Tehran. Major combat operations Trump said: “A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran.” Nuclear programme Trump said: “They’ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we cant take it anymore. Instead, they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and to continue developing the long range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe, our troops stationed overseas, and could soon reach the American homeland. Just imagine how emboldened this regime would be if they ever had, and actually were armed with nuclear weapons as a means to deliver their message.” Lay down your arms Trump said: “To the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the armed forces and all of the police, I say tonight that you must lay down your weapons and have complete immunity. Or in the alternative, face certain death. So, lay down your arms. You will be treated fairly with total immunity, or you will face certain death.” Bombs will be dropping Trump said: “Finally, to the great proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Dont leave your home. Its very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere. When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.”\n\n“Due to reported missile attacks, British nationals in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates should immediately shelter in place,” a statement said.\n\n“Remain indoors in a secure location, avoid all travel and follow instructions from the local authorities.”\n\n\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu also confirmed that Israel and the US are carrying out an operation “to remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran”.\n\nHe said: “My brothers and sisters, citizens of Israel, a short time ago, Israel and the US embarked on an operation to remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran…\n\n“This murderous terrorist regime must not be armed with nuclear weapons that would allow it to threaten all of humanity.\n\nIt comes as…\n\n“Our joint action will create the conditions for the courageous Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands.”\n\n\n\nIt is understood the UK did not participate in the strikes and PM Keir Starmer is expected to chair a meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra committee today.\n\nA government spokesperson says the UK does “not want to see further escalation into a wider regional conflict”.\n\nThe statement said: “Our immediate priority is the safety of UK nationals in the region and we will provide them with consular assistance, available 24/7.”\n\n“As part of our longstanding commitments to the security of our allies in the Middle East, we have a range of defensive capabilities in the region, which we have recently bolstered. We stand ready to protect our interests.”\n\n\n\nThe justification for the US and Israel to bomb on Iran will be the subject of intense debate in days ahead.\n\nTrump first threatened to bomb Iran in January during the anti-government uprising and has since only ramped up its war rhetoric.\n\nLast night, he voiced his frustration and impatience over the lack of progress in negotiations to stop Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nAfter having stayed relatively cryptic on his plans earlier in the week, he told reporters as he left the White House on Friday that he is “not happy with the fact that they’re not willing to give us what we have to have.”\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nBefore this morning’s ongoing strikes, he also warned that there was a risk of a prolonged conflict with Iran.\n\n\n\nBut he declined to share his intentions when asked about a possible strike, saying to reporters: “I’d rather not tell you.”"

It’s completely abhorrent.\n\n“Churchill was a great Briton. This Government will always stand up for our values and the perpetrator must be held to account. We’re glad the police have made an arrest.”\n\nThe statue has been targeted by left wing demonstrators several times before.\n\nIn 2020, Black Lives Matter activists crossed out Churchill’s name and wrote “was a racist” on the base.\n\n\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters followed suit later that year and scrawled the same graffiti on the plinth.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nTrans rights demonstrators climbed on top of the sculpture in protest of the Supreme Court’s ruling on the definition of being a woman last year.\n\nIt is now a criminal offence for protesters to climb on the memorial following legislation passed last year."

Randy has implored the authorities to extend their search to this new area – nearly 1,000 miles north of the previously searched region – asserting that the victims' families deserve answers.\n\n\"Finding the aircraft would finally provide them with a measure of clarity and closure,\" he said.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Part of the plane's engine cowling was found at Mossel Bay, South Africa (Image: ATSB/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe disappearance of Flight MH370 remains one of aviation's biggest mysteries, and one with the greatest loss of life.\n\nThe plane departed Kuala Lumpur in the early hours of March 8, 2014, bound for Beijing, China. Approximately 38 minutes after takeoff, the crew made a routine radio transmission to air traffic control, after which no further communication was received from the aircraft.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMinutes later, MH370 vanished from air traffic control radar screens but remained visible on military radar. The aircraft deviated sharply from its intended course, eventually disappearing from Malaysian military radar around 2am local time.\n\nSatellites continued to receive regular \"pings\" from the plane, indicating it was still airborne, until just past 8am.\n\nView 4 Images Data recovered from the captain's own flight simulator suggest he may have planned to crash the plane (Image: Getty Images)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nIt has been speculated that the passengers and crew were intentionally deprived of oxygen, rendering them unconscious as the plane continued on autopilot over the southern Indian Ocean until it eventually ran out of fuel.\n\nThe Australian-led multinational search for MH370 is already the costliest in aviation history, but Randy believes that substantial portions of the proposed search area were overlooked during the initial 2014 search.\n\nHe asserts that, in contrast to the official conclusion from the authorities, it's highly probable that the plane was intentionally plunged into the ocean approximately 680 miles east of Coral Bay in Western Australia."

But her mum and dad became even more terrified when Lettie's skin started turning purple and mottled, and insisted on more tests.\n\nFinally, the family-of-three got answers. Little Lettie had asymptomatic Covid which was triggering acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) – a rare, and severe, brain condition sparked by viral infections, like flu, which causes rapid neurological decline.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

(Image: Jam Press)\n\n\"It's crazy how powerful a mother's intuition is because, not long after that, Lettie went stiff. The best way to describe it is that her little body turned to stone - she was awake and crying but frozen.\"\n\nLettie, who had showed no Covid symptoms, went on to have several tests and scans, as well as an emergency lumbar puncture. Four days after she was admitted to hospital, doctors diagnosed her with ANE, and told to her parents that her brain stem, basal ganglia and cerebellum had been damaged as a result.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJack said: \"It wasn't Covid itself that caused the damage, but her autoimmune system overreacting and turning on itself. We had absolutely no idea she had Covid - the day prior she had been absolutely fine, and even said 'I love you' for the first time. Until Lettie was diagnosed, we had never once heard of ANE either.\n\n\"The doctors explained that it is extremely rare and she had about a 50% chance of survival. The next five days were crucial, as in those days she could go either way. We were absolutely terrified.\n\n\"We couldn't imagine a world without Lettie in it. No doctor could tell us what would happen or how her life would look – we were met with a lot of 'only time will tell' – which though understandable, is very frustrating. We just wanted our little girl back.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Lettie is now regaining her strength after suffering brain damage last year. (Image: Jam Press)\n\nThe poorly tot was placed on a ventilator and prescribed numerous medications, including steroids. She remained in hospital for more than 100 days, and was discharged in November 2025 to have at-home care.\n\nOnce she was stable, Lettie started physiotherapy, occupational, and speech and language therapies to regain some of the functions she lost due to the brain damage, which affected her movement, muscle control, ability to communicate and eat.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAt the moment, the toddler is unable to move independently, though is showing small signs of incredible progress, including being able to hold objects with one hand and occasionally lifting her head. For now, she remains bed-bound and requires a specialist mobility buggy to get around.\n\nJack and Zuzanna are cherishing the progress milestones and have been overjoyed to see her become more vocal, babbling and giggling at times and even being able to say 'mama' and 'dada'.\n\nWhile the future is unknown, they are staying optimistic. \"We try to take every day as it comes - no expectations, just simply celebrating the little wins, Jack said. \"Some days are harder than others.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"It's heartbreaking seeing such a smart, independent little girl become so dependent. She gets really frustrated often crying when she tries to speak but nothing comes out.\n\n\"Some days it really hurts watching other children grow up and live a full life because we know she deserves that as well, and it feels like although she's alive, her life has been cut short.\n\n\"But she shows us daily that she is a little fighter and we believe she can achieve a lot. Our goal now is to spread awareness of ANE – and how dangerous and sudden it is, how quickly it can change or even take a life.\""

Introducing an established pet dog to a new animal sibling can be tricky, especially if they’re known to be reactive.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAn eight-year-old husky named Wiley saw his owner Sally Compton get attacked by a dog at a dog park when he was just three-years-old and it led to him becoming reactive to new dogs, especially if they were male.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nStill, despite not being a big fan of other dogs, Wiley’s owners worried he was bored and hoped to introduce him to a sibling.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe couple felt “nervous” about bringing a new dog home due to Wiley’s reactivity, so they took him with them to the shelter to meet any potential matches. That way, if they found a dog they liked and connected with, they “could try and introduce them”.\n\nThey met a one-year-old German shepherd husky mix who had been at the shelter for five months and decided to do a “soft introduction”, taking the new dog to meet Wiley while he sat in the back of their car.\n\nInstantly, both dogs’ tails started wagging and they put their noses close together to sniff one another.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAfter that, the couple “took them to a Sniffspot so they could meet off-leash in a controlled environment”.\n\nIn a TikTok video documenting the entire encounter, Sally explained: “I was so nervous that he was going to be aggressive but I couldn’t believe what I saw next.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“They almost immediately started playing and chasing each other, I literally had not seen Wiley get along so quickly with another dog in years.”\n\nThe footage captured the two dogs running around together in the snow and playfully jumping up together.\n\nSally added: “We brought her home the same day and the rest is history.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe couple named their new addition Disco. In the caption accompanying the clip, Sally elaborated: “The story of introducing my reactive husky Wiley to our new rescue, Disco.\n\n“Renting a private dog park for the introduction helped a ton with letting us know that they were meant to be best friends.”\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek, Sally said: “I couldn’t believe it but they immediately started playing together, and she loved chasing Wiley. I hadn’t seen him play or run like that in several years. We decided it was a perfect fit.”\n\nArticle continues below\n\nUpon taking Disco home, the dogs’ bond continued to grow and flourish.\n\nSally added: “They immediately continued playing together in the backyard. It has been a year since then and she has definitely taken up the role of annoying little sister.\n\n“She always wants to be around him and constantly nibbles his neck, licks his mouth and sleeps next to him. He tolerates it and acts grumpy, but we can tell that he is a lot happier and more energetic with her around.”"

He was reportedly attacked with a 3ft-long iron bar at a recycling workshop inside the jail.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNow a prison source has revealed Huntley's chilling prophesy saying he knew \"they'll get me sooner or later\".

There had been intelligence reports about an attack. And inmates had told him outright that he was going to get ‘done’. So Huntley knew it was coming and had told relatives and the few friends he has about his fears. He even said that if he was killed, he wanted it to be as quick and painless as possible.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Huntley has been in prison long enough to know that any attack on him would be a severe one, and possibly fatal.

He was worried before the attack that the protection he had been receiving had been diminished recently, there will be questions asked about what officers were doing when this happened.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHuntley had recently begun working in a prison workshop and using the gym - changes that brought him into closer contact with prisoners who might wish to target him.\n\nView 4 Images Anthony Russell has been named as the suspect in the attack on Huntley\n\nSpeaking with the Chronicle, the anonymous source alleges Huntley was being held on an 'enhanced' wing at HMP Frankland, where inmates are kept separate from the general prison population.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"He is sort of protected in prison, but so are the likes of Levi Belfield and Wayne Couzens,\" the insider explained. \"They all get moved around together. You could never put him in normal prison population.\"\n\nOn Friday evening, Huntley was reportedly given a 5% chance of survival after his head was 'split in two' during the assault.\n\nToday a Durham Constabulary spokesperson said: “The 52-year-old man remains in hospital in a serious condition, there have been no changes overnight.”"

            "content": "Conor Benn to face former world champion on same card as Tyson Fury's return to boxing - as first bout since Eddie Hearn split is revealed\n\nConor Benn is set for a return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after agreeing to share top billing with Tyson Fury and Arslan Makhmudov and fight Regis Prograis in his first outing for new promotion Zuffa Boxing.\n\nThe British fighter announced his split with long-time promoter Eddie Hearn last week after 10 years of working together, with Benn instead joining Hearn's rival Dana White's fledgling company in an eight-figure deal.\n\nHearn revealed that he was 'devastated' by the defection, not least because he stood by the boxing dynasty scion throughout his ordeal over two failed drug tests in 2022.\n\nBenn previously fought in north London when he faced off with Chris Eubank Jr last year, with the fighter gaining his revenge after first being defeated by Eubank Jr in their initial meeting at the stadium.\n\nHis match-up with US light welterweight Prograis is set to take place on Saturday April 11, with their main event coming ahead of Fury's return to the ring after his retirement last year.\n\nThe evening is also set to be Netflix's first-ever live broadcast, following a number of events shown from the United States - including Anthony Joshua's meeting with Jake Paul last December - by the streaming giant.\n\nConor Benn will fight Regis Prograis on April 11 on the same card as the returning Tyson Fury\n\nFormer world champion Prograis last faced off with Jack Catterall on British soil at the Co-op Live in October 2024, with the Louisiana native losing to the Englishman by unanimous decision.\n\nBenn's decision to desert Hearn cast ripples through the boxing world, with Frank Warren sharing his comment in the form of a quote first made by former US President Harry S. Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

            "content": "Frank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

It was a bit lively earlier. I don’t have space to express my feelings about that idiot Trump. No show today.\n\n'You’ll be in the capable hands of our colleagues in London. Thoughts & prayers for everyone in our region. Ramadan Kareem.'\n\nHis comment came after the UK government's foreign office had issued a stark warning.\n\n'Due to reported missile attacks, British nationals in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates should immediately shelter in place,' came the instruction.\n\n'Remain indoors in a secure location, avoid all travel and follow instructions from the local authorities.'\n\nRichard Keys was forced off air after Brits abroad were warned to take shelter\n\nSmoke rises in Iran after a bomb strike from the US and Israel with conflict escalating\n\nKeys, who has lived in Qatar for 13 years while working as a presenter for the sports channel, has been told by the network that his contract will not be renewed when it expires at the end of the football season but is still working up until that point.\n\nOn Saturday morning, however, he was unable to take to the airwaves, with the frightening instability in the Middle East causing chaos in the region.\n\nThe US and Israel launched an attack on Iran, with President Donald Trump warning 'major combat operations' are taking place, as they aim for regime change.\n\nIsrael say Iran have launched retaliatory strikes of their own and explosions have been heard in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait.\n\nKeys and beIN are based in Qatar and the presenter made it clear what he thought of the military action, calling Trump an 'idiot'.\n\nIn a video statement to the world, Trump had earlier urged the Iranian people to rise up and topple the clerical government.\n\n'When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations,' he declared.\n\nHe also said the Iranian army would be given 'immunity' if they laid down arms - vowing that they would face 'certain death' if they chose the alternative.\n\nKeys called US president Donald Trump an 'idiot' after he was forced off air\n\nEarlier this year, the Iranian government killed 6,480 during widespread protests against their rule. Trump said the government 'would pay a big price' and promised help is on the way.\n\nThe ramifications of the conflict and possible escalation are still not known but the impact on the region is already significant, with Keys' no-show just a microscopic example.\n\nThe controversial broadcaster and long-time colleague Andy Gray, 70, have resided in Doha since 2013, two years after they both lost their jobs at Sky Sports in the wake of a sexism scandal.\n\nA series of sexist remarks made by Keys and Gray about female assistant referee Sian Massey were picked up and leaked in January 2011 when they thought their microphones were off.\n\nGray was sacked by Sky Sports after a video showing him making inappropriate comments to presenter Charlotte Jackson was released. Keys resigned from his £500,000-a-year role shortly afterwards.\n\nKeys, 68, is set to move in permanently with his 37-year-old wife, Lucie Rose, with whom he has been in a long-distance relationship since they secretly married in a private £20,000 ceremony in Devon in June 2023.\n\nHis son Joshua and daughter Jemma, who was previously one of Lucie Rose's closest friends before her romantic involvement with Keys, did not attend the wedding.\n\nThe presenter split with Julia Keys after 36 years of marriage when news of his shock relationship emerged in 2016, with his ex-wife revealing how the affair 'devastated' her as she recovered from thyroid cancer and also wrecked the lives of their two children.\n\nLucie Rose, above, was previously one of Keys' daughter's best friends before their romance\n\nKeys (centre) pictured with his ex-wife Julia (left) and their daughter Jemma (right)\n\nJulia said the affair ruined the career of her Hollyoaks actress daughter as she spiralled into alcoholism and depression. Jemma also faced legal action over a string of abusive texts she sent to Lucie Rose before charges were dropped by prosecutors.\n\nSince joining beIN Sports, Keys and Gray have fronted coverage of the Premier League and Champions League across 24 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, while also presenting for the network at the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\n\nIt is also claimed that the broadcasting pair could quit live football presenting altogether when they return to the UK.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Richard Keys told the Mail: 'Richard decided some months ago that, after 13 great years, the time had come to leave beIN with Andy. Following his decision it was mutually agreed that his final broadcasts for the channel would be in May this year.'"

            "content": "The Last Dance: Why the penny has FINALLY dropped for Andy Farrell, how he can now BREAK Ireland's 40-year World Cup hoodoo and what the future holds for our GREATEST EVER coach post-Australia 2027...\n\nIRELAND head coach Andy Farrell is entitled to feel a degree of bemusement around the punditry and coverage of this Six Nations campaign.\n\nDespite the considerable credit he had built up over the years, there was a fair whack of criticism flung his way following the opening night hammering in France, including justifiable question marks over his long-term planning and loyalty to the old guard.\n\nBut Farrell got little credit when he then ripped up the script with his team selection to face Italy, leaving out established frontliners and rolling the dice on promising newcomers. The result was a surge of energy through the Ireland squad.\n\nA SENSE OF JEOPARDY\n\nAll of a sudden, there was a genuine sense of jeopardy, a brutal realisation that, no matter how big your reputation or how storied your career, if you do not perform to the standards expected, you are out.\n\nIcon: Andy Farrell is adored by Irish rugby supporters but the Ireland head coach was on the receiving end of heavy criticism after two games of this Six Nations Championship\n\nThis had not been the case previously on Farrell’s watch, with the general policy revolving around running the same established names almost regardless of form, an approach that persevered even after the 2023 World Cup failure.\n\nIt was a defiant change of direction, an era-altering policy shift, yet it was largely dismissed as ‘rotation’ for the perceived lesser challenge of facing the Italians at home.\n\nFor some, this correspondent included, the subsequent victory over Italy was hugely positive.\n\nYes, there were lots of errors and areas to improve in a win that could be more readily described as ‘nervy’ than ‘convincing’, but Italy are a decent side now and Ireland digging themselves out of a hole with a bunch of new faces catching the eye was a major plus.\n\nOn the front foot: Farrell did not get enough recognition for his bold selection calls against Italy\n\nOr so we thought…\n\nIt quickly became apparent that this was a minority opinion as the widespread reaction across was doom and gloom – with little recognition of what Farrell was, belatedly, trying to do in terms of widening options.\n\n‘TERMINAL DECLINE’\n\nPhrases like ‘terminal decline’ and ‘irreversible recession’ abounded after the Italy game and the general consensus was that Ireland’s efforts to extricate themselves from the deep trough they now found themselves in ‘could take years’.\n\nIt took Farrell a week.\n\nWhen he reinstated a clutch of his tried-and-trusted for the (on paper) daunting trip to Twickenham, they returned to a side re-energised by the Italy reshuffle and ruthlessly determined to prove their worth, driven by the unsettling knowledge that their places were no longer guaranteed.\n\nThe result was a performance of ferocious intensity that proved far too much for a brittle England side, still assailed with doubt after their shock Murrayfield humiliation.\n\nToo much: Ireland played with far greater intensity than England in their Twickenham win\n\nIt was a euphoric occasion for Irish rugby and, suddenly, the same heads who had been talking about the dark days being here to stay, did a 180 with frothy talk of ‘rebirth’ and ‘rejuvenation’.\n\nThere is a tendency in modern media – driven by the internet’s insatiable demand for clip-worthy reaction, and over-reaction – to get mired in the immediate.\n\nThere is also a lemming-like, ‘we are all individuals’ aspect to rugby analysis where nearly everyone dives frantically for the consensus and starts parrotting the same phrase du jour along the way.\n\nThis month it was ‘intent’ after Farrell questioned the lack of it from his players following their Paris pummelling.\n\nAs soon as he said it, the word ‘intent’ was being sprinkled excitedly across Irish rugby analysis, as though pundits had been gifted a secret sauce to use at will.\n\nEuphoria: Caelan Doris and Tadhg Beirne celebrate at the final whistle in Twickenham\n\nFarrell must be shaking his head at it all.\n\nNow, post Twickenham, the analysis has shifted to the head coach’s next career move, with stories linking Farrell to a return to his old haunt of Saracens in English rugby on a whopping €1.2million contract.\n\nThis has led to a cacophony of calls for Farrell to be handed an extended Ireland contract to keep at the helm for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnother knee-jerk, instant reaction to breaking events when it would be better to step back and assess the overall picture.\n\nTHE PENNY FINALLY DROPS\n\nFarrell’s time with Ireland has been a remarkable story of progression and success – with the obvious exception of the World Cup.\n\nAnd now, finally, it appears as though the penny has dropped and he is viewing everything through the prism of next year’s World Cup – because the rhetoric from Farrell, and his assistants, is radically different to what we have heard before.\n\nAfter the 2023 disappointment, it was ‘as we were’ with the message that the ‘journey continues’ and, while Farrell oversaw a thumping win over France in Marseille and landed a Six Nations, it all seemed a little ‘after the Lord Mayor’s show’.\n\nThis Six Nations feels a whole lot different, the right attitude seems to have been adopted (namely that this tournament is a means to a World Cup end) as Ireland continue to assess options for down the road.\n\nEven in the euphoria of the win over England last weekend, Farrell impressed hugely with his calm, bigger picture observations.\n\nMindset shift: Farrell has realised the need to look down the road and broaden his options\n\n‘I didn’t care whether we won or lost today, just whether we grew as a group because we know where we want to go,’ he said afterwards.\n\nIrish rugby has been waiting to hear those words from a head coach for 15 years.\n\nThe message, and mind shift, appears to have been embraced by everyone in camp, based on Johnny Sexton’s observations when asked about the contest for his old No 10 jersey between Jack Crowley, Sam Prendergast, Harry Byrne and Ciaran Frawley.\n\n‘All the criticism from previous World Cup cycles is that we did not develop guys and we have relied too heavily on one player in some positions,’ said Sexton, referencing the over-dependence on his own role at the 2015, 2019 and 2023 World Cups.\n\n‘So, we are doing it a different way now.’\n\nAmen to that.\n\nTHE LAST DANCE\n\nWhatever way you look at it, Farrell has been a phenomenally good coach for Ireland since coming on board as Joe Schmidt’s defensive coordinator in 2016.\n\nBy the time of the World Cup in Australia next year, the Englishman will have been 11 years working for the IRFU and living in this country, where he and his family are known to be very happily settled.\n\nHowever, every coach, no matter how talented, popular or successful they are, has a shelf life, and when his contract expires next year, it feels like a natural conclusion to this Irish rugby chapter.\n\nThe concern is that, if the IRFU were to make that decision and announce it later this year, there is the danger of Farrell becoming a ‘lame duck’ coach.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that this is what happened to Joe Schmidt in 2019 after Farrell was announced as the Kiwi’s successor a year out.\n\nThe New Zealander, who had been the most influential and transformative head coach in Irish rugby history up to that point, had difficulties selling his message in his final year as players began to gravitate towards his successor.\n\nHowever, there is less chance of that happening this time around.\n\nFor Farrell and the core of the squad he has been loyal to over the past five years, it’s ‘Last Dance’ time – the final chance to crack the World Cup code.\n\nThat incentive would be hugely motivating and more than enough to keep Farrell and the likes of Tadhg Furlong, Andrew Porter, Tadhg Beirne, Josh van der Flier, Jamison Gibson-Park and Garry Ringrose right on message through to the conclusion of Australia 2027.\n\nDown and out: Eddie O'Sullivan was given a new deal prior to the 2007 World Cup only for a highly-rated Ireland side to crash out at the pool stages with the coach gone not long after\n\nThe alternative approach, and one that has widespread support, is to hand Farrell another deal to keep him on board for yet another World Cup cycle – but Ireland have been burned this way before, most famously in 2007.\n\nThat summer, prior to the World Cup in France, the IRFU extended Eddie O’Sullivan’s contract and when the announcement was made to the squad, the story goes that, rather than the standing ovation which had been possibly expected, there was an awkward shuffling of feet and half-hearted murmurings of congratulations.\n\nIt was reflective of a bubbling desire for change, amid fringe frustration at O’Sullivan’s loyalty-driven selection policy, and when Ireland crashed horribly at that tournament, there was an enormous backlash against the contract extension and the head coach was gone within a matter of months.\n\nThere are obvious differences between the O’Sullivan landscape then and Farrell’s now – not least the English man’s focus on keeping a happy camp.\n\nBut, when you look at how a Farrell contract extension plays out, it does not make much sense.\n\nIf Ireland did manage to finally have a successful World Cup and reach a first semi-final or go further, it would be a tough mental challenge to start from scratch again on yet another four-year cycle, especially with the complication of the Lions tour to New Zealand in 2029 which Farrell is known to be keen to lead.\n\nAlternatively, if Ireland bombed out yet again at the quarter-final stage, or earlier, there would be a massive outcry for change and Farrell’s position would surely be untenable, regardless of past achievements.\n\nSuccession plan: Ronan O'Gara would be the ideal man to take over from Farrell next year\n\nFar better to take the ‘Last Dance’ approach, confirm Farrell’s departure after the World Cup, announce his replacement – ideally Ronan O’Gara – and pour everything into going out on a high.\n\nPERFECT ENDING\n\nAs for Farrell’s next move, he is not short of options. Saracens have hotly denied any approach or €1.2m contract offer but those words can be taken with a large dollop of salt – this is Sarries we are talking about, after all.\n\nEngland would also appear a highly plausible option; the RFU blazers watching Farrell’s team dismantle Steve Borthwick’s side in Twickenham last weekend would surely have been thinking how to break the bank to get the proud Englishman back on board – and few here could quibble if they did.\n\nWhatever happens, the good news for Ireland is that Farrell appears to have got his focus back in a big way following the drift post-2023.\n\nThat bodes extremely well for next year and what better way for Ireland’s greatest coach to step off the stage than by ending this 40-year World Cup hoodoo?\n\n\n\nThe perfect ending."

'Then maybe a month ago I was dreaming of fighting with Manchester City and Arsenal for the title.\n\n'We are having a great season and I want to tell our fans now that we need them.

A report in The Guardian this week claimed the 29-year-old is keen to return to United's starting XI once his loan comes to an end in May.\n\nAnd his countryman Geremi has shed light on Onana's state of mind.\n\nAndre Onana is eager to fight for his place in United's starting XI when his loan spell ends\n\nSpeaking to Telecom Asia via The Sun, Geremi said: 'Listen, I know Andre very well and during his time at United there were a lot of things that were not right.\n\n'It wasn't just him. And believe me, with the arrival of Michael Carrick, things are looking good for everyone, including him.\n\n'He is clearly talented and his gifts are rare. The next thing is for him to go back there and fight for his spot.\n\n'Andre has always excelled when faced with a challenge. He thrives when he's given a fair chance to prove himself.'\n\nThe former Chelsea star added that football's biggest clubs need big characters, and says Andre needs that same mentality to thrive at United.\n\nHe said: 'In my career I enjoyed playing in teams with big ambitions and big personalities.\n\n'If I had a few bad games, there was always someone knocking on the manager's door asking for a chance.\n\n'That meant I had to stand up, be counted and not walk away.\n\nHis replacement, Senne Lammens, has seriously impressed since joining the Red Devils\n\n'But that is for Andre to decide.'\n\nShould Carrick stay at the club beyond this season, Onana will have to seriously impress to dislodge Lammens from the team.\n\nAfter the Everton win, Carrick said of the Belgian: 'You want a goalkeeper to be reliable, trustworthy and, instead of creating the chaos, you want him to take the chaos away and calm things down.\n\n\n\n'I think Senne is that. He's quite quiet at times and unassuming but he's got a real steeliness. To step in, it's a big role – for some.'"

            "content": "'I'm always considered the dumbest person in the room': Football WAG reveals what life is REALLY like being married to her superstar husband - despite boasting a very successful sporting career herself\n\nThe reality of being married to a professional footballer can be difficult. Wives and girlfriends – better known as WAGs – are constantly fighting to prove they are more than just trophy wives.\n\nThey are persistently put in a box, and it's not one that they always enjoy. Yes, WAGs are known for what their husbands do on the football pitch, but they have their own lives too.\n\nTake Victoria Beckham, for example. A megastar in the music world, winning five Brit Awards with the Spice Girls. She was, and still is, far from just 'David's wife'; she has her own uber-successful career in her own right.\n\nNot only this, but being the partner of a professional player who is constantly travelling around the country, or even the world, to do their job, can feel very lonely. Louise Redknapp once stated that she felt 'invisible' at times while married to former Tottenham and Liverpool star Jamie, and ultimately, the pair got divorced in 2017.\n\nIt's fair to say that being a WAG is not always as glamorous as it looks.\n\nLisa Muller, who is married to Bayern Munich legend Thomas Muller, has now opened up on how she gets treated being the wife of one of German football's greatest-ever forwards. Spoiler alert: it's not all sunshine and rainbows.\n\nThomas Muller's wife Lisa (right) has claimed she no longer cares what people think of her\n\nLisa, 36, has a somewhat successful sporting career herself as a professional dressage rider, winning a variety of competitions, including the Stuttgart Masters in 2019.\n\nOver the years, though, as her husband racked up a series of accolades, people often saw her as just his wife, not as the athlete she is.\n\nThis used to frustrate her hugely, and she would often feel the need to prove herself to banish those views from people's minds. These days, though, she places no value on what people think and just lives her life.\n\nSpeaking at a campaign event via Bild, Lisa said: 'At first, I tried for a long time to fight against it and say: I'm more than that, I can ride. Now I don't care anymore.'\n\nThomas and Lisa met in 2007, while the former was still in the Bayern academy, looking to make a name for himself.\n\nThey were only 18 years of age when they first came across each other, but they didn't hang back, getting married only two years later.\n\nThe majority of the Mullers' marriage has been spent in Bavaria, where Thomas spent 17 years playing for the Bundesliga's most successful club, and Lisa regularly rides.\n\nHowever, the dynamic of their marriage changed due to Thomas's move to MLS side Vancouver Whitecaps. Lisa opted to stay in Germany despite the move, with the pair now living 5,200 miles and over a 10-hour flight apart.\n\nShe continued: 'As an athlete, he knows how much I live for my sport. As an athlete, I know how much he lives for his.\n\n'The decision to continue working on two continents wasn't easy for us. We wouldn't leave our stud farm unattended for a year.'\n\nLisa has always made it clear that she won't throw away her career by moving away from Germany, just because of potential opportunities for Muller.\n\nLisa has her own successful career as a dressage rider and she also owns a farm with Thomas\n\nShe has too much going on in her homeland. Not only does she regularly ride and work at her own stables, but alongside Thomas, she has a rather interesting entrepreneurial venture.\n\nThe couple own a company called EU Insemination Station, a breeding farm for their horses, and it's fair to say it brings in a more than healthy amount of money on the side.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, rumours were ramping up that Thomas was close to joining Manchester United from Bayern, which would have been a huge move at the time. However, Louis van Gaal has since said that Lisa blocked the move due to her desire to stay in Bavaria.\n\nVan Gaal said of Lisa's involvement: 'In 2015, it would have been possible if his wife had been a little more open to a transfer abroad.\n\n'At least that was the reason Thomas gave my assistant Marcel Bout, who had had all the conversations with him, why the transfer had been rejected.'\n\nOutside of riding, Lisa is trying to expand her horizons, challenging herself by getting involved in politics in Germany.\n\nLast year, Lisa, who hails from the Miesbach district, is now part of the Christian Social Union party and has completed an internship with the Bavarian State Parliament. She was even asked if she would consider running as a candidate for their next election.\n\nHowever, she declined because, in her own words, she was ‘too much of a chicken'.\n\nDespite all of this, Lisa still feels there are people who downplay her intellect before even having a conversation with her.\n\nLisa has always made it clear that she won't throw away her career by moving away from Germany\n\n'It's sometimes quite amusing,' she added. 'I'm always considered the dumbest person in the room.\n\n'Sometimes it's nice to be considered the silly one, then you can impress people more when they talk to you.'\n\nPolitics will continue to play a big part in Lisa's life moving forward, even when Thomas inevitably moves back from his venture across the pond.\n\n'The CSU is my political home,' she has told Antenne Bayern radio station, and in the future she may just turn from party member to candidate.\n\n\n\nThen there can't be anybody who can call her the so-called 'dumbest in the room'."

Being blunt about everything that everyone thought wasn't right,' he added.\n\n'If you're five or six weeks in and you think he's not delivering, okay, then you have a point. But to throw out such strong opinions based on his first half hour, I thought, was inappropriate.'\n\nAfter Sterling's cameo appearance last Sunday, one Instagram account called FootballPark, boasting almost 100k followers, wrote that the ex-England international looked like 'Bambi on Ice' and even suggested he should consider retiring.\n\nThe author, who was by no means the only social media account ripping into the footballer, posted: 'Raheem Sterling's debut for Feyenoord was not exactly a success story – in fact, it looked like a veritable disaster from the Dutch club's point of view.\n\n'The English winger looked like Bambi on ice. On a downward spiral since 2022, lacking motivation, and seemingly unable to play under anyone who isn't named Pep Guardiola, Sterling is well and truly into his twilight years. Is it time to hang the boots up once and for all?'\n\nSterling's former Manchester City team-mate Jack Grealish jumped in to defend the 31-year-old star online, taking issue with the post.\n\n\n\n'What a f*****g stupid Instagram post man what's wrong with you guys. Guy hasn't played or trained for so long. Ppl like u guys is what wrong with the world. Have some respect,' he wrote."

Ben Youngs, Freddie Steward and Jack van Poortvliet all grew up in East Anglia yet the area has no professional club representation.\n\nSeason ticket renewals for Norwich City are among the highest in England because it is a remote part of the country which has little other professional sport on offer.\n\nThe RFU and Prem Rugby should be banging down the door of Sir James Dyson, the British inventor who grew up in the area but currently pumps his millions into the jersey sponsorship of Bath.\n\nBirmingham, Yorkshire, Liverpool and the south coast are other areas that rugby should be trying to tap into as part of the long-term plan to grow the sport.\n\nScrapping promotion and relegation is a tough pill to swallow, although the gulf between the first and second division has become virtually unbridgeable.\n\nEnglish rugby's overhaul should be used as a springboard for expansion in untapped counties\n\nWorcester Warriors and London Irish are primed to apply for one of the 12 top-flight franchises and return to the PREM, having been expelled over financial difficulties in 2022 and 2023\n\n28 CLUBS HAVE PLAYED IN THE PREMIERSHIP - WHO'S NEXT? Team Seasons Bath 36 (7 titles) Gloucester 36 Leicester Tigers 36 (11 titles) Harlequins 35 (2 titles) Wasps 35 (6 titles) Northampton Saints 31 (2 titles) Saracens 31 (6 titles) Sale Sharks 30 (1 title) London Irish 28 Bristol Bears 25 Newcastle Red Bulls 24 (1 title) Worcester Warriors 16 Exeter Chiefs 13 (2 titles) Orrell 10 Leeds Tykes 8 Nottingham, West Hartlepool 5 Birmingham Moseley, Rosslyn Park 4 Bedford Blues 3 Liverpool St Helens, London Scottish, London Welsh, Richmond, Rotherham Titans, Rugby Lions, Waterloo 2 Coventry 1\n\nThe model is broken and ring-fencing with the option for expansion offers a happy medium. A pathway for ambitious clubs remains (at least in theory), while new investors can be confident they are not throwing money into a black hole.\n\nAfter the RFU council approved the changes yesterday, Exeter Chiefs owner Tony Rowe told Daily Mail Sport that investor confidence immediately spiked.\n\nNow 77, Rowe is speaking to new investors and negotiations can now advance with financiers in America. ‘We’re talking to a couple of investors and one of them wanted to wait to hear what happened this week,’ he said.\n\n‘English rugby is desperate for money but it’s difficult to find investment because of the worry of relegation. Red Bull didn’t just come along and say, “we don’t mind if we get relegated”. They were banking on this decision.\n\n‘I’m certain we’ll see more big names invest in English rugby now. Money dictates where sport goes and if somebody wants to pay handsomely to change the name of Exeter I have no doubt that might happen.\n\n‘We’re in the market for a partner investor. It’s going to cost you somewhere between £50m and £100millon to get a Prem side together with a stadium. I’m sure there are people out there interested in doing it.\n\n‘There are talks about rugby at the new stadium in Birmingham. Yorkshire has more rugby clubs than any other county but none of them perform at the top level so it would be nice to see another club there. Maybe someone in the North West. We want people to come into the Prem and first we want to get back to 12 clubs.’\n\nThe likes of Ollie Chessum, Freddie Steward and Fraser Dingwall have all played in the second division and the competition must not be set up to fail. It is key the chances of promotion remain genuine if teams meet the relevant criteria.\n\nSeason ticket renewals for Norwich City are among the highest in the country because it is a remote part of the country which has little other professional sport on offer\n\nYorkshire has not had a Premiership team since 2011, when Leeds Carnegie went down - a year later, they sold their P shares in the competition to Exeter Chiefs\n\nThe perfect scenario is more big hitters enter the market and rugby’s ecosystem grows. We could see more investment into playing squads, stronger academies and a trickle-down effect on the Champ.\n\n\n\nWe have seen London Irish, Wasps and Worcester fold under the financial pressures of professional sport but, after years of turmoil, there is an opportunity for new shoots to appear off the beaten path."

A new test will be introduced from June to close a loophole.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe new F1 season kicks off in Melbourne next weekend, and the build-up has seen controversy as rival teams claimed Mercedes had found a way around engine compression ratio limits. The compression ratio limit has been reduced from 18.0 under the previous ruleset to 16.0 as part of F1's biggest regulation changes ever.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAt present, measurements are only taken when the engine is not running at full temperature. Mercedes are claimed to be exploiting that, giving them a competitive advantage.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe FIA has announced that a new test will take place from June 1, ensuring the ratio is tested at an engine ambient temperature of 130 degrees.\n\nF1's engine manufacturers, Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull-Ford, Audi and Honda, unanimously approved 'some aspects of the amendments' according to the FIA.\n\nF1 driver update after losing control in terrifying crash as marshals rush to help READ MORE :\n\nToto Wolff reacts to F1 Mercedes engine vote as Max Verstappen fires warning READ MORE :\n\n\"The modifications to the technical regulations follow the pre-season tests in Barcelona and Bahrain and extensive feedback received from drivers and teams,\" said the FIA.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"A significant effort has been invested in finding a solution to the topic of the compression ratio. This parameter, which was one of the key fundamental targets of these regulations in order to attract newcomers to the sport, is limited in the regulations to 16:1, measured in cold conditions.\n\n\"The FIA has worked to find a compromise solution which determines that the compression ratio will be controlled in both hot and cold conditions from June 1 2026, and subsequently only in the operating conditions (130deg C) from 2027 onwards.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

And so I don't see it that way. I see a chance to put a team together and basically be knocking at the edge and get another one or get a chance at a another one.\n\n\"It runs that way in my view. ... Make no mistake about it now, if you told me I could, because I've done a lot of hitchhiking in my life. ... I'd start here with you right now and hitchhike back to Dallas to win a Super Bowl.\"\n\nAfter a 7-9-1 finish in 2025, Jones promised change. One change will be the team's approach to free agency.\n\nThe Cowboys have not relied heavily on free agency in years, choosing to pick their spots to shore up holes on the roster with cost-effective players.\n\n\"I would bet that we will spend more money in free agency than we have,\" Jones said.\n\nTo do so, the Cowboys will first have to create salary cap room. Well over the $301.2 million cap that was set Friday, they will restructure the contracts of quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and left guard Tyler Smith, which will create $66 million of room.\n\nJones said the Cowboys will rework the contracts of defensive tackles Kenny Clark, Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa, who are scheduled to count around $63 million against the cap. With Clark and Williams, the Cowboys can look to add voidable years to their contracts then restructure that way.\n\n\"I want you to know that the only way to push more [out] is for me to go borrow some of my future, OK?\" Jones said. \"Expect me to go borrow some of my future.\"\n\nTo Jones, it goes beyond his personal Super Bowl wishes.\n\n\"I look at where we are with Dak and I look at where he is in his career. And I look at some of the pluses that we have on our front and what we think we can do there. And what we can do with [George] Pickens and Lamb and what we can do with our running back that we just signed [Javonte Williams],\" Jones said. \"And so all of those things I want to do everything we possibly can to stop somebody and to basically win some third downs more than we did last year. And so I think that would be the area that you would see me bust the budget. Where you would see me do that is what we're doing defensively.\n\n\"And I would expect anybody that's a Cowboy fan or a critic of the Cowboys to say, 'Duh, that's not hard to see, Jerry, to do.' But I guess what I'm doing is saying, yes, I intend to do that if given the opportunity.\"\n\nThe Cowboys defense finished at or near the bottom of the league in yards and points allowed in 2025. Christian Parker has been hired as the new defensive coordinator, and Jones acknowledged the need for more than just one or two new players, while also saying players that were on the defense in 2025 will be better in 2026 \"because the situation has changed.\"\n\nWith two first-round picks, the Cowboys have an opportunity to add more talent to their defense. Jones would not rule out the possibility of making trades, like the additions of Williams from the New York Jets and Clark from the Green Bay Packers for Micah Parsons.\n\n\"I don't know that I'd expect it but we have the ammunition to be good at it,\" Jones said. \"And I wouldn't hesitate to be good at it if it will help our team and help the timeline that we're talking about.\"\n\nNow 83, Jones was introspective at times during the hourlong meeting with reporters. His resolve to win a championship is strong.\n\n\"It's every bit the prize of anything I have, with the exception of family and your love for family,\" Jones said. \"I guess what I would say is make no mistake about it, I don't have a higher priority than to go and win a Super Bowl.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- After Denver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic tumbled to the Paycom Center court early in the fourth quarter Friday night, he determined that he needed to react to what he considered a dirty tactic by Oklahoma City Thunder guard Luguentz Dort.\n\nA chippy game between rivals who faced off in a seven-game series in last season's Western Conference semifinals escalated into a heated confrontation at that point, resulting in Dort's ejection and double technical fouls on Jokic and Oklahoma City center Jaylin Williams.\n\nThe fracas began when Dort appeared to trip Jokic as he ran up the court with 8:03 remaining in the fourth quarter. Dort backed into Jokic and stuck out his right foot, knocking down the big man, who quickly pounced to his feet to angrily confront Dort.\n\n\"It's an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction,\" Jokic said after the Nuggets' 127-121 overtime loss to the defending champions. \"There is no such thing -- I think there's not supposed to be those things on a basketball floor. So, it was just an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction by me.\"\n\nAfter Jokic chest-bumped Dort, Williams rushed over to intervene. Jokic and Williams exchanged shoves and grabbed each other's jerseys as a scrum of players, coaches, officials and staffers formed around them and eventually separated them.\n\n\"Just competing,\" Williams told ESPN. \"Two teams competing, that's it. That's all I got.\"\n\nAfter a review, the foul called against Dort was upgraded to a flagrant foul 2, resulting in an automatic ejection. Crew chief James Williams told a pool reporter that the officials \"deemed [Dort's] contact on Jokic to be unnecessary and excessive with a high potential for injury.\" Williams also cited the contact leading to an \"altercation that did not dissolve\" as a reason for upgrading it to a flagrant foul 2.\n\n\"I will say this: If [Williams] is running up the floor and gets tripped, we expect a flagrant 2 from this point forward,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \"That's all. If that's the precedent, if that becomes a malicious play and flagrant 2 is the line in the sand on that, we would expect that if it's [Williams]. We would expect that if it's anybody. And if that's the case, we're good.\"\n\nAsked if he believed the play was ruled a flagrant 2 because the foul was committed against a three-time MVP, Daigneault said: \"No, I'm not going to answer the question like that. I said what I needed to say about it.\"\n\nNuggets star Nikola Jokic confronts Thunder guard Luguentz Dort, who was called for a flagrant foul 2 after an apparent trip in the fourth quarter. Jokic and OKC's Jaylin Williams received technical fouls. Photo by Joshua Gateley/Getty Images\n\nThe referees determined that the actions of Jokic and Jaylin Williams during the altercation did not rise to the level of an ejection, James Williams said in the pool report.\n\nThe fracas overshadowed the return of reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had 36 points on 12-of-29 shooting and dished out nine assists in 34 minutes. Gilgeous-Alexander sat out the overtime period because he had reached his minutes limit after missing the previous nine games because of an abdominal strain suffered Feb. 3.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was called for a technical foul in the first quarter when he responded to Jokic's post-whistle contact by throwing the ball at him. James Williams told the pool reporter that Jokic was not called for a technical on that play because the officials determined that his contact with his left forearm did not rise to the level of an unsportsmanlike act.\n\n\"They're obviously a high-level team, we're a high-level team, and we've seen each other a lot in the past couple of years, so we might be a little bit more into the game just because we know the opponent,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"It was fun. It was good out there. End-of-season basketball is like that. It's that chippy, that physical, so it was good to get one of those in the regular season.\"\n\nThe Nuggets fell to 4-7 since Jokic returned from a monthlong absence, including 1-6 in clutch games (within five points in the final five minutes) during that span. Jokic recorded his league-leading 22nd triple-double with 23 points, 17 rebounds and 14 assists against the Thunder, but his uncharacteristic recent shooting struggles continued, as he went 9-of-25 from the floor and 2-of-10 from 3-point range.\n\nJokic, who was 3-of-5 from the free throw line, animatedly protested no-calls after several of his shots. There were also multiple instances of Jokic bumping and shoving with Thunder players during the game.\n\n\"I think his frustration is sometimes because the game's officiated differently out on the floor than it is near the basket, and I think he was reacting to what was being done to him,\" Nuggets coach David Adelman said. \"And his reaction's not going to be to cower away. He's competitive. ... I know why he's frustrated. I can feel his frustration with all the contact out there. He shot five free throws.\n\n\"It's just part of the game. The closer you get to the basket, it seems like for a bigger guy, it seems like it's called a little bit different, but he has to react to that the right way. Concentrate and finish through contact. And obviously with Dort's play, I think that took it to a different level for him. He felt like it was malicious, also.\"\n\nThe Nuggets and Thunder meet again March 9 in Oklahoma City."

Including the playoffs, it was the club's third-highest percentage in a game in the shot clock era (since 1954-55), behind 67.9% in 1984 and 67.0% in 1990, according to ESPN Research.\n\nThe Celtics also shot 64.7% from the 3-point line Friday, which equated to an 80.8% effective field goal percentage -- the highest in the shot clock era. Effective field goal percentage measures shooting efficiency by adjusting for the fact that 3-pointers are worth more than two-point shots\n\nAll-Star Jaylen Brown led the way, finishing with 28 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. But he got plenty of support from his teammates, with trade deadline acquisition Nikola Vucevic adding 28 points and 11 rebounds for his third double-double as a member of the Celtics.\n\n\"I thought we just did a good job reading the game,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"I thought we made the right reads throughout most of the entire game. I thought tonight Vooch really looked comfortable in his offensive reads and his offensive screening. He unlocked a lot of stuff for us.\"\n\nAll 13 Celtics players scored, with Boston committing only three turnovers after halftime.\n\n\"We just try to read the game and take what's there,\" Brown said.\n\nBoston, winners of five of its six games since the All-Star break, will wait to see if Sunday night's home matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers will mark the return of Tatum.\n\nThe game, originally scheduled to be played earlier in the day, was moved by NBC into an 8 p.m. ET prime-time slot, creating speculation it could signal Tatum's plan to return.\n\nIt's been 41 weeks since Tatum ruptured his right Achilles tendon in May in the waning minutes of the Celtics' loss to the New York Knicks in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe Celtics are required by the NBA to release an initial injury report by 5 p.m. ET on Saturday ahead of Sunday's home game against the 76ers.\n\nAfter practicing with the Celtics' G League team two weeks ago, Tatum said he hadn't decided whether he would return.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that I'm coming back or I'm not, it's just following the plan. So it's just another step,\" Tatum said. \"I don't know percentage. I just know I feel a little bit better every day. I just try to focus on that.\"\n\nTatum said in the same interview that he is also mindful of not wanting to disrupt the progress of a Celtics team that at 39-20 sits in second place in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\n\"I'm just hyper aware of what's going on. I think it would just stem from that. Obviously, I know what I bring to the table and bring to the team. But I'm also aware that these guys have been playing extremely well,\" Tatum said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe Women's National Basketball Players Association submitted a new counterproposal to the WNBA on Friday evening with some concessions on revenue share and housing, a source familiar with the collective bargaining negotiations told ESPN.\n\nIn the new CBA proposal, the players' union is asking for players to receive 26% of gross revenue (defined as revenue before deducting expenses) over the lifetime of the agreement, with the salary cap in Year 1 of the deal (about $9.5 million) unchanged from its previous offer.\n\nThe revenue share split is down from 27.5% of gross revenue as proposed in the WNBPA's Feb. 17 proposal, a change that a source said amounts to nearly $100 million in reductions on revenue share.\n\nThe new proposal also contains tweaks to the union's housing offerings: Previously, the players asked that teams continue to provide housing to players in the first several years of the new deal, but that in later years, teams will no longer be obligated to provide it for players making at least 80% of the maximum salary, on multiyear deals and receiving full salary protection.\n\nIn the new proposal, the union struck the multiyear component and lowered the salary threshold to 75% at which players would no longer be obligated to receive team-provided housing.\n\nThe two sides are still negotiating the years of service limit for developmental players -- a new feature of this CBA with each team now expected to have two developmental player spots. The union is now proposing a years of service limit of six after originally asking for no experience limit for those players, a source said, whereas the league's latest proposal suggested a limit of four or five years of service based on minutes played.\n\nThe WNBPA's counterproposal comes one week after the league submitted one of its own. That Feb. 20 league proposal guaranteed housing for all players in 2026 before being phased out in subsequent years of the deal. Players on their applicable minimum salary and those with zero years of service would be provided a one-bedroom apartment in 2027 and 2028 only, and developmental players would be provided studio apartments for the entirety of the deal.\n\nBut the two sides are still far apart on the issue of revenue sharing, including proposing different revenue sharing systems: The WNBA has held firm in its proposals, with players being offered on average over 70% of net revenue (revenue after deducting expenses), which would amount to less than 15% of gross revenue. The 2026 salary cap would come in at $5.65 million (up from $1.5 million in 2025) and in subsequent years would grow in line with revenue growth.\n\nThe league's proposal features maximum salaries, including revenue sharing payouts, amounting to nearly $1.3 million in 2026 and projecting to approach $2 million in 2031. The supermax in 2025 came in at $249,000. The average player salary, including revenue sharing, would be projected to reach $540,000 in 2026 and $780,000 by 2031, up from $120,000 in 2025.\n\nThe WNBA publicly struck down the WNBPA's previous proposal as \"unrealistic\" and \"caus[ing] hundreds of millions of dollars of losses for our teams.\" A source familiar with the negotiations told ESPN the league projected that Feb. 17 plan would result in losses of $460 million over the lifetime of the agreement, though the union has maintained its revenue sharing model would still put the league in a \"profitable position,\" another source said.\n\nEarlier this week, the league gave its teams and the WNBPA a target date of March 10 to complete a term sheet, or else the schedule for the 2026 season might be impacted."

            "content": "AUBURN, Calif. -- Former MLB pitcher Daniel Serafini was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 2021 shooting of his wife's parents during a burglary at their home by Lake Tahoe, authorities said.\n\nSerafini, 51, was convicted in July 2025 of first-degree murder of his father-in-law, Gary Spohr; attempted murder of his mother-in-law, Wendy Wood; and first-degree burglary. Spohr was killed, and Wood survived, though she died a year after the shooting.\n\nPlacer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said in a statement Friday that Spohr and Wood were loving grandparents and that Serafini's crimes greatly impacted family members and friends.\n\n\"The impact of this attack has extended far beyond the immediate victims, deeply affecting family members and the broader community, and highlighting the lasting harm caused by deliberate violence,\" Gire said.\n\nSerafini's attorney did not return requests for comment.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Serafini addressed the court and maintained his innocence, according to MyNews4. He said he was out partying with his wife the night of the shooting and described himself as a \"broken, imperfect man that makes mistakes.\"\n\nSerafini was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 1992. In a career spanning 11 years, the left-hander played for the Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies.\n\nProsecutors said Serafini hated his wife's wealthy parents and was heard saying he was willing to pay $20,000 to have them killed, according to the Sacramento Bee. Prosecutors showed jurors transcripts of angry emails and text messages between Serafini and his in-laws.\n\nDuring the six-week trial, Serafini's attorney, David Dratman, argued that there was no physical evidence linking his client to the crime scene. Dratman told the jury that although Serafini had a rocky relationship with his in-laws, he did not have a motive to kill them.\n\nAfter his conviction, Serafini filed multiple motions for a new trial, but those were denied.\n\nSerafini will serve his sentence at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the Placer County District Attorney's Office."

            "content": "FIFA has introduced a new system for the 2026 World Cup knockout stages that will see the top four seeded teams avoid each other until at least the semi-finals of next summer's 48-team tournament.\n\nIn a tennis-style, similar to the one adopted by FIFA during last summer's Club World Cup, the top two teams in the current FIFA rankings - Spain (1) and Argentina (2) - will be on opposite draw pathways, as will the third and fourth-ranked sides, France and England, to ensure competitive balance.\n\nAs a result, the four nations will be placed in different quadrants of the knockout phase and will be separated into pots. Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

You can't even dream about something like that.\"\n\nWhen Troy Parrott arrived for international duty with the Republic of Ireland last Monday, little did he know that six days later, he would have catapulted his country to the World Cup play-offs.\n\nFirst, there was an impressive 2-0 win against Portugal.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "The Director of Communications for the Bawumia Campaign Team has accused the National Democratic Congress (NDC) government of avoiding responsibility for the everyday challenges facing Ghanaians, despite improvements in key economic indicators.\n\nSpeaking on Newsfile on JoyNews on Saturday, February 28, during a discussion on the 2026 State of the Nation Address, Dennis Miracles Aboagye said the true state of the nation goes beyond headline macroeconomic figures.\n\n“I think the state of the nation is just the aggregation of every person within the state. And so if you have the majority of the elements within the state not doing so well, that is what will tell on the state.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the country’s macroeconomic performance over the past year has been strong.\n\n“The macroeconomic performance in the last one year is without doubt. There was no debate about that,” he said.\n\n“The fact that we’ve seen unprecedented improvement in inflation, never seen before. I doubt even first-world countries see this kind of macroeconomic improvement in such a short period.”\n\nHe also pointed to the strength of the cedi, saying, “The fact that we’ve seen some very heavy strength from our currency, it’s without doubt,” he said.\n\nHowever, Mr Aboagye questioned the sustainability of the gains and what is driving them.\n\n“The details as to whether it’s sustainable, based on what is driving it, is another conversation. It’s time for the government to actually sit back and be honest with themselves,” he said.\n\nHe called on the government to clearly explain the source of the improvement.\n\n\"First of all, you need to begin to tell the Ghanaian people what is driving this improvement. So that, should anything go wrong, which we are not praying for, you don’t come back with excuses.”\n\nAccording to him, Ghana’s recent stability is largely tied to high international gold prices.\n\n“We’ve always made a point about gold, and we’ve said that if gold is what is driving us, then we are in trouble. Because we don’t control it. One single thing is what has driven us to where we are now. High international market price for gold,” he said.\n\nHe warned that over-reliance on a single commodity leaves the economy exposed.\n\n“Tomorrow, should gold drop to 2,000 dollars, can we survive?” he asked.\n\nMr Aboagye also referred to the cocoa sector, suggesting that external market forces can quickly reverse gains.\n\nHe said comments attributed to a government official about giving cocoa farmers a “haircut” to prevent economic collapse show how fragile the situation could be.\n\nWhile conceding that some Ghanaians have benefited from the improved indicators, he said that the impact has been limited.\n\n“I have said it here that the government’s performance in the last one year has benefited, in my view, some 10 to 15 per cent of the population,” he claimed.\n\nHe explained that those who directly import goods and require foreign exchange have benefited significantly.\n\n“The person who imports directly and needs forex benefited big time. The person who pays anything in dollars benefited. Who drives to the fuel station to buy fuel for their vehicle, plant, or machinery benefited.”\n\nHowever, he said the ordinary commuter has not felt the same relief.\n\n“The person joining the trotro also hasn’t. That is where the issue comes in,” he said.\n\nHe cited data suggesting that between 75 and 80 per cent of residents in Accra rely on commercial transport. According to him, the limited supply of vehicles has pushed up fares and made commuting more difficult.\n\n“Today, people have to wake up at 3:00 a.m. so they can get to work at 8:30 a.m., which they are late anyway. And they have to leave the office at 5:00,” he said.\n\nMr Aboagye said that economic management should ultimately improve the daily lives of citizens.\n\n“What is macroeconomy without its positive impact on micro?” he asked. “The whole essence of macroeconomic management is the output on the microeconomy.”\n\n“If you drive your macroeconomic indicators to the best of numbers and your micro is not positively affected, you’ve done nothing,” he said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Al-Hassan Kodwo Baidoo\n\nIn many contemporary households, economic pressures, long work hours, and increasing social commitments have reshaped parenting patterns. A growing notion suggests that as long as parents provide financially and pay school fees, the responsibility of grooming children rests primarily with schools.\n\nConsequently, some children spend over 12 hours daily in school or daycare environments with minimal parental interaction. While this model may appear practical, research consistently shows that parental involvement is not a mere provision but a decisive factor in children’s academic success, emotional stability, and moral development.\n\nResearch Evidence on Parental Involvement and Child Development\n\nExtensive global studies affirm that parental engagement is one of the strongest predictors of a child’s educational achievement. Renowned educational researchers such as John Hattie, Joyce Epstein, and our own Prof. Ato Essuman indicate that parental involvement significantly improves academic outcomes, motivation, and behaviour. Similarly, findings by the OECD show that students whose parents actively monitor homework, communicate with teachers, and discuss school activities consistently perform better in literacy, numeracy, and critical thinking.\n\nThe UNICEF further reports that parental supervision contributes to improved emotional regulation, reduced risky behaviour, and stronger social competence. Children who experience regular parental interaction develop higher self-esteem and better coping mechanisms, which are essential for holistic wellbeing.\n\nComparative Outcomes: Present vs. Near-Absent Parenting\n\nResearch across Europe, Asia, and Africa reveals a clear developmental gap between children with involved parents and those with limited parental supervision. Children with Active Parental Supervision:\n\nHigher academic achievement and school attendance\n\nStronger discipline and moral reasoning\n\nLower rates of delinquency and substance abuse\n\nBetter emotional resilience and mental health\n\nStronger parent-child attachment and communication\n\nChildren with Minimal Parental Presence:\n\nIncreased behavioural challenges and indiscipline\n\nHigher susceptibility to peer pressure and deviant conduct\n\nEmotional detachment and anxiety\n\nPoor academic consistency despite school attendance\n\nGreater reliance on external validation and social media influence\n\nA longitudinal study by the Harvard University Centre on the Developing Child emphasises that responsive parenting and consistent adult engagement are foundational to cognitive and socio-emotional growth. Children deprived of meaningful parental interaction may experience developmental delays even when enrolled in high-quality schools.\n\nThe School Cannot Replace the Parent.\n\nSchools are structured for instruction, not total upbringing. Teachers manage large classrooms and cannot provide the individualised moral, emotional, and behavioural guidance that parents offer. When children are dropped off very early and picked up late, the educational institution becomes a holding space rather than a complementary partner in upbringing. Evidence from global education systems shows that the most successful learners emerge from homes where education is reinforced through conversation, supervision, and values formation.\n\nHolistic Wellbeing: Beyond Academics\n\nParental involvement shapes not only academic excellence but also character formation. Studies from child psychology bodies highlight that children who engage in daily discussions with parents exhibit higher empathy, discipline, and ethical awareness. In contrast, prolonged emotional absence can lead to attention-seeking behaviour, aggression, and weakened moral judgment. From a public policy perspective, countries with strong parental engagement cultures, such as Finland, Japan, and Canada, consistently record higher educational outcomes and lower youth delinquency rates. The common denominator is not just quality schooling but structured parental supervision and involvement in children’s daily lives.\n\nThe Role of Religious Bodies and Moral Institutions\n\nReligious and community institutions play a strategic role in reinforcing parental responsibility. While spiritual teachings on salvation and prosperity are important, there is a growing need for faith-based organisations to intensify guidance on parenting, moral instruction, and restorative family interventions. Churches, mosques, and community fellowships can:\n\nOrganise parenting education programs.\n\nPromote family bonding and mentorship initiatives\n\nProvide counselling for struggling parents and children\n\nReinforce discipline, empathy, and ethical values\n\nMoral formation is most effective when religious teachings align with practical family engagement rather than replace it.\n\nConclusion\n\nFinancial provision is essential, but it cannot substitute for parental presence. Global research consistently demonstrates that children thrive academically, emotionally, and morally when parents are actively involved in their upbringing.\n\nSchools can educate, but parents cultivate character, discipline, and identity. In an era of demanding work schedules and social commitments, intentional parental supervision must be treated not as an optional duty but as a developmental necessity. Religious bodies, educational institutions, and policymakers must therefore collaborate to promote value-based parenting, strengthen family engagement, and implement restorative interventions that nurture responsible, well-rounded children for society’s future.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

President Mahama signed the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill into law in February 2026, creating a central coordinating body for the policy.\n\nCompanies operating two shifts qualify for a 25 percent corporate tax rebate, while those running three shifts can get 50 percent, alongside import duty waivers for qualifying machinery.\n\n“Passing a law is not the same as delivering on a promise,” Aboagye said, adding that NDC leaders, in 46 publicly available videos promoting the policy, had presented it as an immediate, holistic solution — not a secretariat or authority.\n\n“The young men and women who were hopeful — millions of young Ghanaians queued and voted for the first time. They are tired of waiting,” he said.\n\nAboagye also recalled the party’s national chairman promising that organisers on the Tema Motorway would be working at 1 a.m., and that businesses, nightclubs, and public offices would operate morning, afternoon, and evening — commitments he says remain unfulfilled.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "International Corporate Lawyer and entrepreneur Victoria Bright has praised the government’s recent macroeconomic gains but warned that long-term progress will depend on structural reforms and stronger support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nSpeaking on Newsfile on JoyNews on Saturday, February 28, during a discussion on the 2026 State of the Nation Address, Ms Bright acknowledged that the country’s economic indicators have improved.\n\n“I mean, our currency is stronger. We have lower debt ratios, higher reserves, lower inflation,\" she said.\n\nShe also pointed to developments in the export sector. “The gold exports have been institutionalised under the gold board, and the cocoa sector reforms will be presented. So, I think we’ll hold our horses a little bit on that to see how that’s meant to be operationalised.”\n\nWhile describing the government’s macroeconomic recovery as “very commendable”, she cautioned against focusing only on short-term fiscal corrections.\n\n“What we are hoping and praying for is that the reforms don’t just end up being fiscal corrections following the extreme difficulties that we found ourselves in not too long ago. But they operate in such a way that in the long term they prevent a relapse,” she said.\n\nMs Bright said that Ghana has often experienced cycles of progress followed by setbacks.\n\n“We do well, and then we go back. Two steps forward, four steps back. So, we don’t want that. We’re all hoping and praying that this time it stays,” she said.\n\nAccording to her, reforms must be embedded firmly in national systems to avoid a repeat of past downturns.\n\n“Unless fiscal discipline, export diversification, energy reforms and enforcement independence are locked into our systems, then the recovery risks become cyclical rather than permanent. They are not structural, and that is what we want,” she explained.\n\n“We can’t keep doing the same things over and over again and expect a different result. I’m hoping that this time things will be done differently,” she added.\n\nMs Bright said that macroeconomic stability must translate into real benefits for citizens.\n\n“This stability that we can all see and which we have to acknowledge has to translate into money in our pockets, lower cost of living for the ordinary Ghanaian, increased real wages and sustained SME growth,” she said.\n\nShe said that SMEs are critical to job creation and economic inclusion. “SMEs, in any country, drive the economy and reduce youth exclusion,” she noted.\n\nAlthough she acknowledged data from the Ghana Statistical Service showing that employment increased by one million between the first and third quarters of last year, she raised concerns about youth unemployment.\n\n“When you look at the other side of the coin and the 1.95 million youth who are not in employment, education or training, it means that a fifth of our youth are actually excluded,” she said.\n\nShe also questioned the quality of the jobs being created. “Are they formal jobs? Are they informal? Are they seasonal? Are they permanent? Private sector or public sector?” she asked.\n\nMs Bright warned against relying too heavily on public sector employment. “We can’t also pack people into the public sector. It then leads us to the same problems,” she said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

If we can do that, most of the other problems we can control,” he said.\n\nIn 2024, Ghana spent GH¢38.95 billion on imported food, with grains, meat, cereals, sugar products, and fish making up more than half of all food imports, according to the Ghana Revenue Authority.\n\nWhile the country exports raw commodities, it continues to import processed foods that could theoretically be produced domestically, highlighting structural gaps in the agricultural sector.\n\nProf. Agyeman-Duah noted that cultural perceptions also contribute to the challenge, with many Ghanaians associating imported foods with higher quality and prestige, reducing demand for local produce even when it is competitively priced.\n\nThe Mahama administration has taken steps to address the problem.\n\nIn April 2025, the government launched the “Feed Ghana” programme, aiming to reduce the country’s dependence on imported food through mechanised farming, smart agriculture, and strengthened value chains, focusing on maize, rice, and poultry. President Mahama highlighted a “staggering $2 billion” annual food import bill and pledged to promote local production.\n\nBut Prof. Agyeman-Duah argue that intent alone is insufficient. Implementation, infrastructure, and institutional coordination must match the ambition if Ghana is to truly transform its agricultural sector.\n\n“My point is simple. Let us begin to look at how we change the structure of the economy,” he emphasised, urging the government to turn policy into tangible action.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "When safety is compromised in a place meant for healing, the impact extends far beyond the facility's walls. It affects families, communities, and public trust.\n\nIn the wake of the widely reported security incident at Mamprobi Polyclinic in which a newborn was taken from the maternity ward by an individual who disguised herself as a nurse, Virtual Security Africa (VSA) chose not to stand on the sidelines.\n\nWhat followed was not silence or deflection, but decisive, meaningful action —swift, structured, and anchored in a genuine commitment to public safety.\n\nWithin days of the incident, the leadership of Virtual Security Africa, led by CEO Emmanuel Asiedu, engaged hospital management through a delegation not merely as a service provider, but as a committed partner in restoring confidence and safety.\n\nThe response was guided by a clear belief: responsibility in moments of crisis must be met with empathy, action, and long-term solutions.\n\nA high-level delegation from VSA paid an official visit to Mamprobi Polyclinic to commiserate with hospital leadership and staff, listen to their concerns, and offer direct support.\n\nManagement of the clinic, led by Medical Superintendent Dr Henrietta Fiscian, expressed profound gratitude, noting that VSA was the first private entity to provide tangible support since the incident.\n\nAs a heartfelt gesture of solidarity, Virtual Security Africa made a generous financial donation to the baby's mother.\n\nThis contribution reflected not only immediate humanitarian care, but VSA’s deeper conviction that the safety and peace of mind of patients and families is inseparable from its mission as a security technology company.\n\nBeyond Empathy: A Full Security Transformation\n\nVSA’s intervention extended far beyond immediate support. With the full consent and gratitude of hospital management, the company conducted a comprehensive security assessment of the facility and committed to a complete overhaul and upgrade of the clinic’s CCTV surveillance system at no cost to the hospital.\n\nThe upgrade will deliver:\n\nInstallation of new high-definition cameras across all critical areas, including maternity wards, entrances, and corridors\n\nEnhanced real-time monitoring and incident review capabilities for hospital leadership and security personnel\n\nA comprehensive security assessment with actionable recommendations for hospital management\n\nA long-term surveillance framework designed for institutional resilience and prevention\n\nThis is not a temporary intervention. It is a structural enhancement, a lasting commitment to ensuring that what happened once will not happen again.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility with Purpose\n\nThis initiative forms part of Virtual Security Africa’s 18th Anniversary Corporate Social Responsibility programme — a milestone that the company has chosen to mark not with ceremony, but with impact.\n\nVSA’s realignment of its CSR focus to address this urgent community need demonstrates that its commitment to Ghana runs deeper than business.\n\nWho We Are: Security Built for Ghana’s Realities\n\nFor nearly two decades, Virtual Security Africa has pursued a clear vision: to become a trusted leader in integrated electronic security and surveillance systems across Africa.\n\nAs a wholly Ghanaian-owned company with nationwide operations, VSA understands the realities of both the public and private sectors — including tight budgets, high expectations, and zero tolerance for failure.\n\nIts solutions are designed to be cost-effective, scalable, and suitable for mission-critical environments such as healthcare, education, government institutions, and public spaces.\n\nVSA believes personal and institutional security is no longer optional — it is essential for safety.\n\nA Partner for Safer Healthcare Across Ghana\n\nVirtual Security Africa remains committed to partnering with health facilities nationwide to create safer spaces for mothers, children, and staff.\n\nFor facilities with existing surveillance systems, VSA offers professional security assessments, upgrades, repairs, and periodic maintenance at affordable rates to ensure existing equipment remains reliable and effective.\n\nFor facilities looking to acquire new systems without the burden of high upfront costs, VSA also provides flexible lease-to-own options, making it easier for hospitals and clinics to own modern, high-quality electronic security infrastructure.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

So far, we are going in the right direction. Let’s sustain it over a long period of time,” he said.\n\nThe government has framed 2025 as a year of stabilisation. A February 23, 2026, press release from the Ministry of Finance highlighted a budget deficit narrowed to 1.0 per cent of GDP, below the 2.8 per cent target, alongside a primary balance surplus of 2.6 per cent of GDP.\n\nInflation fell to 3.8 per cent in January 2026, marking the 13th consecutive month of decline and the lowest level since Ghana’s CPI was rebased in 2021.\n\nThe Bank of Ghana has also cut interest rates cumulatively by 12.5 percentage points since July 2025.\n\nDespite these gains, Prof. Dzanku expressed caution, pointing to structural issues that could undermine sustained growth.\n\n“Ghana has spent an average of 36 per cent of government revenue on interest payments over the past decade — against a sub-Saharan average of 8 per cent,” he said. He also noted that government capital investment has dropped from around 27 per cent of GDP in 2015 to about 10 per cent today, while GDP per capita growth has been volatile, averaging just 2.3 per cent over the decade — far below the 4–6 per cent needed for meaningful structural transformation.\n\n“I want to be optimistic because everybody wants things to go well,” Prof. Dzanku said. “But because of where we’ve been and where we came to, I adopt a wait-and-see attitude.”\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Ionic nano copper water treatment experiment at a galamsey site\n\nThe environmental crisis caused by illegal mining (galamsey) in Ghana has turned once-potable rivers into \"brown waters\" of silt and toxic chemicals.\n\nTraditional water treatment often fails to handle the extreme turbidity and heavy metal loads currently found in water bodies like the Birim River.\n\n\n\nTo combat this, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Ghana, under the leadership of Professor Nana Ama Brown Klutse, is piloting a cutting-edge copper-based ionic nano-liquid technology.\n\n\n\nThe technology is expected to purify the water with the application of ionic nano copper solution.\n\n\n\nThis GhanaWeb article seeks to explain how this molecular-level solution works to reclaim heavily polluted waters.\n\n\n\nGhana’s EPA eyes nano-liquid technology in fight against river pollution\n\n\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in collaboration with Ghana Standards Authority and other relevant organization have started a pilot of this technology on the Birim River; later to be extended to the Pra, Ankobra and other major rivers in the country.\n\n\n\nWhat is Copper-Based Ionic Nano-Liquid?\n\nAt its core, this technology uses nanoparticles (particles so small they are measured in billionths of a meter) suspended in an ionic liquid.\n\n\n\nUnlike standard chemicals that simply float in water, ionic liquids are essentially \"liquid salts\" that exist in a fluid state at low temperatures.\n\n\n\nWhen copper is engineered into this state at a nano-scale, it gains an incredibly high surface-area-to-volume ratio, making it hyper-reactive compared to regular copper.\n\n\n\n1. The Composition: Three Parts of a Whole\n\n\n\n•Copper (The Active Agent): Copper is naturally antimicrobial and has a high affinity for other metals. In this liquid, it acts as the primary tool for killing bacteria and binding to toxic heavy metals like mercury and lead.\n\n\n\n•Ionic Liquid (The Carrier): Unlike water or oil, an ionic liquid is essentially \"molten salt\" that remains liquid at room temperature. Because it consists entirely of ions (charged particles), it has a powerful electrical pull that keeps the copper stable and helps it interact with contaminants.\n\n\n\n•Nano-Scale (The Size): By shrinking the copper particles to a \"nano\" size (billionths of a meter), the surface area increases exponentially. A small amount of this liquid has more \"active surface\" than a massive block of solid copper, making it hyper-efficient.\n\nEPA tryouts ionic nano copper technology on polluted Birim River\n\n\n\n2. How it Works in Polluted Water\n\n\n\nWhen this liquid is introduced into a \"galamsey-polluted\" river, a three-step chemical reaction occurs:\n\n\n\nA. Adsorption (The Metal Magnet)\n\n\n\nThe copper ions in the liquid carry a charge that attracts heavy metals (Lead, Arsenic, Cyanide). These toxins \"stick\" to the copper nanoparticles. Once bound together, they become heavy and fall to the bottom as a stable sediment, or are easily filtered out.\n\n\n\nB. Flocculation (Clearing the Mud)\n\n\n\nGalamsey water is \"turbid\" (muddy) because tiny clay particles are suspended in the water. The ionic liquid neutralizes the electrical charges that keep these particles floating. This causes them to clump together, a process called flocculation, turning the \"brown soup\" into clear water with settled silt at the bottom.\n\nC. Disinfection (Biological Cleanup)\n\n\n\nCopper nanoparticles can penetrate the cell walls of harmful bacteria and fungi. Once inside, they disrupt the cell's metabolism, effectively sterilizing the water without the need for harsh chemicals like chlorine.\n\n\n\n3. Why is it \"Revolutionary\" for Ghana?\n\n\n\nTraditional water treatment (using Alum or Chlorine) often fails when the water is too muddy because the chemicals get \"lost\" in the silt.\n\n\n\nThis nano-liquid is different because:\n\n\n\n1.Speed: It works in minutes compared to the hours required for traditional settling.\n\n\n\n2.Precision: It targets specific heavy metals left behind by illegal mining.\n\n3.Low Residuals: Because it is so efficient, very small amounts are needed, reducing the risk of chemical buildup in the environment.\n\n\n\nVPO/EB\n\n\n\nMahama, Veep share laughs after Minority presents cocoa pods in Parliament"

            "content": "Sports News of Saturday, 28 February 2026\n\nSource: bbc.com\n\nMuslims around the world are currently observing the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, including players in the Premier League.\n\n\n\nSaturday's game between Leeds United and Manchester City at Elland Road might be paused in the first half to allow players observing Ramadan to break their fast.\n\n\n\nWith the match kicking off at 17:30 GMT and the sun setting in West Yorkshire at 17:41, a stoppage in play may see the likes of Omar Marmoush, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Rayan Cherki or Abdukodir Khusanov come to the side of the pitch to take on food and fluids.\n\n\n\nSources say a firm decision on a short break is likely to be made on Saturday morning, while it is understood Leeds would happily accommodate any such request from City.\n\n\n\nAsked by BBC Sport if the club have to alter their schedules to help its Muslim players, manager Pep Guardiola said: \"They follow this religious tradition. We have good nutritionists and they adapt to what the team needs.\n\n\n\n\"We cannot adapt the schedule for the Premier League [kick-off] times and I think they are used to it - they are not young and have been playing [for] many years during this period.\n\n\n\n\"For the players I think it is not new. Both Rayans, Omar and Khusa, it is not the first time for [observing] Ramadan and they know perfectly how to handle it.\"\n\n\n\nThis season, the quartet have all started together once in each of the cup competitions but are yet to feature from kick-off in the Premier League.\n\n\n\nChaplaincy for players and staff\n\n\n\nCity have a memorable history with a number of Muslim players.\n\n\n\nGerman midfielder Ilkay Gundogan captained the side to the Treble in 2023, while Algeria winger Riyad Mahrez was also part of that squad and won the PFA player of the year award with Leicester City in 2016.\n\n\n\nIvorian Yaya Toure scored the winning goal in the 2011 FA Cup final against Stoke City to end the club's 35-year wait for a major trophy - a year later he refused a bottle of champagne for man of the match on live television, stating his Islamic beliefs, with the Premier League subsequently changing the prize to a trophy.\n\n\n\nThough City's training kit is sponsored by Japanese beer company Asahi, its Super Dry 0.0% brand is printed on it, meaning Muslim players are advertising a non-alcoholic product.\n\n\n\nIt is subjects like these that City players and staff are being educated about by the Muslim Chaplains in Sport (MCS) organisation, which has been working closely with the club since 2016-17 from the under-8s all the way up to the first team.\n\n\n\nMCS founder Imam Ismail Bhamji explains to BBC Sport: \"We visit clubs and often lead prayers and we sit down and learn about a particular subject afterwards. I am then available for club staff and players.\n\n\n\n\"I walk around club training facilities and buildings, meeting people and help sort out any issues that they may have and discuss in confidentiality.\"\n\n\n\nThis month Guardiola spoke at a news conference about the \"hurt\" he feels for victims of global conflict, including the thousands killed in Palestine.\n\n\n\nImam Ismail says it is a subject that has struck a chord within some clubs, adding: \"If help is needed, people do reach out to me for guidance on family matters and personal issues.\n\n\n\n\"One example is being asked about how to navigate the war in Gaza - in controlling their emotions and not be at risk of losing their jobs by posting something on social media.\"\n\n\n\n'We leave it to clubs to decide what do to'\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Manchester United held an Iftar (breaking of the Ramadan fast) at Old Trafford for supporters, with the Adhan (call to prayer) taking place inside the stadium.\n\n\n\nClubs up and down the country, including Manchester City, have held similar initiatives during Ramadan in recent years.\n\n\n\nImam Ismail delivers workshops on Islamic awareness and Halal food guidance, while the ongoing month of Ramadan is a particularly busy period.\n\n\n\n\"We explain what Ramadan is and why Muslims find it important and why we must observe it,\" he says. \"It is mentioned in the Quran and one of the five pillars of Islam.\n\n\n\n\"We explain the importance of fasting for those who qualify and we also explain the impact of fasting on professional athletes and how they could navigate and work around that to ensure they can fulfil their religious obligations and the sporting side too so that they can continue to play.\n\n\n\n\"Ultimately, we leave it to clubs to decide what do to - we can't tell them what to do.\"\n\nPlayers that work with MCS are understood to be pleased that they do not have to miss prayers and an Imam can come in to help them perform their duties as Muslims.\n\n\n\n\"I bumped into Pep Guardiola last week and he held my hand and wished me Ramadan Kareem,\" said a beaming Imam Ismail. \"That was nice of him.\"\n\n\n\nThe end of Ramadan is marked by the day of Eid, which will take place on Friday, 20 or Saturday, 21 March - depending on the sighting of the new moon - when celebrations take place with families and friends and gifts are exchanged.\n\n\n\nCity face Arsenal in a tantalising Carabao Cup final on the Sunday - lifting the trophy at Wembley will provide the perfect Eid present for players and supporters alike."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

Syria also announced it had closed part of its airspace in the south along its border with Israel for 12 hours.\n\nThe closures came after the US and Israel carried out attacks across Iran that US President Donald Trump pledged would raze Iran’s missile industry and destroy its navy. Iran, which had been engaged in negotiations with the US over its nuclear programme right up until the attack, pledged a harsh response and soon began waging retaliatory strikes in Israel, as well as several Gulf Arab states that host US military assets, including Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE and Bahrain.\n\n“All American and Israeli assets and interests in the Middle East have become a legitimate target,” a senior Iranian official told Al Jazeera. “There are no red lines after this aggression, and everything is possible.”\n\nThe disruption caused global airlines to cancel or divert flights from destinations across the Middle East, which has become an important route for flights between Europe and Asia, as Russian and Ukrainian airspace is closed to most airlines due to the war there.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Transport said Russian air carriers had suspended flights to Iran and ⁠Israel. Air India said it would temporarily avoid the Middle East altogether.\n\n\n\nAmong other airlines announcing suspensions to destinations in the region were Lufthansa, Air France, Iberia, Wizz Air, Turkish Airlines, Qatar Airways, Virgin Atlantic, KLM, British Airways, Aegean Airlines, Indigo, Japan Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Doha, said the joint US-Israeli attack on Iran and Iran’s response, affecting numerous Gulf states, have created two “parallel” conflicts, further deepening instability.\n\n“This could make the whole crisis very intertwined and very complicated in a way that this region has never witnessed,” said Hashem."

Several other countries in the region also announced the closure of their airspace.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump said Washington has begun a “major combat operation” in Iran, aimed at “eliminating threats from the Iranian regime”.\n\n“This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces,” he said.\n\nThe strikes came just two days after high-stakes US–Iran nuclear negotiations in Geneva, mediated by Oman, ended without a breakthrough. The US-Israel attack marks the most serious escalation since the brief but intense June 2025 war.\n\nHere is a timeline of the events, including attacks and diplomatic overtures leading up to Saturday’s strikes by the US and Israel, and Iran’s fierce response.\n\nJune 13, 2025 — Israel launches major air strikes against Iranian nuclear and military facilities, amid ongoing talks between the US and Tehran. Iran responds within hours with large-scale missile and drone attacks on Israeli cities.\n\nJune 22 – The US strikes Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan, with Trump claiming the attacks degraded Tehran’s nuclear programme. Iranian officials said their programme was set back but not destroyed.\n\n\n\nJune 23 – In retaliation, Iran fires missiles towards Al Udeid airbase in Qatar, housing US soldiers. The missiles are intercepted, and no casualties are reported.\n\nJune 24 – After 12 days of fighting, a US-brokered ceasefire takes effect between Iran and Israel, ending all hostilities. Iran says at least 610 of its citizens were killed in the war, while Israel claimed 28 were killed on its side.\n\nJuly 2 – Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signs legislation halting cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), barring its inspectors from accessing Iran’s nuclear facilities unless specifically authorised by the country’s Supreme National Security Council.\n\nJuly 22 – Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s foreign minister, says Tehran will not give up its uranium enrichment programme, despite a temporary halt due to “serious and severe” damages.\n\nAugust 12 – Iranian police arrest as many as 21,000 people related to the 12-day war with Israel, according to state media.\n\nAugust 22 – Iran agrees to resume nuclear talks later in the month with the United Kingdom, France and Germany, despite the threat of revived sanctions.\n\nAugust 28 – The three European countries trigger a mechanism reinstating the United Nations’ sanctions on the Islamic republic for the first time in a decade.\n\nNovember 1 – Oman urges both the US and Iran to go back to the negotiating table as Iran reiterates it will not stop enriching uranium.\n\nNovember 7 – Trump says Iran has requested that Washington remove its crippling sanctions on Tehran, and that he is willing to talk about the issue.\n\nDecember 28 – Protests break out in major cities, including Tehran, over soaring prices after the rial plunges against the US dollar.\n\nJanuary 8, 2026 – The internet is shut down across Iran following the outbreak of antigovernment protests, which have now spread beyond cities.

            "content": "Iran has targeted United States assets across the Gulf Arab states in retaliation for a huge joint attack on Iran by the US and Israel, as the region’s worst fears of being ignited in the flames of a sustained war loom.\n\nThe Iranian government on Saturday confirmed its attacks on several targets, according to the Fars news agency, including Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, where US airbases are hosted.\n\nIran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed all Israeli and US military targets in the Middle East have been struck “by the powerful blows of Iranian missiles”.\n\n“This operation will continue relentlessly until the enemy is decisively defeated,” it said. All US assets throughout the region are considered legitimate targets for Iran’s army, it added.\n\nAt least one person has been killed in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital, after several missiles launched from Iran were intercepted, according to the country’s state news agency.\n\nBahrain says a missile attack targeted the headquarters of the US Navy’s 5th Fleet, which it hosts.\n\nThe government called it a “treacherous attack” and “a blatant violation of the kingdom’s sovereignty and security”.\n\nAl Jazeera Arabic has meanwhile confirmed the sound of explosions in Kuwait, home to the US military’s Central Command headquarters.\n\nIn Qatar, the Defense Ministry says it “thwarted” several attacks on the country.\n\n“The Ministry of Defense confirms that the threat was dealt with immediately upon detection, in accordance with the pre-approved security plan, and that all missiles were intercepted before reaching Qatari territory,” it said.\n\n\n\nQatar, Kuwait and the UAE have all closed their airspaces.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Doha, said the only country in the Gulf Cooperation Council that Iran has not struck today thus far is Oman.\n\nOman has for years served as a liaison between Iran and other nations in the region and beyond. It has played a central role in recent indirect talks between Iran and the US in Oman and Geneva.\n\nOman’s foreign minister on Friday had voiced optimism that peace was “within reach” as Iran had agreed during the talks never to stockpile enriched uranium. Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi described the development as a major breakthrough. Hours later, Israel and the US attacked, and those talks are now dead and buried.\n\nThe GCC is an alliance of six countries in the Arabian Peninsula: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, established in 1981 to promote economic, security, cultural and social cooperation.\n\n“Here in Doha, in the last few hours, we’ve heard at least a dozen explosions. The majority of them sound like they were Patriot defence missiles intercepting incoming Iran missiles,” Basravi said.\n\n“As far as Iran is concerned, with the US and Israel firing the first shot in this latest go-round, everything is now probably fair game,” he added."

            "content": "is a deputy editor and Verge co-founder with a passion for human-centric cities, e-bikes, and life as a digital nomad. He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nGood electric bikes are expensive. So why not buy one and share it?\n\nThat’s the idea behind the Tenways CGO Compact e-bike I’ve been sharing with my wife and teenage daughter for the last two weeks. It adapts in seconds without any tools to comfortably fit riders of varying heights thanks to its low-entry frame, quick-release seat post, and height-adjustable handlebar.\n\nIt also takes up less space than an ordinary bike with its 20-inch wheels, folding pedals, and a handlebar that twists to create a slim, wall-hugging profile that goes flat inside a car or train.\n\nThe CGO Compact’s geometry puts riders into a comfortable upright body position. Combine that with wide tires and a heavy aluminum frame – heavier than many full-sized e-bikes – and it feels remarkably sturdy despite its size, with a rear carrier system strong enough to hold a child or a few days of groceries.\n\nThe shareable e-bike isn’t a new idea, but Tenways comes close to perfecting it with the €1,999 (about $2,365) CGO Compact.\n\n9 Verge Score Tenways CGO Compact e-bike $ 2365 $ 2365 The Good Saddle and handlebar adjust quickly\n\nTwists and folds to go flat\n\nRides big and sturdy\n\nGood hauling capacity for size\n\nNo service upsells\n\nLow battery alerts The Bad App is just fine\n\nQuick release seat easy to steal $2365 at Tenways How we rate and review products\n\nTenways, the Amsterdam-HQ’d e-bike company of Chinese origin, has been on a tear in Europe thanks to the post-pandemic chaos that took out much of its competition. The brand makes great looking e-bikes from off-the-shelf parts supported by a robust service network. Importantly, they sell below the €2,681 (about $3,160) e-bike average — expensive compared to the US, but far less likely to burst into flames.\n\nMy Tenways review e-bike arrived at my front door in a giant cardboard box. It seemed big enough to fit the CGO Compact fully assembled and with the handlebar twisted, yet I still had to attach the steering column and front wheel myself. The e-bike took about 20 minutes to unbox, but I’ve been assembling direct-to-consumer e-bikes about once a month for the last decade.\n\nQuickly adjusts to fit my wife who is 164cm (5ft 5in) tall. The handlebars and shock-absorbing seat can be raised in seconds to fit my 183cm (6ft) frame. Open the release to raise and lower the handlebars, lift that little pin to twist them out of the way. The folding pedals help create a wall-hugging profile that’s easy to walk past.\n\nThe first thing I did after assembly was play with the Byschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem. It’s magical. Open the lever to quickly raise and lower the handlebar, or to gain access to a pin release that lets the handlebar twist out of the way. It took a little practice for everyone to master but we soon got the hang of it.\n\nThe small LCD dashboard is bright and colorful even in the sun. You have to enter a four-digit PIN code at power-on, which can only be changed in the rudimentary app over Bluetooth. It’s the only theft-deterrence Tenways offers on the CGO Compact, which also means it won’t try to upsell you on subscriptions or software-locked features.\n\nDespite our height differences, ranging from 164cm to 183cm (5ft 5in to 6 feet), everyone found the CGO Compact to be very comfortable. Adjusting the handlebar and saddle takes less than 10 seconds, and the suspension seatpost did a good job of soaking up small bumps. But the seat’s quick release mechanism offers no additional security to prevent the post and saddle from being stolen. A no-no in the big European cities this bike targets.\n\nThe e-bike’s torque sensor made the ride exceptionally intuitive, ensuring that the power delivered by the 250W rear-hub motor was tuned to match the downward force exerted on the pedals. The motor was also very quiet, masked entirely by the sound of the wide, 2.4-inch tires riding over asphalt.\n\nThe Tenways motor is only capable of 45Nm of torque. And without additional gears, the CGO Compact is best for mostly flat environments. It still did better than I expected on hills, easily besting the 35Nm Raleigh One I recently reviewed. For example, I was able to cross a bridge with a 10 percent incline that stymied the Raleigh One, but only if I had a rolling start — otherwise, I had to get off and push. On downhill slopes, the large chainring allowed me to pedal comfortably at speeds approaching 30km/h without my legs frantically spinning out. The pedal-assist, however, quits helping at 25km/h (16mph) in Europe.\n\nI also didn’t experience any of the twitchiness you get from folding bikes with relatively short wheelbases, smaller 16-inch wheels, and narrow handlebars. In general I rode in pedal-assist levels 3 or 4 out of 5, with 3 feeling the most natural, and 4 for when I was in a hurry.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 25 The suspension seat post soaked up bumps on a variety of road surfaces.\n\nOn a full battery I managed to travel 65kms (over 40 miles) before needing a recharge. I received alerts on my iPhone and Apple Watch when the battery dropped to 10 percent, and power dropped noticeably when the estimated remaining range hit 4km. Charging the 494.36Wh battery took a relatively slow 4.5 hours from the bundled charger.\n\nThe CGO Compact was obviously designed by people that actually ride bikes in compact European cities. It comes standard with integrated lighting, mudguards, a loud bell, kickstand, and a partially covered transmission to protect trousers, skirts, and long coats from getting snagged. The little crossbar in the step-through frame even doubles as a handle to help hoist the bike up stairs.\n\nCity bikes need to haul things, which is why the CGO Compact comes fitted with the click-and-go MIK HD rear carrier system. It supports loads up to 27kg (almost 60 pounds) — enough to fit a compatible crate or child seat. The e-bike also has mounting points up front for a bottle cage or rack.\n\nIn general, the Android and iOS app is fine, but it’s rarely needed. It might eventually be useful for buying accessories and insurance, or starting a chat with support and finding the nearest service center. It also promises to show riding data collected by date, but this never worked for me, only showing zeroes.\n\nTenways’ CGO Compact is an excellent e-bike for €1,999 (about $2,365). The riding experience, everyone agrees, has been stellar. And when it eventually needs servicing, Tenways has a solid network of local bike shops in Europe to provide support, with a ready supply of the off-the-shelf parts from brands you know.\n\nThe CGO Compact is a highly adaptable e-bike that rides big and tucks away small, making it an ideal companion for European city life. It’s also exceedingly shareable — but nobody would blame you for keeping it all for yourself.\n\nCGO Compact Specs Tenways C9 Hub Motor (250W, 45Nm torque)\n\nSingle-speed Gates CDN Carbon belt drive\n\n494.36Wh removable battery\n\nSuspension seat post for Selle Royal saddle\n\nTektro hydraulic disc brakes\n\nByschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem\n\nBike weight: 24kg (almost 53 pounds) with all accessories\n\nMax load: 145kg (320 pounds)\n\nMIK HD Rear Carrier system with 27kg (almost 60 pounds) max load\n\nFits riders 160cm and 190cm (5ft 2in to 6ft 2in)\n\nAccessory mounting points on head tube\n\nIntegrated front and rear lighting with daytime running light\n\nLCD display\n\nBasic app for iOS and Android\n\nPhotography by Thomas Ricker / The Verge"

Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of “effective altruism,” they have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission - a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives.\n\nThe Terms of Service of Anthropic’s defective altruism will never outweigh the safety, the readiness, or the lives of American troops on the battlefield.\n\nTheir true objective is unmistakable: to seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military. That is unacceptable.\n\nAs President Trump stated on Truth Social, the Commander-in-Chief and the American people alone will determine the destiny of our armed forces, not unelected tech executives.\n\nAnthropic’s stance is fundamentally incompatible with American principles. Their relationship with the United States Armed Forces and the Federal Government has therefore been permanently altered.\n\nIn conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security. Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic. Anthropic will continue to provide the Department of War its services for a period of no more than six months to allow for a seamless transition to a better and more patriotic service.\n\nAmerica’s warfighters will never be held hostage by the ideological whims of Big Tech.

            "content": "Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.\n\nYet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, Kodak, and others.\n\nAll the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.\n\nIf you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that offers great image quality and lets you choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like Kodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.\n\nTake a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for most people\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 306 grams / Charging method: AA batteries / Companion app: None / Other features: Built-in selfie mirror, film counter\n\nIf all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well-suited for kids and those new to photography.\n\nFor an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most struggle to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash helps. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both bright and dark environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. Photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before, but selfies captured my features and skin tone more accurately, thanks in part to the small front-facing mirror. The updated lens design also lets you twist into Close-Up Mode to zoom slightly and activate the Parallax Correction features for a more aligned photo. It’s a fun, point-and-shoot-style feature, though aligning photos still takes some practice (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).\n\nFor an instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 produces vivid, relatively true-to-life photos. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nThe Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the small counter that shows your remaining shots, which is a useful tracking feature given that each print costs about $1. However, it doesn’t support Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it doesn’t feature filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for a solid instant camera that caters to all ages and experience levels, you’ll likely be satisfied with the Instax Mini 12.\n\nThe best premium instant camera\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 285 grams / Charging method: USB-C (on newer models) / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nOne of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo was a favorite of my former colleague Becca Farcase — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a handsome brown version, as well as a newer pink model.\n\nIt’s easy to balk at its price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.\n\nBeing able to adjust the brightness of the prints helped me capture night photos and a low-light immersive exhibit a little more clearly and realistically, which is a feature the Instax Mini 12 doesn’t offer. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Mini 12, the Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can disable the flash, leverage the 3-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder, and adjust the brightness of a print — a helpful feature, given Evo doesn’t capture dark environments well. The camera’s dials also let you apply various lens options and effects, from retro filters to monochrome shades, and you can even take app-based remote shots, allowing for better seflies and more photographic control.\n\nThe Evo isn’t perfect, though. The companion app isn’t as feature-rich as competing software, the menu system can be confusing to navigate, and the camera’s internal storage maxes out at 45 images. Still, these are relatively minor drawbacks for a stylish, portable camera that makes it easy to quickly capture and print quality shots.\n\nThe best instant camera for social occasions\n\nFilm type: Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / Film size: 3 x 3-inch square prints / Weight: 467 grams / Charging method: Micro USB / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\n\nWhereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app lets you apply frames, stickers, filters, and a wide range of customization options to photos, making it great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature in the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making it a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.\n\nLike the Evo, the Shot 3 Retro features an LCD screen — albeit a much smaller one — that lets you decide whether to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp images from your phone. Unlike the Evo, however, the Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of film. It also uses cheaper film; you can often pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for under $20. The cheaper arguably encourages creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than those from both Fujifilm and Polaroid.\n\nPhotos taken with the Kodak Mini Shot 3 aren’t particularly sharp and can have an excessive pink tint. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nHowever, there are notable drawbacks to the Shot 3 Retro. The resulting prints aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone, for one, nor were they as clear or sharp as what you might get with the Evo or Mini 12 (some even have an excessive pink tint). The Shot 3 Retro doesn’t store images the way the Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish. Nonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.\n\nThe best instant camera for retro fans\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / Weight: 648 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: Yes / Other features: Flip-up lid, scene analysis feature\n\nIf you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the Polaroid Flip is the camera for you. It resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 more than any other camera on our list, thanks to its classic, retro-inspired design and flip-up lid. Its square I-Type film prints and iconic white frame give photos an authentically vintage look, while modern touches like Bluetooth, USB-C charging, and a beginner-friendly companion app add greater convenience and creative control.\n\nCompared to the third-gen Polaroid Now Plus, my former retro pick, the Flip delivers clearer shots with fewer wasted photos, making the extra $50 worthwhile given that eight I-Type sheets are a spendy $18.99. The increased clarity can be attributed to several factors, including the Flip’s sonar autofocus and a four-lens hyperfocal system — which result in sharper, more focused images — along with its excellent flash. It’s the most powerful of any Polaroid camera, and while it can sometimes overexpose images, you can adjust exposure directly from the camera or app. The Scene Analysis feature also helps by warning if a shot is likely to be over- or underexposed, or if you’re too close to your subject. In my experience, the warnings didn’t always prevent overexposure, but they did leave me with shots that looked less blown than those from the Now Plus.\n\nA few outdoor examples I captured with the Polaroid Flip. Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nAll that being said, there are some notable drawbacks. The Flip is relatively heavy and awkwardly sized, so you can’t slip it into a purse or easily carry it around. Prints also take up to 15 minutes to develop — during which they must be shielded from light — which can be quite an inconvenience. Low-light performance remains a weak spot as well, and I struggled to capture indoor shots given the contrast and saturation are lower than with Instax film. Admittedly, this gave my pictures a more dreamy, vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust the saturation and exposure settings.\n\nTruth be told, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, the Flip is the perfect camera for you.\n\nThe best instant camera for portability\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / Weight: 239 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: No / Other features: Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter\n\nWhereas the Flip is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It weighs just over a pound and fits easily in the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it the most portable instant camera on our list. If its images were more true to life and didn’t require you to sheild them from the light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d call it the best instant camera for kids or travel.\n\nAt $89.99, the latest Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera available, with film that costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (a 16-sheet pack runs $21.99). The new Go sports a few upgrades over the last-gen model, including USB-C support, and Polaroid claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor. Photos are slightly brighter, though the original Go produced warmer images that felt more true to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low, but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Flip.\n\nThe second-gen Polaroid Go produces charming photos but with a cooler tone. Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nUnlike the Flip, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. There’s no Bluetooth or companion app for added effects; however, the camera does include a self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. The smaller prints may disappoint those who prefer traditional Polaroid sizes, though, and its modern design lacks the retro charm of older models. But classic Polaroid cameras didn’t come with an app, either, and the Go’s simplicity makes it an a easy-to-use option that delivers a traditional instant film experience at less than half the price of the Flip.\n\nOther instant cameras to consider\n\nFujifilm’s $116.99 Instax Mini 41 is the long-awaited follow-up to the Mini 40. The updated model retains the retro design found on the prior model but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups. It didn’t take long testing the Mini 41 for me to realize it’s simply the Mini 12 for adults. With its black-and-silver body and flatter, squarer edges, the Mini 41 looks sleeker and more stylish. The two cameras are nearly identical, aside from the design, with the same solid photo quality and feature set. Both battery-powered options turn on with a simple twist of the lens, and each comes equipped with a selfie mirror, a close-up mode, and a flash (which cannot be disabled).\n\nThere are a few subtle upgrades to the Mini 41, however. A textured grip in the front makes it easier to hold, and its shape makes shooting in landscape mode more comfortable. But those are small differences, and at their core, the cameras offer the same experience. Since the Instax Mini 12 retails for less, I ultimately believe it’s the better value; however, if a fashionable, mature look appeals to you, the Mini 41 is a great alternative, especially if you can find it on sale.\n\nIf you’re looking for an advanced analog instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At $234.95, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12 or the Mini 41, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click cameras given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket, an aluminum extension column, and a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur when capturing fast-moving subjects.\n\nThanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12, Mini 41, and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera, not a hybrid like the Evo, so you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The newer model is also less user-friendly than the Mini 12 and Mini 41, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters.\n\nThe Kodak Smile Plus is another hybrid instant camera that allows you to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $129.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with a physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers.\n\nHowever, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark.\n\nThat said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software isn’t as snappy or feature-rich, it still lets you add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it’s often available for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.\n\nFrom photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, Leica’s Sofort 2 is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.\n\nThe drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s challenging to recommend at $399, as most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The Leica user interface is easier to navigate, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also appreciate that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.\n\nWhile it didn’t make the cut, the Instax Square SQ1 is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and features a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $159.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100. That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Flip and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.\n\nFujifilm also sells the newer Instax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at $199.95. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.\n\nFujifilm’s Instax Wide Evo Hybrid is nearly identical to the Instax Mini Evo. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $409.95 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lenses and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.\n\nPlus, unlike the Wide 400, the Wide Evo Hybrid is a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful feature that can reduce wasted shots. However, at $409.95, it costs significantly more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken, which is something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects, such as a dog or hyperactive toddler.\n\nIf you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $409.95 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $175.95 Instax Wide 400 is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar stills to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.\n\nFujifilm’s new Instax Mini LiPlay Plus isn’t nearly as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo, but it’s worth considering if you take a lot of selfies. At $234.99, the hybrid camera costs the same as the Instax Mini Evo, but features a 3-inch LCD screen on the back, along with a second, rear-facing wide-angle lens designed specifically for self-portraits. That dedicated selfie camera, paired with the LCD, delivers some of the best — and most precise — selfies I’ve captured with an instant camera to date.\n\nThe LiPlay Plus also includes some fun extra features, such as a layered photo mode that combines images from both cameras into a single shot. It can also record short audio clips, which are saved as a QR code you can place in a corner of the printed photo. Both features are enjoyable to play with, though the layered photo mode can, admittedly, come off as gimmicky. You’re basically just dropping a selfie onto a background image with no way to reposition or resize it.\n\nWhat I’m looking for How we test instant cameras Collapse Typically, I try to spend at least a couple of weeks, if not months, testing each camera to get a sense of what it would be like to actually own one. I’ll use them to capture photos of loved ones while hanging out, as well as subjects and scenes I stumble across as I explore Los Angeles and its many beaches. I shoot indoors and outside, with and without the flash, allowing me to compare how each camera performs in both bright and low-light environments.I also ask friends and family — both young and old — for their input on image quality, and I have them take photos with the instant camera to get their thoughts on usability. If the camera comes with extra features, such as filters or support for a companion app, I’ll make sure to put them to the test in real-life situations. I note how easy it is to pull up and navigate the app, apply the effects, and, of course, how the results look. Photo quality Collapse Instant cameras aren’t known for producing high-quality, sharp photos, and most struggle in low-light conditions. However, the photos should at least be clear and bright enough that the subject is discernible and the picture looks relatively true to life. Ease of use Collapse How easy is it to set the instant camera up and take photos with it? Ease of use is a big part of what makes instant cameras fun and accessible to people of all ages. You shouldn’t need a professional photography background just to enjoy an instant camera. Value Collapse Instant cameras come with different features at various price points. Generally, the more feature-rich cameras tend to be pricier, but do the extra capabilities justify the added cost? Some cameras, for example, pair with a companion app or feature a built-in selfie mirror, while others let you print images from your phone. None of these are essential, though the added niceties may be worth it for some people. Suitability Collapse Some instant cameras aren’t as well-suited for certain situations and / or people as others. For example, there are instant cameras that print old-fashioned Polaroid photos that aren’t very clear. They frustrate me, but retro lovers might find them charming. Other cameras come with advanced creative modes that let you edit photos and even print smartphone photos, but a young child might find them difficult to use. Film Collapse Each instant camera requires a different kind of film, which means that the sticker price of the camera isn’t the true price. This is something you should take into account before making a purchase, as the cost of film can quickly add up. Depending on the brand, you may have to pay anywhere between 50 cents and $2 a shot.It’s also important to take into account that some film is easier to find. The Instax Mini 12, for example, uses credit card-size Instax Mini film that’s sold at most major retailers. Other types of film, including the film needed for Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, are available on Amazon but aren’t sold by as many retailers.Finally, most instant camera brands sell films of varying quality in a range of styles. Some are decorated with colorful frames and patterns, while others are black and white. They also vary in shape and size, from small rectangular prints you can stick in your wallet to square-shaped ones. You can also buy wider prints, and some brands even sell film with an adhesive backing that allows you to use the resulting images as stickers.\n\nUpdate, February 27th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and shorten the copy for all of our main entries."

The Artemis III mission, scheduled for 2027, was originally going to attempt to land on the Moon but will now be a test flight instead. NASA also says it’s “increasing its cadence of missions,” including adding a second test flight in 2027 and aiming for “at least one surface landing every year thereafter,” including the Artemis IV landing.\n\nThe overhaul to the Artemis launch schedule follows a report from NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) earlier this month that highlighted serious safety risks with NASA’s previous plans for future launches. ASAP was particularly concerned about Artemis III, which its report said included too many “cumulative technical, operational, and schedule risks associated with multiple first-of-a-kind objectives planned for a single mission.”\n\nThe Artemis II mission, scheduled for this year, has faced a string of issues during testing over recent weeks, delaying its launch until no earlier than April. Artemis II is intended to orbit the Moon — if it’s successful, it will be the first time humans visit lunar orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance’s merger agreement is now official. On Friday, the two companies announced plans to merge into a massive media company that will fold WBD’s studio, linear channels, streaming service, and gaming segment into Paramount.\n\nThough WBD initially signed onto an $83 billion agreement to merge part of Warner Bros. with Netflix, Paramount persisted with a hostile takeover bid, followed by a series of offers. That persistence paid off, as WBD determined that Paramount’s “best and final” offer is “superior” to Netflix’s deal. On Thursday, Netflix declined to match Paramount’s bid, calling it “no longer financially attractive.”\n\nParamount and WBD say the board of directors of both companies has signed off on the deal. The companies expect it to close in the third quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. Under the agreement, Paramount will acquire WBD in a deal valued at $110 billion. Paramount has also agreed to cover the $7 billion regulatory termination fee and the $2.8 billion breakup fee owed to Netflix, which it has already paid, according to Bloomberg.\n\n“Together, Paramount and WBD will deliver greater choice for consumers through its leading streaming platforms with an exceptional intellectual property portfolio that has produced popular franchises such as Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Top Gun, the DC Universe and SpongeBob SquarePants,” the companies say in the press release.\n\nLawmakers and regulators are skeptical about the Paramount-WBD merger. “A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a statement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta also warned that the agreement isn’t a “done deal,” and that the state’s Department of Justice will be “vigorous” in its review of the merger."

            "content": "Where’s the Trump phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump phone’s whereabouts, and have stopped getting a response. This week, thanks to a reader tip, we think we’ve found the original phone the T1 is based on.\n\nA long time ago, back when the Trump phone was but a single, inaccurate render and a contradictory spec sheet, we tried to figure out what other phone it might be based on. Now, eight months, two spec overhauls, and one redesign later, I have a good guess: the HTC U24 Pro.\n\nI didn’t spot this by myself. A reader first tipped me off to the similarities between the U24 Pro and the Trump phone I revealed a few weeks ago, which are numerous: a similar angled body and curved display, a unique front sensor array, and broadly similar specs, including oddities like a headphone jack and microSD card support.\n\nLet’s get one thing out the way at the top: I’m pretty sure HTC isn’t secretly building the Trump phone. Sohaib Ahmed, the company’s global director of PR, told me as much: “HTC does not design or manufacture phones for third parties.” But that doesn’t rule out another company playing a part in designing or building both phones, and given just how similar they look, I suspect that’s exactly what happened.\n\nIt’s a little hard to make out in this screenshot, but the Trump phone shares the sharply angled edges of the HTC U24 Pro. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nThe U24 Pro is an odd phone in its own right. It launched in 2024 for €549 (around $600 at the time), and was heralded in some corners as a return from the dead for HTC, despite the fact that it followed the U23 Pro a year earlier, and a string of smaller releases that targeted the Asian market. HTC, once one of the major players in the Android phone industry, had been greatly diminished ever since selling a large part of its smartphone business to Google for $1.1 billion in 2017.\n\nBoth the T1 Phone and the U24 Pro share a slightly asymmetric angular frame, jutting out into a point along every edge, with a heavily curved screen on the front. I cannot think of, nor find, another phone that is quite the same shape — even small details like the positions of the antenna lines around the power and volume buttons line up. Even more telling is the set of sensors along each phone’s top. The U24 Pro splits up its speaker grill, notification LED, and proximity sensor into three, resulting in an unusual design with a long bar, a small dot for the LED, and then a second shorter bar, at the point where the display meets the phone’s top. What looks like the same sensor design can be clearly seen on the Trump phone I was shown, though I can’t confirm that the sensors themselves are the same, or that the T1 Phone will also have a notification LED.\n\nBoth phones have near-identical sets of speakers and sensors about the front selfie camera, with headphone jack and microphone visible behind them on the top edges. Screenshot: The Verge and Screenshot: JerryRigEverything\n\nOther details are subtler. It’s hard to tell exactly from the glimpses I got of the Trump phone, but along the top frame it certainly looks to have both a headphone jack and a microphone in the exact same positions as on the HTC device. Even having a headphone jack in the first place is evidence of the phones’ connection, given how rare the feature is in modern devices. The same can be said for the fact that both phones include a microSD card slot, sharing support for up to 1TB cards on top of a base 512GB of storage.\n\nWhile the rear cameras look completely different, which seems to scupper my theory, look again: The U24 Pro’s cameras are split into a pair close together, with a third lens lower down. The new Trump phone sets all its cameras in one mount, but they’re unevenly spaced, with a larger gap between the second and third lenses. These cameras may look totally different on the surface, but I suspect that underneath you’ll find they’re similar. And what we know of the specs matches too: Trump Mobile told me that its phone will have 50-megapixel sensors for both the main and selfie cameras, and my glimpse of its camera UI showed an ultrawide and a 2x zoom option — all of which you’ll find on the U24 Pro.\n\nThe two phones’ cameras look different at first, but the unusual lens placement might just line up. Screenshot: Dominic Preston / The Verge and Image: HTC\n\nAssuming that the two phones are essentially the same, does the U24 Pro tell us any more about what to expect from the T1? It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, matching what I’d been told about a Snapdragon 7-series chip in the Trump phone. The U24 Pro has a 6.8-inch OLED display, 60W wired charging and even wireless charging support, and an IP67 rating for dust and water protection. There’s reason to be cautious reading too much into the spec sheet, though: The U24 Pro released with a 4,600mAh battery, smaller than the 5,000mAh capacity I’ve been told will be in the Trump phone. If that spec differs, then other elements of the internals could well too — the bigger battery in particular might replace the wireless charging coils of the HTC phone.\n\nThe U24 Pro launched to middling reviews, which may not inspire much confidence in Trump Mobile’s offering. Tech Advisor gave the phone two and a half stars out of five, calling it “hard to recommend over rivals,” while Notebookcheck declared it “modern and yet out of date.” Still, it fared surprisingly well in a JerryRigEverything teardown and durability test.\n\nHe noticed, however, that this didn’t appear to be the HTC of old, lacking the sapphire crystal HTC previously used on its displays and optical image stabilization on the front camera it once pioneered. The U24 Pro and other HTC phones released in the last few years share little consistent design language, and ship with near-stock Android software. Speculation has been rife that HTC isn’t in fact manufacturing the phones internally, but had commissioned an ODM — original design manufacturer — to produce the hardware. ODMs design and manufacture phones for other companies, usually to a set of specifications provided by the consumer-facing brands, and often retain ownership of the designs, allowing them to reuse and repurpose them for other clients. I asked HTC for clarification, but the company wouldn’t confirm whether the U24 Pro was made in-house or contracted out.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that Trump Mobile, or its manufacturing partner, is simply ripping off the design of a little-known HTC device. But I think the most likely answer here is a more mundane one: HTC probably worked with some unnamed ODM to design and manufacture the U24 Pro, and Trump Mobile just happened to work with the same company. That manufacturer may have either dug out its old designs for HTC when developing the T1 Phone, or perhaps gave new life to old, unused components from HTC’s production run. Without knowing the hypothetical ODM involved, it’s hard to say for sure. Trump Mobile has previously confirmed that it’s working with a partner or partners to manufacture its phones outside the US, before their “final assembly” in Miami, but executive Don Hendrickson wouldn’t tell me the name of its manufacturer or where it’s based. I reached out to the company again for comment on this story, and received no reply.\n\nSo no, I don’t think that HTC made the Trump phone. But it does look likely that it is based, more or less, on one of that company’s phones. It remains to be seen how the T1 Phone will differ in its details, but the fact that its origins seem so closely tied to an unpopular midranger from two years ago doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the T1 Phone’s flagship credentials.\n\nGot inside information on Trump Mobile or the Trump phone?

Gottumkkala had requested special permission to use ChatGPT, despite the AI being off-limits for other DHS employees.\n\nGottumkkala’s departure follows a downturn at CISA over the past year as the agency has been “gutted and politicized” by the Trump administration, resulting in budget cuts, layoffs, and wavering trust from local leaders. CISA is also still without a Senate-confirmed director. Trump nominated Sean Plankey for the role last year, then renominated him in January.

            "content": "Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.\n\nThe blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.\n\nThe Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.\n\nAccess to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.\n\nWe understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase.

Supabase continues to follow up through all available channels to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nWe continue to advise affected customers… — Supabase (@supabase) February 27, 2026\n\nAn Indian founder, who asked not to be named to avoid potential repercussions, told TechCrunch they had stopped seeing new user sign-ups from India over the past two to three days. A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.\n\nWhile Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.\n\nAt the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nA screenshot showing Supabase’s access blocked on ACT Fibernet Image Credits:Screenshot / Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\n\nNotably, Supabase’s main website remained accessible in India — but its underlying developer infrastructure did not.\n\nIndia is Supabase’s fourth-largest source of traffic, accounting for about 9% of global visits, according to data from Similarweb, highlighting the potential fallout for the country’s developer ecosystem. The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.\n\nThe incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.\n\n“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.”\n\nIndia has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted access to developer platform GitHub, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also reported that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.\n\nFounded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has gained traction amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its valuation to $5 billion.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond."

            "content": "In a post on Truth Social, President Trump directed federal agencies to cease use of all Anthropic products after the company’s public dispute with the Department of Defense. The president allowed for a six-month phase-out period for departments using the products, but emphasized that Anthropic was no longer welcome as a federal contractor.\n\n“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again,” the president wrote in the post.\n\nNotably, the president’s post did not mention any plans to designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk, as had been previously mentioned as a consequence. However, a subsequent tweet from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made good on the threat.\n\n“In conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security,” Secretary Hegseth wrote. “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\n\nThe Pentagon dispute centered on Anthropic’s refusal to allow its AI models to be used to power either mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, which Secretary Hegseth found unduly restrictive.\n\nCEO Dario Amodei reiterated his stance in a public post on Thursday, refusing to compromise on the two points.\n\n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters — with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei wrote at the time. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Per the BBC, CEO Sam Altman sent a memo to staff on Thursday saying he shared the same “red lines” and that any OpenAI-related defense contracts would also reject uses that were “unlawful or unsuited to cloud deployments, such as domestic surveillance and autonomous offensive weapons.”\n\nOpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who very publicly fell out with Altman in November 2023 and has since co-founded his own AI company, also waded into the conversation on Friday, writing on X: “It’s extremely good that Anthropic has not backed down, and it’s significant that OpenAI has taken a similar stance.”\n\nBut within hours of the Trump administration ordering federal agencies to cut ties with Anthropic, OpenAI moved to fill the void, announcing a deal with the Pentagon that Altman said preserved the same core principles Anthropic had fought for — prohibitions on domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, OpenAI and the government began meeting about a potential tie-up on Wednesday of this week.\n\nSurely, there will be more twists to come.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI and Google each received contract awards from the U.S. Defense Department last July. While some Google employees have come out in support of Anthropic, Google and its parent company have yet to comment.\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\n\nStill, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more."

            "content": "The idea of using a laptop cooling pad feels antiquated. These days, laptop chips have become extremely efficient. The fans on MacBooks (if they even have them) are barely used, and both Intel and Qualcomm are pushing efficiency on the Windows front.\n\nBut people keep buying laptop cooling pads, so surely there is a use case in 2026 that actually makes sense, right? I tried out a couple cooling pads paired with a couple of different gaming laptops, and walked away surprised at how effective they could be.\n\nDo Cooling Pads Actually Work?\n\nPhotograph: Luke Larsen\n\nLaptop cooling pads have been around for decades, and the idea has always been simple: provide extra air to blow through a laptop that’s otherwise restricted by its own cooling system. In theory, more air means lower temperatures—and, ultimately, better performance. This is the whole idea of the power modes that exist in Windows, which ramp up the RPMs (rotations per minute) of the fans to add more air to both improve performance. More than that, less heat also means a longer-lasting laptop that doesn't degrade as quickly over time. It’s by that same logic that laptop cooling pads offer help.\n\nThe problem, however, is that a cooling pad is a rather inefficient way of transferring air into your device. Most laptop cooling pads, including the two that I tested, use one large fan or two smaller fans to blast cold air across the bottom of the laptop. This is the first reason why the vast majority of modern laptops won’t benefit much from a cooling pad, as these laptops tend to only have vents along the hinge. Without vents or open holes, blowing air across a sheet of metal or plastic isn't going to do anything to cool the components on the other side. It'll only generate a bunch of fan noise.\n\nGaming laptops are the main exception, though, which is why they are the primary use case for such an accessory. Most gaming laptops have a few open vents, usually above the fans, like the Razer Blade 16, which is one of the laptops I used to test these cooling pads. Laptops like the Blade 16 are designed for intensive tasks like gaming, video editing, or local AI processing—and use a high-wattage GPU and CPU to get the kind of performance you need. My model has two of the most powerful laptop components on the market: the RTX 5090 and Ryzen 9 HX 370. As you might guess, they generate a lot of heat when cranked up. Modern chips tend to max out at 100 degrees Celsius, before throttling back performance to bring down temperatures.\n\nMost laptops use fans to cool these components, but the thickness of the laptop chassis is also a determining factor in how much the system will need to throttle back performance to keep temperatures down. In the end, it's geometry and physics, and every millimeter of space in the laptop chassis has an effect on how cool it can keep its internal components. And unlike in a large desktop PC, you have very restricted space. That's especially true in the modern era, where even gaming laptops have become increasingly thin."

US senator Maggie Hassan launched the investigation in August after an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, copublished by WIRED, found that some data brokers were hiding opt-out tools from Google and other search engines.\n\nThe US Department of Justice’s recent release of 3 million documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein included grand jury subpoenas to Google that shed light on how federal investigators interact with tech companies and how they respond to government requests for information.\n\nThe Mexican drug cartel CJNG may survive the killing of its longtime leader Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes in part thanks to its prolific use of technologies like drones, social media, and AI. Meanwhile, the Mexican Navy announced on Thursday that it had seized a semi-submersible vessel carrying nearly 4 tons of cocaine as part of a recent initiative to deter drug trafficking in the Pacific Ocean. The effort comes as the US has launched its own purported campaign against maritime trafficking via a series of deadly attacks on boats in the Caribbean.\n\nMeanwhile, as AI assistant agents like OpenClaw explode in popularity—and sow chaos around the web—a new open source project called IronCurtain is using a unique design to secure and constrain agentic AI before it can go rogue.\n\nAnd there’s more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nSetting an autonomous internet-enabled robot loose in your house should give anyone a moment’s pause. When that robot is a roving vacuum cleaner equipped with a camera and microphone that could be hijacked from anywhere in the world with nothing more than its serial number, it becomes an actual privacy horror story.\n\nOne such robovac owner, Sammy Azdoufal, discovered that absurd security vulnerability while attempting an experiment in piloting his DJI Romo robot vacuum cleaner with a PS5 controller. He found that he could instead control 6,700 of the robots in 24 countries around the world, with full access to the floor plans they generated of their owners’ homes and their video and audio feeds. When The Verge contacted Azdoufal, he was able to instantly access a Romo owned by a staffer at the tech news outlet just by knowing its 14-digit serial number. DJI has now fixed the vulnerability in response to Azdoufal essentially live-tweeting his findings. But the story nonetheless raises serious questions about the security of other audio- or video-enabled internet-of-things gadgets—not to mention ones capable of freely roaming your home.\n\nWhile the Department of Homeland has been hugely empowered under the Trump administration in its mission to deport millions of immigrants, the organization within DHS that serves as the United States’ primary cyber defender, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, has been neglected. Now its acting director, Madhu Gottumukkala, has been replaced as CISA seeks to find new footing.\n\nEven before that news, CyberScoop this week reported on the crises that have plagued the agency for the entire first year since Trump’s inauguration: A third of the staff has been laid off and entire divisions of the agency have been closed. Nominations for a permanent director have been blocked in Congress. Its capabilities have withered, and organizations that had sought out CISA for assistance and partnerships have looked elsewhere. Gottumukkala has suffered his own more personal scandals such as ousting security personnel after he failed a polygraph test and sharing sensitive contracts on ChatGPT. Now Nick Andersen, who has served as CISA’s executive director for cybersecurity, will replace Gottumukkala at the beleaguered agency.\n\nA researcher at King’s College London pitted three popular large language models against each other in simulated war game scenarios and found that, 95 percent of the time, at least one of the models opted to deploy tactical nuclear weapons. The researcher also found, when an AI model deployed a tactical nuclear weapon, its AI opponent only deescalated a fourth of the time. None of the companies behind the three models—OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic—responded to New Scientist’s request for comment.\n\nAI’s role in war-fighting has lurched into the spotlight this week. Anthropic and the Department of War are embroiled in a contract dispute over whether Anthropic’s AI models can be used to power fully autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance. Dario Amodei, Anthropic’s CEO, wrote in a statement that these types of use cases “can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.” In turn, President Donald Trump has threatened to ban the use of Anthropic products, including its Claude chatbot, within the US government. Meanwhile, hundreds of Google and OpenAI employees have signed an open letter asking for their bosses to “put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War's current demands for permission to use our models for domestic mass surveillance and autonomously killing people without human oversight.”\n\nA new app for Android phones called Nearby Glasses lets users scan for smart glasses in your vicinity, revealing the presence of the wearable gadgets, which are sometimes indistinguishable from normal glasses and let wearers record people without their knowledge. The app scans for the unique Bluetooth signatures that the glasses emit, and sends users a notification if it detects a nearby source.\n\nThe developer told 404 Media that he was inspired to build the app after reading about several incidents involving smart glasses. Over the summer, 404 Media reported that a Customs and Border Protection agent had donned a pair during an immigration raid, and this fall the outlet also reported that men were using smart glasses to film massage parlor workers, seemingly without their knowledge or consent. In February, The New York Times reported that one smart-glasses developer, Meta, had plans to integrate face recognition into its glasses, spurring fresh concerns among privacy experts."

            "content": "As a vegan, my choices for plant-centric meal kits are, let's say, limited, compared to the extremely omnivorous WIRED reviewer Matthew Korfhage, who has tested nearly two dozen meal kits with everything from spicy shrimp to garlic filet mignon and plum pork loin.\n\nI've tested several plant-based meal kits, which, unlike normal meal kits, are often much more expensive than my usual produce-heavy weekly grocery haul, and also seriously limited in their rotating plant-based or vegetarian options.\n\nAll this to say, I was pleasantly surprised when I tried EveryPlate's vegetarian fare for a week. Each meal came to $7 per serving for two people for four meals, but oftentimes the leftovers ended up stretching over several meals. (There's a discount running at the time of writing, with each serving going for $3—which is almost ramen pricing these days.) In total, my first box of four meals ended up being $56 without discount and $24 with the first-time discount (not including shipping cost of $11), and fed me for almost the entire week. That's cheaper than my usual weekly grocery bill at Trader Joe's in NYC.\n\nAlthough EveryPlate meals could be boring, with a pasta or rice base and lots of cheese, each was tasty enough that I actually looked forward to eating the leftovers. I was actually excited to make (and eat) the next planned meal—a rarity in my time testing meal kits, to be honest.\n\nPlan, Preferences, and Picking Process\n\nCourtesy of EveryPlate\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage Save to wishlist Save to wishlist EveryPlate Meal Kit Shop at EveryPlate\n\nAfter testing many meal kits, one thing I've grown to appreciate is transparency when it comes to meal choices and price. EveryPlate has both. At a regular price of $7 a serving plus shipping, HelloFresh's budget offering, EveryPlate, is still the lowest-cost meal kit either Korfhage or I have tested; it's cheaper than other budget choices, and even meal kits for toddlers."

            "content": "It's boom time for water filters, ever since the EPA announced that as many as 10 percent of US water systems may have unsafe levels of PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals,” in the water. Lead pipes are still all over the place, even if they're no longer in Flint, Michigan, as of July 2025. Heck, there are maybe heavy metals in the groundwater, depending where you are, and bottled water risks excess microplastics.\n\nI don't say this to panic you. Your drinking water is probably in compliance with federal standards, and only around 4 percent of water systems end up with unsafe contaminant levels, according to an EPA study in 2020. This said, local water systems won't have to comply with the new federal PFAS and PFOA maximums for drinking water until 2031.\n\nIn response to worries about the water supply, a whole new generation of water filters are making wondrous promises about reductions in contaminants: chlorine, PFAS, heavy metals, stray pharmaceuticals like acetaminophen, fluoride if that's a worry for you. Some of these are whole-home or under-sink reverse osmosis systems. Others are simple countertop systems, gravity-fed through mesh or carbon or other filters.\n\nSo how do you sort out which water claims are credible? I've been testing water filters since 2024, often using chemical indicators and equipment, and can attest that it isn't always easy. Here's a quick guide to checking up on that water filter that caught your eye.\n\nWhat Are NSF/ANSI Water Filter Standards?\n\nThe first main sources of comfort for me when assessing water filters are certifications and independent testing. Vague claims of 99 percent reduction in chlorine or PFAS or arsenic are harder to trust if the testing is internal to the company itself. To be credible, any claims of third-party testing should also clearly identify the lab that conducted the testing.\n\nThe most reliable, standardized form of certification is testing against NSF/ANSI standards. The NSF, formerly called the National Sanitation Foundation, is a Michigan-based, nongovernmental nonprofit founded in 1944 that develops and verifies adherence to a number of different testing standards—including those for water filters. ANSI, or the American National Standards Institute, is an independent nonprofit that accredits accreditation and testing organizations like the NSF.\n\nThere are three main NSF/ANSI standards that apply to filters for home drinking water."

            "content": "“I don't like talking to you wearing that. It's intimidating.”\n\nA friend said this to me—and he's not joking. His name is Stuart. Stuart is about as affable a person as you could wish to meet, and we have skied together three or four times. Now, however, he doesn't want anything to do with me. I haven't upset him, we are on good terms—but he hates what I've got on my head. By the end of the week, so do I.\n\nThe intimidating headgear I'm wearing is the Ruroc RG2. It is, according to Ruroc, the world’s only full-face snowsports helmet—and now I can fully understand why, despite initially thinking it looked like the ideal lid to replace my aging POC. On paper, the RG2 should be a winner, despite a starting price of $379 (making it more expensive than nearly all of WIRED's picks in our ski helmet guide). Only when you wear it do the drawbacks become abundantly clear.\n\nThe RG2 is actually an ISPO Award-winning helmet. It has a built-in Twiceme NFC chip, so you can store critical medical information that can be easily accessed by first responders in emergencies. To protect your noggin, it's lined with Rheon, a breathable, energy-absorbing polymer (originally conceived from a NASA project looking at space shuttle foam replacements) that's flexible in its natural state but instantly stiffens on impact.\n\nFor even more outlay, there's an optional JBL-powered Cardo Communication System that lets you stream music, take calls, connect with a GoPro, and chat with up to 15 other equally intimidating Ruroc users on a mesh network.\n\nThe big boon of the RG2 over the original RG1, however, comes down to a simple tweak in this updated design. In the RG1, you secured the lower face plate using plastic clips that slid—usually unwillingly—into place. It worked, but any supposed cool factor for wearers was immediately ruined as others watched them attempt to wrestle those clips into place with no helpful mirrors on hand outside your average ski lift or mountain restaurant. The solution? Magnets. Ruroc finally made that call after sifting through “15 years of direct feedback.\"\n\nSloping off: The RG2's full-face setup proved to be a look not conducive to social skiing. Photograph: Jeremy White\n\nGone are the plastic clips and in comes the Magnetic Mask System, which “lets users easily remove the helmet’s chin piece while wearing gloves.” Trouble is, taking the chin piece off was never the problem. Putting the darn thing on was the issue. Still, this new magnetic system is definitely easier, but it's by no means foolproof, and you will still likely have to take two or three stabs at getting it locked in each time you want to add it to the helmet."

            "content": "United States and Israeli forces have launched military strikes against Iran, with President Donald Trump calling the attacks a “major combat operation” against the Iranian regime.\n\nExplosions within Iran were first recorded in the early hours of Saturday morning ET, with smoke rising above the capital city Tehran. Shortly after the first reports of the attacks emerged, both the US and Israel claimed responsibility for the strikes. Explosions have subsequently been heard in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, in what appeared to be retaliatory Iranian strikes.\n\nIn an eight-minute video posted to Truth Social and X, Trump said the operation’s objective was to “defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement confirming the military operation and said Israel was aiming to “remove the existential threat posed” by Iran.\n\nThe strikes on Iran, which have been called Operation Epic Fury by the so-called US Department of War and Operation Roaring Lion by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), reportedly hit multiple cities across the country. The impact, targets, and damage caused by the strikes was not immediately clear.\n\nShortly after confirming launching the attacks, the IDF said it had “identified” Iranian missiles being launched towards Israel. Iran’s response to the attacks appeared to include launching missiles towards other countries in the region that host US military bases.\n\nThe US embassy in Bahrain issued an alert saying that missile or drone attacks could be imminent, with images later showing potential explosions around the capital Manama. The United Arab Emirates Ministry of Defense posted on X that it has intercepted “several Iranian missiles” and that building damage had resulted in the death of “an individual of Asian nationality.” Qatar’s defence ministry also confirmed it had intercepted missiles."

            "content": "US secretary of defense Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon to designate Anthropic a “supply-chain risk” on Friday, sending shock waves through Silicon Valley and leaving many companies scrambling to understand whether they can keep using one of the industry’s most popular AI models.\n\n“Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic,” Hegseth wrote in a social media post.\n\nThe designation comes after weeks of tense negotiations between the Pentagon and Anthropic over how the US military could use the startup’s AI models. In a blog post this week, Anthropic argued its contracts with the Pentagon should not allow for its technology to be used for mass domestic surveillance of Americans or fully autonomous weapons. The Pentagon asked that Anthropic agree to let the US military apply its AI to “all lawful uses” with no specific exceptions.\n\nA supply-chain-risk designation allows the Pentagon to restrict or exclude certain vendors from defense contracts if they’re deemed to pose security vulnerabilities, such as risks related to foreign ownership, control, or influence. It is intended to protect sensitive military systems and data from potential compromise.\n\nAnthropic responded in another blog post on Friday evening, saying it would “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court,” and that such a designation would “set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government.”\n\nAnthropic added that it hadn’t received any direct communication from the Department of Defense or the White House regarding negotiations over the use of its AI models.\n\n“Secretary Hegseth has implied this designation would restrict anyone who does business with the military from doing business with Anthropic. The Secretary does not have the statutory authority to back up this statement,” the company wrote.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment.\n\n“This is the most shocking, damaging, and overreaching thing I have ever seen the United States government do,” says Dean Ball, a senior fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation and the former senior policy adviser for AI at the White House. “We have essentially just sanctioned an American company. If you are an American, you should be thinking about whether or not you should live here 10 years from now.”\n\nPeople across Silicon Valley chimed in on social media expressing similar shock and dismay. “The people running this administration are impulsive and vindictive. I believe this is sufficient to explain their behavior,” Paul Graham, founder of the startup accelerator Y Combinator said.\n\nBoaz Barak, an OpenAI researcher, said in a post that “kneecapping one of our leading AI companies is right about the worst own goal we can do. I hope very much that cooler heads prevail and this announcement is reversed.”\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced on Friday night that the company reached an agreement with the Department of Defense to deploy its AI models in classified environments, seemingly with carve-outs. “Two of our most important safety principles are prohibitions on domestic mass surveillance and human responsibility for the use of force, including for autonomous weapon systems,” said Altman. “The DoW agrees with these principles, reflects them in law and policy, and we put them into our agreement.”\n\nConfused Customers\n\nIn its Friday blog post, Anthropic said a supply-chain-risk designation, under the authority 10 USC 3252, only applies to Department of Defense contracts directly with suppliers, and doesn’t cover how contractors use its Claude AI software to serve other customers.\n\nThree experts in federal contracts say it’s impossible at this point to determine which Anthropic customers, if any, must now cut ties with the company. Hegseth’s announcement “is not mired in any law we can divine right now,” says Alex Major, a partner at the law firm McCarter & English, which works with tech companies."

            "content": "Other Wireless Chargers We Tested\n\nThere are a lot of wireless chargers. Here are a few more we like, but for one reason or another don't warrant a place above.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nKrafted Couch Wireless Charger for $52: I thought this wireless charger that’s designed to be draped over the arm of your couch was a great idea when I saw it, but the ridges failed to keep it in place on my velvety couch, so it kept slipping down the side. The silicone finish with the Krafted logo is also a bit ugly. It's just a silicone mat with a magnetic charger inside, though there is a fairly generous 6.6-foot (2-meter) cable, and it is Qi2 rated. If you’re always rooting around for a charger and one of the colors blends well with your furniture, it might be a good solution for you.\n\nEinova Eggtronic Charging Stone for $70: Made with 100 percent solid marble or stone—you can choose from a variety. Every single pick in this guide looks very much like a wireless charger, but I've had visiting friends ask if this one is a drink coaster. (I'm still figuring out whether that's a good or bad thing.) It has zero LEDs, perfect for bedrooms; just try to hide the cable to truly make it blend into your home. We recommend putting a case on your phone when using it with this charger, as there's a risk of scuffing up the back with these harder surfaces.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nBaseus Nomos 5-in-1 Charging Station for $100: If you liked the PicoGo W2 above but need more gadget-charging power, this 5-in-1 could be worth a look. It also has a tilting pad and retractable USB-C cable, but adds two more USB-C ports and one USB-A, along with a stats-filled display. It’s perfect for your desktop. I also tried and quite liked the Baseus Nomos 8-in-1 Magnetic Charging Station ($70), which combines a similar folding Qi2 pad with three US AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one USB-A.\n\nRapport London Formula Wireless Charging Tray for $475: Yes, this is an obscene price for a Qi wireless charger. You can probably make a version for a fraction of the cost. But Rapport's build quality is quite nice, with a lacquered grey box and a soft-touch fabric to keep your watches and phone scratch-free. It reliably recharged several Android phones without making them too warm, all while offering storage for a few watches. It's attractive, but you have to have cash to burn at this price.\n\niOttie iOS Wireless Duo for $50: This dual-charging system looks pretty—I like the fabric-wrapped stand—and you can charge another device on the rubberized charging pad next to it. The stand can be used in portrait or landscape, though in the latter orientation it'll block the pad. I use the pad to top up my wireless earbuds, but I wouldn't use this iOttie on a nightstand, because the LED on the front can be glaring. A cable and adapter are included, which makes it a good value. It can charge Pixel phones at up to 15 watts, iPhones at 7.5 watts, and other Android phones at 10 watts.\n\nJourney Alti Play Performance Desk Mat for $120: This is a desk mat that doubles as a wireless charging pad. On the left side is a plasticky rectangle with a Qi2 magnetic puck for your smartphone. Above it is a little area to charge wireless earbuds (5 watts). Naturally, there's RGB all over, and there are two buttons you can press to cycle through patterns and colors. It's a smart-looking system, though the quality of the actual mat leaves a bit to be desired. I didn't have issues gliding my mouse on it, and it stays put thanks to the rubber underside, but I just didn't like the look and feel of the Lycra surface. Journey has some other versions of this mat that use different materials, so take a look if you like the overall aesthetic.\n\nCourant Catch:2 Essentials for $75: Wireless chargers should look nice. You shouldn't settle for anything less! This Courant dual charger oozes luxury with its Belgian linen-wrapped surface (especially in the camel color). I've used it by my front door to recharge my partner's and my wireless earbuds for two years. The rubber feet prevent it from shifting around, but even if there are five coils in this pad, you should try to be precise when you put your device down to charge and make sure the LED lights up to double-check. It comes with a color-matching USB-C cable.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nZens Liberty Wireless Charger for $150: I tested the Glass Edition of this wireless charging pad, and it looks stunning with the 16 overlapping copper coils on display (the standard version has a woolen fabric top). It can charge two devices simultaneously at up to 15 watts apiece, and there’s an optional Apple Watch add-on ($19). As stylish as it is, the price is too high. Because you can see the coils, placement is never an issue, but it’s a bulky charger; the fan is audible at times, and while I had no problem charging my iPhone or AirPods, my Pixel 6 Pro got very warm on this pad.\n\nXiaomi Mi 80-W Wireless Charging Stand for $50: By far the fastest wireless charger we have tested, this stand is only worth considering for Xiaomi phones (it seems to charge most other phones at 10 watts or below). I tested with the Xiaomi 13 Ultra, which tops out at 50 watts (some Xiaomi models can go higher). The unusual sail shape combines a white triangular section with a clear acrylic base that has a subtle groove to hold your phone in place and a gap underneath for the exhaust grill from the noisy fan. The USB-C port and LED indicator are on the back.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

            "content": "I could go on for hours about all the latest high-tech features in security cameras, including AI summaries, magnetic mounts and privacy zones. But all those extras can get overwhelming, especially if you're trying to ignore the clutter and save money.\n\nDespite all their advances, security cameras still come with unnecessary features, and that's an advantage if you know where to look. You can simplify your setup and save cash by ignoring add-ons, no matter how much they're advertised. Here's my take on the least useful home security camera features -- and why you can skip them.\n\nPan/tilt capabilities\n\nI've seen good pan/tilt cameras, but it's not a feature most homes need. Tyler Lacoma/CNET\n\nPan/tilt features aren't always bad news -- some of my top-reviewed cameras include the ability, giving them nearly 360 degrees of viewing range and tracking. The problem is that most home cameras don't actually need that capability.\n\nUnless you're watching over a very, very large space or have your camera set up in the middle of an open floor plan (a very awkward placement for homes), you don't really need pan/tilt options. Today's cameras typically offer fields of view wider than 130 degrees, so with the right placement, you can capture most of a large room or backyard.\n\nSkipping pan/tilt features can make cameras both more affordable and more durable. Add in motion detection with person recognition, and you should be set with a watchful cam that lets you know what's going on. Pan/tilt is a better option only if the camera is wired -- such as to a junction box or outdoor outlet -- and doesn't have a clear view of your access points.\n\nNVR support\n\nThere are many wireless and wired security cameras that not longer need or benefit from NVRs. Eufy\n\nNVRs -- or network video recorders -- were common parts of very early security systems because they didn't really have any other way to capture and manage lots of video footage. Today, an NVR for home security cameras is largely unnecessary and, I'd argue, a significant drawback.\n\nNot only are these extra hubs bulky, expensive and limited in what they can do, they're also outclassed by today's microSD cards for local storage, which can hold over 1TB of video. Add the wireless video management that mobile apps offer, and NVRs are best reserved for specific commercial applications.\n\nPlus, NVR systems are often designed to use a PoE camera system, which requires much more installation work and isn't suitable for the average home unless you really want to avoid all wireless signals.\n\nProtective enclosures\n\nUnless you live very, very far north, a camera enclosure won't do you much good. Andrew Wevers/Stringer via Getty Images\n\nToday's outdoor security cameras typically have IP64/IP65 weather resistance ratings, which means they can handle most outside conditions. An enclosure to protect the camera is both more work to clean and unnecessary in all but the most blizzardy climates. Also, it can be difficult to find a camera housing that fits your specific model.\n\nIf you're worried about someone damaging your home security camera -- say, with a baseball bat -- that scenario is so rare it's not worth paying extra for a protective enclosure unless you have evidence it's happening in your neighborhood. A nearby family of starlings is likely to cause more problems, in which case you may want a camera cover for around $20.\n\nLTE connections\n\nLTE cameras work well in remote locations, but they're unnecessary for most homes. John Larsen/CNET\n\nLTE cameras have built-in SIM card slots, allowing them -- like your phone -- to connect to cell towers and use a data plan to transmit video (along with the added fees). That's a great option for remote locations, but probably not necessary for your home.\n\nToday's wireless security cameras offer very healthy Wi-Fi ranges suitable for all kinds of homes and Wi-Fi routers. The extra costs of an LTE camera are worth it for construction sites or off-grid cabins, but a poor fit for your backyard. If you get very frequent blackouts that knock out your Wi-Fi, you're better off investing in a powerful home backup battery than spending money on an LTE cam.\n\n4K resolution\n\nGenerally, a 2K camera is the most resolution your home needs. Lorex\n\nA 4K camera offers much higher resolution, which means more detail on your security videos. I know that sounds like a high-value upgrade -- I even have a list of the best 4K cameras for those interested -- but it's not beneficial in the same way as 4K resolution is in your monitor or TV screen.\n\nI'd skip 4K not just to save money, but because it consumes more bandwidth for live viewing and often requires additional storage for video clips. It can also introduce higher latency, which may lead to lag or visual glitches. Many cameras let you switch to a lower resolution to address those issues, but at that point, what's the benefit of paying for 4K in the first place?\n\nThat's why some of the latest and most powerful cameras I've tested, including late 2025 models from Google Nest, Arlo and Blink, stick with a 2K resolution, which I'd say is the sweet spot for security cam resolution. Save 4K for commercial cameras or very specific use cases where lots of detail is mandatory.\n\nSpotlights\n\nSpotlights are usually outclassed by floodlights, making it smarter to either upgrade or skip the feature entirely. Ring\n\nSpotlights occupy an awkward space in home security. Security cameras are often installed in areas that already have porch lights or other nearby illumination. And if not, modern night vision typically delivers excellent results without added lighting. If you do want illumination -- or the \"scare\" factor to deter trespassers -- a floodlight camera is almost always the better option. Battery-powered spotlight cams also tend to drain much faster when the light repeatedly triggers.\n\nThose factors mean it's usually better to choose a floodlight camera, opt for a model without a spotlight or simply turn the light off altogether. There aren't many situations where a spotlight is truly necessary. It could make sense for a dark entryway or a set of shadowy patio steps as a safety feature, but in most cases, it's an add-on you can skip.\n\nWhat about cloud storage?\n\nCloud storage and local storage both have their place. Tapo\n\nCloud storage isn't a useless feature, but its value depends heavily on your camera and your preferred setup. Some cameras rely solely on cloud storage, which may offer only limited access -- such as Nest's six-hour event history -- or require a subscription to unlock full functionality, such as Arlo's $8-per-month Secure plan. Others include a microSD card slot or an optional hub for local storage, which carries a higher upfront cost but avoids ongoing fees. And some cameras offer both options.\n\nCloud and local storage each have their benefits. Local storage is cheaper in the long run and better for privacy, but it's more difficult to share, and you'll have to clear out your local storage occasionally. Cloud storage is convenient, enables more advanced AI features like video searches and lets you download any video you want, but it comes at a higher price. People may also worry about security companies sharing cloud videos with law enforcement or getting hacked, which are legitimate concerns.\n\nOkay, what about the new AI features?\n\nWhen enabled, Gemini for Home adds a new type of watchfulness to security cameras. Tyler Lacoma/CNET\n\nSince advanced generative AI features -- such as object recognition that creates video summaries -- are currently limited to higher-tier subscriptions, they aren't the focus of this list. Instead, I've focused on the more tangible features you'll see on a security camera's box or product page, and which of those don't add much value.\n\nFor more info, check out the worst places to put your camera and what useless features to avoid if you want a full security system, too."

            "content": "Most receivers over $500 include Dolby Atmos capability, but you don’t need to buy height speakers straight away. You can always add them later.\n\nAll modern components use the universal HDMI standard and so you should choose a receiver that has as many of these inputs as possible. If you’re a gamer choose one which has HDMI 2.1 so it can transmit 4K/120Hz to a TV as well.\n\nIf you’re looking for a Dolby Atmos receiver, the minimum number of channels is seven -- which is written as either 7.1 or 5.1.2 channels). Power specs are mostly made up, but anything over 100 watts per channel in stereo is good.\n\nCNET staff -- not advertisers, partners or business interests -- determine how we review products and services. If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nIf you’re serious about bringing theater-like sound into your home, an AV receiver is the best choice. A receiver has many roles: It acts as an HDMI switch between components like a streaming box or gaming console and your TV, and it also decodes and amplifies audio signals so you can hear them through your speakers.\n\nThe best receivers offer excellent sound quality and come equipped with features like 8K video, Dolby Atmos and music streaming capabilities. You don't need to go for the full surround sound system, either, as you can start with as little as a pair of stereo speakers and then add rear speakers and a subwoofer later. This will enable you to get the best movie, TV show and music performance to suit your budget.\n\nI've tested many of the big-name brands in sound, including Denon, Sony and Yamaha, to discover which receivers deliver the best sound. With more than 20 years of home entertainment experience, I've personally had hands-on time with each of the models included on this list and reviewed them based on price, features, sound quality and performance.\n\nBest AV receivers of 2026\n\nTy Pendlebury/CNET Photo Gallery 1/1 Ty Pendlebury/CNET Best AV receiver overall Onkyo TX-NR6100 8.3 /10 SCORE Pros One of the best music streaming suites\n\nExcellent home theater performance\n\nFun to use\n\nCompatible with Xbox Series X/4K 120Hz signals Cons Not as dynamic with music The Onkyo TX-NR6100 is my top choice because it's an excellent-sounding receiver at an affordable price. It has a particular knack for Dolby Atmos soundtracks with an expansive, yet detailed sound, and it's also very good at playing back music. It also offers plenty of streaming audio support, so it's ready to entertain as soon as you hook up the Wi-Fi. The TX-NR6100 is a 7 x 100-watt-per-channel receiver with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support. It includes six HDMI inputs at the back, with three able to pass 8K video; the remaining three ports include HDR10 and Dolby Vision compatibility. Vinyl is still in the middle of a revival, and the NR6100 enables users to take advantage thanks to a dedicated phono input for turntables and record players that lack an onboard phono preamp. Streaming options include Google Cast, DTS Play-Fi, Spotify Connect, Sonos, AirPlay and Bluetooth. Though you can pay much more, or even much less, the Onkyo TX-6100 offers the best mix of usability and performance for the money. ...

Like its budget-oriented label mate, the TX-NR6100, it's stacked with features including the audiophile-level calibration called Dirac Live, as well as the best streaming suite offered in an AV receiver. On that point, being able to request songs directly from Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa is a real boon. What improvements does the $1,699 TX-RZ50 offer over the $800 TX-NR6100? Firstly, it offers double the number of 8K compatible inputs (six versus three) plus it boasts more power (120 watts versus 100 watts). It also has two-way Bluetooth for streaming as well as listening on wireless headphones. The TX-RZ50's performance was excellent, whether listening to streamed music or watching a movie: I hadn't heard Dolby Atmos sound this convincing in a long time. The addition of Dirac Live does pose its own complexities in setup -- please, only use the Onkyo Controller mobile app in combination with the supplied microphone -- but doing so rewards with a highly involving performance. ...

As it turns out, this Yamaha offers even better build quality and a huge, cinematic sound. Look through the fancy top grille and you'll see neatly packed components and a distinguished, stamped transformer. The system is capable of a beefy 110 watts per channel (stereo) and has seven HDMI ports for your connectivity needs. I tested the Yamaha A4A against the Onkyo RZ50 and the older Denon X3700. The Yamaha's sound quality tended toward the cinematic rather than the musical, and it offered a big, roomy sound perfect for blockbusters or conspiracy thriller TV shows. What was surprising is that the onboard phono preamp was even better than the one on the rival Onkyo RZ50, so I can recommend the Yamaha for people who don't want a separate preamp for their turntable. The Yamaha is great as a home theater receiver but doesn't sound as good with music streaming. Still, as the Onkyo offers balanced performance across both, it's my current favorite. ...

The Sony STR-AN1000 is a 7.2-channel Dolby Atmos receiver that offers a whole host of new features, including HDMI 2.1 (4K/120Hz) support and Sony's own 360 Reality Audio. It boasts superb connectivity with six HDMI inputs (two with 8K compatibility) and two 8K outputs. The receiver also includes support for video standards such as Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG for high-resolution gaming. As far as analog inputs, the Sony offers four, though it does lack a dedicated phono input. The Sony also has one of the most sophisticated setup routines yet, so dialing in great sound is even easier. It offers an upgraded version of its calibration routine, now called Digital Cinema Auto Calibration IX. This involves a new stereo microphone and a natty plastic stand -- where competitors' are cardboard -- and it now accommodates multiple seating positions. If you prefer to do a manual AV receiver calibration, then the system is quite powerful, as it now lets you set the height of the screen and speakers; most receivers do not let you do this. But the main reason to buy it is its outstanding performance, especially for video games. ...

The Onkyo TX-NR6100 is the best receiver for most needs Ty Pendlebury/CNET If you're spending under $1,000, there are four main receivers to choose from -- the Sony STR-AN1000, the Yamaha RX-V6A, the Onkyo TX-NR6100 and the Denon AVR-970H. All offer excellent performance, so the short answer about which to buy is whichever is available for the lowest price. At the moment, that is either the Denon or the Onkyo, and I especially recommend the Onkyo TX-NR6100 for its combination of excellent performance and connectivity. The Onkyo offers easy setup, excellent usability, solid looks and useful features, including the best streaming suite (alongside Sony). As an added plus, the Onkyo was never prone to the 4K issue that plagued early versions of the Yamaha RX-V6A. Meanwhile, the step-up Onkyo TX-RZ50 is an excellent receiver if you're looking for the next level of features and a performance bump over sub-$1,000 models. It offers an excellent, if slightly scary, calibration routine from Dirac Live and the best number of streaming features on the market. It sounds great with music and movies alike. Lastly, if it's home theater thrills you're after, the Yamaha RX-A4A offers crisp, dynamic sound and fantastic build quality for $1,300.\n\nFactors to consider when buying an AV receiver AV receivers are notoriously complex, with reams of features and confusing technical specifications. (For example, what's 4K/120Hz anyway?) Yet, what are the things that really matter when buying a new model? I'm going to sum up the most important ones right here. HDMI inputs With most TVs and set-top boxes supporting HDMI, you should buy a receiver that has as many of these HDMI input ports and outputs as possible. Front-mounted HDMI ports are kind of like a human appendix -- unneeded, because most users don't hot-plug HDMI devices -- making the number of rear inputs what's most important. (How else are you going to connect your Roku, Blu-ray player, Nintendo Switch and all your other devices?) The Onkyo TX-NR6100 and Denon AVR-S970H have six rear-mounted HDMI inputs, while the Yamaha RX-V6A goes one better with seven. If you want to connect two different displays -- a TV and a projector, for example -- all but the Yamaha offer a second HDMI output. You should also be sure you have an extra HDMI cable or two on hand -- these things are like the second sock of a pair as you can never find them when you need them. Dolby Atmos capability Most receivers in the $500-and-above price range include Dolby Atmos capability and DTS:X, but the effect these formats have on your home theater movie-watching can be subtle, or in most movies, nonexistent. In other words, don't worry about missing out on these formats by not installing a ceiling-pointing speaker or two. Mounting your rear surround speakers high on the wall will get you halfway there in terms of quality, immersive sound. WiFi music streaming Most midrange receivers have onboard Wi-Fi network connectivity for wireless music streaming via your speaker system. There are plenty of standards for wireless streaming services, but the most universal are Spotify Connect, Apple AirPlay and Google Cast. If you're looking to build a multiroom system with a variety of AV systems and speakers with wireless connectivity, these are the three flavors to aim for. Onkyo and Sony are the only devices to support all three. The Denon receiver model lacks wireless streaming via Google but ups the ante to AirPlay 2 and the proprietary HEOS system. Meanwhile, Yamaha has its own MusicCast system.\n\nHow CNET tests AV receivers The CNET Audio Lab in downtown Manhattan where I test turntables, soundbars, and AV receivers side-by-side Ty Pendlebury At CNET, I test audio equipment from compact soundbars to surround sound systems, but regardless of the device, my methodology is the same. I always compare products against one or more reference devices that offer the best performance at a similar price. When it comes to receivers I want to see how well a system performs with music and movies, as most people will want to do both. I watch test scenes from 4K Blu-ray or streamed from a 4K streaming service (Fandango at Home, for example) and evaluate aspects such as Dolby Atmos surround sound performance and dialog clarity. I also use several test music tracks and test streaming features such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Systems that can perform well with both types of entertainment inevitably score the highest. Check out CNET's receiver buying guide for more about the features and things you should consider when looking for a new system.\n\nOther AV receivers I tested The Denon AVR A10H is a 13.4-channel receiver. Ty Pendlebury/CNET Denon AVR-A10H ($5,199): If you hear the words \"home theater\" and think \"dedicated room with a screen and leather recliners,\" then the AVR-A10H is the kind of receiver you would use to power it. It has all of the features you need, including Dolby Atmos, music streaming, 4K/120Hz on all seven HDMI inputs and more. While it sounds good -- I tested it powering a set of Klipsch Fortes -- the combination of a high price and 13(!) powered channels may be too much for most living rooms. Yamaha RX-V6A Ty Pendlebury/CNET Yamaha RX-V6A ($599): This Yamaha RX-V6A offers a fresh look at AV receiver design, with its futuristic edges and simple controls, while maximizing sound quality. The Yamaha might even make you forget about visiting a cinema ever again, and it's no slouch with music, either. It offers plenty of connectivity with Wi-Fi bringing AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, Bluetooth and Yamaha's MusicCast system for streaming from your devices. Notably, the TSR-700 is identical, and it was an exclusive model for some outlets. Find out more in CNET's Yamaha RX-V6A review. Denon AVR-X3800 ($1,699) Denon has a reputation for quality sound and powerful amplification, and the AVR-X3800 will be able to power most systems with ease. In terms of features, the Denon has everything you need in a modern receiver including Dolby Atmos and six 8K HDMI inputs. Based on my head-to-head testing, I found that the Denon was even-handed with movies and music, but not as good as the equivalent Marantz SR6015 with music or as good at home theater as my current pick, the Onkyo RZ50. Read CNET's first take on the Denon AVR-X3800."

The goal of the puzzle is to find them all, including the spangram, a theme word that reaches from one side of the puzzle to the other.

            "content": "Every year, the moment we witness the very earliest signs of spring, CNET takes its cue to decamp to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress.\n\nThis is the world's most important mobile show, and one of the most exciting events in the tech calendar. This year, we're sending a bigger team to bring you all the news from the show as it happens.\n\nIt's set to be a bonanza of new phones and wearables, with the odd robot thrown in for good measure. Sure, some of the fun tech we see at MWC never makes it out into the wider world, but we've also seen some of our most beloved tech debut at the show over the years -- so expect a little of both.\n\nBig themes are set to include AI and 6G, and with keynotes from SpaceX and Qualcomm, we'll no doubt get a solid glimpse of the future of mobile. With Gemini in everything and satellite dominance on the horizon, it's an exciting time for the industry.\n\nHere's more of what we expect to see.\n\nWhat are the key dates for MWC?\n\nMWC 2026 is set to run from March 2 to 5, although we'll be in town a couple of days beforehand to report on some of the big launch events scheduled for this weekend. Don't miss Xiaomi's launch event on Feb. 28 and Honor's event on March 1.\n\nHow to watch along\n\nNo matter how far away you live from Spain, there's no need to feel like you're missing out. The best place for all the latest MWC news is on our CNET live blog.\n\nWe've been attending this show for decades (this is MWC's 20th year in Barcelona, by the way), and we have a team of experienced reporters and reviewers on the ground.\n\nWe'll show you everything we deem interesting and important, and we're not just admiring new products from afar. We're touching, tinkering with and trying not to drop them, so be sure to follow us across Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, X and YouTube, too.\n\nWhat phones to expect at MWC 2026\n\nFor the past few years, Chinese phone-makers have dominated MWC, and 2026 looks to be no different.\n\nThe first big phone launch event is scheduled for 6 a.m. PT Saturday, Feb. 28, when we expect Xiaomi to unveil its latest camera-focused flagship. We loved the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and the 14 Ultra before it, so we're excited to see what the company has in store for us. A teaser image hints at its partnership with premium camera brand Leica and promises a \"new wave of imagery.\"\n\nThe Honor Magic V6 will be available in red. Honor\n\nNext up, we have Honor on Sunday, March 1, when the company has said it will unveil its Magic V6 phone, alongside the MagicPad 4 and MagicBook Pro 14. Perhaps more exciting still, Honor has said it will give us a first glimpse of a working version of its Robot Phone, and will also unveil a humanoid robot at its event.\n\nFor other phone-makers, MWC is likely to serve as more of a victory lap for its existing devices -- particularly Samsung, which held its own event in San Francisco this week to unveil the flagship S26 series. Motorola will be in town, likely showing off its Razr, which just like the Samsung Galaxy TriFold, has yet to be seen much in Europe.\n\nOn the whole, MWC 2026 is likely to be a big show for foldable phones, which, according to Ben Wood, CMO and chief analyst at CCS Insight, \"is now becoming quite a mature category.\"\n\nAnother major trend in the phone space is likely to be a focus on batteries, particularly silicon carbon-based tech, Wood said in an MWC preview session. \"We're expecting to see phones with some of the biggest batteries we've seen for a long time, [with] fast charging -- perhaps 300-watt charging -- being introduced,\" he added.\n\nWhat other tech to expect at MWC 2026\n\nAfter the early flops that were the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1, we're seeing more companies moving to jump on the wearable AI bandwagon. We expect to see a number of devices and demos pop up at MWC -- perhaps trying to beat OpenAI and Jony Ive to the punch.\n\nThis will include AI- and AR-based glasses, said CCS Insight analyst Ben Hatton during the firm's briefing session. \"We are expecting to see a huge number of glasses on show this year, not just from Meta, but also from the smaller players, [like] TCL and Oppo, looking to take a slice of the pie,\" he said.\n\nOne of the key challenges for these companies will be differentiation, Hatton said. \"Ultimately, there's still a long way to go before these become generally mass market products,\" he added, pointing out that at this stage, compelling use cases are still a bit thin on the ground.\n\nIt's been two years since Samsung launched the Galaxy Ring at MWC, and smart rings have been fairly thin on the ground ever since -- although Oura CEO Tom Hale is slated to speak at the show. We're not necessarily expecting to see any new rings this year, but there's always an outside chance.\n\nMuch more likely to show up are a slew of new laptops and tablets. They rarely get top billing at MWC, but we'll keep an eye out for the most exciting launches. There's also likely to be some intriguing concepts on show from the likes of Lenovo and Samsung Display, which is responsible for the tech behind the new Galaxy S26 Ultra's scene-stealing Privacy Display.\n\nThe big themes: AI, 6G and beyond\n\nNo surprises here that AI will, of course, be a major theme at MWC. For the past few years, Google has dominated the AI conversation at the event by showcasing Gemini's capabilities and its widespread integration. Will this year be any different? Probably not, but that doesn't mean the AI conversation has stalled.\n\nWe expect to see more sophisticated AI agents that are more deeply integrated into wearables, offering live translation, more actionable health insights and more personalized experiences. Some of the biggest players in the AI game will be present, including Nvidia and Qualcomm, on the hardware side. They'll likely have saved some juicy announcements for the show and, hopefully, have some exciting demos we can try out.\n\nWind the clock back a decade, and everyone was talking about 5G and what a dramatic difference it was going to make to our lives. Now that 5G is old news, we're looking forward to 6G. Most discussions about 6G so far have focused on its impact on the industry, but that doesn't mean there's nothing to be excited about.\n\nAt the Web Summit in November, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told me that 6G will make our phones faster than ever and connect us to an \"always-sensing network.\" This could include wearables, smart devices, cars and even robots. No doubt, Amon will expound on this subject further during his MWC keynote, which is all about 6G and AI.\n\nAnother theme likely to be prevalent at the show is the role of satellites in enhancing network connectivity. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell will be on stage to talk about Starlink, and all the world's biggest carriers will have their own booths where they'll show us what they're doing to tap into the latest network technologies."
