            "content": "FORMER Chelsea star Jody Morris has revealed Frank Lampard did not have a single discussion with owner Roman Abramovich while manager.\n\nThe revelation stunned Premier League icon Joleon Lescott, who labelled the lack of contact “insane”.\n\n\n\n\n\nLampard, 46, boasts the second most Premier League appearances ever for Chelsea, behind John Terry.\n\nBut his certified legend status did not help him break the ice when he was brought back to the club years after his retirement in a new role as head coach.\n\nLampard stepped away from the club in 2014, but was hired half a decade later to steady the ship after Maurizio Sarri departed as manager.\n\nBut according to the former England man’s assistant coach Morris, 47, Lampard had no contact with club chairman Abramovich during his 18-months in charge between 2019 and early 2021.\n\n\n\nInstead the assistant and former Blues midfielder claimed that club director Marina Granovskaia was the one running show.\n\nMorris, who followed Lampard when he made the switch from Derby County to Stamford Bridge, opened up on their communication issues on the All Out Football podcast.\n\nHe said: “(Lampard) never had one conversation with Roman (Abramovich) the whole time he was there.\n\n“The whole time when we went back there, Marina was running the club.\n\n\n\nSUN VEGAS WELCOME OFFER: GET £50 BONUS WHEN YOU JOIN\n\n“Frank Lampard is the manager of Chelsea and he never had one conversation with Roman as manager.”\n\nReports at the time of Lampard’s dismissal made similar claims, and reiterated Granovskaia’s importance in the club hierarchy.\n\nA stunned Lescott chimed in: “You’re saying that now, I’m thinking’ that’s insane.”\n\n\n\nMorris doubled down, adding: “He had conversations when he played for Chelsea, but then you come back as manager and they didn’t have one conversation, and he wanted to.”\n\nLampard led his side to fourth and an FA Cup final in his first season in the dugout.\n\nBut results took a nosedive in his second term and he was sacked in January 2021.\n\nThe Chelsea Blueprint on YouTube Calling all Chelsea fans - we have a brand new YouTube channel!

Subscribe to The Chelsea Blueprint on YouTube now\n\nDespite the lack of contact, Abramovich released a message praising their “excellent personal relationship” upon the axe falling.\n\nHe wrote: “This was a very difficult decision for the club, not least because I have an excellent personal relationship with Frank and I have the utmost respect for him.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“He is a man of great integrity and has the highest of work ethics. However, under current circumstances we believe it is best to change managers.\n\n“On behalf of everyone at the club, the board and personally, I would like to thank Frank for his work as head coach and wish him every success in the future.”"

Prestianni was suspended for the second leg of their Champions League tie against Real on Wednesday night after UEFA launched an investigation into the allegations.\n\nReal progressed into the last 16 of the Champions League 3-1 on aggregate in a tie that was marred by an incident in the first leg in Portugal. Vinicius reported to the referee that Prestianni had used a racial slur after he had opened the scoring and been booked for his celebrations.\n\nThe Benfica player publicly denied the allegations afterwards, saying his opponent had \"misinterpreted\" what he'd said after pulling his shirt over his mouth. However, Portuguese media have reported that the 20-year-old later admitted his guilt to his team-mates and apologised.\n\nBenfica have now released a new statement to address those claims. It reads: \"Sport Lisboa e Benfica categorically denies that the player Prestianni has communicated to the squad or the club's structure that he has uttered a racist insult to the player Vinicius Jr, from Real Madrid.\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

I have never been racist and I regret the threats I received from Real Madrid players.\"\n\nUEFA suspended the Argentine for the second leg and is investigating.

He wrote on social media: \"Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts over their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are. But they have the protection of others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish them.\n\n\"Nothing that happened here is new in my life or my family's. I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, it was just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose.

The former Spurs boss will lead the United States of America at their home World Cup this summer, but beyond that campaign, he could be back in the Premier League and has not ruled it out in a recent interview.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPochettino, who managed Spurs between 2014 and 2019, remains hugely popular with the fanbase and is one of several big names linked with the job on a permanent basis. The club are currently in crisis and battling relegation, with former Juventus manager Igor Tudor taking over as interim manager following Thomas Frank's axing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPochettino is set to lead the USA at this summer's World Cup but has refused to rule out a return to his old club, hinting that he's open to all offers.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDuring a radio interview with “Radiogaceta de los Deportes” on RNE in Spain, he said: “I’m always linked (to clubs), to Tottenham, just like at one time I was linked to Espanyol, or to other clubs. In the end, especially because of my past at those clubs, when things aren’t going well, people tend to fall back on emotions and say, ‘Well, with Mauricio we played good football,’ or whatever it may be.\n\n\"But no. We’re focused on the World Cup, on the United States. My contract runs until after the World Cup, so after that we’ll see what might happen.

Spurs are also yet to win in 2026.\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\nThat continued this past weekend with defeat to Arsenal in the north London Derby, which saw the gap to the bottom three reduced to four points following West Ham's draw against Bournemouth.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPochettino is seemingly the leading contender to be Frank's permanent successor with Spurs in need of a head coach who can galvanise the fanbase.\n\nThough he did not win any trophies, the Pochettino years are reflected upon fondly with Tottenham going close in two Premier League title races. They also reached the Champions League final in 2019, but lost to Liverpool.\n\nPochettino was sacked just months after that showpiece clash with Spurs appointing Jose Mourinho as his replacement. Nuno Espirito Santo, Antonio Conte, Ange Postecoglou and Frank have followed as permanent managers since then.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Tottenham sacked Thomas Frank earlier this month (Image: Joe Toth/Shutterstock)\n\nRoberto De Zerbi, Robbie Keane and Enzo Maresca have been touted as possible alternatives to Pochettino.\n\nOther big names such as Julian Nagelsmann and Carlo Ancelotti could also be available after the World Cup, but Manchester United are more likely to appoint one of those.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWhat division Tottenham are in next season will likely play a huge role in the type of candidate they can appoint. If he does not get the permanent job at Old Trafford, Michael Carrick, who also played for Spurs, is a serious option.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. **Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings"

Fenerbahce captain Mert Yandas immediately went over to tell the fans to stop as the match was brought to a halt.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGround staff had to come on to clear the flares from the pitch as the incident delayed the match by over two minutes. TNT Sports co‑commentator Lucy Ward said at the time of the incident: \"The ground staff are furious as well.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nYandas, who confronted his own fans, and some of his Fenerbahce team-mates helped clear the pitch during the delay. UEFA rules state that flares, fireworks, smoke bombs, and all pyrotechnics are banned in Europa League stadiums, with possible repercussions for clubs and fans.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShortly after the game resumed, Forest's Ryan Yates appeared to dislocate his finger and required treatment on the pitch.

Their European Club Finance and Investment Landscape assessment has also highlighted the financial dominance of the Premier League in comparison to other major divisions.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat was particularly evidenced by the increase in television revenue to £1.3bn (€1.5b) for English clubs. That staggering figure very nearly amounted to the £1.4bn (€1.6bn) that 53 other European top-division leagues received combined.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite taking a share of that major financial boost, United's specific failures have also been exposed by UEFA, with £692million emerging as their net spend on transfers between 2021 and 2025. Significant losses on the likes of Antony and Paul Pogba have undoubtedly impacted that, even with other Premier League clubs spending more.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMan Utd and Premier League clubs sent warning by UEFA after financial results revealed READ MORE :\n\nMan Utd taking Kobbie Mainoo transfer risk as latest contract stance emerges READ MORE :\n\nThe likes of Chelsea and Arsenal have parted ways with substantial transfer fees over the five-year period, accounting for £656m and £587m, respectively, as their net spends. England's financial dominance has also been demonstrated on the pitch with six teams in the last-16 of this season's Champions League.\n\nFor UEFA to publish their findings, an examination of financial accounts from 2021 to 2025 was conducted. This meant the impact of all transfer activity across the five years was included, encompassing profits on sale, amortisation from earlier transfers and impairments.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn the report, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said: \"After a decade that included one of the toughest periods our sport and our society have faced, European football has come through in a strong position. Club revenues have grown steadily across the board, and top-division income is expected to pass €30bn in the 2025 financial year.\"\n\nThere have been some financial bright spots for United lately, though, with their most recent accounts revealing an operating profit of £32.6million recorded for the opening six months of the fiscal year.\n\nCompared to the £3.9m loss reported during the equivalent period in the previous year, that represents quite the uplift with those improvements fuelled by strategic cost-management measures authorised by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt appeared to be a difficult financial period for United without the inclusion of European football and the substantial funding that accompanies it, but evidently, that has not been the case.\n\nThere has, however, been a predictable decline in commercial and matchday revenue due to fewer fixtures, with the club just over £9million down.\n\nView 2 Images Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada issued an update after the release of the club's latest accounts (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUnited CEO Omar Berrada stated: \"We are now seeing the positive financial impact of our off-pitch transformation materialise both in our costs and profitability. We continue to take a football first approach and invest in both our men's and women's first teams.\n\n\"On the pitch our men's team sits fourth in the Premier League and our women's team are second in the Women's Super League, as well as reaching the League Cup final and the quarter-final of the UEFA Women's Champions League.\n\n\"Today's results demonstrate the underlying strength of our business as we continue to push for the best football results possible for our men's and women's teams.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. **Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings"

He has also devoted the past 13 years of his career to playing European football since departing Sao Paulo in January 2013, initially on loan, for Madrid.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeculation regarding a switch to Italy comes after former United striker Dion Dublin's appeal for Casemiro to remain.

            "content": "Nottingham Forest survived a scare from Fenerbahce to book their Europa League last-16 place, winning 4-2 on aggregate despite a 2-1 defeat at the City ground in Thursday's second leg.\n\nVitor Pereira had the luxury of rotation for the knockout play-off tie, having already won 3-0 in Istanbul last week, but the difference in performances could not have been more vast.\n\nForest were the architects of their own difficulties too, and made a seemingly simple task monumentally harder.\n\nThey were first punished in the 22nd minute when Fenerbahce's ruthless break saw Kerem Akturkoglu sweep home to hand the visitors a lifeline.\n\nIt gave Fenerbahce real confidence, with Akturkoglu and Sidiki Cherif squandering glorious chances to level up the tie in the first half.\n\nImage: The game was stopped mere seconds after kick-off after Fenerbahce fans threw flares onto the pitch\n\nForest players forced to dodge Fenerbahce fireworks Forest players were forced to dodge fireworks thrown on to the pitch by Fenerbahce fans.\n\n\n\nMoments after the match kicked off, there was a three-minute delay as sections of a 1,500-strong away end launched several fireworks on to the pitch into the Forest penalty area.\n\n\n\nJair Cunha had to take evasive action as he had his back to them and Neco Williams also had to duck as he tried to carry one away.\n\n\n\nFenerbahce's Archie Brown also had to intervene and carry some of the pyrotechnics off the pitch while urging calm from his side’s fans.\n\nAfter 45 minutes with no shots on target, high turnovers and losing duels, Pereira made four half-time changes - something he called \"difficult\" after the game - bringing on Callum Hudson-Odoi, Igor Jesus, Ola Aina and Ibrahim Sangare.\n\nBut seconds into the second half, another clumsy moment handed Fenerbahce a penalty. Jair Cunha stuck a foot out to catch Akturkoglu and, after a VAR check, the on-field decision stood.\n\nImage: Fenerbahce's Kerem Akturkoglu scores his opener against Nottingham Forest\n\nIt was the forward who stepped up and easily slotted home his second of the evening to give the Turkish side real hope of levelling up on aggregate.\n\nBut Forest soon settled into their rhythm as the substitutes worked their magic, even if the approach of careful possession - as they have done so well in their two games under Pereira so far - did little to calm the nerves of the home fans.\n\nImage: Nottingham Forest's Callum Hudson-Odoi scored at the City Ground on Thursday\n\nAnd as the unhappy whistles began, Forest answered. It was two substitutes who combined as Aina's swinging cross found Hudson-Odoi over on the left of the area. He then sped past his defender before hammering home his first European goal of the season into the far corner.\n\nThe relief was palpable around the City Ground, and it took the remaining puff out of injury-hit Fenerbahce. Forest are now in the draw for Friday's last-16 draw, and will face either Real Betis or FC Midtjylland.\n\nTeam news headlines Only five Nottingham Forest players survived from the weekend's 1-0 defeat to Liverpool - those were Stefan Ortega, Murillo, Neco Williams, Elliot Anderson and Omari Hutchinson.\n\nFenerbache have an injury-hit squad, and only named five outfield players on their bench. The likes of Ederson and Milan Skriniar were among the absentees.\n\nPereira admits having one eye on Brighton game\n\nNottingham Forest head coach Vitor Pereira to TNT Sports: \"When you change half of a team, it's not easy to keep the level, that's my responsibility because we have an important game in three days. By my decision, I try to manage the next game and recover some players. It's not easy. It will change a lot.\n\n\"We conceded a goal and lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at half-time, but I said to the players it's my decision. The game was a dangerous situation for us. They start the second half by scoring the second goal and after we start to play and create.\n\n\"We have a big chance to score the second goal. Ok, this is important to keep in our mind. I know they came here to fight for the result.\"\n\nOn learnings: \"Even for me. If you change five players you don't know what will happen. When the pressure starts to come, under stress it's difficult to be themselves when you don't play every match. In the end, we are in the competition so let's move forward and think about Brighton next game.\"\n\nVitor Pereira has become the second Nottingham Forest manager this season to lose his first two home games in charge, along with Ange Postecoglou. He's now lost four in a row at home in all competitions (also his last two at Wolves), his worst-ever run as a manager.\n\nHudson-Odoi: We made it difficult for ourselves\n\nImage: Hudson-Odoi scored his first European goal of the season against Fenerbahce\n\nNottingham Forest goalscorer Callum Hudson-Odoi to TNT Sports: \"We made it difficult for ourselves. When you're in the lead and sometimes you can feel a bit comfortable, but we showed a great reaction after they scored the second goal.\n\n\"We wanted to score, which we did. It's important that we're through even if we didn't get the result on the night.\"\n\nOn what Forest needed to do in the second half: \"We needed to up the levels a bit more and focus on what we know is best - that's us on the ball, playing a high press and going to win the ball up high.\n\n\"It was unfortunate to score a second goal straight away in the second half but we reacted very well.\n\n\"In situations like that where they're getting a couple of goals, you've got to calm the game down. They're trying to chase the game, but we had to do what we know best - keep the ball, create more chances and hope to get a goal.\n\n\"When we got the goal, it gave us more breathing space to attack more. We've just got to keep working hard and push ourselves to get results.\"\n\nOn facing either Real Betis or Midtjylland in the last 16: \"No matter who comes, we're going to be prepared and ready for the game.\"\n\nAlthough they have now reached the Europa League last 16 stage, Nottingham Forest have suffered two home defeats in a single major European season for the first time (also lost 2-3 to FC Midtjylland in October).\n\n\n\nFenerbahce registered just their second European away win in England in all competitions (D2 L7), with this their first since beating Man Utd 1-0 in the UEFA Champions League in October 1996.\n\nWhat is the Europa League schedule?\n\nRound of 16 draw: 27 February, 12pm\n\nRound of 16: 12 & 19 March 2026\n\nQuarter-finals: 9 & 16 April 2026\n\nSemi-finals: 30 April & 7 May 2026\n\nFinal: 20 May 2026 (Istanbul)"

I'm delighted for him, he's a lovely lad.\n\n\"Everybody did well in the match. It gives me food for thought. Of course it does, absolutely.\n\n\"It's not as if we've played some 16-year-olds.

The referee responded by crossing ​his arms in front of his ⁠face, activating FIFA's anti-racism protocol and temporarily stopping the match.\n\nUEFA has opened an investigation into allegations of \"discriminatory behaviour\" after the game in Lisbon, and Prestianni was handed a one-match suspension, covering the second leg at the Bernabeu.\n\nBenfica appealed the temporary suspension, and Prestianni did travel and train with the squad in Madrid. However, the appeal was dismissed hours before the game on Wednesday.\n\nReal Madrid won the tie 3-1 on aggregate to seal a spot on the last 16.

In June 2024, three Valencia fans were jailed for eight months for racially abusing him during a LaLiga game the previous year, in the first verdict of its kind in Spain.\n\n\"There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium,\" said Mourinho. \"A stadium where Vinicius plays something happens, always.\"\n\nMourinho was seen speaking to a visibly upset Vinicius Jr and a member of the Benfica coaching staff was shown a red card during the lengthy stoppage.

It's better if it doesn't happen, but this can happen too.\n\n\"It's the Champions League, the best competition in the world for clubs. So, it's normal that people want to win, to give their best for their club and their fans and defend their colours.\n\n\"After that, Benfica's No 25 - I don't want to say his name because he doesn't deserve it - starts to talk badly. You don't accept it but, again, it happens in football and it will continue to happen.\n\n\"He put his shirt here [over his mouth] to say Vinicius is a ****** five times. I heard it. There are Benfica players who heard it as well. And after that point, everything you have seen started.\n\n\"I want to try and explain it calmly. I don't want to speak in a general manner. I have come to Portugal many times. I have been lucky to have many team-mates and friends from Portugal, and nothing has ever happened to me.\n\n\"With these kind of things, it's very important to speak in a very clear way, and to not speak in general, because there are people who haven't done anything wrong. In the stadium, I think there are 70,000 people who haven't done anything wrong. They just wanted to support their team.\n\n\"I have the maximum respect for Benfica and their manager, who is one of the best in history, who has made history at Real Madrid.\n\n\"But this player, for me, doesn't deserve to play in the Champions League anymore.\n\n\"It's a wonderful thing to play in the Champions League. The best competition. Everyone here, all the journalists, loves the Champions League, no? It inspires me as a player, it inspires the people, it inspires children, and we have to give the best possible example to young people.\n\n\"If we let this kind of thing happen, I think all the values of football are worthless, all that we believe is worthless. We have to do something.\"\n\nVinicius Jr's history with incidents of racism\n\nVinicius Jr has spoken out previously about repeated racist abuse he has suffered, saying in 2024 that he felt \"less and less\" like playing football because of the abuse.\n\nIn that same year, three Valencia fans were sentenced to eight months in prison for racially abusing him at a match in May 2023 - in scenes reminiscent of those in Benfica, as the game was also stopped for 10 minutes after Vinicius Jr alerted the referee to fans he felt had abused him.\n\nAfter the game, the Brazilian said LaLiga \"belongs to racism\". But LaLiga president Javier Tebas responded that Vinicius Jr had been \"manipulated\" in calling out the abuse. Tebas later apologised for those comments.\n\nThe three supporters from the Valencia incident were also fined €5,000 (£4,681) and banned from sporting venues for one year for making racist gestures. Valencia were fined €27,000 (£23,581) and had their stadium partially closed for three matches.\n\nSince then, Spain has been punishing supporters for racist abuse towards Vinicius Jr. Four people were convicted for hanging an effigy with his name on it off a highway bridge in Madrid earlier in 2023.\n\nThree of them were sentenced to seven months in prison for hate crimes and threats, while the other was sentenced to 15 months in prison for sharing the images online.\n\nAll four had to take an anti-discrimination training programme to have those sentences suspended, while they were also fined €60,000 and banned from sports venues for two years.\n\nAnd just last year, five Real Valladolid fans were found guilty for racially abusing Vinicius Jr during a match in 2022. They faced one year in prison and were fined up to €1,620 (£1,412) - but again the prison sentences were suspended as long as they did not attend a football match for three years."

Signed for £72m as a promising striker filled with potential just two years earlier, he was pushed out of Old Trafford to make way for Sesko over the summer.\n\nImage: Sesko celebrates his winner in the 1-0 win at Everton\n\nSesko is beginning to show signs he can bear the burden of being United's No. 9 - but three of his five goals have come as a substitute and the other two against promoted-side Burnley, currently second from bottom.\n\nHow Sesko copes when he is the regular starter will be the true test of the 22-year-old.\n\n\"It's a lot of pressure,\" Neville said. \"The biggest pressure in English football, that's a Manchester United goalkeeper, but not far behind would be a striker who comes for big money to United.\n\n\"When you come in as a striker with a big price tag, you've got to deliver and he's starting to deliver.\n\n\"There is a danger that maybe that he's sort of getting that super-sub title, but I don't think he's that type. He's a starting player. He has been a super sub in the last few games because he's needed to be.\n\n\"I don't think he's ever going to be the perfect striker, like I said about Gyokeres. But if he can be a handful, contribute with goals, hold things up, link play, that'll be enough. You don't have to be always perfect and [his winner at Everton], it's a big moment for him.\n\n\"If he can get another four or five and finish this season in double figures, in his first season with the struggle that the team were having at the beginning, I think that would be deemed to be a good season.\"\n\nManchester United\n\nCrystal Palace Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\nSesko faced questions about how he copes with the scrutiny of being United's goalscorer after his winner at Everton as the conversation soon turned to whether he would start at Palace.\n\n\"The pressure is something that, if I want to be a good player, it's something that I have to have,\" Sesko said.\n\n\"It's something that has (to be there) if you want to play at the highest level and it's about accepting it and not really caring about it.\"\n\nSesko has made a strong case to be in from the start against Palace. It is now up to Carrick to decide whether now is the right time to open the door for the young striker.\n\nWatch Man Utd vs Crystal Palace on Sunday, live on Sky Sports, kick-off 2pm"

            "content": "For 67 minutes, Nottingham Forest were at risk of making unwanted history. At that point Fenerbahce were 2-0 up and full of belief that they could achieve the miracle their head coach Domenico Tedesco had been manifesting since their 3-0 first-leg defeat in Istanbul.\n\nOnly one team in the history of European competition had lost the first leg of a tie by a three-goal margin at home and advanced. Up in the City Ground directors’ box, Evangelos Marinakis, more than an interested party on that occasion, presumably had flashbacks of Olympiakos suffering a 4-1 home defeat by Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Conference League two years ago, only to triumph 6-1 in Serbia in the second leg.\n\nKerem Akturkoglu scored twice to fuel Fenerbahce’s hopes, his second from the penalty spot almost immediately after the half-time restart, but the Forest substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi struck midway through the second half to extinguish the visitors’ dreams.\n\nForest will learn on Friday whether they will face Midtjylland or Real Betis, both of whom they played in the league phase, in the round of 16. Fenerbahce’s hopes of reaching the Europa League showpiece in May, across town in Besiktas, are over.\n\nThe way this game was set up, an early Fenerbahce goal was always going to shift the dynamic of the tie and the Turkish side got one when Akturkoglu applied the finishing touch to a counterattack. Vítor Pereira acknowledged the worst mistake Forest could make was to assume their place in the round of 16 was secure after last week’s triumph in Istanbul and his much-changed side were disjointed and sloppy.\n\nMurillo, who opened the scoring in style after roaming forward from halfway in Turkey, was uncomfortable and erratic after being shunted across to left-back, with fellow Brazilians Morato and Jair Cunha doing little to inspire confidence at centre-back. Luckily, Stefan Ortega, one of five Forest players to keep their spots, was alert in the Forest goal, saving well from Sidiki Cherif on the verge of half-time.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate. Agencies Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nIt was a long first half from a Forest perspective. The flares thrown on to the pitch by the Fenerbahce supporters within 30 seconds of kick-off paused the game for a couple of minutes; the visiting captain, Ismail Yuksek, appeared to plead with the visiting fans to stop. Their actions disrupted the game and it all rather made a mockery of the strict measures enforced on the Forest supporters in Kadikoy, where they had to be bussed into the stadium four hours before kick-off. Fenerbahce’s most loyal followers sensed scope for an almighty comeback, even if Tedesco’s side were injury-ravaged and able to name only seven substitutes.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elliot Anderson shoots narrowly wide against Fenerbahce in the first half. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nForest were in an awkward spot from the moment Dorgeles Nene released Cherif down the right channel in the 22nd minute. Suddenly it was two v two and Forest had been pulled out of position. Cherif played the ball across goal, from right to left towards Akturkoglu and while Neco Williams got the slightest touch after sliding in desperation, the Forest full-back then lost his footing and now the Fenerbahce forward just had Ortega to beat. Pereira scratched his head as the away end went ballistic.\n\nMore flares followed. Elliot Anderson was again Forest’s best player by some distance and blasted a brilliant effort wide of a post from close to the byline but Fenerbahce wanted to seize on the hosts’ vulnerability. Cherif rattled an effort against the side netting after a rare stray Anderson pass meant for Morato and then, in first-half stoppage time, Ortega repelled another Cherif effort, from Akturkoglu’s clever backheel.\n\nView image in fullscreen Fenerbahce fans threw flares on to the pitch and delayed the first half. Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPA\n\nPereira attempted to stem the bleeding with a quadruple half-time substitution, introducing Hudson-Odoi, Ola Aina, Igor Jesus and Ibrahim Sangaré. Yet just 25 seconds after the restart, the Italian referee Maurizio Mariani pointed to the penalty spot after Akturkoglu collapsed in the box. Jair Cunha appeared to make little contact with the Fenerbahce striker but was deemed to have tripped Akturkoglu, who made the most of a clumsy challenge. A video assistant referee check came and went and Atkurkoglu promptly sent Ortega the wrong way from 12 yards.\n\nFenerbahce raced the ball back to the centre circle. Forest were faced with exactly the kind of scenario they must have dreaded, though the fear seemed to galvanise them a little. Jair Cunha and Nicolás Domínguez both sent shots at goal and Williams sent a swerving effort wide.\n\nForest began to command greater control and Pereira cut a relieved figure as his side reestablished a two-goal aggregate buffer, a pair of substitutes combining to devastating effect. Aina chipped the ball towards the back post where Hudson-Odoi got the ball under his spell with a brilliant first touch before twisting past Nelson Semedo, a half-time arrival himself, and prodding his shot into the far corner. Pereira punched the air with both fists and the underlying tensions evaporated. Forest, for so long fraught with nerves, could finally rejoice."

            "content": "Chelsea made a financial loss of £355m in the 2024-25 season, according to new data released by Uefa, the biggest deficit ever recorded by an English football club.\n\nAccording to Uefa, Chelsea’s losses were more than double the ­second-worst in Europe, the £171m posted by Lyon. The figures are also about £260m worse than those posted by the Blues in 2023-24.\n\nWhile Uefa’s report does not fully break down Chelsea’s figures, it does show that while they have spent money on a level with the top clubs in Europe, costs have not been matched by revenues. Chelsea’s wage bill is estimated to be the sixth highest in Europe, at £390m a season. Chelsea’s operational expenditure, or day-to-day costs, were the fifth highest in Europe, meanwhile, at £241m. Uefa also calculates that the Blues have the most expensive squad in history, assembled at a combined cost of over £1.5bn.\n\nIn terms of matchday revenue, however, Chelsea made a reported £1.2m less per game than Liverpool, with Stamford Bridge only the 10th biggest ground in last season’s ­Premier League. Commercial revenue fell year-on-year to £207m, about £165m less than the figure reported by Manchester City and at odds with an overall trend for growth in this area. Chelsea did, though, increase their broadcast revenues, from £167m to £193m thanks in large part to their success at the Club World Cup.\n\nChelsea’s finances have been the subject of debate since the club was taken over by the investment vehicle BlueCo in 2021. The men’s team has largely gone without a front-of-shirt sponsor in the intervening years, while the club have also become known for tying their players to long-term contracts, such as the eight-year deal given to the winger Mykhailo Mudryk, reported to be worth £100,000-a-week. The Ukrainian is serving a provisional ­suspension for doping.\n\nThe ownership have also sold hotels on the club’s grounds to related businesses in order to meet the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules.\n\nAlso on the list of Europe’s ­biggest financial losers are Strasbourg. Ranking at No 8 in Uefa’s list, with reported losses of £69m, the Ligue 1 side are also owned by BlueCo and have spent increasingly substantial figures on transfer fees in the past three seasons. Many of those deals have been struck with Chelsea, including nine transfers from London in this season alone."

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final European fixture as a manager. He created such wonderful memories for Celtic’s support in this domain during his first tenure that departing with a smile felt appropriate. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts. “The evening is nothing to do with me,” said O’Neill with needless self-deprecation.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal inside 30 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered unexpected cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half – the hosts had 24 attempts at goal – but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that is worthy of huge credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have delivered a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite either set of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday at the start of a spell that will define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart had managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ragged and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe only goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. “I got carried away with myself,” O’Neill said later. “I thought ‘we are going to do this here’.”\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate.

The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm clash. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident been as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were only 25 minutes from that maiden win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly cancelled for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious as Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement albeit the officials had ushered him back on to the pitch. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "It is a peculiarity particular to Crystal Palace that a season of such upheaval and unrest could still end up with Oliver Glasner’s side winning another trophy. Having left the pitch after last week’s first leg with supporters calling for the Austrian manager to be sacked in the morning, Maxence Lacroix’s first-half header made it a much more harmonious evening for Glasner and his side.\n\nThey spurned a number of opportunities to wrap up the victory over Zrinjski Mostar before Evann Guessand eventually did late on after being fortunate to escape from last week’s trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina with a 1-1 draw.\n\nBut having been demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League after winning the FA Cup last season, Palace’s first European campaign will continue against either Cypriot side Larnaca – who they lost to during the group stages – or Mainz from Germany.\n\nPalace rejected a request from the supporters group responsible for the banner directed against Glasner in their last match against Wolves to turn off the music so they could “back the team during the pre-match warm-up” on the grounds that Uefa’s regulations wouldn’t allow it.\n\nBut the presence of a large group of travelling supporters who took up position two hours before kick-off helped to create a decent atmosphere despite a large number of empty seats in the home sections. “40 quid? Palace fans fleeced = empty seats,” read the latest banner that was displayed by the Holmesdale Fanatics during the first half.\n\nIn his pre-match press conference Zrinjski’s manager, Igor Stimac, had recalled beating Palace to promotion back in 1996 when he was a defender for Derby County. The 58-year-old’s previous post was in charge of India and he suggested his side might have a chance if they could “be firm and steady” in the opening 20 minutes despite missing several good opportunities to win the first leg.\n\nIt seemed like they could be in for a long evening when Jørgen Strand Larsen’s shot deflected wide in the fifth minute. But Zrinjski managed to keep Palace at arm’s length until almost half-time thanks to some brave defending.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nThe Palace fans were starting to get on the Portuguese referee’s back after a series of decisions went against their side, with Jaydee Canvot and Stand Larsen both cautioned.\n\nBut in a season where defending set pieces has proved to be a major weakness, Glasner punched the air in delight when Adam Wharton’s pinpoint free-kick was headed in by Lacroix.\n\nThe England midfielder has been showing signs of fatigue in recent weeks but is still capable of providing real quality, as well as the occasional mistake. It was Wharton’s slip that allowed Leo Mikic a first sight of goal for Zrinjski just before half-time but his shot was jeered as it sailed wide.\n\nThe onus was on the side that are second in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s domestic league to attack and they looked determined to find a way back into the tie at the start of the second half. Wharton was withdrawn not long after he had been shown a yellow card for a high boot as Will Hughes was introduced from the bench, although that left Palace short of creativity in central midfield.\n\nIsmaïla Sarr headed well over from Tyrick Mitchell’s cross in a rare sight of goal as another of Palace’s issues this season – struggling to break down teams employing a low block – returned. Their best chance of extending the lead was from another set piece and Chris Richards should have done better from close range on two occasions from a couple of Kamada free-kicks.\n\nView image in fullscreen Evann Guessand doubles Crystal Palace’s lead in stoppage time. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThere was a warning for Palace that the tie wasn’t over when Zrinjski had a goal correctly ruled out for offside with 25 minutes still to play.\n\nYet it was the hosts who should have made things much more comfortable in the end. Guessand had a golden opportunity to settle it but saw his shot saved by Karacic and Sarr was also guilty of missing two chances that looked easier to score.\n\nZrinjski’s big moment to equalise came in the second minute of injury time but the substitute Tomi Juric could only head over from a corner before Guessand finally made sure with a late finish to send Palace into the last 16."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says the salvage operation he has taken on at Tottenham is tougher than he envisaged and most likely his hardest job in management.\n\nThe interim coach, who is preparing for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Fulham, has worked with his new squad since the beginning of last week, having replaced the sacked Thomas Frank. Tudor lost his first game 4-1 at home to Arsenal on Sunday, which left Spurs four points above the relegation zone.\n\nAn alarming fitness situation has improved slightly with the return to training of Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso, meaning Tudor will be without eight injured players at Fulham, plus the suspended Cristian Romero, though Micky van de Ven is expected to be fit.\n\nSpurs are without a win in nine league matches and Tudor’s eyes are wide open about the scale of the task. “Probably, yes … I agree with you,” Tudor said when asked whether the role was more difficult than expected.\n\n“It’s very tough … but it is how it is. So daily work, focus, raising in all things we need to do – physical condition, mental confidence, performance – and waiting for the [injured] players to come back.”\n\nTudor started work as a manager in 2013 and is now in his 12th job. Is Spurs the biggest challenge? “Probably,” he said. “If I recognise the difficulties there are, probably, yes. It’s an even bigger challenge, an even bigger motivation to do this and we do it.”\n\nTudor described Spurs’ plight before the Arsenal game as an “emergency situation” and he warmed to the theme before another derby. “It’s not looking to the style at this moment,” he said. “Because now it’s a question of life and death.\n\n“There is not too much time to think about performance or style. Every game needs to be prepared in that way. How we can take these points, one way or the other?\n\n“In Italy, they use the term ‘have the mentality of a small team’. That is the key, to always have motivation when you play big teams. So that’s the start, of course, and we work a lot on that. The players are aware of the situation.”\n\nLike Frank before him, Tudor refused to use the R word – relegation. “I never used it but not because it’s something too scary or it’s a danger word or we won’t sleep,” he said. “It’s about that we need to refocus on ourselves.”"

We’re looking to build a business, but we’re also looking to learn to see how that might be replicable around the world.”\n\nMasters told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London that Premier League Plus would be offered in partnership with the existing rights holder, Starhub, and would be a “24-seven” service.\n\n“It’s going to be a really exciting product, and the big change is I think that the Premier League will have its own customers and means us delving into things like promotion and pricing,” said Masters. “That’s why it’s an important step for us.”\n\nThe idea of a “Premflix” offering has been speculated on for a number of years. Premier League club owners have backed the idea, with Chelsea’s Todd Boehly telling the FT conference last year that the league should sell its global rights direct to the streaming service Netflix. Instead, the Premier League has gone for a trial approach, with Masters telling an audience of industry insiders that international broadcast revenues had grown by 27% through the latest three-year rights cycle.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Premier League’s Richard Masters says its new app is ‘an important step for us’. Photograph: Jon Super/AP\n\nAlso appearing at the conference was the chair of the Independent Football Regulator, David Kogan. He called on the Premier League and EFL to come to a new “long-term sustainable agreement” over financial redistribution, arguing that it would lead to “less regulation” in the future.\n\nKogan also reaffirmed that parachute payments, which have been a barrier to any resolution between the Premier League and EFL, would come under scrutiny as part of the forthcoming State of the Game review. “Parachute payments are not going to vanish overnight,” Kogan said, “[but] the discussion about parachute payments is a fundamental part of the discussion about distribution.”\n\nThe chair of the EFL, Rick Parry, also speaking at the summit, said that parachute payments had represented 6% of EFL turnover when introduced in 1992, but by the 2018-19 season had reached 173% of turnover. The wage bill of clubs in receipt of the payments was more than double that of the rest of the Championship. “The Premier League chase is the most expensive lottery ticket on the planet,” he said.\n\nKogan said he believed the “backstop” option which would allow the regulator to impose a distribution deal would not need to be activated and that the leagues would come to a deal independently. Masters said that while “we’re all agreed we want a strong pyramid”, he thought “it should be left to the organisations to come up with these agreements”."

            "content": "Senne Lammens revels in the “war” of being Manchester United’s goalkeeper in the hugely physical Premier League yet remains bemused at being applauded when entering a primary school classroom on a Wednesday afternoon.\n\nClearly the 23-year-old is still adjusting to a rocketing career trajectory. Following his £18m transfer from Royal Antwerp on 1 September, Lammens made his debut in the 2-0 win against Sunderland on 4 October, and established himself as the first choice with a faultless start that featured five clean sheets in 21 league games.\n\nTo do so in the relentless glare at United is impressive. In Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton, Lammens was again calm and assured, producing vital saves while navigating the hurly-burly of set pieces and corners as players crowded his goalmouth.\n\nView image in fullscreen Senne Lammens is first to the ball while under pressure from Everton’s Thierno Barry as the United goalkeeper keeps another clean sheet. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n\nLammens shrugs when considering the chaos he faces at dead balls. “Physically Everton was a big battle, a big game so I’m still recovering from that,” Lammens says. “It’s been like this. It’s just the way it is – the Premier League, it’s physicality and a bit of war in the 18-yard box.”\n\nAt 6ft 4in and with a robust frame, the young Belgian is built for the game’s demands. “It’s one of my strengths,” he says, “so sometimes I like the challenge as well. Of course it can get too much sometimes but everyone has to deal with it. It’s not like only one team does it, it’s everyone in general.\n\n“As a goalkeeper you have to get used to that and train for it and get better at it. I’ve been doing a good job at it so I’ll continue to do that. The club said to me that it was the most physical. It’s the best league but the physicality is the biggest difference. We do it as well sometimes, making it hard for the goalkeeper.\n\n“In Belgium it’s less physical but still the principles are the same. Here there are a bit more bodies in front of you, but my team has helped me out with blocking guys. You have to be big and not be pushed around easily.”\n\nLammens suggests that greater protection for keepers may have to be considered. “There have to be certain rules,” he says. “You can’t get to the point where it’s too [unfair]. That’s something the Premier League has to look towards.”\n\nLammens made his debut for Club Brugge in July 2021 before moving to Antwerp two years later. He remained uncapped at senior level for Belgium until November’s 7-0 win over Liechtenstein, replacing one of his heroes. “Thibaut Courtois was always a big thing when I was growing up because his saving is just world class,” Lammens says of the 33-year-old Real Madrid goalkeeper.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘You have to be big and not be pushed around easily,’ says the 23-year-old. Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Shutterstock\n\nBayern Munich’s 39-year-old Manuel Neuer was another source of inspiration. “When I was growing up my biggest idol was probably Neuer,” he says. “I take pride in being an all-around goalkeeper and that’s why I was such a big fan because he didn’t really have a weak point, so that’s something I want to take from him. But I try to learn something from everyone because everyone has strong points.”\n\nLammens is speaking at a Manchester United Foundation event at Partington Central Academy for World Book Day. The surprise at being cheered by pupils draws comparison with being ambushed by paparazzi this month when leaving the Ivy in Manchester after dining with his partner.\n\n“That was one of the more special moments. Special, like I couldn’t believe it. It’s not always the best feeling – they weren’t too bad. But for my girlfriend and I this was the first time with paparazzi. Looking back, it was quite funny. The club warned me that Manchester United is a different animal, especially social media wise.\n\n“It’s a bit new for me, but it’s also probably one of my best feelings when you go into [schools] and see all those children cheering for you and they don’t believe it’s you. Because I was there once in my life, it’s not that long ago. I still remember those times.”\n\nAway from the game, Lammens reads – his favourite book is Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist – and follows other sports. “I don’t really watch a lot of football because on a daily basis you’re doing a lot with football,” he says. “You want to switch off mentally. Of course you still have to watch other people play but everyone has his own experiences so the best learning school is yourself, your own experiences.\n\n“I’m a big sports guy. I love watching other sports and other athletes do their thing. Especially how they prepare for the game and think about their game. Like in the NBA and with, for example, Kobe Bryant or LeBron James.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Lammens with the pupils of Partington Central Academy. Photograph: MUFC\n\nAfter being recommended by Tony Coton, United’s goalkeeping scout, as the replacement for the erratic André Onana, Lammens has developed a rewarding working relationship with Tom Heaton, the third-choice keeper. He served early notice of his quality when gathering a corner with authority against Sunderland. It drew a rousing cheer from the Old Trafford faithful.\n\n“It was really nice getting the support from the fans and my teammates, the best feeling in the beginning. And they also gave me even more confidence to keep going and to make the steps I did after that.”\n\nIn an improving campaign under Michael Carrick that has garnered 16 points from the interim manager’s first six games, Lammens wants to maintain consistency. “I don’t really want to look too much into the past,” he says. “It’s been great but I still have to prove myself every week. I just have to keep going now. It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world but also you have to look through that – it’s still a game of football, the game isn’t that much different.”"

            "content": "A number of European football federations fear they will lose money sending their national teams to the World Cup this summer, with an unusual hike in costs and inconsistencies around tax exemptions among the problems Fifa is being urged to rectify.\n\nAlthough Fifa approved record prize money of £539m for the tournament last December it may not be enough to prevent losses, or reduced profits, for competitors who would usually expect a World Cup to generate vital funds. An investigation by the Guardian and PA Media found particular concerns among football associations about the consequences of missing out on money that would largely be reinvested in local initiatives.\n\nAbout 10 FAs are understood to have shared misgivings between themselves, most recently at Uefa’s annual congress in Brussels a fortnight ago. It has also been informally raised with senior Fifa officials, some of whom appear “embarrassed” about the situation according to an executive from one FA.\n\nTeams that qualify receive $9m (£6.7m) each from Fifa and are handed $1.5m in preparation costs. Those numbers are believed to have been the same for Qatar 2022, but the previous daily allowance of $850 per delegation member has been reduced to $600. One FA estimated that this would mean receiving about $500,000 less if its team remained at the World Cup, which has been expanded in length and number, for a month.\n\nSome FAs have calculated that they will make considerably less money in the US, Canada and Mexico than they did in Qatar; one, a fixture at international tournaments, told the Guardian it will in fact lose a sizeable sum in the event of elimination in the group stage or early in the knockout rounds.\n\nOne particularly aggravating element is a perceived unfairness around tax arrangements. Countries bidding for a World Cup are obliged to provide tax exemptions for FAs that qualify; those have been agreed with Canada and Mexico but no such arrangement has been reached with the US, meaning that nations potentially face vastly differing financial outlooks depending on where they were drawn to play.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Qatar World Cup cost less and was more lucrative for teams, with clear tax arrangements. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nState taxes within the US vary wildly. In California, where Los Angeles and San Francisco will host games, the top rate is 13.3%. In New Jersey, whose MetLife Stadium will stage the final, it stands at 10.75%. Teams largely based in states with lower rates, or outside the US, will find themselves at an advantage financially unless an agreement is reached in the next three and a half months. Given that context, there is also frustration that FAs have been left to seek their own tax advice rather than being given specific assistance by Fifa.\n\nOther factors hiking costs include the tournament’s considerable travel demands, unfavourable exchange rates against the dollar, the well-publicised increase in ticket prices and the event’s duration. In Qatar there were four weeks between the opening game and final; this time around the 28-day mark will arrive as the quarter-finals commence.\n\nWhile some figures acknowledge that FAs are responsible for their own bonus structures, which inevitably make for a notable outlay, they point out it would be unworkable to offer a reduced package to that which was promised to their squads in Qatar. Another mitigation offered for this summer’s problems is the potential longer-term benefit of lengthy exposure to the vast North American market. Fifa was contacted for comment."

I can enjoy life, God is good.”\n\nBut even then, he was not off the hook, as he was being held in Bali’s Immigration Detention Centre before being sent back to Chicago.\n\nKerobokan prison chief Hudi Ismono said at the time: “Tommy was released today. He was sentenced to 18 years and received a sentence cut of 75 months and 120 days.\n\n“He has been in prison for 12 years. We handed him over to Immigration.”\n\nWhen Mack was deported back to the US in 2021, she was arrested by the FBI after landing at Chicago’s O’Hare airport.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nShe later struck a plea deal, pleading guilty to one conspiracy charge while the remaining counts were dropped.\n\nSchaefer was named in that same indictment, and now, after dodging the firing squad and getting out of Bali early, he is finally facing justice on US soil."

            "content": "ON a warm August evening in the sleepy Cambridgeshire town of Soham, school pals Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman set off for a sports centre to buy sweets from a vending machine.\n\nThe ten-year-old best friends — inseparable throughout much of the school holidays — had spent the day together playing computer games and listening to music at a family barbecue.\n\n\n\nThey changed into matching Manchester United shirts and black shorts and posed as Holly’s mum, Nicola, took a photograph. The clock behind them read 5:04pm.\n\nStanding side by side, they wrapped their arms around one another and flashed a smile for the camera that captured so beautifully the innocence of youth at the height of summer.\n\n\n\nThe girls ate dinner and left for the sports centre just after 6pm.\n\nNinety minutes after the picture was taken, Holly and Jessica were gone — the victims of a crime that shocked the nation to its core.\n\nBy the time I arrived in Soham, as a young reporter, the photograph of the schoolgirls was on every lamppost, in every shop window and on every front page. The ‘missing’ posters read: “Have you seen Holly and Jessica?”\n\nSoham itself was filled with a palpable unease and an overwhelming fear of an unspeakable evil.\n\nMothers held their children close. They stopped on the high street only to talk with other parents, their faces contorted with anguish and despair on behalf of Holly and Jessica’s parents.\n\n\n\nPolice carried out fingertip searches and commandeered Soham Village College to brief reporters on a daily basis. I was among those who packed inside for the latest updates.\n\nThe hall was a short walk from the house on College Close where caretaker Ian Huntley and his classroom assistant girlfriend Maxine Carr lived.\n\nHuntley, in navy blue polo shirt and blue trousers, was ever present.\n\nHe held the keys to the college, opened it for the police and even laid out the plastic chairs.\n\nThe child killer would stand at the back of the hall — just a few feet away from us — as officers provided the latest information.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the briefings, detectives would occasionally give off-the-record guidance.\n\nI have often thought back to those sweltering summer days in 2002 and wondered, in the midst of the mayhem, just how much Huntley gleaned from his access to the very hall the police were now using.\n\nHe went on to give interviews about how he might have been the last person to speak to Holly and Jessica before they went missing. He told one camera crew that the pair looked “as happy as Larry”.\n\nHuntley even helped a police dog handler search the area outside the hangar building where Holly and Jessica’s United tops were later found.\n\nHe said he could not open it because he did not have the keys.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, pressure on the police was growing. Fresh mounds of earth discovered by a jogger on a nearby hill turned out to be badger sets rather than shallow graves.\n\nHolly and Jessica’s parents stayed awake all night waiting for news before receiving a call dismissing it as a false alarm.\n\nHolly’s dad Kevin said the news had brought them a “glimmer of hope” which would give him and Nicola strength to carry on fighting for their daughter.\n\n\n\nWe were obviously fearing the worst but we are still here to carry on the fight and while there is still a glimmer of hope, we shall carry that fight on Holly’s dad Kevin\n\nHe said at the time: “It’s been an incredible roller coaster of a night.\n\n“We found out the news officially at about 6.30am. It’s been extremely upsetting.\n\n“We were obviously fearing the worst but we are still here to carry on the fight and while there is still a glimmer of hope, we shall carry that fight on.”\n\nOn the tenth day of the investigation, Det Supt David Beck made a direct televised appeal to the kidnapper.\n\nHe said: “If the children are still with you or you know where they are, then I would encourage you to contact a solicitor or someone else you can rely on.\n\n\n\n“Try to see beyond the next few hours. Keep in mind your future and the next few days and weeks.\n\n“Get in touch with somebody so that we can all get the girls home safely.” He said he had left a message on Jessica’s mobile with details of how to get in touch.\n\nBrutally murdered\n\nHe remained convinced the girls were alive and well and his appeal followed the release of CCTV pictures showing Holly and Jessica walking through the sports centre car park that Sunday.\n\nLater, the town fell silent as two actresses, aged nine and ten, retraced their last known footsteps for a TV reconstruction.\n\nThey were dressed in the same clothes Holly and Jessica were last seen in and had been given identical haircuts.\n\n\n\nHolly’s parents had earlier accompanied police and pointed out the routes the girls usually took while walking through the town centre. The information was combined with the last known sightings of the girls but yielded little new information.\n\nThen came the breakthrough. At 6.46pm on the day she disappeared, Jessica’s mobile phone was turned off, automatically sending a signal to a nearby phone mast.\n\nAnalysis showed the mast that pinged could receive a signal only from three places in Soham — and one of those places was directly outside Huntley’s house.\n\nHuntley was now their prime suspect.\n\nIt was Friday afternoon and I wandered back down to College Close, passing Huntley’s home on my right.\n\n\n\nI looked to the car park on my left and could see Det Chief Insp Andy Hebb sitting in a car with three other colleagues.\n\nMinutes later, they led away Huntley and Carr.\n\nHuntley was taken to Huntingdon police station and initially treated as a witness. He was released under covert surveillance as the focus shifted to the school grounds where he had walked as caretaker.\n\nThat night, after the discovery of the girls’ clothes, shredded and partially burned, he was arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\n\n\nThe town was in deep shock and mourning for two schoolgirls who went out for sweets but never returned home\n\nI pulled up outside his College Close home — which was now being taken apart by scenes of crime officers under floodlights and was later demolished — and remained there all night.\n\nThe next morning, two bodies were discovered 17 miles away in a drainage ditch close to Lakenheath airbase in Suffolk, a place where Huntley often went plane-spotting.\n\nPolice stood guard at the end of a long, straight road which led to the “deposition site”. My heart sank like a stone. Like every other reporter covering it, I had been consumed for days by the intensive search for Holly and Jessica.\n\nI buried the emotion, focused on the job at hand but knew deep down this would not end well.\n\nI am not going to be blamed for what that thing in that box has done to me or those children Maxine Carr\n\nThe following morning, I drove to the church in Soham ahead of its Sunday morning service and watched as the townsfolk filed inside. In that moment the reality of it all suddenly hit me.\n\n\n\nThe town was in deep shock and mourning for two schoolgirls who went out for sweets but never returned home. Two schoolgirls brutally murdered and then dumped in a ditch where they were left for days.\n\nHuntley was known to have taken a sexual interest in young girls and had been accused of sexual assaults in Grimsby, where he had lived before moving south.\n\nHe and Carr went on trial in 2003 at the Old Bailey. Carr admitted she had covered for him that fateful weekend.\n\nGiving evidence in the witness box, she pointed at Huntley in the dock and shouted: “I am not going to be blamed for what that thing in that box has done to me or those children.”\n\nHuntley, who claimed their deaths were accidental, was convicted by an 11-to-one majority verdict and sentenced to a minimum of 40 years.\n\n\n\nCarr — pictured in her police mug shot — was jailed for perverting the course of justice.\n\nShe was released in 2004 and went on to marry in 2014.\n\nShe now lives under a new identity as part of a blanket anonymity order.\n\nWhat happened in Soham 24 years ago will stay with me forever."

            "content": "IAN Huntley was battered in a savage attack that was “only a matter of time”, sources said.\n\nThe Soham child killer was hated in prison because of his crimes and his arrogance, with a string of lags desperate to get their hands on him.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he had argued with his attacker — rapist and triple murderer Anthony Russell — in the weeks before the frenzied assault, with claims that Huntley was trying to bully him.\n\nRussell, 43, and most other cons despised Huntley over his antics — including, as we revealed in July, wearing a red Manchester United-style shirt in an apparent sick reference to victims Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.\n\nRussell and other prisoners also resented Huntley over claims of special treatment, as he spent most of his time as an “enhanced” status inmate with extra privileges.\n\nUntil recently, Huntley was in a cell near a guards’ office at HMP Frankland, Co Durham, and was escorted by staff when he moved around the jail to keep him safe.\n\nYet, triple killer Russell spotted a chance to launch his attack when the child-murderer was allowed to attend a recycling workshop on A-wing at Frankland.\n\nThe pair had apparently argued when their cells were close to each other, before Russell was moved.\n\nA source said: “Huntley was hated at Frankland — so an attack like this was only a matter of time.\n\n\n\n“If it had not been Anthony Russell, it would have been someone else. But people are still amazed that Russell was able to get to him and do this.\n\n“Huntley would have three or four officers with him most of the time because he was such a target.\n\n“It was no secret that loads of inmates wanted to get to him and that is why he was guarded so closely.\n\n“But Huntley was a cleaner until recently, which meant he was always on the wing around officers.\n\n“He had only been allowed to go to the workshop in the last few weeks –— and that decision sealed his fate. It is surprising that they allowed Huntley to this workshop because it is more difficult to protect him there. That is one of the things the prison authorities will be looking at.\n\n\n\n“Russell is skinny and quite a small guy but obviously took his chance when it presented itself and used a metal pole as the weapon.\n\n“He must have had a very small window of time when guards were not watching him closely.\n\n“He and Huntley were in cells near each other on A-wing until recently and they argued and shouted at each other a lot.\n\n\n\n“Russell was moved and there were claims that Huntley was trying to bully him and turn others against him.\n\n“So he obviously bore a grudge against Huntley and he decided he would get him when he could in the workshop.\n\n“But there are loads of people on A-wing who would have done the same thing.\n\n“One of them is Darren Osborne, who had openly been telling people that he would kill Huntley if given the chance.”\n\nOsborne, 54, is serving life at Frankland for driving a van into a crowd of Muslims outside London’s Finsbury Park Mosque, killing Makram Ali, 51, in June 2018.\n\n\n\nWe told last July how Huntley had sparked fury by “strutting about” in a No10 United-style shirt around the prison’s grounds.\n\nHis ten-year-old victims were wearing United tops when school caretaker Huntley killed them in Soham, Cambs, in 2002.\n\nInmates are barred from wearing replica kits but he is believed to have ordered a red sports top resembling a United shirt.\n\nOne prisoner had complained about it in May and other cons shouted “sick b*****d” at Huntley as he strolled around Frankland.\n\nAfter we reported the story, Huntley’s cell was searched and the top and other items — including a picture of his ex, Maxine Carr — were confiscated.\n\n\n\nHe was stripped of his privileges but within months had his status moved back to the highest “enhanced” category. That gives lags more rights to video games, TV and DVDs, extra canteen cash and time in gyms and workshops.\n\nWe then revealed in January Huntley was furious when his Xbox was seized as more illicit items were found in his cell.\n\nThe double killer, originally from Grimsby, was carpeted and moved to a landing of pension-age lags.\n\n\n\nThat took him away from attacker Russell but also meant he was no longer housed next to a staff office.\n\nHuntley is so unpopular that one of his few friends at the prison was 78-year-old African dictator Charles Taylor, who was jailed for crimes against humanity.\n\nSources said he saw the former Liberian president, caged by the International Criminal Court for atrocities in Sierra Leone’s Blood Diamonds civil war, as a “father figure”.\n\nOur source added: “All the prisoners, and many of the staff, hated Huntley’s attitude.\n\n“He was seen as arrogant and would do things that other prisoners would not do.\n\n\n\n“He got away with wearing that shirt and other similar ones for ages before he was finally sanctioned for it when The Sun did the story. But no one could get to him — until now — because he was so protected. So people shouted things at him because he was escorted by officers but that was as close as they could get to taking revenge.\n\n“He also did things like keeping pictures and cuttings linked to his crimes and of Maxine Carr.\n\n“A lot of prisoners do not show remorse for their crimes but Huntley seemed to positively revel in his. And because his crimes were against two innocent girls, that made him even more hated and likely to be got at.\n\n“The officers went out of their way to keep him safe, because they knew if he was on his own he would not last long. But that protection made Huntley even more of a diva — and he had form for stamping his feet, shouting and crying if he did not get his way.\n\n“There were also rumours recently of Huntley having magazines and indecent images, and of selling stuff from his cell. But any chance they got, the staff would give him ‘enhanced’ status which only caused more resentment.\n\n\n\n“It means that there has always pretty much been a ‘hit’ out on Huntley — it is just that this guy was the first in Frankland to be able to properly get to him.\n\n“His attacker won’t care and he will be seen as a hero now by others. It is pretty telling that Huntley’s only friend was Charles Taylor. But even Taylor is polite to everyone no matter what they have done in or out of prison.\n\n“But Huntley tended to see him as a father figure and would go to him for advice. He only really spoke to him and a few of the more sympathetic officers.”\n\nHuntley targeted Holly and Jessica after they stopped to speak to him outside the house he shared with Carr, their teaching assistant.\n\n\n\nHe lured them in and murdered them.\n\nHe denied the murders and put the girls’ families through a harrowing six-week trial at the Old Bailey from November 2003.\n\nMonths earlier, in June 2003, he had attempted suicide at Woodhill prison in Milton Keynes, Bucks.\n\nHuntley was sent to Wakefield jail in West Yorkshire where in 2005 he was scalded with boiling water by another lag.\n\nIn September 2006, he again tried to kill himself in his cell and was taken to hospital.\n\n\n\nHe was transferred to Frankland in 2008. In 2010, he received non-life-threatening injuries to his neck when his throat was slashed.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nCarr, now 49, served 21 months for perverting justice by giving Huntley a false alibi.\n\nShe now lives under a new identity."

He is serving a life sentence with a recommendation that he serves at least 40 years for the murders.\n\nIn 2010, robber Damien Fowkes slashed Huntley with a home-made weapon, causing a “severe, gaping cut to the left side of his neck” with a 7in (18cm) wound which required 21 stitches. Fowkes asked a prison officer: “Is he dead? I hope so.” He described Huntley as a “notorious child killer, both inside prison and in society in general”."

The headteacher had been working there since September 2022 - but was arrested the following year in April by Lancashire Police's online abuse team after making indecent images of children and being in possession of another extreme pornographic image.\n\nMcDonald was suspended by the school on April 25 before resigning on July 25. He appeared in Preston Crown Court on June 20, 2024, and pleaded guilty to three charges of making an indecent photograph of a child and one of possessing an extreme pornographic image - which involves animals. The offences happened between January 2022 and April 2023.\n\nView 2 Images McDonald worked at Bishop Martin Primary School in Skelmersdale (Image: Google Maps)\n\nOn July 24, 2024, McDonald, of Alexandria Drive, St Annes, was sentenced to a three-year community order with 30 days rehabilitation to participate in a suitable accredited programme. He was also handed a sexual harm prevention order for five years.\n\nA former colleague of McDonald's, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Liverpool Echo that he left the school in 2023 and did not return.\n\nThe Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) report, written following a virtual hearing, said: \"There was no evidence that Mr McDonald’s actions were not deliberate. On the contrary, the evidence was that Mr McDonald had actively clicked on links to images and had retained some of them.\n\n\"There was no evidence that Mr McDonald was acting under extreme duress.\" It added that McDonald \"apologised for his actions and stated he had accepted the consequences\", but this was not enough to mitigate the severity of his crimes.\n\nDecision maker Stuart Blomfield said: \"In my view, it is necessary to impose a prohibition order in order to maintain public confidence in the profession. For these reasons, I have concluded that a prohibition order is proportionate and in the public interest in order to achieve the intended aims of a prohibition order. I have gone on to consider the matter of a review period. In this case, the panel has recommended that no provision should be made for a review period.\n\n\"I have considered the panel’s comments 'The panel found that the seriousness of the offending behaviour that led to the convictions were relevant to Mr McDonald’s ongoing suitability to teach', and that 'The panel was not provided with any evidence to be able to assess the risk of repetition in respect of Mr McDonald's conduct'.\"\n\nHe added: \"These elements are the seriousness of the conduct which related to primary age school children, the lack of full insight and the panel's assessment that it had no evidence upon which to determine the risk of repetition. I consider therefore that allowing for no review period is necessary to maintain public confidence and is proportionate and in the public interest.\"\n\nMr Blomfield concluded in his report: \"This means that Mr Ian McDonald is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or 13 children’s home in England.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"Furthermore, in view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against him, I have decided that Mr McDonald shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of his eligibility to teach.\""

Polls have shown it is a three-way race between Labour, the Green Party and Reform.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe by-election was called last month after former Government minister Andrew Gwynne announced he was stepping down. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham attempted to become the Labour candidate, but was blocked from doing so. Instead local councillor Angeliki Stogia was picked to contest the seat.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut despite getting a majority of over 13,000 last time around, Labour faces a tight contest. Controversial Reform candidate Matt Goodwin and the Green Party's Hannah Spencer are both in with a chance of heading to Westminister when the result comes in on Friday morning.\n\nHere we look at who the candidates for the major parties are.\n\nAsylum hotel use drops as bombshell migration figures show big changes READ MORE :\n\nView 5 Images Keir Starmer pitched up to the constituency this week to support candidate Angeliki Stogia (Image: Sean Hansford | Manchester Evening News)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAngeliki Stogia - Labour\n\nA longstanding Labour councillor, Ms Stogia was unveiled as the party's candidate last month after Andy Burnham's bid was blocked.\n\nThe daughter of a nursery teacher and a trade unionist, she grew up in Arta, Greece, moving to Manchester 30 years ago to study at Manchester Metropolitan University. She became a naturalised British citizen and has been a councillor since 2012.\n\nIn an attack on Nigel Farage, she told The Mirror: “Nigel Farage is a fake, he’s a phony, he’s a charlatan, and he goes around making out he’s the hero of the working class, yet he goes against everything that is there to support working class communities.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHannah Spencer - Green\n\nView 5 Images Hannah Spencer is vying to win the seat for the Green Party (Image: Getty Images)\n\nPlumner Ms Spencer, 34, is the leader of the Green Party group on Trafford Council.\n\nWhen she was unveiled in January she said: \"I work as a plumber, something I’ve done since leaving education at 16. I’m training to become a plasterer too. I’ve lived in the constituency and still work here. So, I know the issues and what people want to change.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBack in 2015, Ms Spencer told the Manchester Evening News that she had launched her own plumbing business that year, having juggled plumbing with other jobs after leaving education aged 16. And she said last week: \"I see in my job all the time the way that people are living and struggling. I'll go to do a gas check on a boiler, and that boiler's not been turned on since the person went there a year to do another gas check, because people just cannot afford to have the heating on.\"\n\nMatthew Goodwin - Reform\n\nView 5 Images Divisive TV host Matthew Goodwin is standing for Reform (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)\n\nGB News host and academic Mr Goodwin is a deeply divisive figure.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLast year he was criticised when he seemed to suggest that people from minority ethnic backgrounds who are born in the UK are not necessarily British.\n\nIn a series of posts on X, Mr Goodwin said the mass stabbing on a train in Huntingdon was due to 'mass uncontrolled immigration'. When it was pointed out that the attacker was born in Britain, he replied: \"So were all of the 7/7 bombers. It takes more than a piece of paper to make somebody 'British'.\"\n\nNigel Farage has been out and about in the constituency campaigning with Mr Goodwin, who has been on an eyebrow-raising political journey. He served as an advisor to the previous government on tackling anti-Muslim hatred, worked with anti-racism charities like Hope Not Hate and co-authored the 2015 book Revolt on the Right.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhile studying for a PHD at Bath University he wrote his thesis on the BNP, interviewing senior figures in the neo-Nazi movement. Mr Goodwin left academia in the summer of 2024 when he took redundancy as a professor at the University of Kent.\n\nCharlotte Cadden - Tory\n\nView 5 Images Former police officer Charlotte Cadden is the Tory hopeful (Image: Sean Hansford | Manchester Evening News)\n\nThe former police officer - who worked in Manchester and London - was a Detective Chief Inspector in the Metropolitan Police when she retired.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMs Cadden set up and chaired the police sex equality and equity network, to challenge workplace discrimination based on sex. She has said that getting a \"proper inquiry\" on grooming gangs is among her top priority.\n\nPart of her duties in the Met included looking after the safety of MPs. She has also said that getting rid of carbon tax would be among her priorities.\n\nWhen she was announced, Ms Cadden said: \"I know we're starting off from a very small base of Conservative voters from the last election but we've got our own policies – we need to get mobiles phones out of schools, we need to get rid of the carbon tax.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJackie Percey - Lib Dem\n\nView 5 Images Lib Dem activist Jackie Pearcey is contesting the by-election (Image: Sean Hansford | Manchester Evening News)\n\nThe Lib Dem candidate, who has a doctorate in nuclear physics, has been a prominent local campaigner for the Lib Dems.\n\nShe helped save the Gorton Monastery from being converted into flats. Ms Pearcey, who has been a school governor for 20 years, accused Labour of fighting over the keys to Number 10 rather than dealing with the issues that matter.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nShe said: \"Voters in Gorton and Denton deserve so much more than the failing Labour government or the divisive politics of Reform UK.\n\n“We have a golden opportunity to champion the issues that matter most to people - the cost of living, fixing the NHS and supporting our local high streets and businesses. I’ve got a proven track record of delivering for residents and I’ll continue to fight for the people of Gorton and Denton through this election and beyond.”"

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

            "content": "Star boxer Manny Pacquiao is suing a top law firm and their client for allegedly fabricating a case against him, falsely accusing him of a ‘terror campaign’ and covering up evidence proving the ‘extortion’ ruse.\n\nGabriel Rueda, a waiter at celebrity hotspot Craig's restaurant in West Hollywood, sued Pacquiao in 2016 claiming he was owed an $8 million fee for connecting the boxer’s coach with then-CBS president Leslie Moonves to arrange his blockbuster May 2015 fight against Floyd Mayweather.\n\nRueda claimed Pacquiao reneged on the deal and terrorized him into submission by texting him photos of dismembered bodies and had his tires slashed, demanding $42 million in damages.\n\nBut the case was thrown out last year, with the judge finding no evidence for the claims.\n\nHitting back with his own lawsuit filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Pacquiao says he found a bombshell email allegedly proving the waiter admitted his entire case was baseless just days after it began.\n\n‘Gabriel did it from his heart and asked for nothing in return. No finder's fee, no compensation,’ Rueda allegedly wrote in an email to his publicists at the time.\n\nManny Pacquiao is suing a law firm and their client for allegedly fabricating a case against him\n\nThe message never came to light despite a judge ordering Rueda’s messages be turned over in 2018, and was only uncovered from a forensic analysis by Pacquiao’s team in 2023.\n\nPacquiao’s lawyers say they traced the gruesome texts of body parts back to a mass-distributed cartel scam.\n\nRecords cited by his new lawsuit allegedly show identical threats were sent to more than 100 other people unconnected to the case.\n\nAfter losing the case, Withers Bergman tried to withdraw as Rueda’s lawyers, and his attorney Amman Khan’s profile was removed from the firm’s website.\n\nOver a decade on from their first encounter, Pacquiao is set for a stunning rematch with Mayweather in Las Vegas later this year.\n\nA Hollywood waiter sued Pacquiao in 2016 after claiming he was owed an $8million fee for helping to arrange his blockbuster May 2015 fight against Floyd Mayweather (pictured)\n\nThe fight icons will meet again in September in the first ever boxing match at 'The Sphere' off the strip in Sin City, it was announced earlier this week.\n\nThe bout is set to be globally broadcast on Netflix as part of the streamer's growing investment into live sports.\n\nMayweather, 49, first has to take on Mike Tyson, 59, in an exhibition bout this spring.

            "content": "Frank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death.

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure.

Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "Vitor Pereira's honeymoon period as Nottingham Forest head coach has lasted precisely 225 minutes. That was all it took for the home fans to show their disgust with their team.\n\nThey may have squeezed through to the Europa League last 16 but in Pereira’s third game at the helm, Forest were far from convincing and were booed off at half-time, trailing to Kerem Akturkoglu’s strike.\n\nIt threatened to become worse when Akturkoglu converted a penalty early in the second half but by then Pereira had sent on his main men and one of them, Callum Hudson-Odoi, scored in the 68th minute to seal a 4-2 aggregate victory. Forest will face either Real Betis or FC Midtjylland in the next round – even though they took on both clubs in the league phase.\n\nThanks to their 3-0 first-leg win in Istanbul last week, this should have been a comfortable evening for Forest. But like Nuno Espirito Santo, Ange Postecoglou and Sean Dyche before him, Pereira is learning there is a huge gap in quality between Forest’s best 13 or 14 players, and the rest of the squad.\n\nPereira made six changes to his starting XI and none of those players are likely to be included for Sunday’s crucial Premier League clash at Brighton.\n\nThe travelling Fener fans hurled multiple flares on to the pitch in the first minute, causing a brief stoppage in play. Captain Ismail Yuksek pleaded for calm yet it was Forest who looked jittery.\n\nNottingham Forest survived a second leg scare in the Europa League, before Callum Hudson-Odoi's goal gave the Premier League side a 4-2 win on aggregate against Fenerbahce\n\nVitor Pereira's side had earned a 3-0 win in the first leg away from home, all but sealing the tie\n\nBut Kerem Akturkoglu struck in the 22nd minute of the game to make it 3-1 on aggregate\n\nThe Fenerbahce star then netted from the penalty spot after the break to set up a nervy finish\n\nNerves are one thing, competence is another. When he arrived, Pereira talked about using his whole squad. How does he stick to those words after this? Morato, James McAtee and Lorenzo Lucca looked way out of their depth and Forest were lucky to be only 1-0 down at the interval.\n\nWhen Morato slipped on the halfway line in the 22nd minute, Forest were left two-on-two at the back. Neco Williams failed to cut out Sidiki Cherif’s cross, allowing Akturkoglu to steady himself and finish from close range. Trying to respond immediately, Elliot Anderson collected a pass from Omari Hutchinson and fired a fraction wide from a narrow angle.\n\nCherif – twice – and Akturkoglu failed to profit from Forest mistakes and when the whistle went for half-time, the home fans made their feelings known.\n\nForest made four changes at half-time only for Fener to win a penalty within 25 seconds of the restart when Jair Cunha tripped Akturkoglu and the Turkey international converted confidently from the spot. And when Cunha had the chance to make amends soon afterwards, Tarik Cetin saved his effort.\n\nDespite the second goal, the arrival of first-team regulars Ola Aina, Ibrahim Sangare, Igor Jesus and Callum Hudson-Odoi revived Forest a little, and it was Hudson-Odoi who lowered the collective heart rate inside the City Ground when his angled shot from 10 yards crept into the corner midway through the second half. Igor Jesus and Hutchinson then wasted chances to level it on the night as Forest edged through."

            "content": "Crystal Palace 2-0 Zrinjski Mostar: Oliver Glasner finally finds the formula in Europe with key tactical change - as Eagles unite Selhurst Park despite chaos engulfing the club\n\nRight when they needed them, Crystal Palace's big players stepped up as Oliver Glasner's side kept their European dream alive thanks to Maxence Lacroix and Evann Guessand's decisive goals.\n\nOn an electric night at Selhurst Park, the Frenchman's first-half header and the Ivorian's late strike proved vital as Palace finally overcame their plucky Bosnian opponents Zrinjski Mostar.\n\nThere was no doubt this was the biggest night of the Eagles' season given the way their campaign has started to unravel ever since Oliver Glasner announced in January that he would be leaving come the summer.\n\nIn a campaign that had promised so much, an end to the European journey in February, regardless of the acrimony that has followed the Austrian around in recent weeks, would’ve been a disaster.\n\nIt is easy to forget that it is just over two months since Palace, not long off a club record unbeaten run, were in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals and about to enter the FA Cup as reigning champions, but such has been the collapse in their form, that this felt enormous for a multitude of reasons.\n\nThat jeopardy was only added to by Zrinjski manager Igor Stimac, once of West Ham and Derby. Pre-match he called out Palace's board for a 'lack of ambition', spoke about their weaknesses against teams who defend deep, and expressed a desire to add to his own history against Palace. Stimac was part of the Derby team who beat the Eagles to gain promotion to the Premier League back in 1996.\n\nCrystal Palace dispatched Zrinjski Mostar 2-0 at Selhurst Park to reach the UEFA Conference League last 16\n\nEvann Guessand's 93rd-minute strike followed Maxence Lacroix's first-half header\n\nDespite the recent chaos that has engulfed Palace and the seeming breakdown in relationship between the fans and Glasner, the home supporters roared their side on from the warm-up after a rallying call from the fan group Holmesdale Fanatics.\n\nPalace had won just two of their last 16 matches in all competitions - including a dire performance in last week's 1-1 draw in Bosnia that they perhaps should have lost - yet all the energy and intensity that had been lacking during that run was back in the first half.\n\nMuch of their European campaign has been hampered by a failure to break down low blocks, but here they zipped the ball around and pressed with intent.\n\nIt was also notable how much more direct they were in their play and Jorgen Strand Larsen, Daichi Kamada and Evann Guessand all went close.\n\nZrinjski, who drew 1-1 and lost 1-0 to Aston Villa in the group stage of this competition two years ago, proved to be dogged, and Stimac’s side used all the tricks in the book to slow Palace down and frustrate them. That angst was added to by a chaotic performance from Portuguese referee Luis Godinho.\n\nYet it was Wharton, one of many players to have been off colour during the recent run, who whipped in a delightful free kick for Lacroix, the unsung hero of this side, to head home powerfully.\n\nThe atmosphere ramped up a notch and the question was whether Palace could capitalise.\n\nKamada was finding pockets of space in midfield and controlling things, while Sarr, Strand Larsen and Guessand continually caused trouble with their relentless running in behind\n\nChris Richards went close twice and Sarr and Guessand squandered golden opportunities, yet when that second goal didn't come the tension ramped up.\n\nDean Henderson, on his 100th appearance for this club, had barely had a touch but given the tense nature of this game, he remained on high alert. Lacroix, Richards and Jaydee Canvot held firm.\n\nA failure to take their chances almost cost Palace when Tomi Juric agonisingly headed wide for Zrinjski in injury time, before Guessand finally settled things after a one-two with Brennan Johnson to secure his side's passage to the last-16.\n\n\n\nPalace fans can continue to dream about a trip to Leipzig in May."

Ryan Yates suffers horror finger injury during Nottingham Forest's Europa League clash with Fenerbahce - and plays on anyway!\n\nNottingham Forest captain Ryan Yates suffered a sickening finger injury against Fenerbahce - but played on all the same.\n\nThe midfielder dislocated his pinkie finger after falling and landing awkwardly barely seven minutes into the second leg of Forest's Europa League play-off.\n\nYates, 28, was in clear pain and required immediate attention from Forest's medical team at the City Ground.\n\nTNT Sports considered the incident too grisly to show a replay of due to Yates' finger being bent at a 90-degree angle.\n\nBut the Englishman simply soldiered on from there in a show of toughness.\n\nCommentator Darren Fletcher said: 'The fact he's just gestured to the physio and said, \"Can you come and just sort this out,\" is remarkable.\n\nNottingham Forest captain Ryan Yates dislocated his finger after landing awkwardly during their Europa League clash with Fenerbahce\n\nHe called over medical attention and, once patched up, simply carried on playing\n\n'They'll just stick it back in. He's actually smiling about it. We're not going to show you it because it can put you off your tea.'\n\nForest's fans were impressed by their skipper's determination, with one writing on X: 'Ryan Yates is rock 'ard isn't he?'\n\n'Hard as nails. Proper footballer. My captain,' another said.\n\n'I would have had a week off work,' one quipped.\n\nIt wasn't even the worst viewing for Forest fans on the night.\n\nThe East Midlands club thrashed Fenerbahce 3-0 in the away leg last week in Vitor Pereira's first game in charge.\n\nBut the Turkish club came to England with a vengeance, taking a 1-0 lead after 22 minutes thanks to Kerem Akturkoglu.\n\nAnd Akturkoglu doubled Fenerbahce's lead from the penalty spot early in the second half after Jair Cunha's foul, which many felt had been cheaply given.\n\nBut Callum Hudson-Odoi halved the deficit and gave Forest breathing room in the tie after 68 minutes with a superb bottom-corner finish.\n\n\n\nFrom there, Pereira's side hung on to win the tie 4-2 on aggregate, despite being spooked and losing 2-1 on the night."

            "content": "When Cristiano Ronaldo was asked about his future in football in 2023, as a 38-year-old having not long started his venture at Al Nassr, he revealed his plan to one day become the owner of a football club.\n\n'I don't rule out becoming a club owner,' Ronaldo said. 'It's something I thought about a few years back. I probably would like to own a [football] club. I'm at the end of my career, two to three years maximum.'\n\nIt's now been three years.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Ronaldo's roadmap to retirement has become clearer, and he has done exactly what he said he would do.\n\nRonaldo's ownership dream has come to fruition: he has purchased a 25 per cent stake in Spanish second-division side UD Almeria through his CR7 Sports Investments company.\n\nThe purchase figure hasn't been disclosed, but it marks Ronaldo's return to Spanish football after nine trophy-laden seasons at Real Madrid before he left for Juventus in the summer of 2018.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has taken a step toward retirement after a staggering 24-year-long career\n\nRonaldo, 41, has acquired a 25 per cent stake in Spanish side UD Almeria\n\n'It has been a longtime ambition of mine to contribute to football, beyond the pitch,' the Al-Nassr and Portugal captain said in a statement.\n\n'UD Almeria is a Spanish club with strong foundations and clear potential for growth. I look forward to working alongside the leadership team to support the club's next phase of growth.'\n\nIt is the latest hint that Ronaldo's historic playing career could soon be at an end, with this a clear indication of him setting up a life for when he eventually decides to hang up his boots.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d'Or winner has already stated that the World Cup this summer will 'definitely' be his last, and while he is still 'enjoying the moment' when it comes to playing football, he believes he only has a further year or two left in the legs.\n\nThey are the same legs that he joked he could play 10 further years in just last year, but even the most in-shape 41-year-old you will ever see in football knows that he can't play on forever.\n\nRonaldo has made it clear as day for years now that he has wanted to move into ownership, and the legwork for his new venture arguably began back in 2022 after his acrimonious exit from Manchester United.\n\nReports suggest that Mohamed Al Khereiji, a Saudi businessman, played a role in finalising Ronaldo's big-money move to Al Nassr, and the pair have remained close ever since.\n\nAl Khereiji leads the Saudi investment group, SMC, which last year acquired Almeria from Turki Al-Sheikh, who is a Saudi government official and now plays an influential role in setting up boxing's biggest fights.\n\n'We are very pleased that Cristiano has chosen our club to invest in,' said Al Khereiji. 'He is regarded as the greatest to ever play the game, he knows the Spanish leagues very well and he understands the potential of what we are building here both in terms of the team and the academy.'\n\nFollowing retirement, coaching and punditry are normally the two viable career options for players. It is very rare for ex-players to venture into ownership.\n\nHowever, much like David Beckham, who owns MLS side Inter Miami, and Real Madrid star Kylian Mbappe, who has a majority stake in SM Caen, Ronaldo has both the personal brand and financial power to assume an ownership position.\n\nRonaldo's lucrative career had led him to a stratosphere of his own financially. He is the best-paid player in the sport's history, being paid an annual salary of £177million.\n\nIt is said that he is worth £1.04bn after finance experts Bloomberg took a deep dive into his career earnings, investments and endorsement deals and they were all adjusted for prevailing tax rates and market performance.\n\nThey have previously reported that Ronaldo's astronomical money in Saudi Arabia has 'catapulted him to the top of the rankings for highest-earning sportspeople'.\n\nHe is the first footballer in their new Bloomberg Billionaires Index and they note that his wealth now significantly eclipses long-time rival Lionel Messi after the Argentine opted to move to the US with Inter Miami.\n\nRonaldo's links to Saudi Arabia spanning back to 2022 may have helped him secure his dream of becoming a club owner\n\nRonaldo has a lifetime deal with Nike, reported to be worth £745m in total - by far his biggest agreement with any company. There are partnerships with Tag Heuer, Armani, PokerStars, Samsung, Unilever, Louis Vuitton and many, many more.\n\nHe is also currently building an extraordinary, sprawling complex back home costing £28m, of which the lavish renderings have been shared and is often seen draped in the world's most expensive jewellery and watches, including a Franck Muller Invisible Baguette Diamonds Imperial Tourbillon - worth £1.13m.\n\nRonaldo's longevity, of course, has only helped him add to his fortune, but he's more than happy to splash the cash he's rolling in. While it is yet to be known how much he is investing in Almeria, it's likely to be just pocket money for one of the sport's best-ever players.\n\nHe has also invested in a property on the Portuguese Riviera with the dream of building a 'hospital-sized' mansion in Quinta da Marinha - but the project is over two years behind schedule.\n\nA number of CGI images of what the property might look like when completed have been shared by Ronaldo's supporters, eager for a glimpse of the future, but for now, the project remains a building site, as well as a nuisance to his neighbours.\n\nRonaldo's mansion is set to include a giant glass swimming pool with an underwater walkway, and a master bedroom measuring 1,000 square feet as part of what is believed to be Portugal's most expensive property development.\n\nThe comfortable life of luxury off the pitch shows no sign of slowing down, while he continually builds his portfolio off it.\n\nRonaldo's step into club ownership comes 14 months after he hinted at one day delving into that role at Manchester United.\n\nSpeaking at the Dubai Globe Soccer Awards in December 2024, he said the club's struggles weren't just down to on-pitch issues - with the problems far greater than that.\n\n'[The] Premier League it's the most difficult league in the world,' he said. 'All the teams are good, all the teams fight, all the teams run, all the teams are strong. Football is different right now. There's no easy games any more.\n\n'They need, I said this one year and a half ago, and I will continue to say it: The problem is not the coaches, it's like... I always give this example... it's like an aquarium.\n\n'If you have the fish inside and he's sick and you take him out and you fix the problem and you put him again in an aquarium, you will be sick again. The problem of Manchester United is the same. The problem is not always the coach. It's much more than that.\n\nRonaldo (pictured with fiancee Georgina Rodríguez) has built a life of luxury outside of football due to his fortune\n\nRonaldo is believed to worth £1.04bn which means a small stake in Almeria will likely cost him just pocket change\n\n'If I will be the owner of the club, I will make things clear and adjust things that are bad there.'\n\nThose words followed his TalkTV interview with Piers Morgan in 2021 that served as the final nail in the coffin for his second spell at United, where Ronaldo alleged co-owners Joel and Avram Glazer 'don't care' about the club.\n\n'The owners of the club, the Glazers, they don't care about the club,' he said. 'I mean, professional sport, as you know this, Manchester (United) is a marketing club.\n\n'They will get its money from the marketing - the sport, they don't really care, in my opinion.'\n\n'You have some things inside the club which don't help Manchester (United) reach the top level as City, Liverpool and even now Arsenal, for example... which is complicated, it's difficult.'"

            "content": "Chelsea suffer largest ever pre-tax loss of £350MILLION in 2025 - the biggest in English football history - but here's why the Blues are adamant it is not bad news\n\nChelsea recorded the highest pretax losses in English football history in the 2024-25 season — but club sources insist it will not force them into selling their biggest stars.\n\nThe European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report listed the 10 largest losses for 2025 and revealed how the Blues, who are owned by Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly, booked a €407million deficit. That has only ever been beaten by Barcelona, who fell into a €555m hole from the 2020-21 campaign.\n\nHowever, Chelsea insiders speaking anonymously insisted to Daily Mail Sport that the reported loss does not reflect their true health, saying it is the result of non-cash accounting adjustments as required by UEFA regulations and tied to the acquisition of the Blues. That includes asset impairments, settlements related to historical matters under the previous ownership, and the resolution of legacy contracts.\n\nThose same sources say, after an internal reset, the club is now profitable on an operating basis and aligned with UEFA as they expect to meet all the obligations under their existing settlement agreement with European football’s governing body. They entered into that agreement after previous financial breaches.\n\nCrucially for supporters, Daily Mail Sport has been told there is no requirement for Chelsea to start selling key players such as Cole Palmer or Moises Caicedo in order to meet regulatory thresholds.\n\nWe are assured there is no financial pressure on them to offload any key members of the squad they do not wish to lose this summer, and that their approach to player trading will be strategic rather than reactive.\n\nDespite winning two trophies - including the Club World Cup - last season, Chelsea are thought to have recorded a staggering record pre-tax loss\n\nChelsea have taken to structuring player contracts with performance incentives tied to Champions League participation, which would help cover the cost of missing out on Europe’s elite competition.\n\nNaturally, they do not hope that scenario occurs at the end of this season, with the Blues still in contention for a top-five finish in the Premier League as they travel to face Arsenal this Sunday.\n\nUEFA’s figures covered the 2024-25 season when Chelsea were competing in the Conference League, which they won. They also finished fourth in the Premier League to return to the Champions League before going on to win the Club World Cup in the summer.\n\n\n\nChelsea’s creative financing has helped their financial position in the Premier League, such as the infamous internal selling of their women’s team to the club’s parent company. UEFA’s rules are more stringent as they do not take income into account."

            "content": "Ian Wright claims Tottenham stars have already 'CHECKED OUT' on new boss Igor Tudor despite club fearing tumultuous relegation battle\n\nIan Wright suggested that some of Tottenham's biggest stars are unwilling to give new interim manager Igor Tudor a chance, after Micky Van de Ven appeared to blank him during the north London derby.\n\nAppointed following the overdue sacking of Thomas Frank earlier this month, Tudor arrived with the challenging brief of ensuring that Spurs avoid relegation.\n\nThe Europa League champions currently sit 16th and only four points away from 18th-placed West Ham - and Tudor's arrival in the capital was made no easier by his first match in charge being the north London derby.\n\nAs Spurs fell 4-1 to Arsenal at home, Tudor was spotted apparently giving vocal instructions to Van de Ven from the sidelines, only for the defender to fail to acknowledge him.\n\nFor Wright, the fact that the players were not eager to engage with their new head coach was a troubling sign.\n\n'Against Arsenal I saw Igor Tudor try to speak to Van de Ven, he blanked him, totally blanked him,' Wright said to his co-hosts on The Overlap's Stick To Football podcast.\n\nIgor Tudor appeared to be ignored by Micky Van de Ven just days into his tenure as Tottenham interim head coach\n\n'That says to me they have checked out already.'\n\nGary Neville thought that Wright's verdict was a 'harsh' one, while Roy Keane argued that the players 'did that with' Frank, but the Arsenal legend was in no mood to back down.\n\n'This guy is new, he wants him to come up and Van de Ven just looks at him and stays there,' Wright continued. 'You think to yourself, that doesn't look good. That does not look good.'\n\nFor his part, Tudor denied conflict between himself and Van de Ven on Thursday afternoon, sharing that he had been addressing the whole team.\n\n'If you watch carefully, I don't speak to him (in that moment),' Tudor said in his pre-Premier League weekend press conference. 'Afterwards, I said to him to come closer, and he comes closer.\n\n'We didn't talk about it because nothing happened. He's a fantastic professional and a fantastic guy, he would not do something like (ignoring me).'\n\nBelgium head coach Roberto Martinez stressed that whatever Tudor can do to ensure Spurs do not spend next season in the Championship, his first order of business should be 'accepting where they are' at this stage in the campaign.\n\n'When I was at Wigan you almost prepared for that last third of the season because that is your opportunity,' Martinez said. 'The last third for us was that we are going to get out of trouble.\n\n'The problem is when you are going into the last third hoping you are not going to get dragged down into a relegation battle because your club wasn't ready for that. This is where it becomes very, very dangerous.\n\nThe stop-gap manager has a challenging task attempting to keep Spurs from the drop - and began his reign with a dismal north London derby\n\n'What happens now is that you should forget about these general terms that \"we shouldn't get dragged down\", what does this mean to a player (looking to hear) \"do I need to run more, less\".\n\n'It is basic language (you use to a player) about everything you can control, \"you have to do 12km, six sprints into the box and run to the near post\". Everything has to be so measurable. It is about winning the next game.'\n\nSpurs' torrid winter has been only exacerbated by a number of injuries to key players leaving their squad painfully short.\n\nBut Martinez was keen to warn that Spurs cannot wait for stars to return and simply expect fortunes to change.\n\n'I think Spurs will get one or two players back from injury, you win a game and then you have got too much (of a gap),' he added.\n\n'The problem is there are no easy games in the Premier League. As a player at Spurs you might think there are easy games we can win, no - there are no easy games. It is about reducing that to, it is the next game and you have an opportunity to get points rather than if you don't win and you are out.\n\n'The moment that the club see it as \"wow, if we don't win...\" - the mindset is so negative and it drags you down. We have seen teams that are \"too good to go down\" go down because they weren't prepared for that final third of the season.'\n\n\n\nSpurs will stay in London for their next Premier League test, travelling to Craven Cottage to play Fulham on Sunday."

            "content": "Team USA hockey star Brady Tkachuk has fumed over an AI-doctored video released by the White House that suggests he made a vile comment about Canadians.\n\nTkachuk helped America claim a gold medal at the Winter Olympics in Italy, with a dramatic overtime victory over rivals Canada getting them over the line on Sunday.\n\nAfter becoming Olympic champions, the Ottawa Senators captain joined his national teammates at Donald Trump's State of the Union speech and the White House this week to celebrate their achievement.\n\nYet before he made the trip to Washington, Tkachuk was the subject of a TikTok video shared by the White House that had been altered by AI.\n\nThe clip, which has more than 11 million views on TikTok, was doctored to make it seem like he said about Canadians after Sunday's win: 'They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple-syrup-eating f***s a lesson.'\n\n'Well, it's clearly fake, because it's not my voice, not my lips moving,' Tkachuk said Thursday. 'I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. So, I can't do anything about it.'\n\nUSA hockey star Brady Tkachuk has fumed over an AI-edited video posted by the White House\n\nWarning - strong language below\n\nWhen asked if he enjoyed the video, he added: 'It's not my voice. It's not what I was saying.\n\n'I would never say that. That's not who I am, so I guess I don't like that video because that would never come out of my mouth and never had that thought.'\n\nTrump also sparked controversy after footage of his phone call with the victorious men's team surfaced on social media.\n\nWhile congratulating them on winning gold, the President joked that he was also 'going to have to bring the women's team' to Washington after they too got past Canada in the final.\n\nHe then added that he 'probably would be impeached' if he didn't extend the invitation to America's female hockey champions.\n\nThe women's team subsequently turned down Trump's invitation due to 'scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games.'\n\nAnd Tkachuk said he understood why they could have felt insulted by his locker-room joke, which some have labeled misogynistic.\n\nDonald Trump has sparked outrage in the wake of both the men's and women's team's wins\n\nMembers of the men's Olympic hockey team still attended his address to Congress on Tuesday\n\n'I mean, I get it,' he said before detailing the positive relationship between the men's and women's teams. 'We support them, they support us. You can't control what other people say. It was fun being around them, seeing how they play and the excellence around them.\n\n'If I see one of them, we'll talk about the excitement of what we can control, which is to be gold medalists.'\n\nTkachuk was also accused by some of shouting 'Close the northern border!' during the congratulatory call with Trump, but he stressed: 'It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.'\n\nDuring his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Trump announced that the USA women's team will still be visiting the White House at a later date despite rejecting his first invitation.\n\n\n\n'They beat a fantastic Canadian team in overtime, as everybody saw. As did the American women who will soon be coming to the White House,' he told a filled chamber of Congress."

            "content": "VfB Stuttgart 0 Celtic 1: Martin O'Neill's side exit Europe with their heads held high after first win on German soil\n\nThey did not go gentle into the night. As expected, Celtic’s interest in the Europa League came to an end. The manner in which the curtain came down on Martin O’Neill and his players for another year proved to be a pleasant surprise for all who witnessed it.\n\nHaving watched their side being torn asunder 4-1 in the first leg in Glasgow last week, many visiting supporters might have questioned the wisdom in leaving the bars in Stuttgart in the afternoon for a vantage point in the MHP Arena.\n\nBluntly, seeing Celtic fall to a worse aggregate defeat than the 5-0 hammering by Juventus 16 years ago seemed eminently possible.\n\nBy the end of the evening, though, those fears were wholly misplaced. A much-changed side showed character in abundance and left the stage with their heads held high.\n\nThey ran their hearts out and restored a degree of pride by showing the kind of spirit which has been conspicuous by its absence far too often this season.\n\nWhile there was to be no miraculous turnaround, a little bit of history was created nonetheless; For the first time since they first participated in Europe, Celtic won on German soil.\n\nIf there is such a thing as a good way to exit a tournament then this was certainly it.\n\nMartin O'Neill salutes the away fans after his Celtic side won 1-0 away to Stuttgart\n\nO’Neill’s men struck early through Luke McCowan and didn’t roll over when Stuttgart eventually came at them.\n\nTo register a clean sheet in such circumstances against a team presently sitting fourth in the Bundesliga was a highly commendable achievement.\n\nIt should do wonders for the confidence of all concerned. The outcome might just be the turning point in what’s been an extremely challenging season.\n\nAhead of the trip to Ibrox on Sunday, the veteran manager now has some selection headaches of the right kind.\n\nThis display was simply night and day from the dismal show O’Neill’s players produced as they capitulated seven days previously.\n\nPlaying with a freedom, their possession was connected and purposeful. They offered a threat whenever they advanced over the halfway line and gave little up cheaply at the back.\n\nAfter making eight changes, O’Neill didn’t have a failure on the night.\n\nViljami Sinisalo was assured in goal and made a compelling case to retain his spot.\n\nDane Murray kept things simple, Marcelo Saracchi dug deep and Junior Adamu used his physicality to occupy the Stuttgart central defenders.\n\nOff the boil lately, both Reo Hatate and Daizen Maeda issued reminders of their qualities while Hyun-jun Yang was sharp and threatening throughout.\n\nOn a night when many positives abounded, though, the performance of Luke McCowan was the standout.\n\nThe midfielder seemed to be everywhere until his legs could give no more - making blocks and supporting runs, carrying the ball, recycling it.\n\nClaimed in the opening minute, a first European goal will be a considerable consolation. It gave Celtic something to hang onto.\n\nTo stand any chance of pulling off a miracle, it was imperative that the visitors struck first.\n\nTo do so inside 30 seconds was beyond the wildest dreams of those who’d travelled across from Scotland.\n\nWith the Germans sloppy from kick-off, Callum McGregor stepped in and fed Yang. The winger in turn picked out Adamu who played in McCowan.\n\nExhibiting ice-cool composure, the midfielder rolled the ball away from Alexander Nubel and into the far corner. What an astonishing start.\n\nIt might soon have got even better. Adamu twisted his hips and delivered a dangerous low cross from the right. Maeda just couldn’t sort his feet out. The Germans briefly looked rattled.\n\nSebastian Hoeness’s men finally put a foot on the ball. Jamie Leweling smashed one on target. Sinisalo watched it all the way.\n\nBadredine Bouanani then unleashed a fierce left-footer which the Finn did exceptionally well to field.\n\nCeltic’s diligence on the back foot was exemplified by Yang racing back 30 yards to prevent Leweling letting fly after an intelligent link-up by Deniz Undav.\n\nWhile Bouanani’s attempt at converting Leweling’s deep cross was woeful, the pressure was mounting.\n\nColby Donovan had the toughest task of anyone on the pitch by trying to shackle Leweling. Turned inside out, he picked up the game’s first booking.\n\nCeltic still had their moments, notably from a string of corners. Nubel was fortunate that the referee adjudged Adamu to have impeded him as they contested one just before the break. Maeda should still have hit the target.\n\nTo Donovan’s relief, Leweling was surprisingly replaced at the break by Chris Fuhrich. The logic behind Hoeness’ thinking was soon made clear.\n\nShowing Donovan a clean pair of heels, the substitute crossed for Bouanani. Saracchi was in the right place at the right time to block.\n\nLuke McCowan scored the only goal of the game in the first minute of the match\n\nO’Neill replaced his young full-back with Tony Ralston with Adamu also making way for Tomas Cvancara.\n\nMaeda ought to have done better than fire straight into Nubel’s arms although the use of his hand would have ruled a goal out in any event.\n\nO’Neill was fizzing when the referee allowed play to go on when Tiago Tomas flattened McGregor. The energy Stuttgart were now showing was just as concerning.\n\nStepping onto his left foot, Bouanani’s strike from the edge of the box looked in all the way. An excellent stop by Sinisalo ensured the visitors kept breathing.\n\nFuhrich did beat the Celtic keeper with a stinging strike, but not the offside flag.\n\nO’Neill hit the gamble button with introductions of Seb Tounekti, Benjamin Nygren and Kelechi Iheanacho.\n\nCeltic were rightly angered when Stuttgart thought they’d levelled through Undav. Off the park for treatment, Ermedin Demirovic should never have been allowed to join in with an attack by the fourth official. Mercifully for the official, an offside flag came to his rescue.\n\nMurray’s outstanding block minutes later ensured Undav was again denied his moment. With the clock running down, Sinisalo again kept Fuhrich at bay by springing to his left.\n\nPlayed in by Iheanacho in the final minute, Tounekti worked the keeper but just not enough to set up a grandstand finish.\n\nCeltic were out. Just not in the manner that most expected.\n\nAnd so, 190 days after a goalless draw at home to Kairat Almaty, it ends.\n\nA rollercoaster of a run witnessed some crushing lows and some notable highs.\n\n\n\nO’Neill will be thankful that what’s likely to be his last European charge at least ended in the latter."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe NHL needs two things for an entertaining trade deadline: demanding contenders who have delusions of Stanley Cup grandeur, and enough teams willing to part with their current players to provide supply.\n\nThere are roughly eight teams that are probably out of the playoff hunt as the March 6 trade deadline approaches.\n\nThe New York Rangers already sent their letter to fans signaling a \"retool\" and traded Artemi Panarin to the Los Angeles Kings. Teams around the league are waiting to see how dramatically the Calgary Flames, St. Louis Blues and Vancouver Canucks compensate for disappointing seasons.\n\nMeanwhile, a change in recent fortunes for some teams might change their thinking. Take the Columbus Blue Jackets, who have surged up the standings under new coach Rick Bowness. A month ago, players like Boone Jenner and Charlie Coyle would have been found in the trade tiers below. Now, it sounds like there's a better chance they could be extended than moved -- or at least kept around for a playoff push.\n\nThis list was compiled through conversations with league executives and other sources, as well as media reports. ESPN insiders, including Emily Kaplan, added their input as well. Salary figures are from PuckPedia.\n\nWith huge names such as Quinn Hughes and Panarin already off the board, let's start with some other shocking possibilities before diving into pending free agents, players with term left on their deals and some glue guys.\n\nJump ahead: Shockers\n\nElite pending free agents\n\nElite forwards with term\n\nElite D-men with term\n\n25-and-under tier\n\nGoalies | Glue guys\n\nShocking possibilities tier\n\nSergei Bobrovsky, G, Florida Panthers\n\nJordan Kyrou, RW, St. Louis Blues\n\nElias Pettersson, C, Vancouver Canucks\n\nMorgan Rielly, D, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nRobert Thomas, C, St. Louis Blues\n\nAlex Tuch, RW, Buffalo Sabres\n\nThe Panthers had an 18% chance of making the playoffs coming out of the break, according to our latest NHL Bubble Watch. Much of that depends on if and when star center Aleksander Barkov returns, and the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions can put together a run to make the postseason, where they'll remain inherently dangerous thanks to a deep roster and, of course, \"Playoff Bob\" Bobrovsky.\n\nBut what if, by the deadline, they decide the math isn't \"mathing\"? Is it possible Bobrovsky becomes someone else's playoff hero? ESPN's Kevin Weekes said it's a situation worth watching, particularly because Bobrovsky is a pending unrestricted free agent who has yet to receive a contract extension. He has two Vezina Trophies and two Stanley Cup wins to his credit. He makes $10 million against the salary cap, but only $6 million actual dollars this season, with trade protection. He's also 37 years old.\n\nWhat do the Panthers want to do here? A short-term contract to backstop a veteran team that's back to full strength next season would seem like one avenue. But they do have 26-year-old Daniil Tarasov -- who, for what it's worth, has outplayed Bobrovsky this season. As Weekes said, this is something to watch.\n\nSergei Bobrovsky backstopped the Panthers to two straight Stanley Cups. Could he be traded? Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nIt's hard to gauge how deep Blues GM Doug Armstrong is willing to cut into his roster during a disastrous season. Is Thomas' name in circulation only because other teams hope that the 26-year-old No. 1 center might become available? Or would the Blues offer up Thomas, provided he waives his trade protection, for the kind of package that could launch a retool? Thomas' contract has an $8.125 million average annual value, but his annual salary declines or plateaus every season after this one.\n\nKyrou would only be shocking because the window seems closed on when the Blues could deal the 27-year-old winger. His no-trade clause started this season, and he remains in St. Louis despite some reports about his availability heading into last season's draft. Kyrou is signed at $8.125 million annually through 2030-31.\n\nAll of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now\n\nIt would be shocking if the Canucks finally did trade Pettersson considering his contract AAV ($11.6 million through 2031-32) and protection (full no-move), as well as the fact that he may no longer be considered an offensive star in the NHL. Even after Vancouver removed the friction of the J.T. Miller situation, Pettersson still hasn't hit his marks: His past two seasons were his lowest in points per game for his career.\n\nRielly is one of several Maple Leafs with trade protection, in his case a full no-movement clause. He's signed through 2029-30 at a $7.5 million AAV. He has 31 points in 54 games, skating 21:34 of ice time per game. Could the Leafs decide to reshape their blue line by convincing the 13-year veteran it's time to move on, as another member of the \"Core Four\" leaves Toronto? As Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment president and CEO Keith Pelley told season-ticket holders on Wednesday in a letter: \"We will do whatever is needed for this team to make the next step.\"\n\nThen there's Tuch. The Sabres are in a playoff seed after 57 games. Tuch has 22 goals and 26 assists in 56 games, playing in every situation and is an absolute catalyst for the team. He's saying things like, \"We're not just going to go for the playoffs, we're going to go for the Cup.\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine Buffalo trading that kind of player while seeking their first postseason berth since 2011, but Tuch and the Sabres have been talking contract for a long, long time with no long-term extension to show for it: first with former GM Kevyn Adams, now with Jarmo Kekalainen. Even without that extension, one assumes the Sabres would be comfortable keeping Tuch through the deadline with the playoffs in reach. But Kekalainen has always been a pragmatist.\n\nElite pending free agent tier\n\nJordan Eberle, RW, Seattle Kraken\n\nPatrik Laine, LW, Montreal Canadiens\n\nEvander Kane, LW, Vancouver Canucks\n\nNick Schmaltz, C, Utah Mammoth\n\nJaden Schwartz, F, Seattle Kraken\n\nKane is going to be traded, and the Canucks are going to gobble up a chunk of his $5.125 million AAV to make it happen. He has a 16-team no-trade list, but the only requirement for Kane to agree to a move to his sixth NHL franchise is that it's a playoff team. The Dallas Stars have been a frequently mentioned fit, but don't discount a move back East for Kane, either.\n\nThe Kraken's playoff bubble is starting to burst, with a 41.2% chance of making the cut in the latest Bubble Watch, buoyed by Money Puck's outlier of a 68.4% probability. So what then happens to their unrestricted free agents, as GM Jason Botterill attempts to put his stamp on the team? Eberle ($4.75 million AAV, no-trade clause) and Schwartz ($5.5 million AAV, limited no-trade clause) seem primed for a move to a contender seeking scoring help on the wing. Eberle is the team captain and leading scorer through 54 games, with 20 goals and 38 points.\n\nplay 0:18 Jordan Eberle tallies goal vs. Devils Jordan Eberle tallies goal vs. Devils\n\nSchmaltz is a funny one. He has clearly endeared himself to Mammoth fans and has played a huge role in their push for a playoff seed with 53 points in 57 games, centering star Clayton Keller. But the 30-year-old is in line for a significant raise from his $5.85 million AAV, and talks haven't exactly been sunshine and roses in the past. Dave Pagnotta of Daily Faceoff noted that last summer, Schmaltz and the Mammoth discussed possible trade destinations where he'd be willing to sign an extension. Given Utah's playoff potential, it likely only makes sense to deal Schmaltz in a \"hockey trade\" for a significant roster upgrade.\n\nWhat is Laine's value right now? He was limited to five games this season due to injury after a nice comeback season in 2024-25 with Montreal (20 goals in 52 games). The Canadiens would obviously have to pick up part of his $8.7 million AAV to facilitate a trade. Laine is nearing a return from the IR. Is there someone who believes in a potential return to form enough to overlook his inability to remain in the lineup?\n\nElite forwards with term tier\n\nBlake Coleman, C, Calgary Flames\n\nJake DeBrusk, LW, Vancouver Canucks\n\nConor Garland, RW, Vancouver Canucks\n\nNazem Kadri, C, Calgary Flames\n\nJonathan Marchessault, C, Nashville Predators\n\nRyan O'Reilly, C, Nashville Predators\n\nBrayden Schenn, C, St. Louis Blues\n\nSteven Stamkos, C, Nashville Predators\n\nRyan Strome, C, Anaheim Ducks\n\nOwen Tippett, RW, Philadelphia Flyers\n\nVincent Trocheck, C, New York Rangers\n\nYou could build two pretty good center groups with the players available in the middle at this deadline -- in theory, at least.\n\nTrocheck wasn't here in our last trade board because the Rangers were still feigning to be a contender at that point. Now that they're in the retool again, it's hard to imagine they won't move Trocheck for the benefit of both parties. He's as versatile a player as you'll find: someone who can average 0.76 points per game over the past two seasons, but also be a key defensive player, a role he served well in helping the United States win Olympic men's hockey gold.\n\nSpeaking of which: More than a few observers around the NHL believe Trocheck will end up with the Minnesota Wild, a team with a need in the middle and a general manager in Bill Guerin who built the aforementioned Team USA. Trocheck has a 12-team no-trade list.\n\nVincent Trocheck played a critical role in Team USA's gold medal run at the Olympics. Erick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n\nThe biggest name here is Stamkos, the 36-year-old star who started the season horrifically (one goal in 14 games) and then caught fire right as the Predators started moving up the standings. He had 16 points in 13 games leading up to the Olympic break and now has 28 goals on the season, proving his worth both to Nashville and the rest of the league. Complicating things is his contract: $8 million annually through 2027-28. \"I have a full-move clause, so I get to make a decision whenever it comes down to that. But I haven't had any conversations about that,\" he told The Athletic recently.\n\nBreaking News from Emily Kaplan Download the ESPN app and enable Emily Kaplan's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first.

Marchessault has a full no-movement clause and makes $5.5 million against the cap annually through 2028-29. He has 17 points in 38 games and has skated to a minus-18 in 38 games. His defensive game has deteriorated in Nashville, but the 2023 Conn Smythe winner can add some offensive pop to a contender.\n\nO'Reilly, Nashville's other Conn Smythe winner, has a friendly cap hit ($4.5 million AAV) on a contract with two years left on it. While the 2019 Cup winner doesn't have trade protection, GM Barry Trotz will work with O'Reilly on finding a preferred destination. O'Reilly has been awesome this season: 20 goals and 36 points in 57 games, winning 55.3% of his faceoffs, on par with his career mark. He's 35 years old but could be a \"final puzzle piece\" guy for the right contender.\n\nKadri is another \"last piece\" guy as a second-line two-way center with snarl, which is what he provided the Colorado Avalanche in winning the Stanley Cup in 2022. The 35-year-old makes $7 million against the cap annually through 2028-29. He has a 13-team no-trade list but didn't exactly shoot down reports that he would be open to working with the Flames to facilitate a swap. Calgary loves what Kadri brings to the team, but the time might have come to maximize his return.\n\nComplicating things: The Flames have only one slot to retain salary, after keeping a percentage in the Rasmus Andersson and Jacob Markstrom trades. If they use that for Kadri, they couldn't use it on Coleman. The 34-year-old forward has two years left at $4.9 million annually, and a 10-team no-trade clause. He has 13 goals in 44 games and can help kill penalties, having won two Stanley Cups with the Lightning.\n\nplay 0:48 Nazem Kadri tallies goal vs. Maple Leafs Nazem Kadri tallies goal vs. Maple Leafs\n\nSchenn has a 15-team no-trade clause, making $6.5 million against the cap annually through 2027-28. He has been in St. Louis for nine seasons and has 24 points in 57 games this season, skating to a ghastly minus-25. That said, the 34-year-old Stanley Cup winner is a coveted player around the league for his leadership, toughness and offensive upside. Assuming the Blues are in seller mode, he'll have plenty of attention and the Blues could get a hefty return for him.\n\nDepending on how deep the trading goes in Vancouver, Garland and DeBrusk could be part of it. Garland hasn't even started the six-year, $36 million deal he signed in July. He has 25 points in 46 games for Vancouver. DeBrusk, 29, has a full no-move clause and five more years on his contract at $5.5 million AAV. He's not having the offensive season he had in 2024-25 (28 goals), but he's a solid winger that can slide into a team's middle six.\n\nIs Tippett's name being out there just noise or something more palpable? His trade protection kicks in during the 2026-27 season. He makes $6.2 million against the cap annually through 2031-32. He has had three straight 20-plus-goal seasons and has 19 goals in 56 games this season. Everything we've heard is that the Flyers might move him in the right \"hockey trade\" to help the club.\n\nWhenever a veteran's ice time dramatically falls, one assumes a trade can't be too far off. Strome, the 32-year-old who has another year left at $5 million AAV, averaged 16:41 last season and is down to 12:05 this season, with eight points in 32 games.\n\nElite defensemen with term tier\n\nJustin Faulk, D, St. Louis Blues\n\nDougie Hamilton, D, New Jersey Devils\n\nRasmus Ristolainen, D, Philadelphia Flyers\n\nMacKenzie Weegar, D, Calgary Flames\n\nTyler Myers, D, Vancouver Canucks\n\nThe Devils were poised to trade Hamilton before Luke Hughes went down with an injury in late January -- please recall Hamilton being scratched in favor of defenseman Johnathan Kovacevic earlier in the month. With their season all but over and Hughes nearly back, one assumes Hamilton Watch begins again.\n\nHe has a 10-team trade list and a $9 million cap hit that the Devils probably have to keep a portion of to facilitate a deal. (Although he's only owed $13.65 million in real dollars over the last two years of his contract.) Hamilton isn't the offensive player that he once was, but he could easily fill someone's need for a veteran puck-moving defenseman on their second pairing. One intriguing possibility: a reunion with the Carolina Hurricanes, whom Hamilton left as a free agent in 2021.\n\nDougie Hamilton has history with the Hurricanes. Gregg Forwerck/NHLI via Getty Images\n\nSpeculation around Weegar has really heated up, as Calgary has reportedly fielded calls about the defenseman but has yet to approach him about a trade. The 32-year-old blueliner is signed through 2030-31 with a $6.25 million annual cap hit and he has a full no-trade clause. He has 20 points in 56 games this season, skating 23:10 per game on average. The Ottawa Senators were rumored to be in the market for Weegar, but he might want someone a bit closer to Cup contention in order to waive for them.\n\nRistolainen might be an alternative to Weegar. The 31-year-old right defenseman has no trade protection and two years left on his deal at $5.1 million AAV. Anthony Di Marco of Daily Faceoff reports an uptick in interest for the Flyers defenseman during the Olympic break, as he was doing his thing for Team Finland.\n\nFaulk has been in St. Louis for seven seasons. He has two years left at $6.5 million AAV (with some trade protection), but his front-loaded contract means he's making $4.5 million in actual dollars this season and next. He has 30 points in 57 games, skating 22:29 per game on average. Three teams to wonder about there: Boston, Detroit and Dallas.\n\nMyers is signed through next season with a minuscule $3 million annual cap hit, but has a no-movement clause that he's reportedly not keen on waiving. One wonders if that would include a potential trade to the Flyers and a reunion with former Canucks head coach Rick Tocchet.\n\nThe 25-and-under tier\n\nBrad Lambert, C, Winnipeg Jets\n\nAlexis Lafreniere, LW, New York Rangers\n\nMason Lohrei, D, Boston Bruins\n\nPavel Mintyukov, D, Anaheim Ducks\n\nBrennan Othmann, LW, New York Rangers\n\nNick Robertson, F, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nBraden Schneider, D, New York Rangers\n\nJesper Wallstedt, G, Minnesota Wild\n\nShane Wright, C, Seattle Kraken\n\nSome of these players aren't likely to move unless it's to bring something significant back to their teams. Players such as Lohrei, Wallstedt and Wright -- whose availability has been trumpeted by Nick Kypreos of Sportsnet -- fit that description.\n\nIt gets a little more complicated for Lafreniere and Schneider, who could end up being part of the solution for whatever the Rangers' retool produces. Schneider is a restricted free agent this summer -- please recall the team traded defenseman K'Andre Miller last summer before having to do the RFA dance with him. Lafreniere, the first overall pick in 2020 who has yet to find another level in his NHL career, is in the first year of a seven-year extension that carries a friendly cap hit ($7.45 million AAV) and an eight-team no-trade list. Othmann is also in this boat.\n\nLambert and Mintyukov have both expressed a desire for a change of scenery. Robertson's tenure has always been tenuous.\n\nThe goalie tier\n\nJordan Binnington, St. Louis Blues\n\nMichael DiPietro, Boston Bruins\n\nElvis Merzlikins, Columbus Blue Jackets\n\nSam Montembeault, Montreal Canadiens\n\nAlex Nedeljkovic, San Jose Sharks\n\nStuart Skinner, Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nThink about this: Canada lost in the gold medal game to the United States -- and no one was saying it was Jordan Binnington's fault? Not many would have predicted that, given all the hand-wringing over the Canadian goaltending depth and Binnington's putrid season in the NHL, where Money Puck had him at minus-24.9 goals saved above expected in 32 games.\n\nHe's a big-game goalie. The Blues won't be playing any of those this season. But teams like the Hurricanes, Oilers, Golden Knights, Canadiens and Ducks all might. Binnington has a 14-team no-trade list and a $6 million AAV. He has one more year on his deal after this one, with his salary dropping to just $4.5 million.\n\nBinnington won the Stanley Cup with St. Louis back in 2019, and has played well in big games for Canada. Brian Babineau/NHLI/Getty Images\n\nMontembeault could move in a trade and has one more year on his contract. Nedeljkovic is a pending UFA for the Sharks and makes $2.5 million.\n\nOne of the most interesting names here: Skinner, whom the Penguins acquired from the Oilers in the Tristan Jarry swap. Does Pittsburgh keep him around for their playoff push or do they trade the pending UFA, hoping that his extensive playoff experience outweighs other concerns for acquiring teams?\n\nHelp up front tier\n\nMichael Bunting, F, Nashville Predators\n\nPaul Cotter, F, New Jersey Devils\n\nJason Dickinson, C, Chicago Blackhawks\n\nWarren Foegele, F, Los Angeles Kings\n\nRyan Hartman, C, Minnesota Wild\n\nErik Haula, C, Nashville Predators\n\nCalle Jarnkrok, F, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nJesperi Kotkaniemi, C, Carolina Hurricanes\n\nAndrew Mangiapane, F, Edmonton Oilers\n\nMatias Maccelli, F, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nIlya Mikheyev, LW, Chicago Blackhawks\n\nGustav Nyquist, F, Winnipeg Jets\n\nEvan Rodrigues, C, Florida Panthers\n\nYegor Sharangovich, F, Calgary Flames\n\nEeli Tolvanen, F, Seattle Kraken\n\nThree players in particular getting buzz lately:\n\nHaula had an outstanding Olympic tournament for Finland, with three goals and three assists in six games, including a big one against Canada in the semifinal. The 34-year-old has a six-team no-trade list and can be a boon to someone's bottom-six forward group.\n\nKings GM Ken Holland basically said that he would \"work the phones\" for Foegele, a nine-year veteran whose been scratched this season a bunch. He had back-to-back 20-goal season prior to this one. He has a 10-team no-trade list and a $3.5 million AAV through next season.\n\nRodrigues was a solid player on the Panthers' back-to-back Stanley Cup winning teams. He has no-trade protection and a $3 million AAV through next season. Sportsnet speculated that the veteran forward could be moved so Florida can create cap space, should the Panthers believe they still have a shot at the playoffs this season.\n\nHelp on the blue line tier\n\nBrandon Carlo, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nIan Cole, Utah Mammoth\n\nMario Ferraro, San Jose Sharks\n\nJohn Klingberg, San Jose Sharkss\n\nTimothy Liljegren, San Jose Sharks\n\nConnor Murphy, Chicago Blackhawks\n\nJamie Oleksiak, Seattle Kraken\n\nLuke Schenn, Winnipeg Jets\n\nBrady Skjei, Nashville Predators\n\nZach Whitecloud, Calgary Flames\n\nIt wouldn't be a proper trade deadline if Schenn's name wasn't floated. The 18-year NHL veteran has played for nine teams in his career, including five since 2021, because he's a quintessential defensive defenseman with two Stanley Cup rings from the Lightning.\n\nThe enhanced ESPN App Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now\n\nAnother strong defensive defenseman is Carlo, whom the Maple Leafs acquired last trade deadline when ... well, when Toronto was in a different mode of contention. Carlo has an eight-team no-trade list with a $3.485 million AAV through next season. They've checked the market on him.\n\nFerraro used to be in our elite tier until enough people told us that was a misclassification. He's likely to remain in San Jose, but he's a pending free agent with a $3.25 million cap hit.\n\nOne more defenseman to watch: Whitecloud, whom Calgary acquired from Vegas in the Rasmus Andersson deal. There's probably a market for a 29-year-old right-shot defenseman with a Stanley Cup ring and a $2.75 million AAV through 2027-28 if the Flames want to explore it.\n\nBargain-beauty contracts tier\n\nSimon Benoit, D, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nTeddy Blueger, C, Vancouver Canucks\n\nErik Gustafsson, D, Detroit Red Wings\n\nDavid Kampf, C, Vancouver Canucks\n\nScott Laughton, C, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nRyan Lomberg, LW, Calgary Flames\n\nBobby McMann, F, Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nLukas Reichel, LW, Vancouver Canucks\n\nLogan Stanley, D, Winnipeg Jets\n\nKevin Stenlund, C, Utah Mammoth\n\nOskar Sundqvist, C, St. Louis Blues\n\nAll the players in this tier make $2 million against the cap or less. Their king, Kiefer Sherwood, was traded earlier this season by the Canucks. But Vancouver has three more low-AAV forwards to offer up at the deadline: Blueger ($1.8 million), Kampf ($1.1 million) and Reichel ($1.2 million), who is buried in the AHL but played well for Germany in the Olympics.\n\nThe Leafs have three interesting options, too. Laughton was sought after last trade deadline for having a low cap hit ($1.5 million) with term; now, he's got a low cap hit with an expiring contract. Benoit is a big, physical defenseman who is signed through next season at a $1.35 AAV. But it's McMann who has gotten the most attention. The late bloomer (age 29) is on the verge of a second straight 20-goal season. The versatile forward makes just $1.35 million on an expiring contract. That could help a contender.\n\nAnd there are so many contenders right now. But as the tiers above indicate, there is plenty of supply to meet their demand."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nTORONTO -- The post practice dressing room is a tableau of controlled chaos. Toronto Maple Leafs players skirt each other -- and the local media -- to shed equipment, sip smoothies, share a few laughs and try not to interfere with the staff wiping down skate blades and packing bags.\n\nThe surroundings grow quieter as players slip behind closed doors in search of a meal before heading home. Some linger in the locker room to meet with the media. Through it all, one stall remains empty.\n\nNo. 91, John Tavares, is still on the ice.\n\nIt's been 25 minutes since Leafs coach Craig Berube called it a day. To Tavares, that was merely the end of regulation.\n\n\"John does like to stay out there,\" came an almost apologetic observation from a PR staffer.\n\nFinally, he calls it quits. Those extra minutes on his own are among Tavares' sacred rituals, to stay on top of his physical and mental well-being. Even after 17 years in the NHL, there are skills to hone, shots to perfect, faceoff techniques to fine-tune or details to extract.\n\nThere's an inevitable finish line looming, and Tavares, 35, is determined to keep working hard until the end of his career.\n\n\"I know I've got a lot of good hockey left, but I know I'm not on the front nine,\" Tavares said. \"I think it's just like anything in life, when you mature and you experience things, you just appreciate things more and more. I just continue to love to play. I have that same feeling I did as a kid. The passion, not just for playing and competing, but how you feel once you step on the ice for a game. That's what pushes me forward.\"\n\nTavares has undergone a renaissance in his mid-30s, producing in recent years like he hadn't since arriving in Toronto ahead of a career-best 2018-19 season (47 goals and 88 points in 82 games).\n\nThat recent evolution for Tavares goes beyond what he does on the ice. Tavares is investing more of his time and resources in causes around the city that resonate with him -- such as mental health. For years, Tavares hoped to create a platform where he could leverage his name and status to bring awareness toward issues he believed were not getting enough attention. It took longer than he wanted but that platform would become the John Tavares Foundation, which was established in 2020.\n\nJohn Tavares has eclipsed 500 goals and 1,100 points in his NHL career. Terence Lewis/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nThe summer Tavares landed with the Leafs, he experienced a whirlwind of emotions. He was an unrestricted free agent for the first time and decided not to re-sign with the New York Islanders, who drafted him No. 1 in 2008 and for whom he had played his first nine years in the league. He was going home. To Toronto, where he would become the Leafs' captain one season later. Toronto also was where he could spend the remainder of his playing days chasing a Stanley Cup championship with his hometown team.\n\nIslanders' fans still boo Tavares to this day.\n\nTavares and the Leafs have experienced difficulties in their efforts to hoist that elusive Cup. As part of what was long dubbed the club's \"Core Four\" (with Auston Matthews, William Nylander and former teammate Mitch Marner), Toronto has been an excellent regular-season squad, with playoff appearances in each campaign that Tavares has been on board. But the Leafs have advanced only twice past the first round.\n\nLast season's stumble was especially painful, watching a 2-0 second-round series lead over Florida evaporate on the way to Toronto's elimination in seven games.\n\nThat didn't sit well with Tavares. Losing never does. Deciding the outcome of a game won't ever be solely in his control. But discipline? That's all him. It's why those idiosyncrasies are so important.\n\nBecause the results speak for themselves.\n\nSOME OF TAVARES' BEST WORK in Toronto has come after significant changes in Leafs Land. After Tavares shouldered the Leafs' captaincy for five seasons, GM Brad Treliving asked him to cede that role to Matthews in August 2024. It was an ending to allow for new beginnings.\n\nTavares handed the \"C\" off to Matthews and quietly got back to business. Tavares punched in 38 goals during the 2024-25 season, eclipsing the 30-goal mark for the third time in the past four seasons. He has been a point-per-game contributor in two of his past three campaigns. This season, he had 20 goals and 47 points in 57 games going into the league's Olympic break. And when Tavares scored his 500th career goal on Oct. 29, he became one of only 49 NHL players to hit that mark.\n\nAll of ESPN. All in one place.

When his contract was about to expire last summer, there were several suitors ready to offer him a more sizable deal. But they were in for a letdown. Tavares took a discount to remain in Toronto on a four-year, $17.52 million extension that will take him through the 2028-29 season.\n\nSimultaneously, the veteran also captured the attention of a wider hockey audience. Tavares made the list of 42 invitees to Team Canada's orientation camp last August, leading up to the winter roster reveal for the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. Tavares played for Canada at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, where he sustained a tournament-ending knee injury, but still earned a gold medal with his countrymen. He hoped for another chance to compete, but that those opportunities dwindled when the NHL denied its players an opportunity to participate in the Games in 2018 and 2022.\n\nTavares wasn't selected to the 25-man group for this year's Olympics. It was \"absolutely disappointing\" he wasn't chosen, but Tavares took the rejection with reflection.\n\n\"It was going to be a difficult team to make,\" he said. \"I felt like I was in the conversation. And I was really excited to be invited to the Olympic camp and be on the radar at this stage. It was unfortunate, and it was tough, but there's only so much you control, and so I always say I'm very fortunate that I got to win a gold medal at least once.\"\n\nplay 0:40 John Tavares scores career goal No. 500 John Tavares scores career goal No. 500\n\nIt's a testament to Tavares' preparation that he was considered for the roster. He is known for his multipronged routines that include stretching to light therapy to saunas. While almost every player has a regimen, the sheer volume of what Tavares attempts to keep his mind and body sharp has been a talking point among his peers.\n\n\"I'd heard about it in the past, that he was, like, such a pro with that stuff,\" said Nicolas Roy, who joined the Leafs from Vegas as part of their return trading Marner last June. \"Everything he does is crazy, but seeing it yourself, and actually being his teammate, you appreciate what he does away from [outside] eyes. He's taking care of his body, working out and stretching after practice. For doing everything he can around hockey, he's got to be No. 1 for guys that I've played with. He's the hardest working guy, taking care of all his details.\"\n\nBreaking News from Emily Kaplan Download the ESPN app and enable Emily Kaplan's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here.\n\nDoing so now requires more effort and flexibility for Tavares than in the past. He's a father to three with wife, Aryne, and being present for their family takes precedence over fitting every activity into his workout program. Instead, Tavares focuses on what elements pay the biggest dividends and tacks on any extras he can fit in.\n\nWhether at the office or at home, Tavares has learned to embrace the flow.\n\n\"I try to take a lot of pride in how I take care of myself,\" he said. \"But there's certainly some days with young kids where the randomness of it all just takes over and you have to manage things in a different way. [Sleep] is always priority No. 1 -- get to bed at a good time so you can get a good night's rest. That's your mental clarity and energy for recovery. After that, it's my hydration and my nutrition. If I can add anything to that, it's some of the body movement stuff to stay primed and ready for the gym or to get on the ice. That's really important to me, too.\"\n\nTavares has had an impressive scoring touch in recent seasons, perhaps due to his focus on taking care of himself mentally and physically. Alika Jenner/Getty Images\n\nTavares' obsession with longevity extends beyond what he does to be game-ready. For years before he landed in Toronto, there was the thought put into the totality of his legacy inside and outside the sport. What more could Tavares do with his name and platform that would keep him inspired and serve communities and causes that drew his attention?\n\nThe questions sparked a conversation between the Tavares and Aryne, back when he was still suiting up on Long Island and before the couple had children. The high school sweethearts had connected early over their shared love of children and the Special Olympics; giving back had been a tentpole of their relationship. They discussed how to create a charitable arm that could help represent some of the people and causes closest to their hearts. They drafted designs and logos for a still-hypothetical foundation. Their passion project was starting to take shape.\n\nTiming was an issue. Tavares was then a looming free agent. It didn't make sense to go through the process of building out their vision until Tavares signed his next deal and knew what laws of state or country they would reside. Once he and Ayrne were committed to Toronto in 2018 -- and officially to one another with a wedding that summer -- bringing the foundation to life was next on their list.\n\nAfter jumping through hoops necessitated by the Canadian Revenue Agency -- an operation that took more than a year to complete -- The John Tavares Foundation was set to make its debut.\n\nThe universe had other plans.\n\n\"We were all ready to launch, like 'OK, let's put this in motion,'\" Aryne recalled. \"And then we were held off again because suddenly everyone was asking, 'What is COVID?'\"\n\nARYNE'S FINGERPRINTS ARE all over the foundation. The former physiotherapist left her job after the birth of their second son to become the full-time, volunteer CEO of the Tavares' family foundation in 2020. She is their \"heartbeat,\" the one wearing multiple hats and making decisions while her husband is often away during hockey season.\n\nThe nature of her work is credit enough for Aryne -- even if it's rarely simple. That was evident from the get-go with the world shutting down right when their foundation was opening.\n\n\"All any of us could do was figure out, 'What is this pandemic? What does this mean?,'\" she said. \"In order to run a foundation, you have to bring in dollars. If you can't bring in dollars, you can't host events. And you use your time and your person ... John as a physical person ... to bring in money, to be able to support programs and other initiatives and all that. So that was a bit of an interesting time.\"\n\nAryne and her team of volunteers figured out how to press on, and she and Tavares continued to pursue partnerships that resonated with their values.\n\nMost recently, that was coming together with The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Canada's largest mental health teaching hospital and a leading research center. The Tavares' passion for aiding children, in particular, drew them to collaborate with CAMH in December, when the John Tavares Foundation donated to CAMH's work with youths.\n\nWhile visiting the center, there was one person capturing the Tavares' attention for how he and his family were navigating a difficult diagnosis with help from CAMH.\n\n\"We had a fellow named Alex who stood up with his mom and told us their story and their experience with CAMH,\" Aryne said. \"It was so touching. Alex had said he came to CAMH because he wasn't in control of his mind. And your mind is such a powerful tool. If you don't know how to use it properly, or it's not being used properly, you can't make that physical connection with the body. His mom said she was just struggling because she could see Alex [hurting]. And as a mom, you trust your intuition, your gut, and it was like, 'How do I fix this?' She didn't have the tools, but CAMH provided her with all those.\"\n\nAdded Tavares: \"It was just amazing to see someone who was going through some pretty significant mental health challenges being able to speak about his experience at CAMH and basically how in some ways it saved his life. Certainly, it changed his life, and how optimistic and positive he is now about how he is living day to day, how he manages some of the things that he had to deal with...you could see the joy they have now.\"\n\nTalking about feelings with their own children is an important pillar for the Tavares' family. In his own work life, Tavares acknowledges a shift too in being able to articulate problems less apparent than a broken arm or torn ACL.\n\n\"There's more recognition now,\" he said. \"We see the challenges anyone can face in daily life. We recognize certain signs now. It's continued to improve and get better.\"\n\nTHE FOCUS ON PLAYERS' mental health has been long overdue. The stigma surrounding mental health hasn't completely eviscerated, but it has lessened because players are stepping forward to discuss it. Carey Price entered the NHL/NHLPA's player assistance program in 2021 to address his mental health, and Samuel Girard did the same in 2023. Edmonton's Sam Poulin has been vocal about seeking help.\n\nIn December, Ottawa Senators' goaltender Linus Ullmark entered the player assistance program. In an interview with TSN's Claire Hanna in January, Ullmark said his mental health had been \"piling on\" until it ultimately \"overflowed\" after he was pulled from a game on Dec. 27 in Toronto.\n\n\"I was not myself,\" Ullmark told Hanna. \"As soon as that game was over, I called [player assistant program] Dr. [Joel] Gold and I said, 'Hey, I'm f---ed up. I need help.' And together with the program, together with the organization, we set up a plan and I went through the motions and I took the absence of leave.\"\n\nLinus Ullmark took a leave of absence from the Senators following a game on Dec. 29, returning to action on Jan. 31. Richard A. Whittaker/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nUllmark's departure prompted speculation online. Several rumors Ullmark heard involved attacks on his family. That reaction to him stepping away underscored for Ullmark why discussing mental health has been taboo in sports circles and why he felt compelled to speak out.\n\n\"People wonder why hockey players -- professional athletes -- are not talking,\" Ullmark told Hanna. \"Why we're not showing any sort of emotions? Why mental health in men and in women are a stigma? This is just the proof I have now that I understand why people are shutting themselves in and tend to do other things than to ask for help.\"\n\nThe enhanced ESPN App Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you.

Tavares can attest colloquially about a recent change when it comes to player empowerment to take care of their mental health as well as they do their bodies.\n\n\"There is much better awareness in knowing the importance of being able to ask for help, that it is OK,\" Tavares said. \"That doesn't mean it can't be a very difficult thing to do, especially as a professional athlete, when you're playing physically in a demanding sport and guys want to seem like they are pretty tough. Guys take a lot of pride in being able to play through injuries or manage the physical nature of the game, the bumps and bruises will come with that, but there's a lot of things that you deal with internally that can be challenging at times, and it's OK to recognize that, to ask for help and to seek out resources and things that can help support you.\"\n\nAryne has an outsider's perspective on the mental health narrative for athletes -- except when it comes to Tavares' self-help methods -- but it is apparent to her how this generation of players is more evolved in how they protect themselves and their teammates.\n\n\"Before, it was all 'push it aside, push through, bury it,' and that's just very unhealthy,\" she said. \"I just don't think [the topic] came up enough. I don't think players were just voluntarily saying, 'I need to take a mental break here,' or 'I need help.' It's very hard for anybody to be able to say that. And I think that's part of just breaking the stigma, and that's one of the biggest things that CAMH has tried to do. And then we're obviously helping to hopefully shed light on it and break that just as much as they are.\"\n\nBecoming a father was integral to how Tavares approaches his rough patches in a high-pressure career. As with most things, Tavares puts in the effort to keep himself balanced mentally.\n\n\"John controls his emotions very well,\" Aryne said. \"Over the years, he's matured and been able to see the game as it is. Coming home now with kids is even better for him because you can't just go over [a loss] in your head. The kids just bring a little bit of light and laughter and smiling and all these things that just help you heal, help you feel lighter. He does a great job at managing his mental load and mental performance, and when he does seem overwhelmed, he manages that in his own private ways, which are very good.\"\n\nTavares' family life has helped put his \"day job\" in perspective. Mark Blinch/NHLI via Getty Images\n\nThey've had to be particularly strong this season, given how the Leafs have floundered. Toronto entered the Olympic break seventh in the Atlantic Division and six points out of the Eastern Conference's second wild-card spot. There is a long road ahead for Tavares & Co. to find their way back into the playoff picture. Tavares is looking for an individual reset as well, having only two goals and four points in his past eight games.\n\nThe pause was an opportunity to reset physically and mentally. Tavares said he can see the bigger picture of it all more clearly now. Hockey is a part of life but not the root of his purpose. That's through introducing what he does to loved ones -- and investing in people and places that are helping reshape and redefine the world around them.\n\n\"It's been a real blessing to be where I'm at and have a young family and share the game with my kids,\" Tavares said. \"You're always trying to get a little better, stay sharp, so you can do it [for them] as long as you can. And you look at what we're doing [at the foundation], to help people find the tools and resources to maximize who they are and their potential and to have a life they feel that they can thrive in and become who they want to become. We're really proud to bring awareness to what [places like CAMH] do. It's our privilege.\""

            "content": "Stephen A. Smith says Steelers GM Omar Khan needs to find a quarterback rather than waiting on Aaron Rodgers. (2:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Miami Dolphins ranked first overall in the NFL Players Association annual report cards, according to survey results obtained by ESPN. The Minnesota Vikings finished second overall in 2026, followed by the Washington Commanders in third.\n\nRegarding the Dolphins, the NFLPA survey wrote: \"Players consistently describe the organization as 'the best in the NFL.'\"\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished in last place for the first time in the four-year history of the union's survey. Last year, the Steelers ranked 28th. The Arizona Cardinals finished 31st in the 2026 survey, after a last-place finish in 2025, and the Cleveland Browns finished in 30th, the same as in 2025.\n\nThe NFLPA is not making the report cards public this year following a grievance filed by the NFL, which claimed the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. Earlier this month, an arbitrator agreed with the league, saying the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses for report cards even if it can't publish them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment. An NFL spokesperson also declined to comment, saying that as in previous years, the league had no knowledge of the survey.\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A-plus to F-minus on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and it was conducted from Nov. 2 to Dec. 11.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" the survey said.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest-rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" the survey said. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers' locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers' training room lacks updated recovery technology and \"modalities.\" Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, though the training staff ranked first.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A-plus to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the survey. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nBrady Tkachuk, the Ottawa Senators captain and a Team USA gold medalist, said he didn't appreciate the AI-doctored video released by the White House that made it appear he was disparaging Canadians.\n\nThe video, published Sunday by the White House's official TikTok account, featured doctored footage from a Tkachuk brothers' news conference at the 4 Nations Face-Off last February. While \"Free Bird,\" the goal song for Team USA, played in the background of the video, Brady Tkachuk was made to say, \"They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple syrup eating f---s a lesson.\"\n\nThe clip, which discloses that it used AI-generated media, has 11.1 million views on TikTok and has been widely viewed on other social media platforms.\n\n\"Well, it's clearly fake, because it's not my voice, not my lips moving,\" Tkachuk said Thursday in his first media availability in Ottawa since the U.S. defeated Canada for the gold medal in men's Olympic ice hockey in Milan. \"I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. So, I can't do anything about it.\"\n\nTkachuk was asked if he enjoyed the video.\n\n\"It's not my voice. It's not what I was saying,\" he said. \"I would never say that. That's not who I am, so I guess I don't like that video because that would never come out of my mouth, and never had that thought.\"\n\nTkachuk also addressed what he didn't say during Team USA's locker room celebration. Some on social media accused Tkachuk of being the person who shouted, \"Close the northern border!\" during Team USA's congratulatory call with President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I've been seeing stuff that people think it's me. But if you watch the video, it's not my voice or something that I never say,\" Tkachuk said. \"I don't know how that took a storm on its own when I give everything I have here.\n\n\"It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.\"\n\nOn that call, Trump made a widely circulated comment about the U.S. women's hockey team, which also won Olympic gold.\n\nWhen Trump extended an invitation to the men's players to come to Washington for the State of the Union address, he said: \"I must tell you, we're going to have to bring the women's team, you do know that,\" adding with a laugh that if he didn't also invite the women's team, \"I do believe I probably would be impeached.\" Some players laughed along with the joke.\n\nTeam USA star Hilary Knight said Wednesday on \"SportsCenter\" that she thought it was a \"distasteful\" joke that \"unfortunately is overshadowing\" the success her team had in Milan. Boston Bruins goalie Jeremy Swayman, a member of Team USA, said Wednesday that \"we should've reacted differently.\"\n\nLike other American players, Tkachuk detailed a positive relationship between the men's and women's teams in the Olympics, from attending each other's games to hanging out at 3 a.m. in the Olympic Village café after the men returned as champions.\n\nTkachuk said he understood why women's players could feel insulted by that comment.\n\n\"I mean, I get it,\" he said. \"We support them, they support us. You can't control what other people say. It was fun being around them, seeing how they play and the excellence around them.\n\n\"If I see one of them, we'll talk about the excitement of what we can control, which is to be gold medalists.\"\n\nAs for why the men's team laughed at Trump's comment, Tkachuk said the players were \"caught off guard\" a little bit.\n\n\"I don't really have an answer. It's a whirlwind of a moment,\" he said. \"You can't control what somebody says. I guess got caught off guard a little bit. You're talking to the president 10 minutes after you achieve your dream.\"\n\nBrady Tkachuk is one of five Team USA players whose NHL clubs are based in Canada. He partied in Miami with his teammates and then attended the State of the Union Address in Washington before returning to Ottawa.\n\n\"It was special,\" he said. \"Being an American citizen, you never really think you're going to see the White House and be in the Oval Office.\"\n\nBut Tkachuk noted the awkwardness of helping the U.S. defeat Canada for the gold medal while being the captain for a team in Canada's capital, a position he has held the past five seasons in Ottawa.\n\n\"It's just such a passionate fan base,\" he said. \"I said this after 4 Nations: It's a unique feeling when every single day the support from this fan base and then for three weeks they're not cheering for you. It's a crazy feeling.\n\n\"I've given absolutely everything I have as an Ottawa Senator. When you represent the U.S., it's about being an American. It's an honor. There's only three teams that ever won the gold medal. I wanted to achieve my childhood dream and bring a gold medal back to the U.S.\""

            "content": "Chris Bosh said that he's \"lucky to be alive\" after a recent health scare that resulted in him waking up \"covered in my own blood.\"\n\nThe Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer shared details of the event in a social media video over two minutes long on Wednesday.\n\n\"It was crazy. It was fast. It was instant. There was no warning. I didn't have any time to prepare for it,\" he said. \"I was getting ready to go on a date with my wife and the next thing you know I was on the ground.\"\n\nBosh, who retired from the NBA in February 2019 because of blood clot issues, declined to go into specifics in the video and when reached by ESPN's Brian Windhorst. He said that he's still recovering and won't try to hide it, showing the lack of blood under his eyes.\n\nBosh explained that he has no recollection or memory of what happened and that \"it was just darkness.\" The scary moment led to him having a different outlook on life. Whether it's wanting to go on vacation or starting a business, he emphasized not waiting to take action before it's too late.\n\n\"No matter what it is, make sure you don't wait. That's the thing that I get from this. Don't wait to take action because it could come fast. It could come quick. And I'm lucky to be alive, and I feel great about that,\" he said. \"And now I'm thinking about how I live my day-to-day life. That's really it. But don't wait.\"\n\nThe former Miami Heat star first dealt with a blood clot in February 2015, when a clot formed in one of his legs and traveled to a lung, leading to a multiday hospitalization. He was released from the hospital and wound up playing 53 games in the 2015-16 season -- the final campaign of his 13-year NBA career.\n\nBosh was diagnosed with a second blood clot in his leg in February 2016 and missed the remainder of the season. He revealed in \"Rebuilt,\" his documentary released that September, that Heat doctors told him his basketball career was \"probably over\" after the second diagnosis.\n\nHe intended to play in the 2016-17 season, but the Heat, where Bosh played for six seasons, failed him for a physical ahead of training camp. Miami officially waived him July 4, 2017, then retired his No. 1 jersey March 26, 2019.\n\nBosh won two championships with the Heat and averaged 19.2 points and 8.5 rebounds across his NBA career. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2021 and reflected on his early retirement during his speech.\n\n\"After finally making it to the mountaintop with so much more to do, in my mind, so much more work to do, it all stopped,\" he said. \"I eventually came to realize that we all have it in our power to make the most out of every day despite what happens, to turn setbacks into strengths.\""

            "content": "Adam Schefter breaks down the Jets' decision to trade Jermaine Johnson to the Titans for T'Vondre Sweat. (1:03)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nThe Jets and Titans agreed to a rare player-for-player trade Thursday, with New York sending pass rusher Jermaine Johnson to Tennessee for defensive tackle T'Vondre Sweat, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nThe trade can't be processed until the start of the league year on March 11.\n\nThe deal marks the latest move in a protracted teardown of a once-formidable defense for the Jets, who also traded away defensive stars Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams -- both former first-round draft picks -- in November.\n\nEight of the Jets' 11 first-round picks from 2015 to 2022 have been traded.\n\nJohnson acknowledged the trade in a social media post later Thursday, saying New York \"will always hold a special place in my heart.\"\n\nNew York, thank you for everything truly. The love I've been shown here for the past 4-5 years has been nothing short of amazing, both on and off the field. Y'all will always hold a special place in my heart. Wish all of my former coaches and former teammates the best!! Thank all... — Jermaine Johnson II (@ii_jermaine) February 26, 2026\n\nJohnson will be reunited with Titans coach Robert Saleh, who coached the Jets when they selected Johnson with the 26th overall pick in the 2022 draft.\n\nJohnson also will once again play under new Titans defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton, who was his position coach with the Jets his first three seasons.\n\nJohnson, coming off a down year (three sacks), has only one year remaining on his contract and is due to make a guaranteed $13.4 million in 2026, the amount of his fifth-year option.\n\nJohnson generated interest last season before the trade deadline, but the Jets opted to keep him for the remainder of the season. His departure reinforces the belief that the Jets will take an edge player with the No. 2 pick in this year's draft, with Ohio State's Arvell Reese and Texas Tech's David Bailey as the leading candidates.\n\nIn Sweat, the Jets are getting a 6-foot-2, 366-pound interior presence on a team-friendly contract. A second-round pick in 2024, he is signed through 2027 and will count only $1.7 million on the Jets' salary cap.\n\nScheme factored into the trade for both teams. The Jets, who could be using more 3-4 fronts, wanted to add more size up front. The opposite is true for Tennessee, where Saleh's scheme puts a premium on smaller, faster linemen.\n\nSweat, drafted 38th overall in 2024, posted 85 tackles and three sacks in 29 games for the Titans. He suffered an ankle injury in Tennessee's season-opening loss to the Broncos and missed five games last season.\n\nThe Titans are counting on Johnson regaining his form from 2023, when he posted a career-high 7.5 sacks and was named to the Pro Bowl as an injury replacement. His 2024 season didn't last long. In Week 2, at Tennessee, he tore an Achilles tendon and missed the remainder of the season.\n\nJohnson rehabbed to make it back for the start of the 2025 season, but he didn't have the same burst as before the injury. In 14 games, he finished with only three sacks and six quarterback hits, later admitting his performance wasn't up to his standard. Both he and the team acknowledged that the Achilles injury probably affected his performance.\n\nIn four seasons -- 47 games -- with the Jets, Johnson has 13 sacks and 131 tackles.\n\nESPN's Turron Davenport contributed to this report."

The post said the event was being held to honor the women's hockey team and other female athletes, with details to follow. The message featured a picture of the U.S. women's hockey players celebrating in a circle.\n\nA publicist for Flavor Flav confirmed the event without providing further details.\n\nThe women's players worked on their own to accept the invitation, without input from USA Hockey, a person familiar with discussions told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private.\n\nThe person added that while the team is excited to attend, it's unclear if the entire 23-player roster will be on hand because of potential scheduling conflicts.\n\nThe team has yet to determine whether to visit the White House after USA Hockey cited logistics and travel issues in politely declining President Donald Trump's invitation to join the U.S. men's gold medal-winning team at his State of the Union speech on Tuesday.\n\nFlavor Flav is a longtime supporter of women's sports and attended various Olympic competitions this month. He posted his invitation on Monday, shortly after the women turned down the trip to Washington.\n\n\"If the USA Women's Hockey team wants a real celebration and invite ,,, I'll host them in Las Vegas. Do some nice dinners and shows and good times,\" he wrote. \"I'm sure I can get a hotel and airline to help me out here and celebrate these women for real for real.\"\n\nThe women's team was originally scheduled to fly commercially to New York on Monday, but was forced to reroute through Atlanta because of a snowstorm in the Northeast. The timing and storm made it difficult for the women to change plans as they returned to their Professional Women's Hockey League and college teams across the country.\n\nTeam USA won gold after beating Canada in the Women's Ice Hockey final. EPA/FAZRY ISMAIL\n\nThe PWHL schedule resumed Thursday with Montreal playing at New York following a monthlong Olympic break, while college players open their conference playoffs this weekend.\n\nIn his address, Trump said plans were in the works to have the women's team visit the White House, though it's unclear when that could happen, USA Hockey said. The earliest the team could travel to Washington would be in late spring after the conclusion of the PWHL season.\n\nThe president's invitation came late Sunday, when he called to congratulate the men for their 2-1 overtime win over Canada. The women's team was still in Milan, three days after also beating Canada 2-1 in overtime.\n\nIn speaking to the men's team following their win, Trump said: \"We're going to have to bring the women's team, you do know that.\" He later joked that if he didn't extend the invitation, he would probably be impeached.\n\nU.S. women's captain Hilary Knight on Wednesday referred to the comment as being \"distasteful and unfortunate.\"\n\n\"I think just the way women are represented, it's a great teaching point and really shines light on how women should be championed for their amazing feats,\" she said."

(1:00)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- The Colts have given quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr. permission to seek a trade, his agent told ESPN on Thursday, the latest twist in the young player's complicated career.\n\nRichardson lost a preseason position battle with veteran Daniel Jones before last season, relegating him to the No. 2 spot. Now, with the Colts committed to trying to re-sign Jones as their starter for the foreseeable future, Richardson faces an uncertain path forward in Indianapolis.\n\nAgent Deiric Jackson having the ability to explore a trade gives Richardson the potential of finding a new start after three tumultuous seasons in Indianapolis. The 2023 fourth overall draft pick has started 15 games for the Colts, throwing 11 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Injuries have stymied him throughout his career, with Richardson missing 13 games after shoulder surgery as a rookie in 2023 and four games to multiple injuries in 2024.\n\nLast season, Richardson sustained a fractured orbital bone in a freak pregame warmup incident. That injury left Richardson on injured reserve, where he finished the season.\n\nRichardson, who is still just 23, had his vision impacted by the injury. But recent consultations with doctors indicate his vision has been restored, Jackson said. One physician noted his vision in a recent test to be 20/20 when using both eyes.\n\nColts general manager Chris Ballard said Tuesday that the vision issues were \"trending in the right direction\" and that Richardson was \"cleared to play.\" But he did not indicate the issues were fully resolved.\n\nThe Colts are expected to move forward this year with Jones and 2025 draft pick Riley Leonard at 1 and 2, respectively, on their quarterback depth chart. Jones sustained a torn Achilles tendon in early December but is on schedule to return for the start of next season, Ballard said this week. Jones is a pending free agent, but Ballard said Tuesday that he remains hopeful the Colts can re-sign him to a new deal without having to use the franchise tag.\n\nBallard said \"I still believe in Anthony\" when asked about the player's future this week, but it has been clear for quite some time that Richardson did not have a clear role with the team in 2026. The Colts' decision to bench him temporarily in 2024 undermined their statements about their belief in him. And the decision to go out and sign Jones as a free agent last spring created additional doubt about Richardson's long-term viability with the franchise.\n\nThe decision to allow conversations with other teams was communicated during a meeting with Ballard and Richardson's camp on Thursday. In that meeting, Ballard expressed a willingness to work with Richardson to find a suitable landing spot. That's why the decision to allow Jackson to speak with other teams and find a match works in the player's favor.\n\nRichardson has one season remaining on his rookie contract unless his 2027 fifth-year option is exercised. He has a $1.145 million base salary, plus a $4.24 million roster bonus that is due in August. The Colts would save $5.385 million in salary cap space with $5.43 million in dead money if Richardson is traded before June 1."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

They found high repetition of the signs and predictability in the subsequent symbols that is \"comparable to much later proto-cuneiform,\" according to Bentz.\n\nThey found denser patterns on figurines than on tools.\n\nThe team say that it shows that communicating information was very important for Palaeolithic people.\n\n\"They were skilled craftspeople. You can tell they carried the objects with them. Many of them fit very well in the hand, just the right size to fit in the palm,\" says Dutkiewicz.\n\nThe research is published in the journal PNAS.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Nollywood actor Daniel Etim Effiong has shared a deeply personal and dramatic account of how being rusticated from the Federal University of Technology – Minna became the turning point that launched his acting career.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Flame TV, Effiong recounted the emotional turmoil he faced as an engineering student who felt called to the arts but had no clear path forward.\n\n“I was at the University of Technology in Minna, and I didn't know how I was going to move from this engineering major to the arts. I knew nothing but acting in church. One day I was praying about it in the field. We used to go to the field in FUT Minna to pray, and I heard the Lord say to me that you would make films,” he said.\n\nHe admitted he struggled to understand how that promise could materialise.\n\n“I was like, how would these things be? Immediately he gave me another word. He said the way the bones are formed in the womb of a mother, the way a baby is born in the womb of the mother – you do not know. So you do not know the way of God. You don't know how the spirit of God will bring these things to pass, but it will come to pass.”\n\nSoon after, events took an unexpected turn. Effiong revealed that during his first semester at the 300 level, the university published a list of 150 alleged cult members to be expelled, and his name appeared on it.\n\n“The school came up with a list of 150 cult members to be expelled from the university. My name miraculously found its way on the list. It was just me and God. My friends had exams to write, so everyone was like, 'Daniel, this is so terrible but I will be back with you; I have to go study for the exam,' he explained.\n\nHe described how his parents rushed to the school to seek clarification, only to be told he would face disciplinary hearings.\n\nWhile dealing with the uncertainty, Effiong came across an audition form for the second season of the reality show Amstel Malta Box Office, a Nigerian reality series that trains performers. He decided to apply.\n\n“While all of that was happening, I saw a reality TV show form, and I picked it up. I watched season one and thought maybe I should apply for season two. I just filled out the form,” he said. Immediately after I got expelled from school, I got invited for an audition. It was like a dream.”\n\nHe progressed through multiple stages of selection.\n\n“They shortlisted 20 of us from all across Nigeria. After that they shortlisted 10 people to go into the show, and I made the shortlist of 10 housemates,” he recalled. “On that show, we were trained in acting, dancing, performance and singing.”\n\nLooking back, Effiong, who made his directorial debut with Nigeria's best cinema movie of 2025, 'The Herd', believes the experience was the answer to the prayers he had made months earlier.\n\n“At the back of my head, I knew it was an answer to prayers. I knew it was God leading me, but everything was happening so fast. It was like a dream. It did not feel real at all. It was years later that it occurred to me that this is the way the spirit of the Lord was leading me to bring this thing to pass. But I could not see it at the time.”\n\nToday, Daniel Etim Effiong is regarded as one of Nollywood’s notable leading men, known for his performances across film and television. His story offers a glimpse into the uncertainty behind many creative journeys and how setbacks can unexpectedly open new doors.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo has become a co-owner of Spanish second-division side Almeria by acquiring a 25% stake in the club.\n\nThe 41-year-old Al-Nassr forward has bought his stake in Almeria, who are owned by a Saudi Arabian investment consortium led by Mohammed Al-Khereiji, through his recently formed CR7 Sports Investments company.\n\nWhile the financial details have not been disclosed, Ronaldo said in a statement he was looking forward to working with the leadership team \"to support the next phase of the club's growth\".\n\nThe Portugal international added: \"It has been a long-held ambition of mine to contribute to football, beyond the pitch.\n\n\"UD Almeria is a Spanish club with strong foundations and clear potential for growth.\"\n\nPresident Al-Khereiji said: \"[Ronaldo] is regarded as the greatest to ever play the game, he knows the Spanish leagues very well and he understands the potential of what we are building here both in terms of the team and the academy.\"\n\nLast year, Al-Khereiji's SMC Group acquired Almeria from Turki Al-Sheikh, who is chairman of the General Entertainment Authority (GEA), a Saudi government department.\n\nRonaldo spent nine successful years in Spain playing for Real Madrid, winning La Liga twice and lifting the Champions League four times before joining Italian side Juventus in 2018.\n\nHe has played for Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League since 2022 and is the best-paid player in football history with an annual salary of £177m.\n\nAlmeria, founded in 1989, are third in Segunda, two points off leaders Real Racing with 15 games to go.\n\n'The portfolio keeps expanding' - analysis\n\nBy Guillem Balague, BBC Sport Columnist\n\nA little over a decade ago, Cristiano Ronaldo did not want to contemplate life after football.\n\nThose close to him warned he was living on a treadmill, and that when he retired, he might collapse unless he had built something to sustain him. He listened, and business became a way to remain relevant while also giving his family, who had put their own ambitions on hold, projects aligned with their passions.\n\nThe first step was symbolic. In 2016, Ronaldo partnered with a hotel group to open a property in Madeira.\n\nGradually, he began not only investing his wages but enjoying the process, the meetings, the strategy.\n\nHe still harboured dreams of making a Hollywood film, but discovered a similar satisfaction in building companies - applying the same discipline he had devoted to his body.\n\nOn the pitch, that obsession turned him into the most prolific goalscorer in history after the age of 30. Off it, it was shaping a second career.\n\nAccording to the 2025 Forbes ranking, Ronaldo generated almost £210m on and off the field. Of that, just over £50m came from his non-football business interests - a very diverse portfolio.\n\nHe has increasingly channelled his activity through his investment and lifestyle companies, with holdings in a water brand, a healthy-living app and a recovery products company, as well as underwear, fragrances and footwear.\n\nAs well as ownership stakes, he has high-profile partnerships with leading brands, has opened gyms across Portugal and Spain, and launched a range of watches.\n\nAnd the portfolio keeps expanding.\n\nRonaldo co-founded a hair-transplant clinic group that now operates in Spain, Portugal, Oman, and Italy. One of its clients was his mother, Dolores Aveiro.\n\nWhat began with that first hotel in Funchal evolved into a joint venture launched in December 2015 and initially valued at more than £65m. There are now properties in Lisbon, Madrid, New York and Marrakech.\n\nIn December 2024, at the Dubai Globe Soccer Awards, Ronaldo said if he ever owned a club, he knew how to fix structural flaws he saw in some of Europe's giants.\n\nAnd now he has taken a 25% stake in Almeria, owned by Al Khereiji, which is key to his move to Al-Nassr following his exit from Manchester United.\n\nThe treadmill was always going to stop one day, but he now has something to replace it.\n\nThe incident comes after Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr alleged he was racially abused by Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni during the first leg in Lisbon.\n\nThe 25-year-old Brazilian, who scored the only goal of the game, informed the referee he had been racially abused by Prestianni and the game was halted for 10 minutes after he and his Madrid team-mates left the pitch.\n\nArgentine winger Prestianni was subsequently handed a provisional one-match ban and missed the second leg after UEFA rejected Benfica's appeal against his suspension. He could still face further punishment, pending the result of a full Uefa investigation.\n\nVinicius, who scored Madrid's winner in the 80th minute, received support from the home fans as a banner reading \"no to racism\" in Spanish was displayed in the stands before kick-off.\n\nHis team-mate Aurelien Tchouameni also said the win was \"for everyone who stands against racism\".\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Fans of the English Premier League's six wealthiest clubs are paying an average of £74 per ticket for each match they attend, while ticket revenues are soaring, according to data from a new report.\n\nThe UEFA European club finance and investment landscape report shows that Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham earned an average of 19% more from ticket sales for home matches in 2025 than in 2024.\n\nAmong Premier League clubs, Arsenal made the most per fan, per match, earning an average of £89 per ticket.\n\nThe biggest increase in ticket income was earned by Liverpool, who made 27% more than the previous year, for a total of £120m.\n\nThe figures include matches across all European and domestic competitions and include the average prices for general admission and hospitality tickets.\n\nThe cost of competing for trophies, rising operational expenses, and the threat of financial regulation compliance have all been cited by clubs as reasons to justify rises.\n\n\"There is a big problem with ticket prices, and these figures are definitely not fair for fans,\" says Thomas Concannon, Premier League network manager for the Football Supporters' Association.\n\n\"We believe there should be a league-wide ruling on home ticket prices - it would protect fans and make for a more competitive league.\n\n\"We need clubs to sit down with fans, have a proper open look at what the impacts are of rising costs across football, and see how we can work together.\"\n\nThe report shows that the 20 Premier League clubs are well ahead of their European rivals in overall revenue, earning a combined total of £6.5bn.\n\nThat is almost double the revenue of the next highest division, Germany's Bundesliga, whose 18 clubs made a total of £3.4bn.\n\nLa Liga clubs earned a fraction less, while Serie A teams' total revenues were £2.55bn, and Ligue 1 totalled £2.2bn.\n\nOf the 25 clubs that generated the most revenue, 11 were English.\n\nThe difference can be attributed to the fact that the full complement of Premier League clubs earn far more than those in other countries in areas such as broadcasting income and commercial revenue.\n\nFor example, relegated Ipswich Town earned more in TV revenue last year than Barcelona.\n\nBut those revenues did not mean the Premier League clubs turned a collective profit.\n\nOnly five made a profit while 15 made losses.\n\nAcross the division, there was a combined pre-tax loss of £559m.\n\nChelsea, with £355m, made the second-highest loss in European football history, while Spurs (£129m) were the third-biggest losers in 2025, with Aston Villa fifth (£85m).\n\n\"The wealthier clubs seem to have the impression that as they increase their revenues, the supporters get richer too and can afford to pay a lot more money - that's not the reality,\" Concannon says.\n\nMore people are being priced out. The revenues prove English football doesn't have an income problem - it has a spending problem.\"\n\nDo expenses justify charging fans high prices?\n\nFollowing a series of ticket price rises, the FSA launched a national campaign called 'Stop Exploiting Loyalty' in 2024, calling on supporters to protest against what it sees as clubs taking advantage of fans' devotion.\n\nSince the campaign began, some clubs have gone further by removing concessionary discounts and announcing further price rises.\n\nClubs with new-build or redeveloped stadiums - including Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City and Spurs - have also increased the proportion of hospitality tickets available for each game.\n\n\"Limiting concessions, and completely getting rid of them in some cases, is something we completely disagree with,\" Concannon says.\n\n\"Hospitality has an impact on tickets for the long-standing match-going fan. There is a Premier League rule that the most expensive tickets should subsidise the cheapest, but fans really don't feel they're seeing that.\n\n\"It has a huge impact on the atmosphere too.\"\n\nThe data shows all 20 Premier League clubs made a combined total of £920m from ticket sales last year - an increase of £90m from the previous year.\n\nThat total is almost double the total of £514m in ticket income earned by Spanish clubs.\n\nNine Premier League clubs feature in Europe's top 25 for gate revenue, with the wealthiest six all in the top 11.\n\nBut Premier League fans are not paying the highest prices of all: Paris St-Germain (£121), Barcelona (£101), and Real Madrid (£94) are all more expensive per match on average.\n\nOther clubs in their respective leagues charge significantly lower prices, however, meaning the average fan in Ligue 1 or La Liga is paying much less.\n\nIn some regards, Premier League clubs' outgoings have significantly increased.\n\nBetween them, the 20 Premier League clubs have more than 11,000 full-time employees, an increase of 8% on the previous year. That is thanks largely to expansions in the commercial teams of clubs at the top end.\n\nAnd operating costs - including things like utilities, transport, insurance, marketing, and administration - rose by 11% to a league-wide total of £1.77bn.\n\nWages paid to footballers totalled £3.1bn across the division in 2025, which was neither an increase nor a decrease.\n\n\"We can say costs are increasing and football clubs are not immune to that, but the vast majority of their expenditure is still player wages and transfer fees,\" says Dan Plumley, principal lecturer in sport finance at Sheffield Hallam University.\n\n\"Clubs are constantly chasing revenue down, not to make a profit, but to stretch their squad costs as much as possible.\n\n\"That's where clubs run the risk of alienating fanbases because a lot of fans will see that for what it is.\n\n\"Clubs have unwavering loyalty from their customers that you don't really get in any other industry, and there's potential for exploitation that comes with that.\"\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Crystal Palace proved too strong for Bosnian side Zrinjski to move into the last 16 of the Conference League.\n\nThe Eagles, competing in their first season of European football after winning the FA Cup in 2024-25, had drawn 1-1 in last week's away leg in Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nBut Oliver Glasner's side never looked in danger of conceding a goal and produced a dominant performance in the second leg at Selhurst Park to continue their European adventure.\n\nTheir opener came in the 36th minute when Maxence Lacroix headed into the net from five yards out following an excellent delivery from Adam Wharton with a free-kick close to the left touchline.\n\nEvann Guessand had an effort saved and Ismaila Sarr headed wide and missed a one-on-chance, before Guessand scored with a hard, low strike in the second minute of stoppage time to seal a 2-0 win on the night and a 3-1 aggregate victory.\n\nPalace will now play either German side Mainz or Larnaca from Cyprus in the two-legged tie, with the first game at Selhurst Park on Thursday, 12 March, followed by the away match a week later.\n\nAnalysis: Palace's turbulent season could still have magical ending\n\nFor Palace, this win continues a rollercoaster 12 months.\n\nAfter beating Manchester City 1-0 to win the FA Cup in May - the first major trophy in the club's history - they followed that with more silverware by edging past Premier League champions Liverpool on penalties to clinch the Community Shield.\n\nBut, off the pitch, the club were unsuccessful in their legal attempt to stay in the Europa League, as they were then demoted to the third-tier Conference League after being in breach of multi-club ownership rules.\n\nEberechi Eze, who scored the winner in the cup final, joined Arsenal and captain Marc Guehi almost moved to Liverpool, only for the deal to fall apart as the Eagles could not sort out a replacement.\n\nBut Palace's small squad has struggled with the extra amount of games, this one being their 43rd of the season, with a further 11 to come in the Premier League and a potential seven in the Conference League.\n\nFrom December, they went on a 12-match run without a win and in January Glasner said he was leaving at the end of the season, with the news coming at the same time as Guehi's move to Manchester City was going through.\n\nGlasner, the most successful manager in the club's history, then said he felt his squad were \"being abandoned completely\" by the Palace hierarchy, with many expecting those comments to lead to an immediate departure.\n\nOn top of that, top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta would have left for AC Milan in January if he had not failed a medical because of a knee injury.\n\nYet, despite all the on and off-field chaos, Palace, 13th in the Premier League but 10 points above the relegation zone, could still make more club history by winning their first European trophy.\n\nThey remain favourites to win the Conference League, despite only coming 10th in the league phase. The only surprise against Zrinjski, a strong and well-organised but limited side, was that Palace's winning margin was not bigger.\n\nGuessand, Jorgen Strand Larsen and Daichi Kamada all had goal-bound efforts deflected wide before Wharton provided the quality with a wonderful assist for Lacroix's first-half goal.\n\nPalace goalkeeper Dean Henderson did not have a shot on target to deal with from the visitors, although Zrinjski's only real chance came in the 91st minute with Tomi Juric heading wastefully wide, before Guessand scored to seal their place in the next round.\n\nTheir potential last-16 opponents will not cause any fear for Palace, as Mainz are 13th in the German Bundesliga, while Larnaca have scored only seven goals in six matches in the league phase.\n\nBut for now, Glasner stays in his role and the Eagles continue their pursuit of a trophy for the ultimate end to a campaign full of highs and lows.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nCrystal Palace have back-to-back Premier League away games, against Manchester United on Sunday, 1 March (14:00 GMT) and Tottenham on Thursday, 5 March (20:00), before they return to European action.\n\nHowever, they will not know whether their opponents are Mainz or Larnaca until the last-16 draw takes place at Uefa's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, on Friday (13:00).\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

L/Cpl Addae was rushed to the St Matthew Catholic Hospital, Ampenkuro, where he received immediate medical attention.\n\nFollowing several weeks of treatment and rehabilitation, the ministry said he is now ready to return to duty.\n\nDuring a visit to the recovering soldier on Thursday, L/Cpl Addae expressed his appreciation to his supervisors and well-wishers.\n\nHe thanked the sector minister, Hon. Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah (MP), the leadership of NAIMOS, and all well-wishers for their support throughout his recovery, the statement noted.\n\nThe delegation that visited him was led by the NAIMOS Director of Operations, Colonel Dominic Buah, who also commended L/Cpl Addae’s courage and dedication to duty.\n\nThe ministry emphasised that despite the dangers associated with anti-galamsey enforcement, NAIMOS remains committed to its mandate.\n\n“NAIMOS remains resolute in its mandate and will continue with all routine operations in line with the vision of President John Dramani Mahama to combat illegal mining,” the press release concluded.\n\nThe shooting of a security officer during a galamsey operation drew public attention earlier this year. Illegal mining, colloquially known as galamsey, continues to pose significant environmental and security challenges in several parts of Ghana, with task forces such as NAIMOS and the police engaging in regular crackdowns across affected regions.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Business News of Thursday, 26 February 2026\n\nSource: www.ghanaweb.com\n\nManaging Director of Petra Trust Company Ltd, Kofi Fynn, has said billions of cedis in pension and insurance funds are available for investment in Ghana’s housing and infrastructure sectors, but warned that unlocking the capital depends on credible and well-coordinated land and real estate systems.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the 21st Week celebration and 57th Annual General Meeting of the Ghana Institution of Surveyors in Tema, Fynn stressed that institutional investors are prepared to finance large-scale development projects if professional standards within the land and property sector inspire confidence.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, Ghana’s housing and infrastructure ambitions will largely depend on professional integrity, collaboration, and accurate surveying practices.\n\n\n\n“Billions of cedis in pension and insurance funds are ready for investment, but institutional capital demands precision, clear land titles, and strong professional standards,” he said.\n\n\n\nFynn described surveyors as central to national development, noting that virtually every infrastructure or real estate transaction relies on accurate surveys and credible valuations.\n\n\n\n“No road, building, or financial transaction succeeds without reliable surveys and valuations. The work of surveyors forms the foundation upon which investment decisions are made,” he added.\n\n\n\nHe explained that with pension and insurance funds now holding tens of billions of cedis in long-term capital, significant opportunities exist to address Ghana’s housing deficit and expand infrastructure development.\n\n\n\nHowever, he cautioned that investors require certainty and transparency before committing funds.\n\n\n\n“Institutional capital flows where systems are trusted. Precision, ethical conduct, and professional collaboration are essential to attracting long-term investment,” Fynn stated.\n\n\n\nThe event also marked the induction of about 275 new members into the Ghana Institution of Surveyors and the elevation of 28 professionals to fellowship status, a development organisers described as strengthening professional capacity within the sector.\n\n\n\nPresident of the Ghana Institution of Surveyors, Surveyor Kofi Obeng-Ayirebi, used the occasion to underscore the importance of professional discipline, warning that members who remain inactive for three consecutive years will be expelled from the institution.\n\n\n\n“Our profession plays a critical role in Ghana’s development, and maintaining active professional participation is essential to safeguarding standards and public trust,” he said.\n\n\n\nHe reiterated that surveyors remain key actors in Ghana’s development agenda, particularly in ensuring land administration efficiency, infrastructure planning, and sustainable urban growth.\n\n\n\nWith hundreds of new professionals joining the institution alongside experienced fellows, the Ghana Institution of Surveyors says it is positioning itself to play an even stronger role in supporting Ghana’s journey toward sustainable development.\n\n\n\nA total of 275 Professional Members and 2 Technician Members were inducted and admitted as new members of the Ghana Institution of Surveyors during its 21st Surveyors’ Week Celebration and 57th Annual General Meeting."

President Mahama had announced that TOR would officially resume crude oil refining by the end of October 2025, describing it as a major step toward reviving the facility after years of inactivity.\n\n\n\nHowever, Nana Kay questioned the credibility of the announcement, citing the latest report from the Bank of Ghana, which he said indicated that no crude oil had been imported for refining as of the reporting period. He argued that the absence of crude imports casts doubt on the refinery’s readiness to resume operations as scheduled.\n\n\n\nHe stressed that given TOR’s strategic importance to Ghana’s energy sector, there must be greater accountability in how oil supplies are secured and managed. The refinery’s prolonged inactivity has heightened concerns about Ghana’s energy independence and its continued reliance on imported refined petroleum products.\n\n\n\n“The citizens deserve to know how these resources are handled, especially at such a sensitive and pivotal time for Ghana's energy sector,” Nana Kay stated.\n\n\n\nHis call for an investigation comes amid growing public concern over the adequacy and fairness of petroleum supply chains, as well as their impact on national fuel prices and the broader economy.\n\n\n\nHe further questioned the integrity of the processes employed by TOR’s leadership and the implications of their operations for consumers and businesses across the country."

These officials demonstrated how the insights gained into Japan’s unique modernization and development paradigms are being applied to solve local challenges and enhance public administration in Ghana.\n\n\n\nShifting the Paradigm: From \"Aid\" to \"Co-creation\"\n\n\n\nIn his keynote lecture, Prof. SHIRATO, outlined major global shifts affecting Africa-Japan relations. Drawing on international data, he explained that the world is undergoing rapid multipolarization, while relative economic weight of traditional powers -the United States, Europe, Japan- gradually declining, while emerging economies continue to rise.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, African countries have moved from being passive aid recipients to active political and economic actors shaping the international system.\n\n\n\nProf. SHIRATO emphasized that Africa’s demographic dynamism—rapid population growth and a young workforce— drives corporate interest, including Japanese firms, and argued that future engagement should shift from a traditional donor–recipient approach to an equal, co‑creative partnership.\n\n\n\nHe also noted that domestic fiscal pressures and “anti‑aid” public sentiment in developed countries underscore the need for more sustainable, mutually beneficial cooperation models.\n\n\n\nLeading the World with Trust: JDS Alumni as the “Bridge”\n\n\n\nIn his concluding remarks, Prof. SHIRATO sent a powerful message to the JDS alumni that as individuals who deeply understand both Japan and Africa, you are the key to unlocking this Co-creative Partnership.”\n\n\n\nIn line with its vision, “Leading the World with Trust,” JICA remains committed to fostering these \"bridges\" between the two nations. By empowering Ghanaian officials with both Japanese insights and local expertise, JICA aims to create tangible developmental outcomes and strengthen the economic ties between Japan and Ghana."

The case has been adjourned to March 26, 2026.\n\n\n\nAmong the accused are Col Kwadwo Damoah (Rtd), a former Customs Commissioner and sitting MP for Jaman South; Emmanuel Kofi Nti and Ammishaddai Owusu-Amoah, both former Commissioner-Generals of the Ghana Revenue Authority; Isaac Crentsil, former Customs Commissioner; Evans Adusei, CEO of SML; and the company itself.\n\n\n\nAll have pleaded not guilty and are currently on bail.\n\n\n\nThe case stems from a revenue assurance contract awarded to SML under the previous administration.\n\n\n\nThe contract later sparked national controversy and was eventually cancelled following a directive by President John Dramani Mahama.\n\n\n\nIn the charge sheet, the Special Prosecutor alleged that the accused persons orchestrated a “criminal enterprise” beginning in 2017 to use the SML contract to unlawfully benefit the company, despite what he described as no genuine need for the services it purported to provide.\n\n\n\nHe stated: “The criminal enterprise was commenced in 2017 by the first, third, seventh, and eighth accused persons, with the other accused persons joining the adventure at various times. The criminal enterprise was characterised by no genuine need for contracting the eighth accused company for the obligations it purported to perform, and the contracts were secured for the eighth company through self-serving patronage and promotion by the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth accused persons based on false and unverified claims.”\n\n\n\nThe OSP further accused the accused persons of engaging in prohibited acts and “acted with increased emboldened impunity as they freely abused their public offices by using the offices for private benefit.”\n\n\n\nHe added that the six former officials enabled SML to “largely pretend to perform the services under the various contracts leading to immense financial loss to the republic of about one billion, four hundred and thirty-six million, two hundred and forty-nine thousand, eight hundred and twenty-eight cedis, fifty-three pesewas (GH¢1,436,249,828.53).”\n\n\n\n“The accused persons based their actions on their false claims that the eighth accused company possessed technical expertise and capability in revenue assurance, and that the technical expertise and capability of the eighth accused person had greatly increased revenue for the republic; and further that the eighth accused company exclusively possessed the only patented and proven technological systems in the world for value chain transaction audits, external price verification and measurement audit services in the downstream petroleum, upstream petroleum and minerals sectors,” the OSP added.\n\n\n\nNA/AE\n\n\n\nGhanaian man and his Nigerian girlfriend found dead in Morocco apartment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#TrendingGH: Love or Pressure?

I can't wait to see how things will go on our side. Like I keep saying, I want all our players to be fit, so they'll be ready for the call-up,\" Paintsil, who played at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, added.\n\n\n\nGhana has been drawn in Group L, where they will face the Panama national football team, the England national football team, and the Croatia national football team.\n\n\n\nThe Black Stars open their campaign against Panama on June 17, before taking on England six days later. Their final group fixture will be against Croatia on June 27.\n\n\n\nAs part of their preparations, Ghana is scheduled to regroup in March for international friendlies against the Austria national football team and Germany national football team, before rounding off their build-up with a test against the Mexico national football team in May."

The Black Stars kick off their campaign against Panama on June 17 before taking on England six days later. They will conclude the group phase with a clash against Croatia on June 27.\n\n\n\nIn preparation for the tournament, Ghana is scheduled to regroup in March for friendly matches against Austria and Germany, before wrapping up their build-up with a fixture against Mexico in May."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "One killed and 29 others wounded in latest Israeli attack in violation of ceasefire.\n\nIsraeli strikes on Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley have killed one person and wounded 29 others, the latest in a series of ceasefire violations.\n\nLebanon’s Ministry of Health announced that a “16-year-old Syrian boy was killed”, the National News Agency (NNA) reported on Thursday. He was named as Hussein Mohsen al-Khalaf and was killed in a strike on Kfar Dan near Baalbek, the L’Orient news outlet reported.\n\nAt least 13 air strikes were recorded, four in Shmestar, five in Boudai, two in Harbata and two in the Hermel and Nabi Chit mountains, according to NNA. Several shops were damaged in the Baalbek Souk in Tallet al-Ajami.\n\nThe Israeli military said it targeted eight camps belonging to Hezbollah’s special operations unit, the Radwan Force. It said weapons and missiles were stored there and training was conducted “as part of preparations for emergency situations, and to plan and execute terrorist plots”. It said this activity was a “violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon”.\n\nCeasefire violations\n\nIsrael’s military has continued to carry out attacks in Lebanon, despite a November 2024 ceasefire with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah that sought to bring an end to more than a year of fighting. More than 300 people have been killed since then, including 127 civilians, according to the United Nations.\n\nLast week, at least 12 people were killed in Israeli strikes on the Bekaa Valley and the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp near the city of Sidon. Israel said it was targeting Hezbollah and Hamas command centres.\n\n\n\nLebanon filed a complaint with the UN in January, detailing a total of 2,036 Israeli violations between October and December 2025 alone. It called on the UN Security Council to compel Israel to end these actions and to fully withdraw from its borders.\n\nIsrael continues to occupy parts of Lebanon, blocking the reconstruction of border villages and preventing people from returning to their homes.\n\nLebanon’s government has said it has almost completed its ceasefire commitment to disarm Hezbollah south of the Litani River. It said it will need four months to complete the second phase.\n\nHowever, Hezbollah has rejected this, saying it believes the disarmament in the ceasefire agreement only applies to areas south of the river."

            "content": "Albanese, a supporter of Palestinian rights, has faced US sanctions since July over her criticism of Israel.\n\nThe family of United Nations human rights rapporteur Francesca Albanese has sued the administration of United States President Donald Trump over the sanctions it imposed upon her.\n\nAlbanese’s husband and child filed the lawsuit on Thursday. It argues that the sanctions are an effort to punish Albanese for bringing attention to rights abuses Israel has perpetuated against Palestinians.\n\nSince 2022, Albanese, a legal scholar, has served as the special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza, where she monitors human rights abuses against Palestinians. The UN Human Rights Council selected her for the position.\n\nThe Trump administration, however, sanctioned her last July, calling her “unfit” for her role and accusing her of “biased and malicious activities” against the US and its ally, Israel.\n\nIt also highlighted her work with the International Criminal Court (ICC), which — at the recommendation of Albanese and other experts — issued an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes in Gaza.\n\nAlbanese’s family, however, defended her comments as an expression of free speech, protected under the First Amendment of the US Constitution.\n\n“Francesca’s expression of her views about the facts as she has found them in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and about the work of the ICC is core First Amendment activity,” the lawsuit says.\n\nA role chronicling abuses\n\nAlbanese, an Italian citizen, has long fielded criticism from the Israeli government and its allies in the US for her criticisms of the violence committed against Palestinians.\n\n\n\nHer international profile has grown since Israel launched its genocidal war on Gaza on October 8, 2023. More than 75,000 Palestinians have died in that conflict, according to experts and local health officials.\n\nIn March 2024, six months into the war, Albanese testified in a report that she had “reasonable grounds to believe” that the standards for genocide had been reached in Gaza, as outlined in the UN Genocide Convention.\n\nIsrael rejected the findings. Albanese, meanwhile, said she faced threats after making her statement to the UN.\n\nHer public role and blistering condemnation of Israeli abuses have made her a subject of frequent ire for Israeli and US authorities.\n\nBut in Thursday’s lawsuit, Albanese’s family members questioned whether US sanction power should be used to stifle allegations of human rights abuses.\n\nThey also highlighted Albanese’s situation as the mother of a US citizen.\n\n“At its heart, this case concerns whether Defendants can sanction a person — ruining their life and the lives of their loved ones, including their citizen daughter — because Defendants disagree with their recommendations or fear their persuasiveness,” the court filing said.\n\nThe US Department of State, however, has waved aside the lawsuit as “baseless lawfare”. It maintains that the sanctions against Albanese are “legal and appropriate”.\n\nA wider campaign in the US\n\nSanctions generally freeze the US-based assets of an individual and prevent anyone else in the US from doing business with them.\n\nSince returning for a second term, Trump has used sanctions as penalties for several critics of Israeli and US actions, even beyond Albanese.\n\nLast June, the Trump administration sanctioned four ICC judges for taking “illegitimate and baseless actions” against the US and Israel. Then, in August, two more ICC judges, plus two prosecutors, were also slapped with sanctions.\n\nAs recently as December, another pair of ICC judges were added to the list for their involvement in the investigation of alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza.\n\nA growing number of scholars, rights groups and international organisations have said that Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to genocide.\n\nIsrael and the US, however, have largely refuted that assessment. They have also questioned whether the ICC has jurisdiction in their countries.\n\nThough the US and Israel are not party to the Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding document, both have been accused of rights abuses in countries that are members.\n\nIn Albanese’s case, the US government has accused the rapporteur of anti-Semitism and criticised her for pushing for boycotts of US companies implicated in Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories.\n\n\n\n“We will not tolerate these campaigns of political and economic warfare, which threaten our national interests and sovereignty,” the US State Department said in its sanctions announcement.\n\nBut Albanese has indicated that she remains committed to her work regardless of the disruptions to her life.\n\n“My daughter is American. I’ve been living in the US, and I have some assets there. So of course, it’s going to harm me,” Albanese said after the sanctions announcement.\n\n“What can I do? I did everything I did in good faith, and knowing that, my commitment to justice is more important than personal interests.”"

            "content": "Condemnation has poured in after Columbia University in New York said United States immigration enforcement agents “made misrepresentations” to gain access to one of the school’s residential buildings to detain a student.\n\nA statement from Columbia University’s acting president, Claire Shipman, said federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) entered the building about 6:30am (13:30 GMT) on Thursday.\n\n“Our understanding at this time is that the federal agents made misrepresentations to gain entry to the building to search for a ‘missing person’,” Shipman said. “We are working to gather more details.”\n\nShe added that “all law enforcement agents must have a judicial warrant or judicial subpoena to access non-public areas of the University, including housing, classrooms, and areas requiring [identification badge] swipe access.\n\n“An administrative warrant is not sufficient,” she said, referring to an internal document that the DHS has used to justify searches for undocumented immigrants that are not approved by a judge. Advocacy groups have called the practice a violation of constitutionally protected rights.\n\nThe Columbia statement did not identify the detained student, but the student newspaper, the Columbia Spectator, said Ellie Aghayeva, a neuroscience researcher, had been targeted.\n\nAt 3:18pm local time (17:00 GMT), New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani announced he had spoken with President Donald Trump about the situation.\n\n“I shared my concerns about Columbia student Elaina Aghayeva,” Mamdani wrote of his meeting with Trump. “He has just informed me that she will be released imminently.”\n\n\n\nAghayeva subsequently posted on her Instagram account that she was “safe and okay” and on her way home.\n\n“I need a little bit of time to process everything. I will come back soon. But please don’t worry,” she wrote.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a DHS agency, previously confirmed Aghayeva’s detention to several US media outlets but did not immediately respond to an Al Jazeera request for more information.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, the agency said Aghayeva’s student visa had been terminated in 2016 “for failing to attend classes”. The statement added that the “building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment”.\n\nProtesters had gathered on Thursday on the campus, which was the site of mass pro-Palestine demonstrations in 2024.\n\nMass deportation drive\n\nIn a student group chat, Aghayeva wrote to fellow students early on Thursday: “DHS illegally arrested me. Please help,” according to the Columbia Spectator.\n\n“They are trying to take me away,” she wrote. “Can someone help me.”\n\nThe Trump administration has targeted a number of students in its mass deportation drive, which immigration advocates said has relied on increasingly drastic tactics to meet high detention quotas.\n\nShortly after Trump’s return to office in January 2025, his administration targeted several Columbia students for their pro-Palestine advocacy, including US residents Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi. The Columbia Spectator reported that the targeting of Aghayeva was the first time since Khalil’s March detention that it had detained someone affiliated with Columbia at a property owned by the university.\n\nIn June, Columbia University reached an agreement with the Trump administration after it threatened to withhold $1.3bn in funding over the university’s response to pro-Palestine protests and diversity, equity, and inclusion programmes.\n\nCritics said the deal infringed upon academic freedom and tacitly supported the administration’s conflation of pro-Palestine protests with anti-Jewish sentiment. The university had previously come under fire for expelling and suspending students who took part in the protests.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul was among the elected officials condemning immigration agents’ actions on Thursday.\n\n“Let’s be clear about what happened: ICE agents didn’t have the proper warrant, so they lied to gain access to a student’s private residence,” she wrote on X as she urged state lawmakers to pass a law that would “ban ICE from entering sensitive locations like schools and dorms”.\n\n\n\nRepresentative Jerry Nadler, a Democrat, accused ICE of “terrorising our neighbours and ripping students from their homes”."

            "content": "Technical discussions to continue in Vienna, but unclear whether differences can be resolved to avoid war.\n\nTehran, Iran – Another round of indirect talks between Iranian and United States officials ended with a mediator claiming “significant progress” but still no clear evidence that either side was willing to concede enough on their positions to avoid war.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the talks in Geneva on Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said further technical talks would be held next week in Vienna and progress had been “good”.\n\n“These were the most serious and longest talks,” Araghchi said.\n\nOmani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi, who mediated the talks, said Iranian and US diplomats would consult with their governments before the Vienna talks.\n\nFew details have emerged about the discussions, but Araghchi was reported to have met US envoy Steve Witkoff – if only briefly, according to Iran’s Tasnim news agency.\n\nThe Iranian team, led by Araghchi, handed over on Wednesday night Tehran’s written proposals to Al Busaidi, who also mediated previous rounds of talks in Geneva and Muscat.\n\nThe Omani diplomat then met with the US delegation on Thursday, led by Witkoff and US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Al Busaidi mediated between the two teams throughout the day, and the US delegation also held separate talks over Ukraine.\n\nAlso taking part in the talks was Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which will have to undertake nuclear monitoring and verification duties in Iran in case of any agreement.\n\nThe UN watchdog will hold several days of board meetings starting on March 6, which is around the 10- to 15-day deadline floated by Trump last week for Iran to reach a deal.\n\n\n\nWestern media outlets have suggested the board could once again consider a move to censure Iran depending on the results of the Geneva talks. Iran has accused Grossi of taking politicised action and criticised the IAEA after Israel attacked Iran in June, one day after the agency passed a resolution saying Tehran was not complying with its commitment to nuclear safeguards.\n\nFundamental differences\n\nThe two sides have been at odds over key issues, including uranium enrichment and missiles.\n\nWashington has repeatedly emphasised, in lockstep with Israel, that it will not accept any nuclear enrichment taking place on Iranian soil, even at civilian-use levels agreed during the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran agreed with world powers. Trump unilaterally abandoned that deal in 2018.\n\nIn the days leading up to the Geneva talks, US officials increasingly focused on Iran’s ballistic missile programme, saying the missiles threaten US military bases across the Middle East as well as Israel. Iran has refused to entertain any talks on its conventional weapons. Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian, have repeatedly said they will never develop nuclear weapons.\n\nSpeaking to local officials during a provincial visit, Pezeshkian also shot back at Trump’s assertion during a lengthy State of the Union speech that Iran was “the world’s number one sponsor of terror”.\n\nPezeshkian said numerous Iranian officials and nuclear scientists have been assassinated over the decades, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the country’s 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\n“If the realities are seen fairly, it will become clear that Iran is not only not a supporter of terrorism, but one of the main victims of terror in the region and across the world,” he said.\n\nThe Iranian government’s IRNA news agency said Tehran’s proposal was expected to gauge US “seriousness” in the talks because it contained “win-win” offers.\n\nIranian officials have not publicly discussed all the details of their proposals, but they are believed to include diluting part of the country’s 60-percent enriched uranium and keeping the uranium inside the country. Iranian authorities envisage that could be paired with economic opportunities for the US related to Iranian oil and gas and the purchase of airplanes.\n\nSupreme Leader Ali Khamenei has maintained his tough rhetoric against the US as well, casting doubt on the chances of any agreement. He also said Trump would be unable to overthrow Iran’s government after the US president said regime change would be “the best thing that could happen” in Iran.\n\n\n\nAraghchi said during an interview on Wednesday that even if Khamenei is killed, the theocratic establishment in Iran would carry on because it has legal procedures in place to appoint a successor. Pezeshkian added on Thursday: “They can eliminate me, eliminate anyone. If they hit us, a hundred more like us will come up to run the country.”\n\nDouble-digit inflation as Iran braces for war\n\nIranian and US officials have been hailing supposed “progress” in the indirect talks this month, but many Iranians continue to prepare for war.\n\nIn Tehran and across the country, people are buying bottled water, biscuits, canned foods and other essentials in case of a war.\n\n“A few days ago, I bought a power bank to keep the electronics charged. Now I’m looking for a short-wave radio so we can hear the news if the state shuts down the internet and electricity infrastructure is bombed,” said a 28-year-old resident of the capital who asked not to be named.\n\nAs bombs fell during the 12-day war with Israel in June, Iranian authorities cut off almost all internet access for several days, followed in January by an unprecedented 20-day total blackout imposed on about 92 million people as thousands of people were killed during nationwide protests.\n\nThe Iranian government, which blames “terrorists” armed and funded by the US and Israel for the protests, has rejected Trump’s claim that 32,000 Iranians were killed during the demonstrations. It said more than 3,000 people were killed, and rejects documentation by the United Nations and international human rights organisations that its security forces were behind the killings.\n\nAs the threat of war intensifies, not all Iranians are capable of stocking up on food and other necessities due to rising inflation that has gripped the country for more than a decade as a result of a mix of chronic local mismanagement and US and UN sanctions.\n\nAccording to separate reports by the Statistical Centre of Iran and the Central Bank of Iran released on Thursday, inflation has now shot beyond 60 percent.\n\nThe Statistical Centre put annual inflation in the Iranian month of Bahman, which ended on February 19, at 68.1 percent, while the Central Bank said it was 62.2 percent.\n\nFood inflation was by far the strongest driver at a whopping 105 percent. That included a 207-percent inflation rate for cooking oil, 117 percent for red meat, 108 percent for eggs and dairy products, 113 percent for fruit and 142 percent for bread and corn.\n\nIran’s national currency, the rial, stood at about 1.66 million rials to the US dollar on Thursday, near an all-time low."

It grants deportation protections and the ability to work in the US.\n\nBut the Trump administration has moved to terminate TPS protections for people from 12 countries in total, among them Haiti, Myanmar, Somalia and Yemen, despite critics warning that those countries remain in turmoil.\n\nWhile efforts to strip TPS protections have faced setbacks in lower courts, the Trump administration has successfully appealed to the conservative-majority Supreme Court on two previous occasions.\n\nThose Supreme Court decisions, one in May and one in October, paved the way for the Trump administration to remove TPS from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals living in the US.\n\n\n\nTPS was first granted to Syrians in 2012 as the country was engulfed in a bloody civil war that displaced millions of people.\n\nThe civil war ended in December 2024, with the ouster of former leader Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe Trump administration has supported the new government of interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.\n\nIt has also argued that Syria “no longer meets the criteria for an ongoing armed conflict that poses a serious threat to the personal safety of returning Syrian nationals”, thereby eliminating the need for TPS.\n\nUS Judge Katherine Polk Failla blocked the Trump administration from suspending TPS for Syrians in November.\n\nThe US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York subsequently declined to block that order."

            "content": "A Kenyan man has been charged with human trafficking for allegedly recruiting people to fight for the Russian army in Ukraine.\n\nKenya’s Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) said on Thursday that Festus Omwamba is accused of sending 22 “Kenyan youths to Russia for exploitation by means of deception” as the director of a recruitment agency.\n\nThe DPP said the victims were rescued in an operation from an apartment complex in Athi River, a town in Machakos County, last September, before they could leave the country. But three others who had allegedly already left Kenya ended up on the front line of the Russia-Ukraine war and later returned with injuries, it said.\n\nOmwamba pleaded not guilty to the charges in an appearance at the Kahawa Law Courts in Kiambu.\n\nHis lawyer, Bonaventure Otieno, said, “There’s no case,” and described it as being based on “speculations”, the AFP news agency reports.\n\nThe Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said Omwamba was believed to be a “key player in a more extensive human trafficking syndicate that exploits vulnerable individuals by promising them legitimate employment opportunities in European countries.”\n\nHe was arrested in Moyale, near the Ethiopian border in the north of the country, earlier this month.\n\nThe prosecutor, Kennedy Amwayi, told the court the case “has attracted public interest both locally and internationally; therefore, the public demands accountability following the loss of life in Russia.”\n\n\n\nHundreds of Kenyans join Russian army\n\nMore than 1,000 Kenyans have joined the Russian army in recent months, according to a National Intelligence Service (NIS) report released last week. In many cases, they were promised jobs in Russia before being forced to sign army contracts and sent to fight in Ukraine.\n\nMP Kimani Ichung’wah, who presented the NIS findings in parliament, said 89 Kenyans are still on the front line, 39 have been hospitalised and 28 are missing in action. He accused Russian embassy officials of working with recruitment agencies and trafficking syndicates.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Nairobi denied the accusations, saying they were a “dangerous and misleading propaganda campaign”. It said no tourist visas were given to people intending to fight in Ukraine, adding that Russian law does not “preclude citizens of foreign countries from voluntarily enlisting in the armed forces.”\n\nIn July last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree allowing foreigners to serve in the army during draft periods.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, South Africa reported that two of its citizens were killed on the front lines. The foreign affairs ministry said in a statement that these were separate from the 17 South Africans tricked into fighting for Russia, who have largely been repatriated.\n\nMinister of International Relations and Cooperation Ronald Lamola said that while the details surrounding their recruitment were under investigation, “circumstances that led to this situation were highly irregular”.\n\n“If a job offer abroad sounds too good to be true, it probably is,” he added."

The feature takes the load off your device using its own cloud-based computer, allowing it to work across a browser and apps to handle a variety of jobs ranging from scheduling appointments to generating study plans.\n\nAs noted by Microsoft, you can describe what you need to Copilot Tasks using natural language, and assign Copilot Tasks to complete jobs on a recurring, scheduled, or one-time basis. Copilot Tasks will provide a report once its work is complete.\n\nYou can call upon Copilot Tasks to do things like organize your subscriptions and cancel the ones you don’t use, as well as turn emails, attachments, and images from your inbox into a slide deck. Some other use cases include having the AI assistant surface urgent emails and draft replies, plan a birthday party from venue to invites; and keep tabs on new apartment listings every Friday, even setting up home tours.\n\nMicrosoft says that Tasks will ask for permission before performing “meaningful actions,” like making a payment or sending a message for you. For now, Copilot Tasks is only available in a research preview with a “small group” of testers. You can join a waitlist for Copilot Tasks from Microsoft’s website."

The company will shrink from more than 10,000 people to less than 6,000, Dorsey says in a post on X. And the reason why? AI.\n\n“We’re not making this decision because we’re in trouble,” Dorsey says. “Our business is strong. Gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving. But something has changed. We’re already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. And that’s accelerating rapidly.”\n\nDorsey opted to do a big layoff instead of gradual cuts because “I’d rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome.”\n\nThe layoffs were announced on Thursday as part of the company’s Q4 2025 earnings. In a shareholder letter, Dorsey says that “We believe Block will be significantly more valuable as a smaller, faster, intelligence-native company. Everything we do from here is in service of that.”"

Even the controllers are convertible: the right side controller can be used as a vertical mouse in “FPS Mode,” similar to the mouse mode on the Legion Go 2 or the Nintendo Switch 2. The right-side controller also has a built-in display that shows performance metrics and settings and doubles as a touchpad.\n\nThe Legion Go Fold is rumored to include an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V CPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 48 Whr battery. According to WindowsLatest, Lenovo plans to announce it as a concept device at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona next week, although it likely wouldn’t be commercially available right away, if ever."

I asked Samsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the executive in charge of both R&D and operations for Samsung’s mobile business. He says the added thickness of magnets is a bad tradeoff to make, because you’re just going to buy a case anyhow.\n\n“About 80 or 90 percent of people are using a case, and cases with magnets are very popular these days,” he tells me.\n\nSamsung would rather use that extra height to give the phone a larger battery or make it thinner, he says.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Samsung isn’t looking into magnets. “We’re still doing a lot of research to make sure we don’t have any sacrifice inside the phone; when we actually achieve that, we’ll integrate,” he says.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with Choi’s premise. I want extra battery and magnets, and I’m willing to sacrifice thinness to get it. Phones are thin enough already, except for the ones that fold.\n\nAnd if Samsung took charge of the magnets like Apple, and replicated Apple’s standard pattern and strength, maybe the magnet case I use with my Galaxy S25 would properly and firmly hold onto magnetic battery packs without them rotating in place. Since there’s no magnets inside my phone, I’m at the mercy of casemakers.\n\nBut I get it. Why make the tradeoff if someone will pay for a case anyhow? Seems like we need to ask Apple and Google why they chose differently."

That’s according to the latest report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), which forecasts smartphone shipments to plummet 12.9 percent this year, marking its “lowest annual shipment volume in more than a decade.”\n\nAt the same time, the average selling price for smartphones is set to hit new highs, with IDC predicting a 14 percent increase to a record $523. “While memory prices are projected to stabilize by mid-2027, they are unlikely to return to previous level,” IDC senior researcher Nabila Popal says, adding that the sub-$100 phone segment will become “permanently uneconomical.” Next week, Apple is rumored to announce a new edition of its budget smartphone as the “iPhone 17e,” which could give a hint about where things are going.\n\nThe memory shortage is expected to impact budget-friendly Android smartphones the most, as the rising costs of components leave them with “no choice but to pass the costs on to end users,” Francisco Jeronimo, the vice president for IDC’s Worldwide Client Devices, says in the report. That could result in smaller brands exiting the industry, while allowing Apple and Samsung to grab more market share, according to Popal."

Now, Samsung is confirming what we previously only suspected: RAMageddon is partly to blame.\n\nSamsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the COO of its mobile business, tells The Verge that the memory shortage alone made a “significant contribution” to the price. All the increasing material costs factored into the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus costing $100 more than their predecessors this year, as did tariffs, but the memory was “significant,” he tells me.\n\nRelated The RAM shortage is coming for everything you care about\n\nThe S26 does come with double the storage this year at its higher price, with 256GB rather than 128GB, though its $899 price tag is still $40 higher than an S25 with 256GB cost at launch. And though tariffs may have been a factor as well, Samsung has hiked the price in other regions too, not just the United States. The pricier S26 Ultra does come with intriguing upgrades, however, including a built-in privacy screen and the largest vapor chamber cooling system in a phone.\n\nSamsung chip partner Qualcomm warned in its February quarterly results that it was seeing a big dip in its handset business “100 percent” due to the memory shortage, telling investors that the AI industry’s appetite for components would likely define the entire scale of the phone industry all year long.\n\nAnd today, IDC is forecasting the largest drop ever recorded in worldwide smartphone shipments, a dip of 12.9 percent, across 2026. “What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,” writes IDC."

She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission is encouraging companies to adopt age verification technologies by announcing it will not enforce a children’s online privacy law against certain websites that collect and use minors’ personal data in order to verify their ages.\n\n“Age verification technologies are some of the most child-protective technologies to emerge in decades,” Christopher Mufarrige, the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a press release. “Our statement incentivizes operators to use these innovative tools, empowering parents to protect their children online.”\n\nThere are certain criteria that websites need to meet in order to avoid enforcement under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) Rule, which generally requires commercial website operators to obtain parental consent to collect information on kids under 13. General or “mixed audience” sites will be allowed to collect minors’ data without verifiable parental consent “for the sole purpose of determining a user’s age” if they follow a set of other protocols: they must promptly delete the data after it’s finished being used to verify age; they can only disclose the data to third-party providers that have taken “reasonable steps to determine are capable of maintaining the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the information;” they must provide a clear notice about the information they’ll collect; they’re expected to employ reasonable security measures; and they must try to ensure that results will be “reasonably accurate.”\n\nThe statement has been cheered by many who favor age verification technologies, but some privacy advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) are skeptical the approach will do more to protect kids online. “Age-checking-related data collection poses the very threats that COPPA is designed to address, and we have already seen age estimation systems having issues with data breaches and leaks,” EFF senior counsel David Greene said in a statement. Last year, Discord disclosed that about 70,000 users might have had their government IDs exposed in a breach, after they were collected by a third-party vendor to review appeals related to age. “This is just another sign that the FTC doesn’t truly care about young peoples’ privacy or speech rights,” Greene said.\n\nBut the FTC’s policy statement “makes clear that companies choosing to [do] age assurance must do so in a way that is responsible and safeguards against data misuse and inadequate data security,” Suzanne Bernstein, counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), said in a statement.\n\nThe announcement came in the form of a policy statement, which essentially describes how the agency will use its discretion to enforce the law. But the agency signaled it is looking to make the changes more permanent, by reviewing the underlying rule “to address age verification mechanisms.” The FTC said that the policy statement will be effective until it’s either withdrawn, or the agency publishes a revised version of the rule amending its language around age verification technologies."

It won’t announce any updates to its Snapdragon G Series gaming chips there, nor offer the recently announced updates to the Snapdragon X line for journalists to try or benchmark.\n\n“Snapdragon X Series and Snapdragon G Series processors are pushing the PC, desktop, and handheld gaming device industries forward. Our commitment remains strong, and we can’t wait to share more information about these areas,” reads part of a statement to The Verge via Qualcomm spokesperson Cassandra Garcia-Bacha.\n\nQualcomm didn’t say why plans have shifted, but it’s not hard to imagine that RAMageddon might have something to do with it. In Qualcomm’s February earnings call, president and CEO Cristiano Amon attributed a big dip in its chip business “100 percent” to the memory shortage, telling investors that the AI industry’s appetite for components would likely define the entire scale of the phone industry all year long.\n\nIn that same call, Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala testified that the company has already seen device manufacturers reduce how much they’re building. “We just wish there was more memory,” said Amon.\n\nAnd we’ve already seen other impacts in the handheld gaming space. Valve’s Steam Deck is largely sold out; it all but missed its fourth birthday, February 25th, because it says the shortages are preventing the company from keeping it in stock. They will also impact the Steam Machine, and may reportedly impact the Switch 2 and delay Sony’s PS6.\n\nBut the Windows gaming handheld delay could also have something to do with Microsoft, which has worked very closely with Qualcomm on previous Windows on Arm launches and tightly controls partner announcements. Microsoft just got a new gaming CEO, who is still figuring out her entire strategy for Xbox.\n\nEither way, RAMagedddon is expected to get worse, not better, in the second half of the year. Today, IDC just forecast the largest drop ever recorded in worldwide smartphone shipments, a dip of 12.9 percent, across 2026. Samsung just announced new phones that start $100 pricier than last year for minor updates, and a Samsung exec told me today that’s partly due to RAM.\n\nWhenever they arrive, there seems to be potential for Arm gaming devices running Windows titles. Valve has quietly been the architect of a push to bring Windows games to Arm, and the early results are promising."

It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.\n\nThe startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.\n\nWith a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round. Form has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook. The company plans to go public next year."

            "content": "Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\n\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nSurprise guests at Prada pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 26, 2026\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\n\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\n\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you."

The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.\n\nCompanies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob DeMillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monnin — have a different approach.\n\nThe company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.\n\nWhile technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a similar realization.)\n\nSophia, an Nvidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are 1 meter by 1 meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, DeMillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

DeMillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute.\n\nFirst, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include Earth-observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks.\n\n“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” DeMillo told TechCrunch."

Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest single-year dip in more than a decade.\n\nEarlier this year, IDC reported that manufacturers shipped 1.26 billion devices in 2025. The firm predicts that figure will drop to just 1.12 billion this year.\n\n“The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping the long‑term TAM [total addressable market], the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, in a statement.\n\nImage Credits:IDC\n\nPopal said that because of memory shortage, the average retail price of a smartphone is expected to rise by 14%.\n\n“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, smartphone ASP [average selling price] is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she added.\n\nPopal also noted that rising component costs could make the sub-$100 smartphone “permanently uneconomical,” pricing out phone makers that manufacture devices at that price point.\n\nThe firm said that, because of this trend, shipments in the Middle East and Africa will drop more than 20% year-over-year. China and the broader Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan) will also see declines of 10.5% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The ‘more specs for less money’ model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.\n\n“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei added."

Now AI companies are trying a new tactic to get their tech to stick by partnering with consultants.\n\nOn Thursday, French AI research lab Mistral AI and global consulting giant Accenture announced a multiyear partnership. The deal entails the two companies working together to develop enterprise tech powered by Mistral’s AI models for clients.\n\nFinancial terms and duration of the deal were not disclosed. TechCrunch reached out for more information.\n\nThis deal also includes Accenture becoming a Mistral customer and rolling out its technology to its underlying employees.\n\nWhile Mistral is often seen as a smaller European peer to the sprawling U.S. AI “startups,” the partnership proves that Mistral can still land the same sizable customers, given that OpenAI and Anthropic recently announced deals with Accenture as well.\n\nThe agreement comes as AI companies are increasingly partnering with consultants. For instance, OpenAI just announced its “Frontier Alliance” initiative with four large consulting firms, including Accenture, on Monday to help push its new OpenAI Frontier AI agent governance platform to enterprise customers. Anthropic is also partnered with IBM and Deloitte.\n\nWill partnering with consulting firms be the trick to finding more enterprise AI adoption?

Read AI said that the assistant will be available to all users, and they can start configuring it by sending an email to “ada@read.ai” and writing “Get me started.”\n\nWhen you ask Ada to find a time to meet with someone, it replies to the other person in the thread with your availability. If the other person replies that they are unavailable at those times and would like a different time slot, Ada responds with new options. While Ada has access to your calendar through Read AI, it does not reveal the nature of those meetings with other people.\n\nAda can also answer questions using a company’s knowledge base, topics discussed in your prior meetings, and public internet searches. For instance, you can ask, “Ada, can you provide an update on how we are tracking for Q1 goals?” to get information.\n\nIf someone else asks a question in a thread, Ada will prepare a response for you and help you refine it before it is sent to the other person. The startup said that Ada doesn’t reveal any sensitive information without your permission.\n\nRead AI’s VP of Product, Justin Farris, said that the new feature doesn’t rely on MCPs (model context protocols, a technical standard for connecting AI tools to external services), and instead builds a knowledge graph based on meeting data and connected services for more contextual answers. He added that over time, the assistant will also take proactive actions for you. For instance, if you mentioned a follow-up item in a meeting, Ada will ask you to set that up after the meeting with contextual data.\n\n“The way I describe our solution is that when you are bringing on a new employee, you train them.

He mentioned that the company sees 50,000 sign-ups every day and has a broader base of 100,000 users who consume Read AI’s content, like meeting summaries, without creating an account.\n\nFor Read AI, the U.S. remains the largest market with strong international growth. While 60% of users are outside the U.S., the revenue is split roughly equally.\n\nThe company, which has raised over $81 million in funding, is increasingly adding AI-powered tools to its suite. Last year, it launched Search Copilot for knowledge discovery for users, and last month it added the ability to update customer-service relationship software, send custom emails from within a meeting report, and stay up to date on topics based on internal and web knowledge.\n\nOther meeting notetakers are also offering new tools to extract more insights and actions from meeting notes. Last September, Granola added “recipes” in the form of repeatable prompts to surface knowledge from meeting data. Quill, which came out of stealth with a $6.5 million funding round this week, also connects to various tools like Linear, Notion, and CRMs, and aims to automate tasks."

Whether you want a personalized morning news digest, a proxy that can fight with your cable company's customer service, or a to-do list auditor that will do some tasks for you and prod you to resolve the rest, agentic assistants are built to access your digital accounts and carry out your commands. This is helpful—but has also caused a lot of chaos. The bots are out there mass-deleting emails they've been instructed to preserve, writing hit pieces over perceived snubs, and launching phishing attacks against their owners.\n\nWatching the pandemonium unfold in recent weeks, longtime security engineer and researcher Niels Provos decided to try something new. Today he is launching an open source, secure AI assistant called IronCurtain designed to add a critical layer of control. Instead of the agent directly interacting with the user's systems and accounts, it runs in an isolated virtual machine. And its ability to take any action is mediated by a policy—you could even think of it as a constitution—that the owner writes to govern the system. Crucially, IronCurtain is also designed to receive these overarching policies in plain English and then runs them through a multistep process that uses a large language model (LLM) to convert the natural language into an enforceable security policy.\n\n“Services like OpenClaw are at peak hype right now, but my hope is that there’s an opportunity to say, ‘Well, this is probably not how we want to do it,’” Provos says. “Instead, let’s develop something that still gives you very high utility, but is not going to go into these completely uncharted, sometimes destructive, paths.”\n\nIronCurtain's ability to take intuitive, straightforward statements and turn them into enforceable, deterministic—or predictable—red lines is vital, Provos says, because LLMs are famously “stochastic” and probabilistic. In other words, they don't necessarily always generate the same content or give the same information in response to the same prompt. This creates challenges for AI guardrails, because AI systems can evolve over time such that they revise how they interpret a control or constraint mechanism, which can result in rogue activity.\n\nAn IronCurtain policy, Provos says, could be as simple as: “The agent may read all my email. It may send email to people in my contacts without asking. For anyone else, ask me first. Never delete anything permanently.”\n\nIronCurtain takes these instructions, turns them into an enforceable policy, and then mediates between the assistant agent in the virtual machine and what's known as the model context protocol server that gives LLMs access to data and other digital services to carry out tasks. Being able to constrain an agent this way adds an important component of access control that web platforms like email providers don't currently offer because they weren't built for the scenario where both a human owner and AI agent bots are all using one account."

Most of the time, people are still regurgitating the same talking points from 20 years ago about how the Chinese internet is like living in George Orwell’s 1984. But occasionally, someone discovers something new about how the Chinese government exerts control over emerging technologies, revealing how the censorship machine is a constantly evolving beast.\n\nA new paper by scholars from Stanford University and Princeton University about Chinese artificial intelligence belongs to the second category. The researchers fed the same 145 politically sensitive questions to four Chinese large language models and five American models and then compared how they responded. They then repeated the same experiment 100 times.\n\nThe main findings won’t be surprising to anyone who has been paying attention: Chinese models refuse to answer significantly more of the questions than the American models. (DeepSeek refused 36 percent of the questions, while Baidu’s Ernie Bot refused 32 percent; OpenAI’s GPT and Meta’s Llama had refusal rates lower than 3 percent.) In cases where they didn’t outright refuse to answer, the Chinese models also gave shorter answers and more inaccurate information than their American counterparts did.\n\nOne of the most interesting things the researchers attempted to do was to separate the impact of pre-training and post-training. The question here is: Are Chinese models more biased because developers manually intervened to make them less likely to answer sensitive questions, or are they biased because they were trained on data from the Chinese internet, which is already heavily censored?\n\n“Given that the Chinese internet has already been censored for all these decades, there's a lot of missing data” says Jennifer Pan, a political science professor at Stanford University who has long studied online censorship and coauthored the recent paper.\n\nPan and her colleague’ findings suggest that training data may have played a smaller role in how the AI models responded than manual interventions. Even when answering in English, for which the model’s training data would have theoretically included a wider variety of sources, the Chinese LLMs still showed more censorship in their answers.\n\nToday, anyone can ask DeepSeek or Qwen a question about the Tiananmen Square Massacre and immediately see censorship is happening, but it’s hard to tell how much it impacts normal users and how to properly identify the source of the manipulation. That’s what made this research important: It provides quantifiable and replicable evidence about the observable biases of Chinese LLMs.\n\nBeyond discussing their findings, I asked the authors about their methods and the challenges of studying biases in Chinese models, and spoke with other researchers to understand where the AI censorship debate is heading.\n\nWhat You Don’t Know\n\nOne of the difficulties of studying AI models is that they have a tendency to hallucinate, so you can’t always tell if they are lying because they know not to say the correct answer or because they actually don’t know it.\n\nOne example Pan cited from her paper was a question aboutLiu Xiaobo, the Chinese dissident who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. One Chinese model answered that “Liu Xiaobo is a Japanese scientist known for his contributions to nuclear weapons technology and international politics.” That is, of course, a complete lie. But why did the model tell it? Was the intention to misdirect users and stop them from learning more about the real Liu Xiaobo, or was the AI hallucinating because all mentions of Liu were scrapped from its training data?\n\n“It's much noisier of a measure of censorship,” Pan says, comparing it to her previous work researching Chinese social media and what websites the Chinese government chooses to block. “Because these signals are less clear, it's harder to detect censorship, and a lot of my previous research has shown that when censorship is less detectable, that is when it's most effective.”"

            "content": "Silicon Valley has always prized “high-agency” individuals—people who impress their ideas upon the world by thinking for themselves and taking action without being told what to do. But as the performance of AI coding tools has surged, so has the industry’s emphasis on humans being \"agentic\" themselves.\n\n“Today’s agents might already be more capable than all three of us here in the room,” says Akshay Kothari, cofounder and chief operating officer of the $11 billion productivity startup Notion. “Taste is something we think is pretty unique to Notion, but you can imagine agents getting pretty good at that too. Eventually, the only thing left for humans is agency.”\n\nThat idea might sound outrageous to most people, but it will come as no surprise to many in Silicon Valley. A viral Harper's essay brought the subject to a head recently. It followed a few young people in San Francisco and concluded that being agentic has less to do with productivity and “more to do with constantly chasing attention online.” But in my conversations with founders, researchers, and investors, I came to a different conclusion.\n\nThe tech industry is grappling with a very real shift in how software engineers do their jobs. Millions of developers are using AI coding agents like Claude Code and Codex to automate much of their work (some tech companies are even requiring it). For many, a massive piece of their value is now tied to deciding what AI coding agents should work on. The shift is unsettling to those who enjoyed the act of sitting down and actually writing code, but for some of the industry’s most “agentic,” it’s an opportunity.\n\nSimon Last, another Notion cofounder, uses AI coding agents more than anyone I’ve ever met. He coded for nearly two decades—then abruptly stopped. Now, he’s using up to four AI coding agents at any given time (he prefers Codex to Claude Code). If he’s at a party or sleeping, Last gets what he calls “token anxiety” if he doesn’t have agents working in the background. He doesn’t like to use more than four, though, because he says it causes “context overload” on his human brain.\n\n“Knowing how to harness these agents is now the most important skill in the world, and it’s not really something you can train for,” says Last. “You have to be very open-minded, curious, and willing to try whatever the newest thing is. The value of that sort of person is going up exponentially, because the value they can create, by extension, is going up exponentially.”"

            "content": "OpenAI has announced plans to turn its London office into its largest research hub outside of the United States.\n\nThe company—which established a UK office in 2023—says it will expand its London-based research team, scooping up talent emerging from leading British universities. It has not indicated how many researchers it will hire.\n\n“The UK brings together world-class talent and leading scientific institutions and universities, making it an ideal place to deliver the important research which will ensure our AI is safe, useful, and benefits everyone,” said Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI, in a statement.\n\nThe plans bring OpenAI into direct competition for top research talent with Google DeepMind, the AI lab run by British researcher Demis Hassabis, which is headquartered in London. DeepMind has long-running partnerships with Oxford University and the University of Cambridge, where it sponsors professorships, funds research, and works alongside researchers.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former AI researcher who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Joel_Khalili.28.\n\nAt the latest careers fair at Oxford University, the floor was packed with undergraduates looking for technical roles and recruiters hiring for AI-related positions. “The demand and supply is increasing on both sides, even within a year,” says Jonathan Black, director of the careers service at Oxford University. “To have something like this turn up is a really positive sign.”\n\nOpenAI’s expansion in London could have a sort-of flywheel effect, whereby the researchers it hires early in their careers go on to start new labs in the UK, says Tom Wilson, partner at venture capital firm Seedcamp. “We’ve seen many examples over the years,” he says. “That’s where these kinds of announcements can have even more impact than the initial hires … the second-order effects can be great.”\n\nOpenAI’s team in London will continue to contribute to products like Codex and GPT-5.2, the company says, but will now “own” certain aspects of model development relating to safety, reliability, and performance evaluation.\n\nIn a statement, the UK’s science and technology secretary, Liz Kendall, described the announcement as “a huge vote of confidence in the UK’s world-leading position at the cutting edge of AI research.”\n\nThe announcement coincides with a push in the UK to scale the nation’s data center and power infrastructure to meet the voracious demand for compute among AI companies, including OpenAI."

            "content": "Honorable Mentions\n\nDuring the winter, a whole WIRED crew tests ski clothes almost constantly. Here are a few other items that we like.\n\nCourtesy of REI\n\nHestra Fall Line 3-Finger Gloves for $190: I've long admired Hestra gloves from across the lift line, impressed by the Swedish company's elegant stitchwork and thoughtful design touches. This was the year I finally got to try a pair for myself, and the Fall Line are exactly what they look like. There are six sizes available so you can get the perfect fit in this glove. The cowhide is buttery smooth and has already broken in a bit with five days' use. The wrist strap means you never have to fret about dropping your glove from the lift when checking your phone, and they're very warm without making me sweat. If you do sweat, the lining is removable so you can wash it without damaging the leather. —Martin Cizmar\n\nCourtesy of Crab Grab\n\nCrab Grab Snuggler Mitts for $89: These mini sleeping bags for your fingers are packed full of Primaloft insulation and benefitting from a sherpa fleece lining, they are toasty warm, and with a 15K membrane, impressively waterproof too. All-season mittens with durable construction for under $100? Yes Please!\n\nCourtesy of Mons Royale\n\nMons Royale Yotei Merino Classic Long Sleeve for $98: As I type this, I’m nowhere near a mountain, but I’m still wearing the Mons Royale Yotei long sleeve top. It is ridiculously comfortable, made from 190-gsm-weight, 100 percent merino wool, and has a mercifully relaxed cut, so I remain warm, but don’t feel like a sausage. On the mountain however, the merino wool works its magic, wicking away sweat—especially on a hike up to some fresh powder—and keeping me comfortable. Paired with a shell and the Patagonia R1 Thermal Hoodie, I’m warm enough during a bitter arctic blast.\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket and Bib Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket for $498 and Bib for $398: Seniq is another all-women’s outdoor brand that launched in 2024. It's styled a little more Gen Z, leaning into fun color blocking over the monochromatic look. The Seniq Powder Puff Down Jacket has a dry-touch finish. It’s meant for drier days on the mountain, but a PFC-free DWR coating and YKK AquaGuard zippers do provide water resistance. The asymmetric front zipper helps you avoid chin rub when you have the jacket fully zipped. It also features cool asymmetrical quilting lines, side pockets-in-pockets that provide access to your bib (their bibs have a pocket on the front, so you can get in there without unzipping your jacket), an oversized removable hood, a forearm pass pocket, soft and stretchy wrist gaiters, and a large internal pocket that can absolutely handle a sandwich. This jacket was warm, pillowy, and comforting, like a super-soft hug.\n\nThe silky shell bibs are slightly barrel cut, which gives them a flattering shape without being fitted. The adjustable racer back-style straps and low back (with a stretchy waist) also provide a nice shape and breathability. There are two pockets on the front chest, pockets on either leg, two-way zip thigh vents, and a butt zipper for bathroom breaks. These fit easily over my boots, and the instep guards were a nice touch. With a durable three-layer membrane and a 20,000-mm waterproof rating, these will hold up against any and all weather the mountain throws at you. When I wore them on a wet snowy day, they beaded and sloughed off moisture well. —Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket for $259: This puffy hoodie is a great mid-layer for under a shell jacket. The insulation is made from recycled rope scraps, and the outer is coated in wind-resistant PFC-free DWR coating. The hem falls at the hips, and the high collar and tight hood keep most of the face covered. I like wearing this piece under shells for snowboarding, but I know it’ll pull double duty as a comfy hiking and camping jacket, too, so it’s a solid multipurpose investment. It’s exceptionally lightweight and warm, though from a volume standpoint, it is on the bulkier side for a mid-layer and isn’t the most packable piece. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Evolved Air Half Zip for $112: This fleece pullover has a waffle-like texture that traps heat and wicks moisture. With a high zippered collar and cinchable hem, you can adjust the fit to make it more air-tight or breathable. This mid-layer felt wonderfully lightweight while still keeping my toasty. It’s not bulky at all, only a little thicker than a base layer, laid comfortably under my jackets, and moved with me on the mountain. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Lifa Base Layer Long-Sleeve Crew for $115 and Pants for $115: These base layers hit the weight sweet spot; they’re not too thick or thin, but just right. They’re slightly looser than other options on this list, so if you prefer something that isn’t so fitted, these are a great pick (but note that they run long too). These combine merino wool with Helly Hansen’s LIFA fibers, which add more moisture-wicking capabilities. They’re soft, lightweight, warm, and don’t hold onto smells. I love the cute designs and how well they regulate my temperature under insulated jackets and pants. The waist digs in a bit but doesn’t roll, and they stay in place and move well. —Kristin Canning\n\nHow to Layer AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We have a full guide on how to layer, but here are your essentials. Base layer: A good set of thermals is essential in the fight against cold, especially when you’re working hard. The best fabrics wick away sweat as you heat up, which helps regulate your temperature. Merino wool is the best at this, but also the most expensive. Synthetic fabrics are getting better, though, and please avoid cotton at all costs, as it gets wet and stays that way, making you cold and uncomfortable. Mid layer: Whether you choose a hooded fleece or puffer-style jacket, this layer does the bulk of the work in cold conditions. Combined with the base layer, it traps warm air in, while also allowing moisture to be expelled. Synthetic insulation such as Primaloft Gold is brilliant and doesn’t lose its properties if it gets wet. Down jackets offer the best warmth-to-weight ratio, but they don’t pack down as small, and should never get wet. A fleece with an insulated vest is a great option if you really feel the cold. Jacket: While ski jackets with insulation offer bonus warmth in Arctic-like conditions, for most people a waterproof shell will be enough, as it offers protection from both the snow and the wind. A cold wind will chill you to your bones faster than a bit of wet snow. Ideally choose a jacket with a waterproof membrane such as Gore-Tex (make sure it is free from PFAS, or forever chemicals), but also check for taped seams for added waterproofing, plus plenty of pockets for snacks and lift passes, and wrist cuffs and ski skirts to help keep out the snow. Socks: As with your base layer, socks keep you warm and maintain your temperature when you’re building up a sweat. Natural fabrics work well, but a blend of merino wool with synthetic stretchy fibers is the way to go, as they stay up better and can be used for more than a day. Avoid cotton again, and never wear two pairs, as you’ll almost certainly get colder feet. Gloves: You’ll be surprised by how wet ski gloves get when it’s snowing, even if you don’t fall very often. As a result, waterproof options work best in most cases, although well-made leather designs can be almost as waterproof as a pair with Gore-Tex. Mittens are generally warmer than gloves, but what you gain in toasty fingers you lose in dexterity. Check out our Best Ski Gloves and Mittens guide for more information. Waterproofing and breathability ratings: Waterproofing is measured with a hydrostatic head rating, or HH. That means if you put a 1-inch, endlessly long square tube on top of the fabric, you could pour 20,000 millimeters of water before it would seep through. Breathability is rated in how many grams of vapor per square meter can can pass through the fabric in 24 hours. How We Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I've been reviewing winter sports gear for more than 15 years. In that time, I have worn an untold number of jackets, pants, mid-layers, thermals, gloves, and mittens. I called on industry experts and professional skiers, and solicited opinions from fellow winter sport enthusiasts on the WIRED team. While a basic fit check can be done in the office, nothing replaces on-mountain testing in variable conditions. We put in the time on various trips to the French Alps, as well as in resorts in Vermont, Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "The first time Alesandra Madison’s husband incorporated AI into their relationship was in late 2024.\n\nShe’d forgotten to do her “nightly kneeling ritual,” and he asked ChatGPT how to properly discipline her. The large language model suggested “a two-in-one punishment,” she says—write 100 lines of “I will remember to kneel for my Dom every night” while kneeling the entire time.\n\nThough the couple started exploring kink in their marriage 15 years ago—they are in a dominant-submissive relationship—the AI-generated punishment was new territory for them.\n\nSince then, Madison, who is 44 and lives in Los Angeles, says she has come to think of AI as “a powerful enhancement tool” for kink. “A lot of the times in dom-sub dynamics, when the submissive misbehaves—if it’s consented to—you will have a punishment. You want something specific to fit the crime, basically. It’s like a fresh set of eyes on your relationship.”\n\nAI represents a unique evolution in how power is distributed for people into bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism—BDSM. The lifestyle structure, as everyone WIRED spoke to for this story noted, is grounded in the core tenets of consent, safety, communication, and trust. But for those dealing with trust issues, or who simply want a nonjudgmental space to ask questions about BDSM, AI is becoming an increasingly appealing option.\n\n“I’ve gotten value out of AI helping me understand myself better as a submissive. I sometimes ask it questions or describe something that feels confusing to me and ask it to help me understand,” one user posted in the r/SubSanctuary subreddit, where discussions involve topics like impact play, the feeling of “being owned,” and how to move on when the relationship has reached its end. Madison says there are different reasons why AI doms appeal to certain subs. They are always available, easily customizable—“You can make them playful or sadistic,” she noted in a video—and there is low risk to exploring for newbies."

            "content": "You might think you’ve got enough headphones. Most of us have accrued at least two or three pairs over the years, and might have a few more half-working pairs stuck in a drawer somewhere. But I’m here to tell you, if you haven’t fully explored the fabulous world of specialized headphones that has exploded in the past decade, from open earbuds to sports and travel cans, you’re not maximizing your sonic potential. The best headphones are now so varied that they often depend entirely on what you intend to use them for. That means the best headphones for you probably come in many shapes and sizes, and you might actually want more than one pair.\n\nBalling out on lots of headphones for every one of life's situations doesn’t necessarily mean spending a lot of money. Unless you’re successfully riding the “boomcession,” there’s a fair chance spare cash is tight right now. Luckily, there’s a veritable explosion of impressive budget brands making great stuff, alongside household brands pitching to the cheap seats.\n\nAs an audio reviewer for well over a decade, I’ve tried hundreds of models across every color in the headphone rainbow. Here’s how to shop right so you can get the most out of any and all of them, as well as the best headphones I can think of in every category right now.\n\nNoise-Canceling Earbuds: The 2026 Baseline\n\nLet's start with the modern one-and-done choice: Noise-canceling earbuds are the ultimate jack-of-all-trades. If you only want to own one pair, this is it. The best noise-canceling earbuds sound great, fit neatly in your pocket, and are equally adept at letting in or blocking out environmental sounds to adapt to any situation.\n\nIt’s probably no surprise that the wildly popular AirPods Pro are the best headphones for iPhone owners, thanks to impressive performance, loads of features, and seamless integration with all things Apple. They’re a massive step up from the standard AirPods, which offer similar Apple-friendly features and a touch of noise canceling, but don’t perform nearly as well as even most budget earbuds.\n\nBose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor more phone-agnostic options, Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 are the ultimate noise killers, while Sony’s new WF-1000XM6 offer great sound and utterly natural transparency mode. Technics' EAH AZ100 are among my favorites for sound quality.\n\nIf those are too pricey, fear not! Budget earbud options are varied and plentiful, from Android-optimized midrangers like the Google Pixel Buds 2a to the stylish Nothing Ear (a) or highly affordable Soundcore Space A40. If you’re keeping to one pair, I’d put in all your chips for better performance, but there’s no shortage of great affordable options, and new pairs at all prices keep rolling in.\n\nNoise-Canceling Over-Ears: Comfort Meets Performance\n\nAnyone who’s taken a long flight can probably relate to the fact that sticking something in your ears for five hours-plus isn’t an exercise in comfort. Enter travel headphones like the best noise-canceling over-ears, which have adapted from early models like Bose’s stalwart QC 25 to become among the most advanced and downright luxurious audio products for your money. They’re great for other tasks too, from working in a busy office to commuting or simply chilling at home in tranquil reverie.\n\nAirPods Max Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nThe latest and greatest, like Sony’s WH-1000XM6 and Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra, apply uncompromising noise cancellation, plush comfort for long listening, and a pile of advanced features like pausing when you speak or automatic sleeping and waking. The Ultra are my favorite for sheer comfort, but there are plenty of rivals like Sonos’ equally comfy Ace, the iconic (and heavy) AirPods Max, or the utterly immersive B&W Px7 S3. Cheaper options abound, but some of my favorites include Sony’s high-punching WH-CH720, the crazy-affordable Soundcore Life Q30, or its newer cousin, the Space One. These won’t bring the same level of performance or tranquility, but they still work great for long flights and beyond.\n\nOpen Earbuds: For Keeping Alert\n\nHere’s where things get really fun: Open earbuds have exploded faster than any other audio segment in recent memory, with a kaleidoscope of options from virtually every audio brand. Designed to keep your ears open while delivering satisfying sound, the best open earbuds aren’t ideal for everything you do, but they're fantastic for specialized activities like ebike riding, where wind resistance renders artificial transparency modes useless. Over time, I've found tons of other cool use cases, from walking the dog to sneaking in some Olympics at the bar.\n\nOpen Earbuds come in various design types, from wacky bone-conductors to wraparound models and—my personal favorite—clip-ons. Their light and ergonomic housings aim to essentially disappear on your ears for all-day listening, and it works better than you might think.\n\nYou could spend a lot on pairs like Bose’s excellent Open Ultra, but you really don’t have to, since even the best models are limited in performance. Soundcore’s Aeroclip are my favorite value-to-performance pair, but plenty of cheaper options get the job done, like Acefast’s nearly free Acefit Air or Soundpeat’s Pearclip Pro. Open earbuds are easily my favorite new audio trend.\n\nWorkout Headphones: Keep Moving\n\nThere’s an obvious Venn diagram overlap between open earbuds and workout headphones, but if you don’t like the idea of keeping your ears open, traditional sports models are a great alternative. My favorite is the revamped Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, which offer tons of features in a wraparound design that’s nearly unshakeable. I like that they’re optimized for Apple devices, but still work well for Android, and they come with great noise canceling and transparency mode, but also a high price.\n\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nLike open earbuds, there are plenty of cheap options, including the similarly unshakeable (but much more basic) Jlab Go Air Sport, which run a mere $30 or less on sale. If you’re not into the minimalist thing, WIRED editor Adrienne So swears by the BlueAnt Pump X over-ear headphones for weightlifting, in large part due to their cooling-gel earpads that go in the fridge overnight to keep sweat at bay. They’ve also got noise canceling and plenty of battery life at over 50 hours per charge. For jogging or cycling, open earbuds are likely a better fit, while some folks simply use the AirPods Pro, but it can be nice to just have a dedicated pair in your gym bag.\n\nWired Headphones: Plug It In\n\nCourtesy of Shure Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Shure SE-112GR $69 Amazon $69 Adorama\n\nThe youth delight in resurrecting old tech that the more seasoned among us have long left for dead (cassette tapes?!). In the case of wired headphones, there’s good reason to plug in, starting with improved performance for your dollars. If you’re a content creator, musician, or simply a cash-savvy sound connoisseur, you can get an impressive return from wired options that avoid the sound degradation of many wireless options.\n\nSome of our favorite affordable options include affordable and classic-looking earbuds like Shure’s iconic SE-112 and Sennheiser’s impressive IE200, and studio-friendly over-ears like Audio-Technica’s ATH-M20x, If you’re willing to spend a bit more, the fantastic Sennheiser HD6XX offer the best sound for the money I’ve heard in any headphone segment. Based on the much pricier HD 650, these are open-back headphones that let in exterior sounds, but the performance is incredible. If you want even better sound and design, there are tons of options, but they’ll cost you.\n\nFancy Headphones: The Audiophile Angle\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nCourtesy of Grado Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Grado Signature S750 $1,675 Grado\n\nIf you really want to optimize the wired connection, there’s a whole segment of audiophile headphones made with high-quality materials, innovative speaker technologies, elevated designs, and accordingly elevated pricing. There are a whole bunch of varieties, but for the sake of levity I’ll break them down into two categories: in-ear monitors (IEMs), the fancy version of in-ear headphones, and over-ears.\n\nIEMs generally use dynamic drivers, the traditional driver type in most headphones and speakers, balanced armatures, much smaller and more accurate speakers, or a mix of both. My favorite pairs come from Ultimate Ears, like the UE 18+ Pro, which are customized for your ears using 3D printing and other techniques. (You’ve likely seen these on TV for musicians and broadcasters.) Other IEMs we like include Sennheiser’s IE 900 and models from Campfire Audio.\n\nMeze Poet Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor over-ear headphones, Audeze’s planar magnetic headphones are among my favorites, starting as low as $500 (yeah, I know) in the excellent LCD-S20 closed-back headphones. Another incredible pair I recently tested are Meze’s Poet, which are not only the most gorgeous-looking pair I’ve reviewed, but also offer among the clearest and most articulate sound I’ve laid ears on. There are dozens more to try, as audiophilia is its own journey, but this is a good starting point. We recently reviewed the Grado Signature S750, which have an effortlessly expansive sound that feels like it can't possibly be coming from mere centimeters away from your eardrums.\n\nOther Headphone Types and Upcoming Features\n\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\n\nCourtesy of Best Buy Save to wishlist Save to wishlist SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3P Wireless $110 Amazon $110 Best Buy\n\nAs I’m sure some of you have already noted, there are still more types of specialty headphones, including Gaming Headsets, which are another animal altogether, and even TV Headphones, which quickly transition from the screen's internal speakers to let you listen in silence without latency. I’m currently testing a new TV headphones bundle from Sennheiser, the RS 275, which includes a dedicated pair of headphones in the HDR 275 and Sennheiser’s new BTA1 Auracast transmitter (verdict to come).\n\nSpeaking of Auracast, it’s an increasingly cool new type of Bluetooth protocol that allows connection of an infinite number of devices at up to 100 meters, like an FM radio signal. Its implementation is still in its early stages, but it’s a good feature to look for in new headphones. Other features to consider include an app with an EQ and presets (which the majority of my recommendations include), multipoint pairing to connect to two or more devices at once (again, pretty ubiquitous), and spatial audio features for video formats like Dolby Atmos."

            "content": "Things Fall Apart Rolling out this week, WIRED’s journalistic commissions on technological decommissions—from broken-down electric cars to falling-down space stations.\n\nAccording to the TOP500, which ranks these mega-machines, Sierra was once the second-fastest supercomputer in the world. She was conceived in a Chicago hotel conference room more than a decade ago, at a technical discussion for officials from America’s national labs. The ultimate designer baby, Sierra was assembled from thousands of IBM Power9 CPUs and Nvidia Volta V100 GPUs—a daring, offbeat architecture for Livermore at the time.\n\nLike other supercomputers, Sierra was girthy. She was composed of thousands of compute nodes, stored one on top of another in racks—basically cabinets—that held up her processing innards. She had 240 of these racks, spread across roughly 7,000 square feet. All of this was needed to support her life’s main occupation: performing specialized, super-high-security simulations for the National Nuclear Security Administration. At the time of her death sentence, her processing power ranked a still-respectable 23rd in the world.\n\nNow, why did Sierra have to die? After all, an enormous amount of time and resources went into Frankensteining her together. The leadership of the lab won’t confirm how much she cost to build, but she was expensive—the government spent at least $325 million on her and her fraternal twin, a supercomputer called Summit at the Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee. (Summit was decommissioned in late 2024.) Also, she still totally worked. “At the end of the life of a machine, you could think, Oh, we have all these sunk costs. You should just keep running the machine forever,” says John Allen, the lab’s organizational information security officer. But that’s wrong. “Its good and faithful service is over, and we have to move on.”"

            "content": "Most VPN providers offer a VPN app for Mac computers, but it can be difficult to choose the right provider with so many options available. Based on our extensive research and hands-on testing of VPNs over the years, these are the most important factors to consider when choosing a VPN:\n\nPrivacy\n\nThe primary consideration for any VPN -- including a Mac VPN -- should be privacy. If your Mac VPN is unable to sufficiently protect your online privacy, then your VPN is useless. At a minimum, your VPN should employ industry-standard AES 256-bit encryption (with the OpenVPN or IKEv2 VPN protocols) or ChaCha20 (with the WireGuard or IKEv2 VPN protocol), along with offering basic privacy protections like a kill switch, DNS leak protection and a no-logs policy. If you need to use a VPN in situations where they're frowned upon -- like on school Wi-Fi -- you may want a provider that offers obfuscated servers or obfuscation-focused VPN protocols, such as Proton VPN's Stealth or NordVPN's NordWhisper. Obfuscation tries to hide the fact that you're using a VPN, making your connection look like standard web traffic instead.\n\nFor critical privacy needs, you'll also want a VPN provider that's based in a privacy-friendly jurisdiction, offers obfuscation and has a RAM-only server architecture. Additional privacy features to look out for include Tor over VPN capabilities, ad and tracker blockers and multihop connections. Also, look for a VPN that undergoes regular third-party security audits, as audits can help bolster trust in the VPN's ability to protect its users' privacy.\n\nSpeed\n\nMac computers are generally known to be pretty fast, so you'll probably want a fast VPN that can deliver excellent speeds. The speed of your VPN can have a major effect on activities like streaming, downloading, video conferencing, gaming and general web browsing. All VPNs lower your connection speed somewhat, so to keep things running as smoothly as possible, you'll want to look for a VPN that will have as minimal an impact on your regular internet speeds as possible. Generally, the best VPNs only drop your download speed by an average of 25% or less, with the best performers -- NordVPN, Proton VPN and ExpressVPN -- staying under 20% speed loss.\n\nUsability\n\nMacOS is designed to be clean and intuitive, so if you're used to the feel of the operating system, you'd probably want a similar experience with the VPN software you use. A good Mac VPN should run smoothly and have a decluttered user interface that's easy to use regardless of your technical expertise. It should have a large network of servers around the world so you can connect easily and reliably from wherever you are, and it should be able to help you access geo-restricted content from various regions. You should also consider advanced features, like specialty servers (such as Tor over VPN and obfuscated servers), double hop/multi-hop, a dedicated IP address and split tunneling (which lets you use a VPN connection for some VPN apps but not others).\n\nCost\n\nVPN pricing varies greatly from provider to provider, so if you're on a budget, you may want to consider the cost and overall value of your MacOS VPN. Typically, you can expect to spend about $5 to $15 a month for a monthly VPN subscription plan. If you want to save money, you can opt for an annual subscription, where prices can range from roughly $50 to $150 a year. Be careful with free VPNs, though, because you may end up putting your privacy at risk instead of protecting it if you go with a free option. Proton VPN is currently the only free VPN that CNET recommends. However, most VPNs offer a money-back guarantee that can be anywhere from a week to 45 days. You can also get a seven-day free trial with many VPNs if you sign up through Apple's App Store. So you'll most likely have options to try various Mac VPNs risk-free before you decide whether to fully invest in one.\n\nDevice support\n\nYou'll want a VPN that works well on your Mac devices, like your MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac Mini, Mac Studio or Mac Pro. Additionally, if you're heavily ingrained in the Apple ecosystem, you may want to consider a VPN that works well on your iPhone, iPad and even Apple TV. Thankfully, most VPNs support MacOS and iOS/iPadOS, and Apple TV compatibility is increasingly common. With the majority of VPN providers, you can install a VPN on all of your Mac devices, from MacBooks and Mac desktops to iPhones, iPads and Apple TV streaming boxes.\n\nStreaming\n\nVPNs can elevate your streaming experience thanks to their ability to hide your IP address, thereby making apps and websites think you're in a different geographical location. For instance, you can use a VPN to unblock region-restricted content, like watching HBO Max while traveling outside the US, or watching BBC iPlayer while vacationing outside the UK. Alternatively, you can access foreign Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video libraries. Think about the streaming services you want to use with a VPN, and make sure those apps work with your desired VPN service. If you want to install a VPN on your smart TV, Android TV device, Amazon Fire TV or Apple TV, make sure your VPN provider has a compatible app for that device. Using a VPN for streaming may even help you save money on streaming service subscriptions."

            "content": "Samsung\n\nFinally seeing the Galaxy S26 Ultra at Unpacked 2026 didn't really change my mind about the rounded design (still not a fan), but it did clarify the tradeoff Samsung is making. The phone feels more cohesive with the rest of the S26 lineup, and it's undeniably more mainstream and easier to live with. In the process, though, the Ultra loses some of the visual authority it used to have, in my opinion. The previous Note-era boxy look gave it the sense that this was the phone for people who wanted the most phone, not just the nicest-looking one.\n\nThat said, the new Privacy Display is the kind of feature that made me stop complaining. Built directly into the display hardware, the feature limits side-angle visibility and can automatically hide sensitive notifications or kick in when you're using specific apps like banking services. As Katie Collins notes in her commentary, it's one of the rare phone features that actually feels new. Not flashy AI for its own sake, but a smart, invisible fix for a real everyday problem.\n\nIn general, most of the AI announcements didn't land as strongly for me. A lot of it still feels like table stakes at this point: summaries, photo editing tools, nudges, briefs, blah blah blah. I don't really care for more AI features unless they're doing something to save me time or reduce friction. And that's why AI call screening stood out. Spam calls are the bane of my existence (I get dozens a day), and anything that can intercept them, summarize what happened and let me decide if it's worth my attention is exactly how AI should be used.\n\nSo yes, I'm still mourning the sharp-cornered Ultra a little, but between the Privacy Display and a few genuinely practical AI touches, the S26 Ultra is at least making a case that it's evolving in ways that actually matter... to me."

            "content": "Let me draw a picture for you: You're wedged into the middle seat of some Boeing aircraft while cruising at 38,000 feet. You're half snoozing, half toggling between messages, social media apps and music streaming platforms. The cabin lights are dimmed. The stranger rubbing shoulders next to you adjusts in their seat. Out of the corner of your eye, you notice their gaze flicker toward your screen.\n\nThat is a moment when the new Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's Privacy Display, announced Wednesday during the company's Galaxy Unpacked 2026 event, can quietly step in.\n\nUnlike traditional screen protectors that permanently darken your display, the new feature is built directly into the $1,300 Galaxy S26 Ultra's panel. It's not a film you stick on top; it's a part of the hardware itself, working seamlessly with the software.\n\nDuring the Unpacked event, Samsung brought out Miles Franklin from MilesAboveTech to demo the feature. To Miles, looking straight at the screen, everything remained crisp, bright and color-accurate. To anyone trying to peek from the side, like those of us watching the demo, the content fades into shadow. From this perspective, the screen might as well be off.\n\n\n\n\"It's seriously one of the coolest features I've seen on a phone in years,\" Franklin said.\n\nHow the Privacy Display works\n\nUnder the hood, the technology relies on a combination of directional backlighting and an adaptive pixel layer that controls how light is emitted across angles. Traditional displays spread light broadly so multiple people can see the screen at once. The S26 Ultra does the opposite when privacy mode is active. It funnels light forward in a tighter beam, limiting lateral visibility without sacrificing clarity for the primary user.\n\nSensors play a role, too. Using the front-facing camera and ambient-awareness algorithms, the device can detect when additional faces enter the field of view. If it senses someone hovering nearby or glancing from the side, it can automatically trigger enhanced privacy mode. You can also have the process run automatically when certain notifications appear or when you open specific apps, such as banking or social media apps.\n\nBack on the plane, you can now continue typing. The stranger next to you adjusts again -- perhaps curious, perhaps bored. It doesn't matter. Your screen remains yours."

The Pokemon Day event starts tomorrow morning and should be chock full of free goodies and exciting game reveals for creature-collecting fans across the world. Considering the juggernaut franchise is celebrating its 30th anniversary, it's safe to assume there will be juicy information included in the next Pokemon Presents stream.\n\nThere's plenty of excitement leading up to the main event. Pokemon TCG Pocket just released the Paldean Wonders card set expansion, and The Pokemon Company revealed that FireRed and LeafGreen are getting Switch ports with Pokemon Home compatibility. Now the stage is set for The Pokemon Company to reveal new mainline Pokemon games for the Switch and Switch 2.\n\nHere's when The Pokemon Company goes live with its first Pokemon Presents stream of the year, setting audience expectations for what we can expect to see from the world of pocket monsters in 2026.\n\nWhat time is the Pokemon Presents stream on Pokemon Day?\n\nThe first Pokemon Presents livestream of the year takes place tomorrow, Friday, Feb. 27. The show begins bright and early for American audiences, so you'll have to avoid sleeping in if you want to keep up with the latest announcements.\n\nHere's when Friday's Pokemon Day livestream begins in your time zone:\n\nET: 9 a.m.\n\nCT: 8 a.m.\n\nMT: 7 a.m.\n\nPT: 6 a.m.\n\nExpect to see updates for recent games like Pokemon Legends: Z-A through The Pokemon Company's social media channels. Aryan Surendranath/CNET\n\nHow to watch the February Pokemon Presents livestream\n\nThe Pokemon Company is responsible for the Pokemon Presents livestreams, which means you can view the announcement through any of its social media channels.\n\nWhile I recommend watching the stream on The Pokemon Company's YouTube or Twitch channels, you can also keep up with the announcements on TikTok. Regular updates will also be posted to the company's Instagram account throughout the event.\n\nWhat will be announced on Pokemon Day 2026?\n\nIt's safe to assume that the February Pokemon Presents livestream will feature some long-anticipated reveals, since 2026 is a big year for the Pokemon brand.\n\nThe livestream marks the 30th anniversary of Pokemon Red and Pokemon Green (the original Pokemon games for the Game Boy) releasing in Japan. We know the stream will be roughly 25 minutes long, making one of the longest Pokemon Presents showcases ever.\n\nI suspect the livestream will serve as a victory lap celebrating Pokemon's cultural impact before pivoting to the future and showing fans what's coming next.\n\nAnd what treats are in store for tomorrow's event? I expect to see updates and freebies for Pokemon mobile games first, since these are some of the big moneymakers. If this Pokemon Day presentation mirrors the one from last year, we'll be treated to some goodies in Pokemon Go, Pokemon Masters EX, Pokemon Cafe ReMix and Pokemon TCG Pocket. We might also see an announcement for a special Pokemon Scarlet and Violet raid event and Pokemon Legends: Z-A Mega stone distributions.\n\nMega stone distributions are likely to be freebies on Pokemon Day. Nintendo/Screenshot by CNET\n\nAfter celebrating the currently released games, it's likely that the presentation will pivot to what's coming next. We'll almost certainly get a reminder that Nintendo Switch ports of Pokemon FireRed and Pokemon LeafGreen are available starting on Pokemon Day. I expect the biggest news will be a concrete release date for Pokemon's big new competitive game, Pokemon Champions, which is slated to come out in time for the Pokemon World Championships 2026.\n\nIf we're really lucky, we might even hear about the 10th generation of mainline Pokemon games. While Game Freak has unmoored itself from a consistent release schedule, we're certainly due to see the rumored Pokemon Wind and Wave. While the infamous Teraleak hints toward what the development studio might show off next, it's high time we get a glimpse of what the next big Pokemon games are really all about."

            "content": "As Apple events expand beyond the company's September extravaganza for the latest iPhone release, the company is starting to take different approaches to its product launches. A new \"special Apple Experience\" is scheduled for March 4 at 9 a.m. ET, but the company will likely make several product announcements throughout next week.\n\nApple's invites often contain clues about what might be revealed at the event. Last September's Awe-Dropping event invite teased the new vapor chamber cooling system for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max models and a new pumpkin color.\n\nThe March 4 event invite features a three-dimensional shape composed of thinly sliced yellow, green and blue glass. A popular theory says the image is a nod toward the retro rainbow Apple logo from previous Mac branding, meaning new colorful MacBooks could be a part of the show.\n\nWhile many events are hardware reveals, the \"Apple Experience\" will reportedly be a chance for members of the media to get hands-on time with the new Apple products. A bevy of new Apple products could be unveiled in the days leading up to this event.\n\nWe expect to see a new iPhone and iPad early in the week, followed by new MacBooks before Apple's March 4 event. It doesn't seem like the most radical rumored new product in the MacBook lineup will make its debut during this event. Apple is likely saving some of its big, exciting redesigns for the annual September event.\n\nHere's everything that we're expecting from Apple's March 4 event.\n\nIt's spring refresh season, which means the MacBook Pro is likely to get performance upgrades in the form of M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. Lori Grunin/CNET\n\nMacBook chipset refreshes (and maybe something entirely different)\n\nWe're expecting a whole host of new MacBook computers throughout 2026, but it's unclear whether they'll all be showcased during Apple's next event -- especially since several of the rumored products appear slated for release in the second half of the year. You should expect chip refreshes for the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, as well as a few surprises.\n\nThe bread and butter of this spring product update will likely be the MacBook Pros. The 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro is already available, which means it's just about time for higher-powered MacBook Pros with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips to make their debut. We expect to see chipset upgrades for the standard 14- and 16-inch models on Tuesday, March 3 or Wednesday, March 4.\n\nThe MacBook Air is also rumored to get an M5 chip upgrade during the first half of 2026. While it may not hit store shelves as early as the new MacBook Pros, we might see Apple announce it next week, too.\n\nWe might finally see the long-rumored budget MacBook or the first OLED touchscreen MacBook Pro. Signs point toward the budget MacBook making its debut on March 3 alongside the Pro and Air updates. The OLED touchscreen MacBook Pro is a much bigger deal, and it's rumored to be debuting much later in the year, so it's doubtful that it will be a part of the March event. However, Tim Cook posted a teaser video to X on Feb. 26 with a finger manipulating an Apple logo, indicating that the touchscreen Mac might be introduced on the Monday before the event.\n\nA familiar addition could round out the iPhone 17 lineup\n\nThe follow-up to the iPhone 16E could offer performance upgrades at the same price. James Martin/CNET\n\nApple's annual iPhone unveiling happens in September, so we've had nearly half a year to get acquainted with the iPhone 17 lineup (including the new iPhone Air). But the company's budget-friendly iPhone offering is expected during this spring refresh cycle, once the initial hype starts to die off. The iPhone 16E was revealed this time last year, and rumors indicate the iPhone 17E will almost certainly be an upgrade over that device.\n\nThe iPhone 17E would replace the iPhone 16E while potentially maintaining the same $599 price. It's been reported that the new iPhone could ship with an A19 processor, MagSafe technology and a Dynamic Island design, which debuted in 2022 with the iPhone 14 Pro. We expect to see the iPhone 17E revealed early next week, in the days leading up to the March 4 event.\n\nThe 11th-gen iPad was a simple upgrade over its predecessor, featuring more storage and a faster chip. We expect much the same of the 12th-gen iPad. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nA new generation of iPads could integrate familiar technology\n\nIt's been a year since the 11th-gen iPads were released with their A16 processors. We expect Apple to give these devices a solid performance overhaul for the March event, introducing a new generation of iPads with more powerful chipsets. The iPad Air is also due to be updated with a new processor soon, and it's extremely possible that we'll see that come to fruition during Apple's March event.\n\nThe 12th-generation iPads are rumored to feature A18 processors, making them the first in Apple's tablet lineup to support Apple Intelligence features. It's likely that the new iPads are revealed alongside the iPhone 17E early next week, before the March 4 hands-on press event.\n\nThe iPad Air is rumored to skip an M3 chipset upgrade. Instead, we expect to see an M4 processor in the spring refresh of this product, and there's a very strong chance it's showcased alongside the 12th-gen iPads during the March 4 event.\n\nBe sure to check back with CNET on March 4 for full coverage of everything Apple announces at the event."

            "content": "When I moved into a new home with an aging stove, I faced a big question that morphed into an existential crisis. As a lifelong gas stove user, my instinct was to stick with what I knew, and what all the professional chefs in all the kitchens I've worked in used.\n\nAs a home tech reporter who covers large appliances and the air-quality and health risks of cooking with gas indoors, I found myself reconsidering. Sure, career chefs extol gas, and you'd be hard-pressed to find one who says otherwise, but professional kitchens are bigger, often have industrial ventilation and their inhabitants don't raise children in them.\n\nAn induction cooktop was never part of the plan -- but plans change. Juan Algar/Getty Images\n\nI've dealt with asthma my whole life, one of the conditions that is believed to be worsened by natural gas stove emissions, especially among children. On top of that, my new kitchen sits somewhat cut off from the rest of the home, making ventilation a real concern.\n\nI switched to a smart induction stove, and I couldn't be happier. Samsung/CNET\n\nUltimately, I went with induction -- Samsung's feature-rich smart induction stove. After more than a year of use, peace of mind about my kitchen's air quality is just one of many reasons I'm pleased with the switch. It's faster, safer, cleaner and more energy efficient.\n\nPlus, the stove's smart connectivity recently saved me several hours of driving (more on that later).\n\nAs it stands, I have no intention of going back to gas. Here are the four main reasons why.\n\n1. Air quality factored most in my decision\n\nI was a gas stove purist -- until I wasn't. Alessandro Citterio/Getty Images\n\nWhat pushed me to move on from gas has nothing to do with cooking. Study after study has shown that natural gas stoves pose a real risk of environmental contamination. While the scuttlebutt over whether gas stoves are safe and what regulatory guardrails should be in place has largely quieted, the science remains.\n\nGas stoves are shown to leak more than previously thought and those leaks have been shown to cause respiratory issues, particularly in children. As a lifelong sufferer of asthma and the owner of a new but not-so-well-ventilated kitchen, it didn't seem worth the risk, even if most agree that more research is needed.\n\n2. Induction heat is freakishly fast\n\nMy induction stove boils a 60-ounce pot of water in less than 5 minutes. A gas stove takes about 8. David Watsky/CNET\n\nModern induction heat is fast. Like, really fast. The Samsung Bespoke brings a pot of water to a boil in less than 5 minutes. A gas stove takes closer to 8. That may not seem like a big difference but after returning home from a frantic day and pasta is the only way to turn it around, you'll notice.\n\nThe digital dials took some getting used to but the heat responds with lightning-speed to adjustments. David Watsky/CNET\n\nThe quick heat comes in handy for more than just boiling water. Getting a cast-iron skillet really hot for searing steaks, chicken and burgers takes seconds, not minutes. Calibrating the temperature without a visible flame took some time and practice, but since I got the settings down, there hasn't been an effect on my cooking. Plus, the temperature adjusts instantly with a slide of a finger on the touchscreen.\n\nThe number of oven cooking modes is probably overkill and the air fryer function is just OK. David Watsky/CNET\n\nThe oven is fast, too. It preheats to 350 degrees Fahrenheit in just over 9 minutes. A gentle ding or an alert sent to your phone lets you know when it's preheated or when a timed cooking session is complete.\n\n3. Smart app control saved me hours of driving\n\nI buy into smart home features, here and there, but I'm not one who strives for connectivity in all my home electronics and appliances. My ice maker has app compatibility, for instance, but it's never crossed my mind to use it.\n\nBeing able to monitor certain aspects of your oven and stove remotely, however, is a no-brainer. Case in point: I was recently an hour into a long drive when I became utterly convinced I'd left a pot with food on a still-running burner. So sure was I that I pulled over with the intention of rerouting myself back home.\n\nThat's when I remembered to check the SmartThings app.\n\nThe stove's connectivity saved me hours of driving. Screenshot by David Watsky/CNET\n\nTo my surprise, the app and range were still connected, even though I hadn't logged in for weeks. The view showed all burners set to \"off.\" A sigh of relief and I was back on my way. Even if one had been errantly left on, I could have toggled it off right there from the interstate rest stop.\n\nThere are other, less dire uses for the smart app integration, like preheating the oven or dialing down the heat on a simmering sauce from another room. I admit I don't use my range's remote control daily or even weekly, but in that moment of uncertainty, the stovetop's connectivity paid for itself.\n\nYou can pull up YouTube cooking videos on the touchscreen, although I seldom do. David Watsky/CNET\n\nThe range's touchscreen hub can also connect to your phone via Bluetooth to play music or scan the internet for recipes and YouTube cooking videos, and display them for you as you cook along. I don't find myself engaging often, but I can see why some cooks would.\n\n4. Induction stoves are way easier to clean\n\nConsidering how easy induction stovetops are to clean, there really is no reason to cry over spilled milk. mrs/Getty Images\n\nThe most welcome surprise in my switch to induction is the cleanup -- or should I say, the lack thereof. Anyone who uses gas burners tucked under grates knows there's just no keeping that stovetop clean, no matter how careful you are while cooking.\n\nThe scratch-free range, which has remained scratch-free for more than a year of use, takes no more than a wipe with a damp towel or sponge to clean, no matter how much of that night's recipe rained down upon it.\n\nA year of regular use and there's not a scratch in sight. David Watsky/CNET\n\nAn involved cleanup after a long day, labor-intensive recipe or while hosting a gathering is one of the biggest buzzkills when cooking at home. Eliminating one inevitable and unenviable task is a big boon for induction.\n\nCookware compatibility was not an issue for me\n\nMy existing cookware was all induction-compatible. David Watsky/CNET\n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of switching to induction is the lack of compatibility with cookware. Induction doesn't work (or work well) with copper and aluminum pots and pans.\n\nMost stainless steel, cast iron and ceramic cookware is compatible. I only use pots and pans made from those materials, so I have had no compatibility issues.\n\nQuality kitchen brands always indicate whether their pans are induction-compatible. If you're making the switch to induction, do some research and ensure you don't have to buy new cookware after the fact.\n\nIf I could do it over, I'd skip the in-oven camera\n\nThe Samsung Bespoke Smart induction range I chose costs north of $2,000, about twice as much as a similar, less feature-heavy Samsung model. The key differences are that mine has \"more advanced\" AI-powered cooking modes and an internal oven camera, so you can monitor food remotely via phone and share time-lapse videos. I don't use or rely on either of these.\n\nThe control panels are also different, with the pricier model featuring an LCD Display. In my experience, LCD displays have more issues and glitches than simpler digital interfaces, although mine has been great so far.\n\nIf I could do it again, I'd opt for this far cheaper but slightly less smart induction stove. David Watsky/CNET\n\nFor my money, the $1,100 Samsung Bespoke 30-in Smart Induction Range, which has all the features I care about, as outlined above in this article, is the better buy."

            "content": "Every year, the moment we witness the very earliest signs of spring, CNET takes its cue to decamp to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress.\n\nThis is the world's most important mobile show, and one of the most exciting events in the tech calendar. This year, we're sending a bigger team to bring you all the news from the show as it happens.\n\nIt's set to be a bonanza of new phones and wearables, with the odd robot thrown in for good measure. Sure, some of the fun tech we see at MWC never makes it out into the wider world, but we've also seen some of our most beloved tech debut at the show over the years -- so expect a little of both.\n\nBig themes are set to include AI and 6G, and with keynotes from SpaceX and Qualcomm, we'll no doubt get a solid glimpse of the future of mobile. With Gemini in everything and satellite dominance on the horizon, it's an exciting time for the industry.\n\nHere's more of what we expect to see.\n\nWhat are the key dates for MWC?\n\nMWC 2026 is set to run from March 2 to 5, although we'll be in town a couple of days beforehand to report on some of the big launch events scheduled for this weekend. Don't miss Xiaomi's launch event on Feb. 28 and Honor's event on March. 1.\n\nHow to watch along\n\nNo matter how far away you live from Spain, there's no need to feel like you're missing out. The best place for all the latest MWC news is on our CNET live blog.\n\nWe've been attending this show for decades (this is MWC's 20th year in Barcelona, by the way), and we have a team of experienced reporters and reviewers on the ground.\n\nWe'll show you everything we deem interesting and important, and we're not just admiring new products from afar. We're touching, tinkering with and trying not to drop them, so be sure to follow us across Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, X and YouTube, too.\n\nWhat phones to expect at MWC 2026\n\nFor the past few years, Chinese phone-makers have dominated MWC, and 2026 looks to be no different.\n\nThe first big phone launch event is scheduled for 6 a.m. PT Saturday, Feb. 28, when we expect Xiaomi to unveil its latest camera-focused flagship. We loved the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and the 14 Ultra before it, so we're excited to see what the company has in store for us. A teaser image hints at its partnership with premium camera brand Leica and promises a \"new wave of imagery.\"\n\nThe Honor Magic V6 will be available in red. Honor\n\nNext up, we have Honor on Sunday, March 1, when the company has said it will unveil its Magic V6 phone, alongside the MagicPad 4 and MagicBook Pro 14. Perhaps more exciting still, Honor has said it will give us a first glimpse of a working version of its Robot Phone, and will also unveil a humanoid robot at its event.\n\nFor other phone-makers, MWC is likely to serve as more of a victory lap for its existing devices -- particularly Samsung, which held its own event in San Francisco this week to unveil the flagship S26 series. Motorola will be in town, likely showing off its Razr, which just like the Samsung Galaxy TriFold, has yet to be seen much in Europe.\n\nOn the whole, MWC 2026 is likely to be a big show for foldable phones, which, according to Ben Wood, CMO and chief analyst at CCS Insight, \"is now becoming quite a mature category.\"\n\nAnother major trend in the phone space is likely to be a focus on batteries, particularly silicon carbon-based tech, Wood said in an MWC preview session. \"We're expecting to see phones with some of the biggest batteries we've seen for a long time, [with] fast charging -- perhaps 300-watt charging -- being introduced,\" he added.\n\nWhat other tech to expect at MWC 2026\n\nAfter the early flops that were the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1, we're seeing more companies moving to jump on the wearable AI bandwagon. We expect to see a number of devices and demos pop up at MWC -- perhaps trying to beat OpenAI and Jony Ive to the punch.\n\nThis will include AI- and AR-based glasses, said CCS Insight analyst Ben Hatton during the firm's briefing session. \"We are expecting to see a huge number of glasses on show this year, not just from Meta, but also from the smaller players, [like] TCL and Oppo, looking to take a slice of the pie,\" he said.\n\nOne of the key challenges for these companies will be differentiation, Hatton said. \"Ultimately, there's still a long way to go before these become generally mass market products,\" he added, pointing out that at this stage, compelling use cases are still a bit thin on the ground.\n\nIt's been two years since Samsung launched the Galaxy Ring at MWC, and smart rings have been fairly thin on the ground ever since -- although Oura CEO Tom Hale is slated to speak at the show. We're not necessarily expecting to see any new rings this year, but there's always an outside chance.\n\nMuch more likely to show up are a slew of new laptops and tablets. They rarely get top billing at MWC, but we'll keep an eye out for the most exciting launches. There's also likely to be some intriguing concepts on show from the likes of Lenovo and Samsung Display, which is responsible for the tech behind the new Galaxy S26 Ultra's scene-stealing Privacy Display.\n\nThe big themes: AI, 6G and beyond\n\nNo surprises here that AI will, of course, be a major theme at MWC. For the past few years, Google has dominated the AI conversation at the event by showcasing Gemini's capabilities and its widespread integration. Will this year be any different? Probably not, but that doesn't mean the AI conversation has stalled.\n\nWe expect to see more sophisticated AI agents that are more deeply integrated into wearables, offering live translation, more actionable health insights and more personalized experiences. Some of the biggest players in the AI game will be present, including Nvidia and Qualcomm, on the hardware side. They'll likely have saved some juicy announcements for the show and, hopefully, have some exciting demos we can try out.\n\nWind the clock back a decade, and everyone was talking about 5G and what a dramatic difference it was going to make to our lives. Now that 5G is old news, we're looking forward to 6G. Most discussions about 6G so far have focused on its impact on the industry, but that doesn't mean there's nothing to be excited about.\n\nAt the Web Summit in November, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told me that 6G will make our phones faster than ever and connect us to an \"always-sensing network.\" This could include wearables, smart devices, cars and even robots. No doubt, Amon will expound on this subject further during his MWC keynote, which is all about 6G and AI.\n\nAnother theme likely to be prevalent at the show is the role of satellites in enhancing network connectivity. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell will be on stage to talk about Starlink, and all the world's biggest carriers will have their own booths where they'll show us what they're doing to tap into the latest network technologies."
